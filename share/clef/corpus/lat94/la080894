 LAST WORD: Bob Lagomarsino has published a newsletter since he was bounced 
from Congress by Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara). In his periodical, 
Lagomarsino often unleashes his opinions on key votes in Congress and 
diplomatic developments on the world stage. He also takes an occasional shot at 
his nemesis. . . . In the latest issue, he dredges up an old quote from 
Huffington's wife, Arianna, years before they were wed. "I'm going to marry 
Jerry Brown," she told Vanity Fair. "He's a genius. A savior of the world. 
We'll do great things together." 
</P>
<P>
 MIXED GREENS: The fledgling Green Party is still working out the kinks, three 
years after it won the right to place its candidates on the ballot. . . . Tom 
Stafford's name will appear on the November ballot as the Green's nominee in 
the 35th Assembly District. After all, he won the Green's primary with 85% of 
the vote. Yet the Santa Barbara chapter recently considered endorsing 
Democratic nominee Mindy Lorenz in that race. Or it did until Stafford pointed 
out: "The Green Party has a legal candidate, and that's me." 
</P>
<P>
 LABOR OF LOVE: It hardly surprises Jordan Jones that his literary magazine, 
Bakunin, adorns few coffee tables in his hometown of Simi Valley. . . . "It's 
not the kind of thing that goes over well in suburbia," he said. The magazine's 
chock full of provocative, if not startling, notions on thorny issues (B4). Its 
inspiration: Mikhail Bakunin, the anarchist who wanted to overthrow 
19th-Century society and organize a new one based on individual freedom. The 
magazine's motto: "For the dead Russian anarchist in all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 TRAINING GROUND: When it comes to ecological disasters, the United States has 
racked up its share. But wildlife biologists have also learned plenty about 
preserving endangered species and protecting habitat. . . . Now, the U. S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service is teaching biologists from foreign lands how to learn 
from American mistakes and profit from its successes (B1). The exchange program 
is a big hit.

L.A. SCENE / THE CITY THEN AND NOW 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Clara Phillips was never one to mask her feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 After removing her husband's latest lady friend by beating the woman to death 
with a claw hammer, she returned home still clad in her blood-dappled clothes, 
threw her arms around her man and said, triumphantly: 
</P>
<P>
 "Darling, I have killed the one you love most in this world. Now I'm going to 
cook you the best supper you ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, dubbed "Tiger Woman" by the Los Angeles newspapers of the 1920s, was 
ultimately convicted in the grisly murder of her husband's paramour, a 
beautiful, 21-year-old widow. 
</P>
<P>
 During the early part of the Roaring '20s, when oil wells were springing up 
across the city, Phillips' husband, Armour, was beginning a career as an 
aggressive, persuasive oil stock salesman. Charming and handsome, he bought 
expensive suits and a big house -- all on credit -- for his 23-year-old wife, 
whom he had married when she was a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 As his credit began to dwindle and other problems arose, he started turning 
his attentions to a seductive bank clerk, Alberta Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Clara Phillips, a former hoofer with a toothpaste-ad smile, began spending her 
days surreptitiously following her husband. She soon found out whom her husband 
had been seeing and decided what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She stopped by a dime store and bought a claw hammer. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, July 12, 1922, she told a friend, former chorus girl Peggy 
Caffee, of her pain and outrage over her husband's infidelities. The women 
decided to drown their woes in bathtub gin at a Long Beach speak-easy, before 
catching a cab back to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 By then a bit unsteady on their feet, the two waited outside the bank at 9th 
and Main streets for Meadows to finish work. 
</P>
<P>
 When Meadows saw them, she recognized Clara, who coolly asked Meadows to drive 
them to the house of Clara's sister in Montecito Heights, then a new 
subdivision below a hilltop in northeast Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of Montecito Drive, then a winding dirt road, Meadows stopped the 
car when Clara accused her of having intimate relations with Armour. When 
Meadows denied it, Clara punched her hard, knocking her out of the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleeing down the hill, Meadows fell when the heel of her shoe broke. Phillips 
caught her, hoisted the hammer and brought it straight down into Meadows' face, 
over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Phillips attacked her with the claw end of the hammer. A police detective 
would later say that it looked as if she had been mauled by a tiger. Thanks to 
the newspapers, that comparison to Clara Phillips would stick. 
</P>
<P>
 When a hysterical Caffee had finished vomiting in the grass, Phillips dropped 
her off at her house, then casually drove home in Meadows' new Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband panicked as she drove up in his girlfriend's car. Calmly, she told 
him what she had done. He insisted that she flee. 
</P>
<P>
 With her husband following in his car, they drove to Pomona, abandoned 
Meadows' car, returned to Los Angeles and spent the night at a Downtown hotel. 
Armour Phillips then put his wife on a train heading toward Arizona.  
</P>
<P>
 But then he had second thoughts. Hoping to save his own neck, he turned her 
in. She was arrested in a raid on the train. 
</P>
<P>
 Her trial created a sensation. Letters, candy and flowers were delivered to 
her cell. 
</P>
<P>
 Armour Phillips went further into debt, borrowing heavily to pay for his 
wife's defense. But a jury found her guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The three women (jurors) wanted to see her hang, but compromised on 
second-degree murder," said the jury foreman. Supposedly, her smile had 
softened the hearts of male jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 As she walked from the courtroom back to her cell after the judge sentenced 
her to 10 years to life in prison, a besotted spectator whispered to her that 
he would set her free. Her attorney overheard and laughed at the notion. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, Phillips escaped. A hacksaw had been smuggled into her cell. 
</P>
<P>
 But within four months, after a newspaper reporter tipped authorities to her 
whereabouts in Honduras, Undersheriff Eugene Biscailuz brought her back in 
handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 During Phillips' 12 years in prison, she found religion, organized a 
seven-piece orchestra, trained as a dental technician and slashed her wrists in 
a suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1931 jailhouse interview, Phillips said, "I don't know whether I killed 
Alberta Meadows or not, but if I did, I did it for mother love. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fought with Alberta on the top of Montecito Drive to protect the only love 
I have ever known. I did what any mother in the world would do if she saw her 
baby being taken from her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Armour L. Phillips is my baby. He has been my only baby. He is my very life, 
and when I realized he was being taken from me, I fought, fought, fought -- so 
that I might always have him." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon her release in 1935, hundreds gathered at the prison and shouted, "Tiger 
Woman! Tiger Woman!"  
</P>
<P>
 For a time, she lived in San Diego, caring for her ill mother. Before she 
divorced her "baby" in 1938, she petitioned for permission to move to Texas. 
And there, she vanished from public view. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

GEORGE RAMOS: IN COMPTON -- A NEW VIDEOTAPE AND A NEW STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was set to vent my anger because Latinos -- who make up about half of the 
riders on Metropolitan Transit Authority buses and trains -- got taken for a 
ride by the recent strike and the fare increase that goes into effect Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure the MTA did the right thing by banking on an unproven program of 
using busing discount tokens to entice riders to stay with public transit. 
Judging from the reaction of some riders I met after the strike, County 
Supervisor Gloria Molina had few friends for going along with the hike. "She 
sold us down the river," Route 30 commuter Rene Acosta told me. 
</P>
<P>
 But as often happens in the news business, something else came up. I quickly 
changed course after two friends, Emiliano Castillo and Joey Mendez, called 
Saturday to say they wanted to go to Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted to know if this much-publicized confrontation between a black 
police officer and a 17-year-old Latino was another Rodney King case. "We don't 
need another one of these damn things," Emiliano said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Compton is the latest place where the race card is being played. Because the 
confrontation between Felipe Soltero and Officer Michael Jackson, who is 
African American, was videotaped and shown on TV, it underscored festering 
tensions in a place where city officials estimate that Latinos have replaced 
blacks as the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Latino activists have demanded an apology from Compton's mayor, who is 
black, and the resignation of Police Chief Hourie Taylor, who also is black. 
Even the Brown Berets showed up in town to back up those demands. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been some tensions in South-Central L.A. between Latinos and 
African Americans, but it doesn't match the current storm in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a hot Saturday sun, my buddies and I walked around much of Compton -- I 
insisted that we take the Blue Line to get there -- and discovered some 
surprising things. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the folks we encountered weren't really interested in talking about 
the specifics of the incident. They knew that it involved a black officer and a 
Latino. They have seen the videotape on TV, but that doesn't mean very much. 
After all, they said, recent events have proved to them that not everything is 
on a tape. 
</P>
<P>
 They were very interested, however, in the charge by some Latino leaders in 
Compton that the incident showed that African Americans -- oppressed themselves 
since before slavery -- have become the oppressors of the Latinos in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion was divided, depending on one's skin color. 
</P>
<P>
 "B.S.," said Glenda Harris, a black woman who is a 20-year Compton resident, 
as she walked to her car on Compton Boulevard. "If anyone is sensitive to that 
sort of thing, it's us. We have been oppressed for so long that I think many 
blacks guard against it." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no respect for raza " -- the people -- said Jose Guzman, a five-year 
Compton resident who was eagerly eating ice cream on Willowbrook Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is respect," argued Melva Johnson at the Blue Line station. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way," said a man from Guadalajara, now on Cypress Street. 
</P>
<P>
 As we made our way around town, we also saw a bit of Compton that doesn't make 
the TV news or the pages of a major metropolitan newspaper. Kids of all shades 
run after an ice cream truck on a hot day and pedal their bikes furiously on a 
moment's dare. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors still gossip. Carmen Valencia and Ruth Johnson, no relation to 
Melva, chose to huddle in a noisy but shady walkway between their homes. The 
husbands argued about the impending baseball strike, but the two mothers 
preferred to wonder about Michael Jackson -- not the police officer, but the 
singer, who just married the King's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back home, mulling over what we saw and heard, this much seemed clear: 
</P>
<P>
 This is no time for the police chief to be taking a vacation, as he apparently 
has done. He should stick around and handle this controversy. Otherwise, as 
Compton resident Johnny Merchant noted, "People will start smearing Compton. 
That ain't right." 
</P>
<P>
 In dealing with the situation, Compton City Hall should keep in mind the 
danger of the oppressed becoming oppressors. To forget it is a sure 
prescription for political arrogance. Latinos have had to deal with it as they 
acquired power in places like Bell Gardens. Asians have heard it too, in 
Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, many of the folks we met on Saturday were glad that the brouhaha has 
surfaced in Compton. "Sometimes, you need a camera to set things right," Melva 
Johnson said. "We can use this to remind ourselves that as people of color, we 
are entitled to respect and we ought to give it. Compton has a chance to teach 
L.A. a thing or two."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On April 2, 1968 -- two days before Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was 
assassinated in Memphis, Tenn. -- British pop star Petula Clark, during a 
television special aired on NBC, grasped the arm of her African-American guest, 
Harry Belafonte. The sponsor was outraged. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, on Nov. 22, the series "Star Trek" featured what was 
reported to be television's first interracial kiss. Viewers never actually saw 
William Shatner (Capt. Kirk) buss Michelle Nichols (Lt. Uhura) but NBC 
threatened to pull the episode. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, mixed relationships are unremarkable media fare. Since television 
reflects popular culture, the increasing numbers of such real-life marriages 
comes as no surprise. Even the publicity glare on the Simpson murder trial has 
focused on domestic abuse, not interracial marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Census Bureau reports that there were only 310,000 interracial 
couples with white and African-American partners in 1972 compared to 1.2 
million such couples in 1992. And a 1990 study found the intermarriage rate for 
Jews topped 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Intermarriage has gotten a lot easier because of the phenomenon of the 
shrinking world that is brought on by the tremendous improvement in mass 
communication and intercultural exchanges," says Halford Fairchild, a professor 
of psychology and black studies at Pitzer College. "People are getting used to 
the idea. We see it more frequently." 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Platform, couples involved in interracial, intercultural and 
interethnic relationships discuss the challenges they face: coping with 
competing demands, a society that still isn't fully accepting of their ties and 
imparting varying cultures to their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Couples who intermarry must negotiate the differences between them," says 
David Levy, a psychology professor at Pepperdine University: "They must learn 
to respect each other's differences. That is a common theme in all marriages 
but in intermarriages the tensions tend to be heightened," says Levy. "They 
really just magnify the same themes that almost every relationship has to 
struggle with -- two people trying to live together." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there has always been a concern, especially within the Jewish and 
African-American communities, that intermarriage will dilute the religious or 
racial identity of these groups -- and, in some cases, political clout as well 
-- by diminishing the number of people who identify themselves as being fully 
within a particular group. It's the old argument about strength in numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Fairchild (who is himself a child of an interracial marriage): "There is 
going to be tension as certain ethnic enclaves seek to remain homogeneous. I 
think that is a legitimate orientation and perspective, particularly for 
discriminated-against minority groups. There is a political question when those 
numbers are reduced by people opting for a mixed marriage." Yet, predicts 
Fairchild, "In another generation or two the whole world will be quite 
different. The melting-pot metaphor will begin to take hold."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SERMON; ON 'STAR 
TREK' AND SPIRITUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD R. ZOLLAR, The Rev. Gerald R. Zollar is the director of Obadiah 
Ministries in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The music, the star-filled view, the haunting voice-over that says, "Space, 
the final frontier." If you are a Trekkie, I need say no more. Even if you are 
not, you'll get my drift. 
</P>
<P>
 What does this television show have to do with religion and God? In the main, 
nothing. Mind you, I said religious, not spiritual. There are many religious 
interpretations of the one spiritual nature that we all possess. The 
Judeo-Christian rendering leans on the writings found in the first book of 
Genesis, wherein humanity is created as a godlike idea, or concept of God. 
</P>
<P>
 One particular "Star Trek: The Next Generation" episode that seemed to have 
been written around this concept of creation deals with the humanoids of this 
galactic arm in the 24th Century chasing each other around the Milky Way, each 
with a strand of deoxyribonucleic acid. The DNA led each group representative 
on a merry romp across the stars. When, at last, they confront each other on a 
barren planet, ready to do the "human thing" -- go to war -- Captain Jean-Luc 
Picard and Dr. Beverly Crusher conspire to put the last piece of the DNA puzzle 
in place.  
</P>
<P>
 Lo and behold, a holographic image appears and gives each "species" 
representative a universal shock: Yo, homeboys, Y'all be kin . . . in the DNA . 
. . in the skin! No secret treasure, new weapon or advantage one over the 
other. Just a spiritual understanding and identity of sameness.  
</P>
<P>
 How is that spiritual? DNA, the basic material of human life, the transmitter 
of heredity, is a series of seven or eight proteins that have millions of 
different combinations. Yet only a few specific combinations can make us. Only 
a few chromosomes keep us from being chimps. Yet there is an uncrossable gulf 
between us and the chimp. Together we can not create viable offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 In the original "Star Trek" we first meet Spock, who is from Vulcan, light 
years from Earth. Yet Spock is half human. He has had a different and separate 
development yet is not so different. Later on, we meet Lieutenant Worf, who is 
Klingon/human; Deanna Troi, Betazoid/human, and on "Deep Space Nine," the 
newest offspring in the science-fiction family, we have a Bjoran (anyhow, it 
sounds like that) and Cardassian mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Human, Klingon, Cardassian, Romulan, Vulcan, Betazoid, et al.: all kin, blood 
kin, DNA kin. All sharing a single progenitor, creator if you will, the one 
source from whence they all arose. 
</P>
<P>
 Intended or not, when I saw the final DNA segment put into place on the 
screen, I felt an intense moment of spiritual connection, a bond that left all 
present shaken to the core of their being. Then the physical regained control. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was a physical being that stirred our primordial soup, so what? It 
still points to an infinitely higher being. I seem to recall even the "Q," 
godlike beings on "Star Trek: The Next Generation," alluding to powers greater 
than they. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on Mother Earth, we seem to live for the difference, never looking 
beneath, beyond, below, behind the surface. We add layers of surface with our 
cultural trappings just so we can be different. 
</P>
<P>
 The creation alluded to in Genesis is a singular sameness, the part that is 
like God. The dirt being -- the physical -- doesn't come in until the second 
chapter. I contend that humans would never have placed those books in that 
order except for the hand of God. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trekian allusion to a deeper and more fundamental sameness in some of the 
populations of the galaxy, fell short of the real truth. In the beginning God 
created everything! You simply have to look for the sameness: It is a spiritual 
thing.

RIDE THROUGH TIME' TO SEE WHAT THE AUTO WROUGHT

<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH HENIGSON, Deborah Henigson, 17, of University High School in Los 
Angeles, won the national essay contest sponsored by the American Jewish 
Committee's Skirball Institute on American Values with her answer to What can 
events, documents or personalities in U.S. history teach us about protecting 
our environment? The contest challenges high-school students to tell how 
America's historic ideals play a role in their lives.

 "In our automobile world, the noise and chatter of the streets will be 
reversed, a priceless boon to the tired nerves of this overwrought generation . 
. . . Streets will be cleaner, jams and blockades less likely to occur, and 
accidents less frequent." 
</P>
<P>
 I would love to take the author of that quote, an editor for "The Horseless 
Age, " a turn-of-the-century magazine, on a journey from his time to modern-day 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 During his time, the auto was a marvelous invention. Later, its use was 
mismanaged, causing widespread ecological harm. When L.A.'s major mistake was 
made -- the building of its first freeway, in 1940 -- the transportation 
emphasis switched from mass transit via rail to individual cars on freeways. 
The editor would see that had city planners thought about what cars would do to 
the environment, ecological damage would have been avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 I can imagine myself setting my Waybac time machine for 1900, heading for the 
editor. I discover him in his office. As he edits some copy, I decide this is 
my best chance and I pull "Ed" into the time machine. He is quite startled at 
first but soon accepts that I am taking him on a ride through time. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first stop is the Ford Motor Co. factory, on Oct. 1, 1908. Ed watches as 
the first Model T rolls off the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a funny looking vehicle!" Ed says. "It'll never sell!" 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know how wrong you are," I reply. "That is the four-cylinder Model 
T Ford.' It sells for only $600 at first and drops to $300 over the next 20 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 "At that price, anyone with a job will be able to buy a car!" my guest 
exclaims, pleased with the prospect of mass car ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed, snap out of it. You're dreaming." 
</P>
<P>
 "But . . .." 
</P>
<P>
 "No buts, Ed. Can't you see the bad side of this invention? All these cars 
will use up our natural resources!" 
</P>
<P>
 Ed is about to comment, but I speak first. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my time, there are more than 400 million motor vehicles on the world's 
roads. The consequences are enormous. For example, over 26 million gallons of 
oil and 400 million gallons of antifreeze drain each year from American cars 
alone. They're especially detrimental to oceans and fresh water sources." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed looks sad. "Ransom Olds and the Studebaker brothers have experimented with 
electric and steam cars," Ed notes, "but they were unstable and delicate. Both 
manufacturers converted to petroleum. That stuff can't be good for the planet." 
</P>
<P>
 "How right you are," I reply. "The combustion of gasoline produces harmful 
fumes. Let me take you forward in time, to General Motors in 1922." 
</P>
<P>
 I manipulate the controls and we flash to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "GM was formed in 1908 as the first large-scale merger of U.S. auto makers. At 
this time, GM is trying to fix the knocking of incomplete ignition caused by 
inefficient fuel burn. GM is making ethyl gasoline by taking petrol and adding 
octane and tetraethyl lead. The mixture ends the knocking but produces, as a 
byproduct, hydrocarbons that seep into the atmosphere and eat away the earth's 
shield against carcinogenic ultraviolet rays. Those emissions also make 
breathing more and more deadly." 
</P>
<P>
 By now Ed has taken to pacing back and forth in our time machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed, now I'm going to take you to Los Angeles, in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 Look out the window. It is December, 1940, and we are witnessing the 
dedication of L.A.'s' first freeway, a huge road without intersections. It's 
intended to make commuting through cities easier." 
</P>
<P>
 "Take me to sometime in the '50s; I want to see what happens," says Ed, 
intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
 "The '50s," I say, switching the Waybac controls, "are when many freeways are 
built and commuter rail lines start to disappear. Here we are at the Hollywood 
Freeway, leading to Downtown L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 "My goodness," says Ed, looking at all the cars. "They're just creeping 
along." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed pauses, then asks, "What is that layer of brown stuff over the city?" "It's 
'smog,' " I reply, "Smoke and fog. Over the next 30 years, city planners will 
fill up 60% of Downtown L.A. with freeways. Public transportation will switch 
from commuter trains to hydrocarbon-belching buses. Cars will be touted as 
status symbols, and ownership will increase every year." 
</P>
<P>
 "As will the smog!" says Ed. "If we change our focus from cars to cleaner mass 
transit, this future disaster can be avoided! Take me back. I'll start arguing 
for clean transit, electric cars. I've got lots of work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 I steer the Waybac to his time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good luck, Ed. It's an uphill battle, but a battle worth fighting."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY COMMENT; 
FEARS ABOUT A NATIONAL IDENTITY DATABASE ARE 'A BOGUS ISSUE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIRSO del JUNCO, The national Bipartisan Commission on Immigration has 
proposed using an electronic database to verify Social Security numbers of 
prospective employees. Dr. Tirso del Junco, a practicing general surgeon and 
Chairman of the California Republican Party, discusses the proposal's impact on 
the Latino community. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I do not believe that the database will have anything to do with the 
(economic) future of the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, today, we have a national, universal database, based on the Social 
Security number, at the Internal Revenue Service. Every single citizen has his 
Social Security number in that database. The only thing that we're talking 
about is (having) a tamper-proof card. But I do not believe that that will 
change the fact that the system is already in place. 
</P>
<P>
 The law right now says that the employer should check the Social Security card 
of the potential employee. The only thing is that he's going to have (that's 
new is) a tamper-proof system. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm an immigrant; I came here 40 years ago. And I don't think the issue is 
immigration. The issue is illegal immigration. We make a very big mistake when 
we do not separate these two issues. This is a very, very serious economic 
issue. There are a large number of incentives for illegal immigrants, a very 
strong force for them, to take whatever risk is necessary to come to the United 
States. This itself has a great economic impact on particular states like 
California, Texas and Florida. We're talking about billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that rules, regulations and standards established to regulate the 
illegal immigration problem causes difficulties for legal immigrants in my 
opinion is a bogus issue. 
</P>
<P>
 It has nothing to do with legal immigrants. Legal immigrants have access to 
jobs and all government benefits. I, as one who has lived in California for 
more than 30 years, have never found any problems whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
 I think we make a very big mistake when we merge the issue of illegal 
immigration with (legal) immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration has been good for America historically and I believe it will 
continue to be good. But it has to be done in a regimented and regulated 
fashion as has been done historically.

<P>
 I'm a third-generation Japanese American. My wife's Jewish on her mother's 
side, Lebanese on her father's side. She was raised in a Catholic boarding 
school and had a grandfather who was a Greek Orthodox minister. She now is sort 
of a Buddhist. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a richness in this diversity. But sometimes she will misinterpret what 
I say. Her perspective is certainly different from mine. Part of that has to do 
with culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Because we're parents now, we're finding there is overlap in Japanese 
tradition and Jewish American tradition, with a strong emphasis on education 
and discipline. We have really little difference of opinion on how we want to 
raise our son. He's four and adopted. He's whiter than white. He recognizes 
that Daddy's of Japanese extraction as are grandma and grandpa, and that 
Mommy's not and grandma Phyllis is not. 
</P>
<P>
 I get some strange looks when I take our son places. I was at the beach once. 
I showered him off. People gave me a funny look. They weren't sure I was 
related to this child. I turned around and said: "It's OK. He's my son." JAMES 
BADHAM

 Magazine editor, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 I'm as white, Anglo-Saxon Protestant as you can get. My background is German, 
Irish, Scottish and English. My wife's from Brazil. She has Italian, South 
American Indian, some Spanish and probably some black blood.  
</P>
<P>
 My wife's skin is so brown. Our son is blue-eyed and blond. People always 
think she's the nanny even though we're living in Los Angeles in 1994 where 
there are so many mixed couples. 
</P>
<P>
 The main difference I've noticed is how round her culture is and how linear 
ours is. We tend to be much more compartmentalized. They don't have a word for 
inhibition. She is so happy to be with other people, whereas I'm a private 
American for whom personal space and privacy are important. Americans tend to 
be more formal about social arrangements: You don't suddenly have 12 people 
over for dinner. Brazilians will do that. 
</P>
<P>
 If things don't go right, it's no big deal to Brazilians. There doesn't seem 
to be a lot of suppressed anger waiting to come out in rage. I have much more a 
hair-trigger than my wife. This is the value of an intercultural relationship. 
You're both tugged toward the middle a little bit. LAVIVA SIMMS

</P>
<P>
 I'm African American. My partner is Mexican American, a Chicana. When I think 
of family, I think of her and me. For her, family is her entire family: 
cousins, nephews and all of that. Her brother and his three children live with 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it's difficult for me to get adjusted to the fact that her family 
has a common bond she and I don't have: mannerisms, values, ways of doing 
things. Those are culturally-based. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though we are both people of color, we interpret differently what that 
means. My awareness is more heightened to racism. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong point that I see in our relationship is a strength that comes from 
being two positive, confident women of color. 
</P>
<P>
 To my family, the fact that I'm a lesbian, that's more of an issue than what 
race my partner is. 
</P>
<P>
 Our issues as lesbians aren't that different from a straight couple who's 
interracial, except for the idea of our not being able to legitimize our 
relationship. KAY YEE

<P>
 I'm Chinese American. My parents were both born in China. My husband's an 
Anglo of Dutch, Irish and English descent. 
</P>
<P>
 We have one boy, who's 2 1/2, and a girl, 5 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing we're very aware of is that both our children are biracial. I want 
them always to be comfortable in their environment, where they go to school and 
in their social surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 My father came over in 1921. He was discriminated against tremendously. So 
because of his culture, what happened to him as an immigrant, I have 
consciously raised my children to be aware of civil rights. That's very 
American thinking but it was taught to me by my father who is from China. 
</P>
<P>
 My father would have preferred that I had married a Chinese person. But once 
we got married, then there was never any animosity toward my husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the food, the Chinese holidays and the language, I really don't find 
that much difference between us, except that he was raised Catholic and I was 
raised Presbyterian. ALAIN COHEN

</P>
<P>
 I was born in Tunisia and lived in France growing up. I'm Jewish. My wife is 
German and non-Jewish. We met in L.A. four years ago and have one daughter, 
</P>
<P>
 3 years old. She is a merging of our cultures and personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Both our families are still in Europe. In the beginning it was difficult for 
them to accept our marriage. But after, we were wholeheartedly accepted by both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Marrying someone not from your background is not easy. It forces you to 
question all your values and ways of being. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the relationship is never dull. After we go through the 
differences, resolve the differences, we discover that behind this cultural 
strata there are values and traits in common that make us like each other, love 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a bonus when you go through that veil of differences and find something 
really particular to that person that you like, that you can find once in a 
million people. That's a great gift.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MULTICULTURAL 
MANNERS; 'THE FRENCH PUT A HIGH VALUE ON PRIVACY'

<P>
 Confident in her French-speaking abilities, Marilyn accepts an exchange 
teaching position at a university south of Paris. One day, an elderly French 
woman using a cane boards the bus Marilyn is riding.The woman struggles to keep 
her balance, so Marilyn offers her a seat. The woman refuses and reprimands 
Marilyn. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Marilyn could ask her university students to explain why the 
woman had become angry with what Marilyn regarded as an act of kindness. She 
learned that the French place a high value on privacy and resent anyone who 
intrudes upon it. By offering help to the older lady, Marilyn called attention 
to the woman's disabilities. From the French point of view, that was 
impertinent. They feel that if the woman had wanted help, she would have asked 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovering this perspective was useful later when Marilyn traveled alone 
carrying heavy luggage. Previously, she had thought the French were 
inconsiderate for never offering to help as she grappled with her bags. Now 
that she knew otherwise, she asked for assistance and it was gladly offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: Among the French, do not offer assistance unless it is requested. 
Conversely, if you need help, be sure to ask for it.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY ESSAY; 
DIVERSITY OF BENCH TAKES THE STAND IN SIMPSON CASE; PRESIDING JUDGE LANCE ITO 
IS A RARITY IN CALIFORNIA, WHERE MINORITIES ARE 43% OF THE POPULATION BUT LESS 
THAN 14% OF THE STATE JUDICIARY. 
</P>

By JOHN K.C. MAH, John K.C. Mah is president of the Southern California Chinese 
Lawyers Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before I started law school in 1972, my contact with the judicial system was 
very limited. As an immigrant and the son of immigrants, I did not know any 
lawyers or judges. 
</P>
<P>
 My first contact with the court system took place in late 1970 in a 
small-claims case in Stockton. I had been rear-ended at an intersection by a 
white middle-aged driver. I was not hurt and my car sustained minor damage. At 
that time I was a naive 20-year-old college student. When the driver refused to 
pay for the damage to my car, I filed a small-claims action. 
</P>
<P>
 The other driver and I went before a white middle-aged judge. I told the judge 
that my car stalled at an intersection as the light turned green and was rammed 
by the driver behind me. The other driver then gave his story: that my car 
stalled in the intersection as the light turned red, and I backed into him and 
caused the damage to my car. To my surprise, the judge believed him.  
</P>
<P>
 That experience soured my perception of the legal system. It reinforced a view 
I held until I went to law school and met minority judges: that the courts 
favored white persons. I believe that even today most members of minority 
groups do not feel they can receive justice in a court of law. 
</P>
<P>
 That perception is based in part on the fact that most judges are white. The 
Commission on the Future of the California Courts has noted that of the state's 
1,554 judges, 5% are black, 5% are Hispanic, 3% are of Asian or Pacific 
Islander descent, and 0.1% -- a single judge -- is Native American.  
</P>
<P>
 Complaints have been voiced that the GOP governors since Edmund G. "Jerry" 
Brown have failed to appoint enough minorities. According to a recent column in 
"California Lawyer," 16% of Gov. Pete Wilson's judicial appointments have been 
minority, compared to 12% under George Deukmejian and 25% under Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 For our judicial system to continue as a viable institution, the public must 
perceive it as a fair one, reflecting the views and opinions of all cultures 
and backgrounds. Three steps can be taken to increase the number of minorities 
on the bench.  
</P>
<P>
 * First, the pool of minority candidates must be increased. Leaders of 
minority and ethnic bars statewide should recruit qualified members and assist 
them in completing the exhaustive application to be submitted to the Governor's 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
 * Second, we can move toward a merit selection system of appointing judges. 
Richard Chernick, a past president of the Los Angeles County Bar Assn., notes 
that currently 32 states and the District of Columbia use a merit plan to 
choose some or all of their judges. According to Chernick's research, states 
using merit selection have a more diverse judiciary than states that don't.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, merit selection would limit a governor's ability to shape the 
courts and law that will stand for decades after he or she has left office. If 
the reforms are not implemented, mainstream and minority bars can form their 
own merit panels and recommend candidates.  
</P>
<P>
 * Third, minority lawyers can seek a seat on the bench via the ballot box. 
Only six of the 199 minority judges in the state initially went on the bench 
through the election process. Part of the problem is the difficulty of 
defeating an incumbent, and part is money. It can cost $15,000 to retain a 
political consultant and $17,000 to print a candidate's statement in the sample 
ballot. Candidates often must rely on personal funds to wage a successful 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment of Superior Court Judge Lance Ito, a Japanese American and a 
highly regarded jurist, in the O.J. Simpson case will showcase a minority judge 
presiding over a high-profile case. The public should be aware that persons of 
color make up 43% of California's population but less than 14% of the state 
judiciary. Minorities still have a long way to go in achieving representation 
on the bench.

WHITEWATER: START ALL OVER AGAIN; MIDSTREAM SWITCH OF SPECIAL PROSECUTOR WAS 
UNAVOIDABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As uncomfortable as it will make the Clinton White House, the decision of a 
special three-judge panel -- activated earlier this year by Congress' renewal 
of the special prosecutor statute and signed into law by the President -- to 
replace Robert Fiske as special counsel in the Whitewater case was unavoidable. 
Indeed, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno had virtually predicted that something like this 
would happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in January, as the temperature in Washington over Whitewater was rising 
daily, Reno was under tremendous pressure to appoint a special counsel to open 
up a formal investigation. At the time Reno did so, but reluctantly. That was 
not because she opposed an independent probe, but because she believed that no 
one named by Clinton's appointed attorney general would be perceived as truly 
independent. What she recommended was that everyone wait until the independent 
counsel law was renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 That law, used in the Iran-Contra case and other controversies, stipulates 
that any special counsel be named by neither Democrats nor Republicans but by a 
panel of federal judges. It was such a panel that moved to replace Fiske with 
Kenneth W. Starr, a former federal judge and high-ranking legal counselor in 
both the Bush and Reagan administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel pointedly noted that it was not its intent to "impugn the integrity 
of the attorney general's appointee, but rather to reflect the intent of the 
act. . . . . The court . . . deems it in the best interest of the appearance of 
independence contemplated by the act that a person not affiliated with the 
incumbent Administration be appointed." 
</P>
<P>
 The choice of Starr made no one's day in the Clinton Administration. Not only 
is he a certified Republican but he has been an active critic of the White 
House's view that Clinton, as long as he is President, should be temporarily 
insulated from civil suits, such as the sex-harassment claim filed by Arkansan 
Paula Jones. Starr's stance no doubt raises questions among Democrats about his 
impartiality. But it will also undercut Republican criticism should Starr's 
final findings not be to the GOP's liking. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Reno was right to not want to name anyone herself, she was wrong to 
recommend to the judges that Fiske be allowed to stay. As good and as thorough 
and as fair as Fiske's probe may have been, he still remained the pick of the 
very Administration whose President and First Lady were under scrutiny. It's 
too bad that this midstream switch is going to cost the taxpayers even more 
money for the probe. But efficiency in government is not always congruent with 
justice.

A LESSON IN COOPERATION ON GHOST TOWNS OF THE QUAKE; FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL 
OFFICIALS WORK TOGETHER TO FURTHER REBUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Intentionally or not, the Clinton Administration and Congress left some 
maneuvering room in the nearly $12-billion federal-aid package that is fueling 
Los Angeles' recovery from the Northridge quake. For example, there was an 
estimated $400-million surplus in federal funds allocated for repairing 
quake-damaged schools and freeways. It was that cache that an alert Mayor 
Richard Riordan wisely focused on two weeks ago, hoping to use it to bridge a 
multimillion-dollar gap in quake-related housing repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 One week later, President Clinton agreed, saying that a shift of $225 million 
of those funds to housing relief would represent a "down payment on our 
partnership with the cities to solve this ghost-town problem." About $200 
million would go to Los Angeles, with another $25 million earmarked for Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Senate approved the transfer on Thursday. The matter will be taken up 
this week in conference with the House of Representatives. It deserves final 
approval. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros made the point 
last week when he stood outside a vacant apartment building in Granada Hills, 
one of 13 ghost towns in the San Fernando Valley, Mid-City and Hollywood areas. 
In these locations, owners are struggling to rebuild or still weighing the pros 
and cons of even trying. Meantime, their empty units are prey to opportunists 
and vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see that this is uninhabitable, unacceptable for the long run," 
Cisneros said, later adding: "The loser when an apartment owner walks away from 
an apartment like this is the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The funding is another welcome sign of commitment and cooperation. The Riordan 
Administration and the governor's Office of Emergency Services, under Richard 
Andrews, have done a good job thus far in cooperating with federal officials, 
providing them with badly needed information and suggestions and promptly 
applying federal aid where it is needed most. More remains to be done, however. 
The city and the federal Small Business Administration, for example, had 
identified some 855 affected business and residential properties in the ghost 
towns. There was an approval rate of about 58% for owners who applied for SBA 
loans, but 188 owners were denied. Local officials will have to question 
another 310 ghost-town property owners who never applied for SBA assistance to 
determine whether they obtained funds to rebuild from other federal sources or 
from their own insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those condominium and apartment owners who applied for both Federal 
Emergency Management Agency and SBA funds and were either denied or left short, 
the addition of another funding mechanism could be crucial, according to Gary 
Squire, general manager for the city's housing department. "We are trying to 
cure financial damage as well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $225 million would be used for 30-year no-interest loans with no payments 
due for six years. It would not be a panacea; not everyone could rebuild, 
particularly in Santa Monica, where rent control has made reconstruction even 
tougher. But it would arm some residential owners with the edge they need to 
avoid foreclosure. For some, it could be the difference between giving up and 
carrying on. We're already beginning to see a benefit from negotiations among 
city officials, lenders and owners.

 The vacant apartment where HUD's Cisneros made his remarks, for example, will 
be rebuilt through a package that includes $2 million in federal loans, $1 
million in interest write-downs by a bank and $250,000 in cash from the owner. 
Along similar lines, the Los Angeles City Council has already approved another 
$7.75 million in federal loans that will help the owners of another set of five 
apartment buildings in the Valley that were headed for foreclosure avoid that 
fate and rebuild. This is exactly the kind of help that Cisneros and the mayor 
want to duplicate.

PRESIDENTIAL CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter who's President, let him (or, eventually, her) snap back at media 
exaggeration, error or incompetence, and someone will accuse him of "whining." 
</P>
<P>
 As a longtime newspaper reporter, I often winced when officials in high places 
failed to react to bad journalism aimed at them. The media need constant 
criticism -- from every possible source. As the fourth branch of government, 
they need every bit as much critical attention as Congress. Whine on, Mr. 
President, whoever you are!

JUDGE DEFIES '3 STRIKES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your well-reasoned editorial (July 23) on the dilemma faced by California 
judges in administering the "three strikes" law poses the problem but does not 
suggest a solution. The court must either obey the law and pronounce an unjust 
sentence or disobey it by pronouncing a sentence that the court considers just. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming there is a valid test case on appeal that will ultimately decide the 
constitutionality of the law as applied, there is a third option available to 
the trial judge: Pronounce the sentence required by law but qualify it by also 
pronouncing a "just" sentence to prevail when and if the law is ruled to be 
unconstitutional "as applied." This will avoid the court's disregarding a valid 
law, which is what the criminal has done in the first place.

 My compliments to Superior Court Judge Lawrence Antolini for standing up to a

ABORTION STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article of July 29 ("Abortion Rights Groups Criticize Huffington Record") 
inaccurately reflects my positions on the abortion issue. For the record, I 
want to once again state my position: 
</P>
<P>
 I totally and unequivocally support a woman's right to choose.I voted to lift 
the gag rule, and in favor of clinic access. I am in favor of state and local 
funding of abortion, and support federal funding only as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, like the vast majority of Californians, I also support some 
sensible restrictions on abortion: 
</P>
<P>
 * I am against abortion for the purpose of sex selection. 
</P>
<P>
 * I am in favor of parental notification (though not parental consent). 
</P>
<P>
 * I oppose third-trimester abortions, with the exception of the life of the 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 There are those who, because of my support for these minor restrictions, are 
trying to paint me as anti-choice. They are extremists, whose opinions on the 
issue are shared by only 6% of the population. By their radical litmus test, 
nearly all Californians are anti-choice. My position on abortion is clear, 
mainstream, and I have not diverged from it since I entered public life.

U.S. POLICY TOWARD UKRAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration should resist pressures to abandon support for 
Ukraine's territorial integrity (Jonathan Clarke, Column Right, July 24). Such 
an irresponsible reversal would abet the very forces Clarke decries: 
destabilization and conflict in Eastern Europe and throughout the former Soviet 
region. Clarke fails to take account of the following: 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine emerged from the breakup of the Soviet Union as both a force for 
stability and a potential economic power. (According to Time magazine, it 
accounted for one-quarter of Soviet food output and nearly a third of Soviet 
industry.) Moreover, its nuclear arsenal ranked as the third largest in the 
world. America's interest in supporting Ukraine increased with Ukraine's 
joining in the tripartite nuclear weapons agreement in January of this year. 
Ukraine's special strategic importance is conceded by Clarke himself when he 
states: "A stable and independent Ukraine certainly constitutes a strong 
American interest." These factors amply justified the Administration's policy 
supporting Ukraine and its territorial integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Ukraine is struggling to make the transition to democracy and a market 
economy. Like any nation, it can be diverted from these great tasks by a 
territorial challenge. Thus, at this time more than ever, Ukraine's boundaries 
must be held inviolate so that Ukraine can focus its resources on constructive 
goals. As a former British diplomat, Clarke must know that one of the 
fundamental principles of international relations is respect for territorial 
integrity. One can easily imagine the diplomatic outcry if U.S. policy should 
retreat from support for the territorial integrity of France, Russia or Great 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns are being expressed in Washington over Russia's tendency toward 
interventionism in areas such as the Baltic states, Moldova, Georgia and 
Azerbaijan. Russia should not be encouraged to believe it can add another 
region to this list: Crimea and eastern Ukraine. While such a scenario could 
appeal to expansionist elements in Russia, it is hardly in U.S. interests. The 
Clinton Administration wisely recognized this fact. We believe most Americans 
would agree.

BECKER THE 55-MINUTE MAN IN L.A.; TENNIS: BORIS BECKER WINS L.A. OPEN WITH A 
SPEEDY VICTORY OVER AUSTRALIAN WOODFORDE.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boris Becker, showing the form that made him the world's No. 1 player three 
years ago, routed Mark Woodforde of Australia, 6-2, 6-2, Sunday to win the 
$400,000 Los Angeles Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, making his first appearance in Los Angeles, disposed of Woodforde in 
55 minutes, the quickest final on the ATP Tour this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unexpectedly easy," said Becker, the No. 2 seed. "I kept hitting big 
serves and being very aggressive from the baseline." 
</P>
<P>
 The serve-and-volley game that brought Becker three Wimbledon titles in the 
late 1980s proved devastating against Woodforde. 
</P>
<P>
 The German lost just eight points on his serve the entire match and won 20 of 
22 points at the net. For the second straight match, Becker didn't face a break 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today was one of the finest matches of the year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker's second title of the year and 40th of his 11-year career will move him 
from 11th to eighth in the world when the latest ATP rankings are released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodforde, a left-hander ranked 53rd, was playing his first singles final of 
the year and it showed. He opened the match with consecutive double faults and 
connected on just 55 percent of his first serves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big-time struggle," said Woodforde, known primarily for his doubles 
success. "I think he sensed I was a little bit hesitant. " 
</P>
<P>
 Becker dominated despite playing with tendinitis in his lower right leg, an 
old injury that flared up in his quarterfinal against Karsten Braasch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm physically not 100 percent," he said. "In the (semifinals) and final I 
bite my tongue and play over the pain." 
</P>
<P>
 "Boris has resurrected himself," Woodforde said. "He was hitting some 
incredible angles."

COMMENTARY; WAKE HER UP WHEN THIS STRIKE IS OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHNETTE HOWARD, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Except for the hurt absorbed by ticket-takers, the stadium vendors and the 
other blue-collar people who might lose money if baseball has a work stoppage 
for the eighth time in 23 years, I won't mind a baseball strike. I say relax. 
Forget the melodrama, the paroxyms of grief. Look at the bright side. 
</P>
<P>
 No baseball could mean no more rotisserie-league seamheads preening around the 
office water cooler, spouting off self-researched esoterica such as: "Did you 
know Kenny Rogers was the first left-hander to toss a perfect game in the 
American League since ATM cards allowed you to withdraw cash anywhere in North 
America, including Canada?" 
</P>
<P>
 With some unexpected time on his hands, Orioles owner Peter Angelos might 
realize his dream of landing an NFL team for Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, having no baseball would probably not mean a respite from that 
saccharine prose about the pastoral beauty of the game, its gentle rhythms, the 
unebbing mystery that unfolds slowly during each contest, the answers and 
nuances revealed only to those true believers who come to the altar of baseball 
willing to give The Game the attention The Game deserves and blah, blah, blah, 
blah, blah ... 
</P>
<P>
 I say let 'em walk. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't let the door smack their stadium seat cushions on the way out. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a lot wrong with baseball even before the strike began to loom. The 
games move like glaciers. The expansion boom to 28 teams has nurtured whole new 
genres of big leaguers -- the rag-arm outfielders who can't hit the cutoff man, 
the rag-arm pitchers who can't string together three outs in a row, the 
power-hitting hulks who'd have the range of a bird bath if they had to play the 
field, the long-toothed veteran who'd hang on forever if the other guys didn't 
kid him unmercifully about those boxes of Depends in his locker. 
</P>
<P>
 Throw in the pampered stars who rush the mound over an honest inside pitch, 
the neurotic just-signed free agents who can't handle the big contract, the 
spitters and scratchers and preeners who stall between pitches like they're 
praying for a rain delay to save them from an 0-2 count and, as I said, what 
you've got is BOR-ING. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 This season was different for the first time in years. With a livelier ball 
and numerous record chases, the new contenders and the glut of rising young 
stars, baseball was more entertaining than it's been in eons. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as usual, baseball found a cynical, money-related way to screw it up. 
</P>
<P>
 The average player's salary is $1.2 million this year. Small-market clubs 
can't retain players. But the players have refused to consider a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have a long, sordid history of lying and condescension in 
negotiations. Last week brought two more examples. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners claimed that 19 of the 28 teams would lose money in 1994. When it 
leaked out that two of baseball's richest franchises, the Dodgers and White 
Sox, were rather unbelievably listed among the red-ink teams, owners coughed 
and said the 19 clubs are projecting losses in 1994 -- a stupid bit of 
subterfuge, considering the players' distrust is already sky high. 
</P>
<P>
 The second gesture -- withholding a scheduled $7.59 million payment to the 
players' pension fund -- was even worse; a dumb and incendiary move that 
suggested the owners are daring the players to strike, rather than working to 
avoid one. 
</P>
<P>
 So let them all walk out, bloody each other up, then phone it in when they 
settle. I have no interest in the blow-by-blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Bbaseball has gotten to the point where genuine sympathy is hard to rustle up. 
It's had too many chances, suffered too many relapses, asked for forgiveness 
too many times. 
</P>
<P>
 The march to this strike has been no different than the others -- just loaded 
with more greed, malice and selfishness -- in short, the usual. From the usual 
guys.

 LOCOMOTION: It won't just be green thumbs attending the Southern California 
Home & Garden Show at the Anaheim Convention Center starting Saturday and 
running through Aug. 21. One of the highlights this year will be an elaborate 
outdoor model train set landscaped with live miniature trees and other 
greenery. Nine separate tracks will crisscross the display, some of them 
available for control by show goers. Says show producer Randy Bauler: "You have 
people who like model railroads, but like to get outdoors." 
</P>

 IVY LEAGUE: The Fountain Valley branch of World Savings never needs a paint 
job. That duty is left to Mother Nature. . . . The 13-year-old bank was 
designed so that it would be entirely covered in three different types of vines 
and Boston ivy. It took about three years of growth for the vines to entirely 
cover the building, and the greenery blooms every summer. "It's pretty 
drought-resistant stuff," says group Senior Vice President Tom McBroom. "It's a 
topic of conversation among our customers." 
</P>
<P>
 FLORAL MICKEY: Gardeners are so concerned about the floral portrait of Mickey 
Mouse that greets Disneyland visitors that they replant it five times a year to 
keep it looking fresh. That's 19,000 plants. . . . Mickey's face is purple and 
white sweet alyssum, his tongue is red alternanthera. He is bordered in summer 
by yellow marigolds and in winter by yellow or blue pansies. "It's probably the 
most photographed area of Disneyland," says landscape supervisor Karen Hedges. 
The bed has even kept up with the times: the portrait was modified last year to 
keep pace with the latest rendition of the famous mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 ROYAL OAK: The oldest living thing in Orange County? It's actually a tree -- 
but which one is a matter of debate. . . . Tom Larsen, president of the county 
Tree Society, says he believes that it's the "Mother Oak," a huge tree inside 
Rancho Mission Viejo near San Juan Capistrano. Mike Evans of the Tree of Life 
Nursery in San Juan Capistrano said he suspects some sycamores in the area are 
older. . . . But they do agree on the age: 300 years plus.

STREET SMART: FRONT-WINDOW TINTING IS BANNED FOR SAFETY REASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: I thought tinted windows were illegal. Every week, it 
seems, I get into a waiting game at a four-way stop with someone driving the 
van from "E.T." I have no way of telling what the driver might be signaling, 
because I can't see into the car -- it's like looking into Darth Vader's 
helmet. For all I know, the driver is buck naked and asleep. Isn't that 
illegal? Tinted front windows, I mean, not driving nude. 
</P>
<P>
 D.R. Peck 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed it is, according to Steve Kohler, a spokesman for the California 
Highway Patrol. Any tinting, other than that which comes standard from the 
factory, is strictly illegal on a car's front windshield or either front side 
window. The primary reason for the prohibition, he said, is safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "You probably wouldn't wear your sunglasses if you drove at night," Kohler 
said, "yet if you apply this material to your windshield, that, in effect, is 
what you are doing. It cuts down on visibility for the driver and in a 
situation where visibility is already limited, you don't want to limit it 
further." 
</P>
<P>
 Windows tinted at the factory, he said, are usually lighter than those tinted 
later. In addition, he said, commercially tinted windows can be spotted because 
the tint is on the surface of the glass rather than inside it. Often, Kohler 
said, drivers with tinted windows come from other states -- usually in the Heat 
Belt -- where such tinting is allowed. "Sometimes they're upset that we would 
cite them," he said, "but if we were in their state we would have to obey their 
laws." 
</P>
<P>
 As for driving nude, he quipped, "check your local ordinances. If you're 
taking a shortcut through a nudist colony, it's probably legal." 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Recently an "improvement" was made at Laguna Canyon and El Toro roads. The 
improvement eliminated a second northbound lane on Laguna Canyon Road used by 
drivers turning right from El Toro Road onto Laguna Canyon Road. The 
elimination of this lane apparently was done in order to create a left-turn 
lane for cars going in the opposite direction on Laguna Canyon Road, which is 
not wide enough there to accommodate two lanes in each direction at the 
intersection with El Toro Road.  
</P>
<P>
 This improvement doesn't appear to have been well studied, was done in haste 
or, perhaps, in preparation for further improvements. The bottleneck on El Toro 
Road, turning right, is now much greater and any increase in traffic flow 
through the signal into Laguna appears to be negligible. Are there any future 
improvements destined for this enhanced problem, or could this improvement be 
improved by "disimproving" it? 
</P>
<P>
 Bert G. Fenenga 
</P>
<P>
 Aliso Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 Don't hold your breath, says Terry Brandt, Laguna Beach's director of 
municipal services. In fact, he said, the recent improvement has greatly 
enhanced the flow of traffic into Laguna Beach along Laguna Canyon Road. The 
change was a trade-off, he said, aimed at eliminating the longstanding problem 
of afternoon peak-hour traffic in that direction that sometimes backed up for 
miles. The situation was caused by the line of cars waiting to turn left onto 
El Toro Road without the benefit of a left-turn lane. By adding such a lane, 
Brandt said, the flow of traffic into town has been greatly increased. 
</P>
<P>
 But the only way to add the left-turn lane on the southbound side, he said, 
was to eliminate one of the two northbound lanes, thus forcing motorists to 
wait in line for right turns onto Laguna Canyon Road from El Toro Road. City 
officials opted for the change, Brandt said, as the greatest good for the 
greatest number. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are trade-offs," he said, "and what we're trying to do is help the 
largest number of people and we think the largest number of people are 
traveling inbound" to Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
 As for future improvements aimed at rectifying the inequity, he said, nothing 
is likely to happen soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, county and state are studying a proposal to significantly widen 
Laguna Canyon Road, a project that would improve the intersection in question, 
making it much easier to pass or turn in any direction. But at best, Brandt 
said, the proposal is still several years from realization. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart:

 My letter regards the intersection of La Palma and Tustin avenues in Anaheim. 
The traffic lights at this intersection appear to be controlled by a timer. The 
lights go through their timed cycles regardless of the traffic flow, so that in 
some cases the light for a direction of travel will turn green and stay that 
way for a long time even if no traffic is going in the direction of the light. 
If you come up to the signal just as it turns red, you will have to wait two to 
three minutes as the lights go through their timed cycles, even if little or no 
traffic is flowing against you. 
</P>
<P>
 My question is, why aren't road sensors used to speed up the traffic-light 
cycles when no traffic is present for a particular green light?

 Not to worry, says John Lower, traffic and transportation manager for the city 
of Anaheim, the problem's being taken care of. During a recent 
intersection-widening project, he confirmed, the lights in question were indeed 
operating on timers. But the project's been completed, Lower said, and the 
signals are once again sensor-activated.  
</P>
<P>
 "We sent a traffic signal technician out there to check," he said, "and 
everything's operating fine."

THIS RECALL SHOULD BE RECALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most attempts to recall California politicians partway through their terms 
deservedly fail. But the number of proposed recalls has risen so dramatically 
that the taxpayer's pocketbook is getting a jolt. 
</P>
<P>
 There is actually an initiative planned for the November ballot to deal with 
those that are successful. Proposition 183 would extend the time allowed 
between a recall and the election to fill vacant seats, allowing consolidation 
with a regular election to save money. The proposition refers to state officers 
such as governor and legislators, but the extent of the problem is exemplified 
by a situation in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Fullerton City Council members who voted for a 2% utility tax last year 
were recalled in June in a glaring example of the pernicious effects of 
single-issue politics. The terms of two of the three would have expired in 
November anyway. But after winning, recall organizers went to court last week 
and forced a special Oct. 18 election rather than waiting. That will cost the 
city an estimated $117,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempted recalls can be justified in cases of criminal activity or 
disability. But too often they are used as a protest against one vote. 
Office-holders are elected to decide a variety of issues and if they deserve to 
be voted out, the time for a referendum on their job performance is when they 
are up for reelection. Reducing everything to a thumbs up or down vote 
undermines representative democracy.

TRAGEDY IN RWANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a Tutsi, I am troubled and shocked that the world stood by and watched 
almost 1 million of my people perish at the hands of Hutu troops and 
government-trained militias. For almost three months, the United Nations and 
the United States debated whether to characterize the killings in Rwanda as 
genocide, that way avoiding the responsibility imposed on the signatories of 
the 1951 Genocide Convention, which calls for the apprehension and prosecution 
of war criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 All of a sudden, now we see the United Nations, the United States and its 
European allies jump on the bandwagon to save the cholera-ridden Hutu refugees 
in Zaire and Tanzania. While I am not opposed to humanitarian aid, I am 
concerned that the donors, in attempting to redress their guilt for having not 
acted faster, thus saving millions of lives, are aiding the very people that 
planned and executed the genocide of my people. Yet, nobody talks of the 
millions of displaced people inside Rwanda who are suffering horrendous 
physical as well as psychological wounds. And let us not forget that these 
refugees fled Rwanda at the behest of their leaders who are seeking to 
establish a diaspora from which to recruit an army to fight their way back to 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 Ample evidence exists to apprehend former Rwanda government officials and 
military officers in the refugee camps who continue to spread messages of hate 
against the Tutsi. Action must be taken now before the evidence dissipates and 
memories fade. 
</P>
<P>
 Until justice is done, we Tutsi will neither forgive nor forget. And though 
small be our numbers, resolve will be our drive and justice our rallying cry.

 Re "Rwanda Relief Groups to Help Fittest Survive," July 31: 
</P>
<P>
 Shades of new-Malthusian darkness! So, in this day, is the fitness of a human 
being to be determined by an ability to walk 50 miles, over rough terrain, in 
illness and in need? Is suffering to become the new measure of the worthiness 
of a person? Then surely the Holocaust was good, AIDS is a boon and the Mother 
Teresas of this world are working against humanity.

 In his Aug. 1 commentary on Rwanda, Richard Walden, president of Operation 
USA, misportrays the massive and immediate response by the U.S. government to 
the grave humanitarian situation in Rwanda. Our government, reflecting the 
compassion of the American people, has dedicated more than $500 million of U.S. 
government funds and the expertise of military and emergency relief personnel 
to meeting the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion of Rwandan refugees, their numbers greater than the city of San 
Francisco, occurred in six days. This is the largest and most rapid migration 
of people that the international relief community has faced in this generation. 
The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has had its disaster 
assessment and response teams in the field -- and they have been fully 
operational -- since the earliest stages of the refugee crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government funded Red Cross efforts in Rwandan even after U.S. 
personnel were evacuated for security reasons following the coup. Any direct 
intervention in the Rwanda crisis at that point, other than through our support 
of private voluntary organizations, would have necessitated U.S. military 
involvement in an ongoing civil war. This kind of military intervention in a 
"hot" conflict would have placed the lives of American military personnel 
directly at risk. Wisely, neither the Clinton Administration, Congress or the 
American public supported such a move. 
</P>
<P>
 USAID, working with the World Food Program, has diverted emergency food relief 
to Rwanda from supplies held elsewhere in Africa. These supplies were taken 
from surplus stocks and not out of the hands of hungry people. The World Food 
Program will replace the African commodities shipped to Rwanda; not to have 
diverted these supplies to Rwanda would have meant starvation and death for 
untold numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance remains the premier disaster 
relief organization in the world. Its extraordinary performance under the most 
difficult of circumstances at disasters sites throughout the developing world 
speaks for itself.

 As the mother of a young soldier being deployed to Rwanda, via Goma, Zaire, 
your article of Aug. 3 concerns me a great deal. I understand the Rwandan 
people need help, but to say security for our troops is a concern but not a 
problem is quite an understatement. When does it become a problem? Maybe when 
some of our troops are killed? Your article says we have 98 troops in Goma, 
living in tents near a crowded road with no protection other than a concertina 
wire and that most of our soldiers go unarmed and none wear flak vests. It 
doesn't sound like anyone has much concern for their safety.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't want to see any of our soldiers' dead bodies dragged around like one 
was in Somalia.

THE PENAL STATE OF CALIFORNIA; CORRECTIONS: WE COULD SWITCH MILLIONS TO 
EDUCATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCENT SCHIRALDI, Vincent Schiraldi is executive director of the Center on 
Juvenile and Criminal Justice, a nonprofit justice-policy organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid the pandering and the politicking around the "three strikes and you're 
out" legislation, California's Department of Corrections emerged unscathed once 
again from the budget ax. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections has received increases averaging $239 million per year for every 
year over the past decade. During that time, the Corrections budget has 
increased at twice the rate of the budgets for Health and Welfare, Education or 
the General Fund. Fiscal conservatives and tax-and-spend liberals alike have 
refused to touch Corrections' astonishing $400-million administrative salaries. 
Over the past decade, substantially more employees were added to Corrections 
(26,000) than all other state departments combined (16,000). Higher education 
actually experienced a reduction in work force of more than 8,000 employees 
during this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three strikes and you're out" notwithstanding, several very workable cuts to 
Corrections have received preliminary approval from the Legislature. 
Unfortunately, both Gov. Pete Wilson and Democratic gubernatorial challenger 
Kathleen Brown have rejected them.  
</P>
<P>
 One is to eliminate costly and ineffective parole supervision for non-serious 
offenders. Parole officers have long been overburdened. Little in the way of 
meaningful rehabilitation can occur in the relationship between one parole 
officer and more than 75 extremely troubled, often impoverished, often 
substance-abusing parolees.  
</P>
<P>
 Rather than abolish supervision for all parolees, this proposal selects those 
whom Californians fear the least -- the nonviolent ones who are not drug 
dealers. As modest as that sounds, this suggestion would save $45 million in 
the next fiscal year alone, and more in subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sensible cut to Corrections would involve abolishing the state's 
antiquated "petty theft with a prior" law for defendants whose prior offense 
was nonviolent. The "petty with a prior" law is California's "steal two loaves 
of bread, go to prison." A first conviction for shoplifting is a misdemeanor, 
but the second such conviction is a felony allowing for a state prison 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, California imprisons about 4,500 prisoners for "petty with a prior," 
more than twice as many as for rape. That practice alone cost taxpayers $95 
million last year. Each of those prisoners would have had to commit 53 petty 
thefts in order to collectively steal $95 million. Abolishing the "petty with a 
prior" law for defendants with nonviolent priors would save $14.2 million next 
year, and more in ensuing years. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of overloaded courts, pretrial delays for defendants sent to state 
prison have doubled. Since they serve so much jail time before they are 
sentenced, more than one-quarter of all admissions to California's prisons 
spend less than six months actually in prison. Rather than school short-term, 
nonviolent inmates in the ways of the "big house," the state should place them 
on intensively supervised parole. If properly designed, intensive supervision 
has been shown to actually reduce rearrests for parolees. This proposal would 
save $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, because sending juvenile offenders to the California Youth Authority 
costs counties only $25 per month per child, there is a financial incentive for 
counties to commit even low-level youthful offenders to our state's juvenile 
prison system. Once there, many learn more about criminal behavior their first 
week than they could have in years in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing the charge to counties would hold them accountable for sending 
lightweight youth to California's juvenile "gladiator schools." Right now, the 
county with the highest commitment rate commits kids at eight times the rate of 
the county with the lowest commitment rate, per capita. Still, both counties 
pay the same taxes for the system. This modest proposal would save $66 million 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In total, reducing the state's nonviolent prisoner population and its 
correctional bureaucracy would save $266 million in 1994-95, and more in 
ensuing years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, the higher education budget was 2 1/2 times the corrections 
budget. This year, the two are equal for the first time. California has the 
highest juvenile incarceration rate in the nation, twice the national average. 
We also have the second-worst school class size in the country. We spend 
$97,000 to build one prison cell, $21,000 to incarcerate one prisoner, but only 
$4,000 to educate one child. California could obviously make better use of $266 
million than by imprisoning our least-serious offenders and funding a bloated 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 While these cuts to corrections are no panacea, they begin to take prisons off 
of the fiscal pedestal they have occupied for the past decade and to make the 
sensible and safe fiscal choices required in this era of austerity. The 
governor would do well to cut Corrections' waste as he would any other 
department, and not play politics with the prison budget.

PERSPECTIVE ON IMMIGRATION; OVERWHELMED BY OUR GENEROSITY; FAMILY REUNIFICATION 
AND AMNESTY HAVE BROUGHT MILLIONS ILL-EQUIPPED TO SERVE OUR NATION'S NEEDS, A 
LUXURY WE CAN'T AFFORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By DAN STEIN, Dan Stein is executive director of the Federation for American 
Immigration Reform (FAIR). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amazingly, U.S. immigration policy now admits, legally and illegally, the 
equivalent of the population of San Francisco every six months without a clear 
idea of what it will mean to the country. 
</P>
<P>
 As early as 1982, the National Academy of Sciences complained that the 
government was failing to collect much meaningful data about immigrants. The 
bureaucrats in Washington can tell us approximately how many immigrants are 
here and where they come from, but alarmingly little about what sort of human 
capital they bring with them and the fiscal impact they have on the country 
after they arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with a growing number of states and local governments screaming for 
federal reimbursement for costs associated with immigration, Washington is 
belatedly attempting to assess the economic and social impact of its policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The data that do exist about recent immigration explain why California and 
other states are demanding relief.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the few groups of recent immigrants that we have had a chance to 
examine in some depth consists of those who received amnesty as a result of the 
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. An obscure provision of that law 
required that the executive branch compile a statistical profile of the 3.1 
million people who were legalized under IRCA. The portrait painted by the 
Department of Justice study in 1992 is a troubling one because it indicates a 
trend toward lower skills, lower earnings and greater dependency on public 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical immigrant who received amnesty under IRCA had lived in the United 
States for at least 10 years. Nevertheless, the median annual income for a 
family of four in this group was a mere $16,000, just barely above the official 
poverty line. Only 13% of amnesty recipients lived in households that had an 
annual income of more than $30,000 a year. Not surprisingly, the same profile 
revealed that the average amnesty recipient had just seven years of formal 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, data collected for a 1994 United Way survey tell much the same 
story. One-third of the county's population, or 2.9 million people, was born 
outside the United States. The 1990 annual per-capita income for the 
"non-Hispanic white" population of Los Angeles was a shade under $25,000, while 
for Latinos, the largest immigrant group in the county, it was a mere $8,000. 
Again, education levels explain this wide discrepancy. While about 70% of 
U.S.-born Latino adults have completed high school, the influx of recent 
immigrants has been so large and their educational attainment so low that the 
picture of the Latino community as a whole has been turned on its head: 
Overall, 61% of all Latino adults in Los Angeles County have less than a high 
school education. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the nationwide data show an unmistakable and ominous trend. At a 
time when our economy is placing a premium on a highly skilled, educated work 
force, our immigration policies are admitting ever-growing numbers of 
unskilled, poorly educated people. Moreover, our policies, as they are 
currently formulated to favor family reunification, will result in an 
acceleration of this trend in the coming decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the nearly 1 million people who come here through the legal immigration, 
refugee or asylum processes, a mere 160,000 visas are set aside for people 
based on their skills. And even that is a misleading statistic, because 
approximately two-thirds of those visas go to the dependents of the skilled 
workers. In addition, between 250,000 and 500,000 illegal aliens settle 
permanently each year. Thus, of the 1.2 million to 1.4 million permanent 
immigrants who come to the United States each year, only about 60,000, or 5%, 
are selected because they have some unique qualifications that our country 
desires. No doubt some highly skilled individuals come through the family 
reunification or refugee process, but relying on that is the policy equivalent 
of fishing with a drift net. 
</P>
<P>
 Things are not likely to get any better. The 3.1 million amnesty recipients 
are just beginning to become eligible for citizenship, and there is a concerted 
effort to increase the naturalization rate for other long-term legal residents. 
As people become citizens, the current law allows them to begin petitioning to 
bring relatives to this country. There is no reason to expect that those 
relatives will be any better educated or have greater earning potential than 
the amnesty recipients who sponsor them.  
</P>
<P>
 As honest, sincere and hard-working as most of these people may be, the 
profile of today's immigrants simply does not match our needs as a nation. 
Faced with the already daunting task of making the transition to the high-tech, 
highly competitive global economy of the 21st Century, an immigration policy 
that admits more than a million people a year, without regard to their skills, 
is a luxury we can no longer afford. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three decades into the greatest and most sustained wave of immigration 
in our nation's history, the United States should not be wrestling with 
elemental question about who the immigrants are and whether they are a benefit 
to our society. If, by this time, we cannot state with absolute certainty that 
we are getting people we really need -- and only people we really need -- 
little red lights ought to be flashing inside the heads of those who make our 
immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 There is ample evidence to suggest that immigration is not serving the social 
or economic interests of our country. It's time we stop for a while and recover 
from an immigration binge that has lasted for more than a quarter of a century.

RELIGIOUS RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Referring to the Times article, "GOP: Moderate Republicans Warn of Religious 
Right Takeover" (July 28). It is terrifying to read such statements as "The 
1992 GOP platform called for a 'human rights amendment' to the Constitution, 
outlawing abortion in all circumstances."And "the Texas GOP convention, where 
delegates carried signs saying, 'A vote for our candidate is a vote for God." 
It seems that some Republicans hide behind the cloak of religion and moral 
values for what it can do for them among the voters. It's a shame that people 
like Bob Dole do not have the courage to put principles before politics. 
</P>
<P>
 I also believe a clarification should be made for Republican leaders who claim 
that Democrats attack religion. What they attack is intolerance and those who 
label themselves Christians but breed hate and fear of anyone who does not 
believe as they do. These people obviously have forgotten that this country was 
founded on religious rights and the right to believe as we choose to believe.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; THANKS TO GOLFERS' WILD SHOTS, THIS FIRM IS 
DIVING FOR DOLLARS; RECREATION: RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA-BASED BALL HAWK FETCHES 
$900,000 A YEAR RETRIEVING LOST GOLF BALLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a boy, Larry Margison used to sneak into the Meadowlark Golf Course in 
Huntington Beach at dusk, wade into the shallow ponds and pick up golf balls 
with his toes. Often the superintendent shooed him away, but Margison always 
returned and became so proficient that the golf course finally gave him a deal: 
a quarter a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 41, Margison still retrieves wet golf balls. And he still gets about a 
quarter apiece for them. But today, his company, Ball Hawk in Rancho Santa 
Margarita, employs seven scuba divers who mine the water hazards at 80 golf 
courses from Tijuana to Utah, picking up most of the 3.5 million golf balls a 
year that Margison resells. 
</P>
<P>
 That translates into a $900,000-a-year business, making Ball Hawk the largest 
company of its kind on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a natural talent for pulling them out of the water," Margison says, 
showing that he can still scoop up golf balls with his size-12 foot faster than 
most people would be able to bend over and grab them by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Margison's firm actually retrieves about 2.5 million golf balls a year and 
buys 1 million more from other dealers. Ball Hawk then cleans and resells the 
balls for as much as $1.50 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are sold to golf courses at discounts, and the balls often wind up for 
sale in fishbowl containers at pro shops, where they'll be bought, hit and most 
likely dropped into the water again. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't own golf balls, they just borrow them for a period of time," 
says Mitchell Lombard, president of Gold Eagle in Dallas, which processes about 
50 million balls a year and is the nation's largest golf ball retrieval 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows how many ball retrieval firms there are. Some golf courses clean 
the ponds themselves, and nighttime poachers take away a huge chunk of business 
from tax-paying entrepreneurs like Margison, who figures that illegitimate 
traders cut his revenue by 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Margison's company formally began in 1972, when he was 19, just married and 
playing golf for Golden West Junior College in Huntington Beach. He started 
with contracts from three golf courses: Anaheim, Costa Mesa and Sea Cliff. That 
year, Margison grossed about $18,000 -- picking up all the balls himself with a 
rake, his hands and his toes. 
</P>
<P>
 Margison's business has boomed with the mushrooming of golf courses -- about 
one a day nationwide in recent years -- and the growing popularity of the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average golfer could lose three or four balls per round," said Marv 
Kilburg, a marshal at Cypress Golf Club, which opened in the summer of 1992. 
For Ball Hawk, which has a contract at Cypress, that means a take of 4,000 to 
5,000 balls a week. 
</P>
<P>
 When he can, Margison retrieves balls with a $10,000 rolling machine that 
sweeps a lake bottom like a lawn mower, sucking up golf balls between its 
aluminum blades. But machinery won't work in most golf course lakes because 
they have fountains, pipes or plastic linings at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Cypress golf course, for example, bubbling fountains shoot out from a 
75-yard-long pond that skirts the par-four No. 8 hole. Vince Maxwell, outfitted 
in wet suit and turquoise face mask, usually spends a couple of hours a week in 
the murky lake, groping for balls barehanded. 
</P>
<P>
 His average find is about 900 balls, for which he receives seven cents apiece, 
or about $63. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the better holes," Maxwell said last week as he came up for 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball Hawk's divers, who are independent contractors, make between $25,000 and 
$40,000 a year, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money's pretty good," Maxwell said. "It's interesting. We've come across 
lawn chairs, bicycles and golf clubs once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Texas or Florida, where divers can run up against alligators, Maxwell 
says the worst creatures found here are crawdads or big fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other day at Sea Cliff," he said, "a two-foot catfish kept bumping into 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the day, divers like Maxwell dump the balls into banana boxes 
and drop them off at Margison's production facility in Rancho Santa Margarita. 
There the balls are cleaned and sorted by grade, like lemons. 
</P>
<P>
 Margison says only 20% of the balls retrieved are in the top condition needed 
to be resold to pro shops. The rest are usually marketed to driving-range 
operators or firms that condition used golf balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Margison also runs his own retail shop near Tijeras Creek Golf Course in 
Rancho Santa Margarita, selling top-of-the-line used Titleist and Ultra balls 
for as much as $1.50 each -- about $1 less than what they cost new. Those balls 
provide the best profit margins for Ball Hawk, and Margison's hope is to open a 
similar store in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Margison likens his best used balls to cars with a couple of thousand miles on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not brand new," he said, "but pretty close."

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: HEALTHY ECONOMY COULD BRING STOCKS, BONDS A SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are some things Wall Street would rather not talk about these days, and 
this one's at the top of the list: What if the U.S. economy just keeps rolling 
along? 
</P>
<P>
 After Friday's shockingly strong report on July job creation, which triggered 
a new surge in bond yields, the specter of another credit-tightening move by 
the Federal Reserve Board reared its Gorgonic head. 
</P>
<P>
 And as with each of the Fed's four interest rate increases this year, many 
investors are already labeling the next boost as the one that will "do the 
job": In other words, one more hike of half a percentage point and the economy 
will slow, inflation worries will evaporate and stocks will be off to the races 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 It's curious that anyone could have such faith in the Fed's gradualist 
approach to raising rates, given what happened between 1990 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed took a gradualist approach in that period, too, trimming interest 
rates in quarter- and half-point increments. And the continual surprise was 
that the economy failed to react significantly to the Fed's steady stimuli. By 
late 1992, many economists were urging the Fed to abandon gradualism and 
jump-start the economy with a rate cut of a full percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, it seems few investors believe that the economy has momentum going for 
it. Many think it can be easily restrained. What most aren't expecting is that 
the Fed will probably have to raise short-term interest rates continually well 
into 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, some sectors of the economy do appear to be responding to higher 
rates. New home sales, for example, fell in June to the lowest level in two 
years, undoubtedly influenced by the rise in mortgage rates since winter. 
</P>
<P>
 But three powerful forces at work in the economy could ensure that growth 
stays stronger than the inflation-paranoid Fed would like, and thus that 
short-term rates will keep rising: 
</P>
<P>
 * Job creation is robust. Even with weakness in housing, the economy still 
managed to add 259,000 jobs in July, the Commerce Department said Friday. Year 
to date, the economy has created a net 2 million new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 While some analysts fret about a buildup in product inventories at the 
wholesale and retail levels during the second quarter, they may be missing 
something important: Business owners sense that the economic outlook is 
terrific and thus they are unafraid to hire workers and restock shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Every job added, in turn, means income for -- and consumption by -- that 
worker, adding fuel to the economy's expansion. People who already have jobs, 
meanwhile, feel more secure in them as new hires come on, which also boosts 
prospects for consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Corp. in Chicago, calculates that the 
household sector will lose $3 billion to $5 billion in income this year from 
rising mortgage rates. "But such income losses will be modest compared to the 
income gains that would occur if employment growth held at the 2% to 2.5% 
range," Hale says. 
</P>
<P>
 Every 1% increase in employee compensation, he estimates, is worth about $24 
billion a year to the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Corporate profits are booming. Eric Miller, strategist at Donaldson Lufkin & 
Jenrette Securities in New York, notes that corporate profits have topped 
expectations for six straight quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 That surge in earnings, in large part because of the painful restructurings of 
the late 1980s and early '90s that slashed corporate break-even points, has 
given managers a windfall of dollars with which to expand their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 And expansion, in the form of investment in new plants and equipment, is 
definitely happening, further bolstering the economy. For example, Cimtek Inc., 
which tracks new-plant announcements nationwide, counted 802 from January 
through May, up from 591 in the same period of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In the government's report last week on June manufacturers' activity, factory 
shipments of electrical machinery rose 1.1% in that month, the eighth straight 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
 * Europe and Japan are on the upswing. After deep recessions in 1993, the 
economies of Europe and Japan are showing unmistakable signs of improvement. 
That will almost certainly raise demand for U.S. exports and in general 
contribute to a stronger global economy all around heading into 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's economy grew 3.3% in the second quarter, the fastest pace in five 
years, notes Joseph Quinlan, international economist at Dean Witter Reynolds in 
New York. Elsewhere, housing starts in France jumped 23% in May, he says, and 
German exports rose 11% that month. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Japan, an extreme heat wave this summer is driving a mini-boom in 
consumer spending (air conditioners, electricity, beer, bathing suits, etc.) 
while also guaranteeing a bumper crop in rice, Quinlan says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Given the ongoing boost to the U.S. economy from all of the above, can the Fed 
make a meaningful dent in growth with just one more half-point boost in 
short-term interest rates? 
</P>
<P>
 Many Wall Streeters doubt it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we'll have another boost now (at the Fed's Aug. 16 meeting) and one 
more by the end of the year," says Marshall Acuff, investment strategist at 
Smith Barney in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe more after that? 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Carson, domestic economist at Dean Witter, argues that the 
Fed-engineered increase in the federal funds rate (the overnight loan rate for 
banks) from 3% to 4.25% so far this year is still woefully inadequate if the 
Fed's goal is to hold down growth and thus inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, the average level of the inflation-adjusted fed funds rate has 
been about 2% to 2.25% during economic expansions," Carson says. So if the Fed 
expects inflation to be around 3%, he says, the fed funds rate should rise to 
5% to 5.25% at a minimum -- well above the current 4.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, if the Fed wants to get serious about capping inflation at 
around 3% a year, Carson says, the fed funds rate will have to rise to around 
6%. 
</P>
<P>
 If he's right, short-term interest rates will be pushing higher well into 1995 
and maybe into 1996. For the bond market, that could mean a long, drawn-out 
bear market. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the stock market? If too many investors believe that the next Fed 
rate hike will be the last, the market will just be setting itself up for new 
disappointment later this year and in 1995, as the Fed keeps pushing up rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, many Wall Street strategists continue to believe that it will be tough 
for the market overall to advance between now and the end of the year, 
short-term rallies aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Concern about rates is going to overwhelm the equity market," Acuff says. 
"Our guess is that rates are going to go higher than most people think." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, abandoning stocks completely isn't a reasonable option for most 
investors. Long-term investors in diversified mutual funds, for example, have 
no compelling reason to walk away from this market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But if the question is putting new money to work, many Wall Streeters say 
investors should follow themes that mesh with the prospects for a stronger 
rather than weaker economy: 
</P>
<P>
 * Go with companies that have the most to gain, profit-wise, from U.S. 
economic growth. To Acuff, that list would include such names as machinery 
maker Emerson Electric, paper giant Kimberly-Clark and major lenders such as 
BancOne and Bank of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 It's worth noting that investors have been able to get excited about some 
stock groups this year -- even as interest rates have risen -- if the 
companies' earnings outlook has improved radically. Steel stocks, which have 
surged in recent weeks, are the latest example. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep thinking international. The recent blazing comeback of Mexican stocks 
demonstrates that opportunities can still abound in foreign markets, regardless 
of what's happening in U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
 If world economic growth surprises, the biggest beneficiaries are likely to be 
foreign firms in the fastest-growing economies. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, don't forget that many U.S. multinationals are also poised 
to reap the benefits of global expansion, says Howard Gleicher, portfolio 
manager at Palley-Needelman Asset Management in Newport Beach. He favors such 
names as General Motors, 3M Co. and Tenneco.

PAYING THE PRICE; YEN'S MIGHT MAKES IT TOUGH FOR JAPANESE FIRMS TO MAKE A BUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The soaring value of the yen against the dollar has triggered a kind of 
reverse alchemy for Japanese companies trying to sell in the United States: A 
onetime fount of profits has been transformed into a swamp of red ink. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lose money selling products here," says Takashi Kiuchi, chairman of 
Mitsubishi Electric America, the Cypress-based Japanese subsidiary that sells 
big-screen televisions and other electronic products. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kiuchi professes to be pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "Management people in Japan feel they can't keep manufacturing in Japan (at 
this rate)," he says. Kiuchi believes the parent company will finally heed his 
calls to boost production in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Increased production in America seems a happy solution not just to a yen that 
has soared in value by about 10% since the beginning of the year, but to an 
increasingly large and nettlesome Japanese trade surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reality is far more complex and sobering. With huge excess factory 
capacity at home and armies of lifetime workers to support, Japanese companies 
cannot easily shut down domestic factories and shift production overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, the only way Japanese companies can recover the higher 
costs that come with a strong yen is by raising prices. Yet here, too, the 
choices are grim. Higher prices will mean lower sales, lower market share and 
even more excess capacity at a time when the domestic economy remains mired in 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, if Japanese companies raise prices only modestly, as they have in the 
past, losses will mount and companies will risk more dumping lawsuits by the 
Clinton Administration accusing them of selling products in the United States 
below cost. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, except for a few areas such as semiconductors and flat-panel displays 
for laptop computers where demand is strong, Japanese companies seem willing to 
let themselves bleed in order to hold onto their market share and keep their 
factories moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though exports don't generate profits," says Tetsuo Tsukimura, chief 
economist at Smith Barney's Tokyo office, Japanese companies "will keep 
exporting until they go bankrupt." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such policies suggest Japanese corporations have been unable to make the shift 
in strategic focus from a policy of maintaining market share to one of boosting 
profit margins -- a transition that many, including former Sony chairman Akio 
Morita, argued was essential if Japan is to cut its mounting trade surplus and 
get along with its trade partners. 
</P>
<P>
 A continued effort to hold down prices and maintain market share means a 
strong yen won't reduce Japanese exports, or America's trade deficit, anytime 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese haven't been passing on the full price impact of the high yen, 
so their exports have been holding up," says Larry Chimerine, an economist at 
the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent Japanese surveys suggest about half of the Japanese companies operating 
in the United States are losing money. Jerry Sullivan, a business professor at 
the University of Washington who has conducted surveys of Japanese operations 
in the United States, thinks the numbers are higher -- perhaps eight in 10. 
</P>
<P>
 While companies with U.S. production are more insulated from the yen's surge, 
even Japanese auto companies, which have invested heavily in North American 
production in recent years, still import about half the cars they sell in the 
United States. And those cars they make in America still depend heavily on 
high-priced parts from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's problems aren't good news for the American economy. While Japanese 
companies won't be able to increase prices enough to cover their foreign 
exchange losses, they will nevertheless institute modest price increases of 3% 
to 4% wherever they can. That will help drive up prices of such products as 
cars and computers. And American companies will cheerfully follow suit, helping 
to fuel inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 While Kiuchi hopes Japan will shift more production to the United States, most 
analysts expect any new factories to be in Mexico or Southeast Asia, where 
labor costs are low. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsushita Electric, for example, recently indicated it might move two U.S. 
television plants south of the border to take advantage of low cost labor and 
the new tariff-free border. Last year, the number of Japanese factories 
established in the United States declined for the first time in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 While pricing is the Japanese firms' only short-term tool to shore up profits, 
it is a tool companies use cautiously. In 1991, when the yen shot up about 20%, 
Japanese auto makers tried to pass on their higher costs to consumers in the 
form of higher prices. But when they saw their market share slide in reaction 
to the price increases, the companies used low-interest leases and other 
mechanisms to take back market share. Now there are strong indications that 
Japan's auto share is once again rising. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, auto makers will try again to pass along some of the impact of the 
high yen to consumers. Masaaki Masuda of NLI Research, a Tokyo-based think 
tank, expects Japanese auto firms to boost 1995 model prices by as much as 5%. 
They might succeed, because U.S. companies such as Chrysler are operating at 
close to capacity and have announced sharp price increases of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies such as Toyota, with strong customer loyalty, have managed to make 
price increases stick. Al Salas, a salesman at Hollywood Toyota, notes that the 
Toyota Corolla sells for $16,200, fully $5,000 more than a similarly featured 
Ford Tracer, which his dealership also sells. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to switch a person who can't afford it, but they will lease a Corolla 
rather than buy a Tracer," Salas says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as the price gap between Japanese and American cars widens and 
Detroit's lineup improves in look and quality, companies such as Nissan have 
been forced to effectively lower their prices. The 1995 model of the Nissan 
Maxima, for example, has a sticker price 5% lower than the previous year, even 
though the yen has risen in value over the period by as much as 10%. Analysts 
say the company will probably lose money on the made-in-Japan car. 
</P>
<P>
 The story isn't as grim in all sectors. In semiconductors, for example, strong 
demand has kept Japanese factories operating at capacity. That means Japanese 
companies have been in a strong position to institute price increases and make 
them stick. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also look for prices of laptop computers to stop falling. That's 
because Japanese firms are the only sources for the flat-panel displays that 
make up as much as half the cost of a laptop. 
</P>
<P>
 An Apple Computer executive says the company expects to pay higher prices for 
components like displays that are only available in Japan in large quantities 
and are being designed into products to hit the market next year. 
</P>
<P>
 That pleases the much smaller American suppliers of such components. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing price increases from Japan while we continue to cut our costs," 
says Jim Hurd, chief executive at Planar, a small Beaverton, Ore., flat-panel 
display maker. "We're getting new penetration." 
</P>
<P>
 But even when Japanese companies are in a position to demand stiff price 
increases, they are hesitant to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "In principle, we could increase prices because of the supply constraints, but 
we take a long-term view," says Joel Pollack, market planning manager at Sharp 
Electronics' U.S. flat-panel operation in Camas, Wash. He said the company 
recognizes that lower prices are necessary to drive overall growth in the 
laptop market. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the dumping threat. Since a high yen automatically pushes down 
American prices relative to Japanese prices, it makes Japanese companies 
vulnerable to dumping charges. The U.S. Department of Commerce and the 
International Trade Commission recently concluded that Fuji Photo was dumping 
photographic paper in America by selling it for as little as one-third the 
price it charges in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 If dumping duties are imposed, Fuji Photo has said it will avoid them by 
building manufacturing facilities in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. auto manufacturers have been gathering statistics to bolster their claims 
that the Japanese companies are dumping cars here by selling them for far less 
than they charge in Japan. Analysts believe they are using the figures to prod 
Japanese companies to push up prices -- giving Detroit room to raise its own 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, the last time the yen rose dramatically, Japan also responded by 
keeping prices low. But at that time, Japan was able to soak up excess demand 
by pumping up its domestic economy. Profits at home, in effect, covered losses 
in America. Booming asset prices boosted wealth so much that Japanese companies 
went on a buying binge in America. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Japan doesn't have that cushion today. While companies are losing money in 
America, they are also suffering from sluggish sales and falling real estate 
prices at home. A gradually opening market is also opening Japanese companies 
to competition from Asian neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 A Japanese banker in Tennessee says the ability of Japanese companies to 
maintain low prices in America while losing money will depend on their cash 
position. While Toyota is cash-rich, Nissan, Mazda and some of the other auto 
companies are in poor financial shape -- but are forced to play a market share 
game that few can win. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is terrible," says Smith Barney's Tsukimura. "But there is no 
easy way out." Keeping Prices Down 
</P>
<P>
 To boost sales in the United States, Nissan has held down the price of its 
bread-and-butter sedan, the Maxima, despite steady increases in the value of 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Wholesale U.S. price of the Nissan Maxima (industry estimates): 
</P>
<P>
 '95 model: $17,954 
</P>
<P>
 Average yen per dollar in previous year: 
</P>
<P>
 '95 model: 100 
</P>
<P>
 Auto prices have climbed more slowly than the value of the yen from 1985 to 
1994, even as auto makers have upgraded their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Top five Japanese auto makers' average price increase: 64.7% 
</P>
<P>
 Big Three's average price increase: 32.9% 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer price index: 37.0% 
</P>
<P>
 Yen's increase in value: 138.5%

DELTA WORKERS WONDER WHERE THEY'LL LAND; AIRLINES: A RENT DISPUTE WITH LAX 
OFFICIALS COULD RESULT IN HUNDREDS LOSING THEIR JOBS OR BEING FORCED TO MOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 900 Delta Air Lines workers face the prospect that they'll either 
have to leave California or quit their jobs because of a lease dispute between 
Delta and Los Angeles airport officials. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is Delta's 40-acre city-owned facility on Century Boulevard next to 
Los Angeles International Airport. Delta, with its lease expiring next March, 
faces sharply higher rent if it wants to stay on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Atlanta-based carrier is suffering major financial problems, and so 
Delta is mulling whether to move its LAX operations elsewhere -- perhaps out of 
state -- if it cannot strike an acceptable rent deal. 
</P>
<P>
 That's left Delta's work force in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're freaking out, to tell you the truth," said Monica Boutte-Peeke, a 
reservation sales agent, noting that Delta has told its employees to expect a 
decision soon, perhaps by next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mood (here) is very somber," she said. "We will either be out of work or 
have to move to a state that we do not choose or desire, and give up our 
friends, relatives and homes in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Delta's facility, anchored by a four-story office building, mainly houses 
about 700 reservation and customer service agents, along with about 225 
marketing and airplane maintenance personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The carrier pays about $600,000 a year in rent. Although neither side will say 
what new rent it is proposing, sources familiar with the dispute said Delta 
faces at least a doubling of its rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Stein, president of the city Board of Airport Commissioners, said, "We 
want Delta to stay" in the area. But he said Mayor Richard J. Riordan's 
administration also expects to receive a "fair market" rent, and that separate 
appraisals of the property by both sides show the rent should be 
"substantially" higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are committed to trying to retain the (Delta) jobs, but we're also 
committed to establishing a fair market return," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta is saying little about the matter publicly. Spokeswoman Jackie Pate said 
only that the company is "exploring all options." 
</P>
<P>
 The Delta matter is the latest in a growing list of hassles between the 
airline industry and Los Angeles officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, for instance, the airlines grudgingly agreed to a tripling of 
their LAX landing fees after the Riordan Administration threatened to deny the 
carriers operating privileges at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The Delta dispute also could presage a conflict of interests between city 
airport authorities and state agencies, which are eager to prevent another 
major company from taking hundreds of jobs out of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The state just waged a successful battle to keep Taco Bell Corp., a unit of 
PepsiCo Inc., from moving its 1,000-worker headquarters operation from Irvine 
to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, however, California's Trade & Commerce Agency -- which organizes "red 
teams" of personnel that try to keep disaffected companies from leaving the 
state -- is keeping a low profile in the Delta case. The agency has been in 
contact with both sides, but no Delta red team has been formed, a spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a spokesman for the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County, 
a nonprofit jobs-promotion group, said the EDC is prepared to help Delta find 
another site in the region should the airline's LAX lease be terminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta's LAX building mainly houses agents taking reservations by phone -- a 
task that can be handled in virtually any city. Employees say Delta has already 
offered to transfer some Los Angeles workers to its reservation centers in 
Boston, Cincinnati and Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago, Delta launched a major corporate overhaul to slash $2 
billion from its annual operating costs, in part by eliminating up to 15,000 
jobs nationwide. Special charges related to that overhaul contributed to a 
$408-million loss for Delta in its fiscal year ended June 30, which followed 
the airline's $1-billion loss the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Delta's LAX facility and its work force are not included in the 
airline's massive restructuring and job cuts. Indeed, the airline said it has 
spent more than $1 million in recent months to upgrade and expand the 
building's communications and computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Those steps indicate that Delta prefers to stay in Los Angeles and is not 
using the LAX lease issue as an excuse to exit the state, some of Delta's 
workers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like they're super healthy and just looking for the best break" in 
rent, said Barbara Chavanne, a ticket agent who has worked at Delta for 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavanne said she and her husband were recently able to buy a house on the 
Palos Verdes peninsula because they have two incomes. But if Delta pulls out, 
she said, transferring to a Delta site outside of California "is something we 
have to seriously consider."

 For anyone who isn't sick by now of all of the Woodstock nostalgia as the 
music festival's 25th anniversary celebration approaches, the Learning Annex 
next week will offer a course on the Westside titled "How to Make $$$$ in 
Multi-Level Marketing." 
</P>
<P>
 The course features " '60s legend Jerry Rubin," a West Los Angeles 
businessman. Before discovering capitalism, Rubin was one of the nation's 
leading Woodstock-era radicals and a defendant in the famous Chicago 7 trial. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the catalogue, Rubin "has accurately predicted the most important 
trends of the past three decades."  
</P>
<P>
 On another Woodstock matter, it seems that for a fair number of people, the 
soft spot for Woodstock is limited. 
</P>
<P>
 A New Jersey company, Recollections, which sells framed displays featuring 
Woodstock tickets, has been deluged with people eager to sell their 25-year-old 
tickets. The going rate is $50 to $200, depending on the condition. Partner Tom 
Beaber says sales of the Woodstock items are decent, but "I wouldn't say we're 
going to retire from this." Cashing Out 
</P>
<P>
 Institutional shareholders of IDB Communications are unhappy the company 
agreed last week to swap each IDB share for about $10 in LDDS Communications 
stock, especially because IDB shares were trading at more than $20 earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the telecommunications company's officers, it's a much better deal. 
According to IDB's proxy, a clause that pays their salaries through 1996 -- 
with the company picking up the tab for taxes -- kicks in if there is a change 
in control. Chairman Jeffrey Sudikoff will get $1.6 million total for 1995 and 
1996, and President Edward R. Cheramy will get $1.3 million, the document says.

 Celebrity infomercial king Anthony Robbins, author of a bestseller called 
"Personal Power," is on the verge of turning on the legal power. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, the San Diego area self-help lecturer made famous by late-night 
commercials hosted by former football player Fran Tarkenton and actor Martin 
Sheen, is preparing a $100-million lawsuit against his longtime producer, 
Guthy-Renker, according to Robbins attorney Marty Singer. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit comes in the wake of a court filing last month by Guthy-Renker -- 
which is one-third owned by billionaire Ronald O. Perelman -- seeking 
arbitration proceedings. The company claims Robbins "took it hostage" by 
demanding more money and holding up production. It also claims that as Robbins' 
success grew, "so did his penchant for overreaching, extortion and disregard of 
his obligations" to Guthy-Renker. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer calls the Guthy-Renker accusations "damage control (that) read like a 
press release." 
</P>
<P>
 He also alleges that Robbins was shortchanged by Guthy-Renker because 
production costs were overstated on Robbins' products and the company failed to 
pass on savings when big blocks of TV time were bought. Singer adds that 
Guthy-Renker was able to attract a $25-million investment from Perelman because 
of Robbins' success.

 Alternative Vehicle Hearings Begin: Hearings by the California Public 
Utilities Commission open Monday in San Francisco involving plans by the 
state's investor-owned electric and gas utilities to charge their customers for 
programs to support the introduction of electric and natural gas vehicles to 
meet the state's clean air plan. The proposed projects over the next six years 
include installation of electric recharging and gas refueling stations, as well 
as other infrastructure development.Consumer groups have challenged some 
projects, charging that they unfairly force ratepayers to pay some of the costs 
of promoting the use of alternative vehicles. Plans that totaled more than $600 
million have already been scaled down by the utilities. The hearings will run 
three weeks, with a final PUC decision expected early in 1995.

 Natural Gas Facility Opens: The nation's largest facility for converting cars 
and trucks to natural gas opens in East Los Angeles on Friday. The Ecotrans 
assembly plant, owned in part by Southern California Gas Co., is one of the 
first enterprises to begin to meet a growing demand for cleaner, 
alternative-fuel cars, largely created by the California Air Resources Board 
Low Emission Vehicle rules. While most attention has been focused on electric 
cars, many thousands more natural gas vehicles, particularly in fleet use, are 
expected to appear on the state's highways over the next few years.

 Irvine Co. Negotiates Swap: Discussions are expected to continue this week 
between Orange County's largest private landowner and the Department of 
Interior regarding a possible land swap in which the development giant could 
gain control of all or part of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in exchange for 
property bordering the Cleveland National Forest.Federal officials were in 
Orange County two weeks ago meeting with Irvine Co. executives about the 
proposal for future control of the 4,700-acre military base, which is scheduled 
to close in 1999, according to officials. It is unknown whether such an 
enormous swap would boost or hinder prospects for building a commercial airport 
at El Toro.

 Vote Expected on Bullet Train: Planning, environmental studies, rights of way 
and technological research for a possible magnetic levitation "bullet train" 
between San Diego and Sacramento and other U.S. transit corridors would be 
funded under a $184-million federal transportation bill called the High Speed 
Rail Development Act. The bill may come up for a vote in the House of 
Representatives as early as Wednesday.Introduced by Rep. Lynn Schenk (D-San 
Diego), the bill is a precursor to a much larger authorization bill that could 
fund actual construction of several high speed trains similar to those that 
operate in Europe and Japan. A bullet train could be a tough sell in San Diego, 
however, where a previous proposal for a 200-m.p.h. train to Los Angeles and 
back died in the mid-1980s after generating strong local opposition. "Things 
have changed since 1985," a Schenk aide said. The House bill, which would need 
Senate approval, would authorize matching federal funds to states and 
municipalities considering high-speed transit.

 Alaskan Communities Settle Claims With Exxon: A few coastal communities soiled 
by the Exxon Valdez oil spill settled claims against Exxon for less than $1 
million.The communities, along with half a dozen Alaskan Native groups, had 
filed a $100-million suit against the oil company in state court seeking 
property damage, unpaid cleanup bills and protection of archeological sites. 
Still unresolved are the Native groups' claims for damage to their lands and 
archeological resources, plaintiffs' attorney Robert Stoll said. The trial on 
those issues was to continue today. The settlements came as a federal jury 
continued deliberations that began July 12 in a separate class-action lawsuit 
filed by about 10,000 fishermen who seek nearly $900 million from Exxon.

CATERPILLAR CONFIRMS REVIEW BY JUSTICE OFFICIALS; MANUFACTURING: HEAVY 
EQUIPMENT MAKER SAYS ANTITRUST PROBE WILL FIND NO VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caterpillar Inc., one of the nation's biggest manufacturers of heavy 
construction equipment, acknowledged Sunday that the Justice Department is 
conducting a review of its marketing practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Butterfield, a spokesman for the Peoria, Ill.-based company, said 
Caterpillar is in the process of responding to a Justice Department inquiry. He 
said the company is confident the agency will find no "violations of the law." 
</P>
<P>
 The Peoria Journal Star reported Saturday that the Justice Department is 
investigating Caterpillar for possible antitrust violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper said the probe is aimed at determining whether Caterpillar tried 
to restrain or even monopolize trade in the replacement parts market. 
</P>
<P>
 A Justice spokeswoman was quoted as saying the government is investigating the 
heavy construction equipment industry for charges of anti-competitive 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokeswoman, citing department policy, refused to identify the corporate 
target of the probe. The department's weekend spokesman said he was unaware of 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Butterfield, reached at his home outside Peoria, said in a telephone 
interview: "We have received an inquiry from the Justice Department." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the firm is responding to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are confident and have every reason to believe that the Justice Department 
will understand that our practices are not a violation of the law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Butterfield said a company attorney advised him of a Justice Department letter 
of inquiry but said he did not know when that correspondence was received. 
</P>
<P>
 The Journal Star said the Justice Department's interest was piqued by a series 
of lawsuits against Caterpillar in recent years that alleged: 
</P>
<P>
 * Businesses were blacklisted from buying Caterpillar parts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caterpillar's dealers were kept from buying competitive parts from other 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 * A supplier alliance was set up to restrict sales of competitive parts into 
the "aftermarket," parts needed by Caterpillar users when a machine breaks 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Caterpillar has enjoyed a very good year financially. On July 21, for the 
second time in 1994, the company reported record quarterly results. 
</P>
<P>
 Caterpillar said second-quarter net income more than tripled to $240 million, 
or $2.36 a share, from $67 million, or 66 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 During the same quarter, revenue jumped 24% to $3.61 billion.

U.S. RESOURCES SUBSIDIZING PRIVATE BUSINESS, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toward an outdated goal of developing the West, the federal government is 
virtually giving away billions of dollars' worth of natural resources to 
subsidize private business, a congressional report says. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsidies come in the form of cheap water, underpriced timber and help for 
private interests ranging from mining companies to ranchers and farmers, 
according to a study released Sunday by the House Natural Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The study said the subsidies -- which range from mining claims being sold for 
a few dollars to cheap electricity from government dams -- are so widespread 
that no one can calculate the total cost to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply don't know," Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.), the committee's 
chairman, told reporters. "It runs into the hundreds of millions, sometimes 
billions of dollars. And on a cumulative basis, it's off the charts." 
</P>
<P>
 Congress has discussed many of these subsidies for years, but the debate has 
intensified since the Clinton Administration began pushing for higher grazing 
fees, royalty payments on hard rock minerals and higher prices for timber taken 
from federal forests. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say some subsidies should be eliminated, some curtailed and others 
subjected to means testing to ensure that wealthy individuals or corporations 
do not get tax-funded support. 
</P>
<P>
 The report lists dozens of cases in which private individuals or corporations 
enjoy tax benefits or cheap access to federal land, water or mineral rights. It 
also points out that some subsidies work at cross-purposes. Some farmers, for 
example, have used subsidized water to grow surplus crops on land leased from 
the government at lower-than-market rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the examples it cites: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mining companies that purchase through a "patenting" process the rights to 
federal land, then reap billions of dollars from hard rock minerals such as 
gold and platinum without paying the government a penny in royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cheap electricity from federal power suppliers in the Northwest and in the 
Missouri River Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the price gap has narrowed in some cases, federal power is still much 
cheaper than other sources, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The sale of timber from federal forests at prices that do not cover the 
costs of administration or of building at taxpayer expense the miles of 
roadways needed.

MITSUBISHI'S REDESIGNED ECLIPSE DEBUTS IN BLAZE OF ADVERTISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America is launching its redesigned Eclipse sports 
coupe today with the biggest advertising campaign in the company's history. 
</P>
<P>
 The $35-million-plus effort will play out in the media through November, 
highlighted by a series of television ads directed by Mikael Solomon, the 
cinematographer whose special effects made fire a leading co-star of Ron 
Howard's 1992 film "Backdraft." 
</P>
<P>
 True to Solomon's background, the first of the four commercials features 
scenes of the new Eclipse rising from the fiery solar surface during a total 
eclipse of the sun and then plummeting to earth as a blazing comet. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme is a constant in each commercial, a blending of computer-drawn 
images, live action and special effects shot in the desert near Moab, Utah, 
said Holly Hood, art director for Mitsubishi's ad agency, G2. 
</P>
<P>
 G2 is the Huntington Beach-based subsidiary of New York's Grey Advertising 
that was formed last year to handle Mitsubishi's $100-million-plus ad account. 
Previously, Grey had operated a branch office in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the television spots, the model launch includes national print, 
radio and billboard campaigns as well as several promotional tie-ins with MTV. 
Mitsubishi is a sponsor of the MTV Video Awards to be broadcast Sept. 8 and 
also will sponsor the rock video channel's summer "Beach House" program through 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Stone, G2 creative director, said the campaign is aimed at the Eclipse 
target market of 18- to 34-year-olds and will continue after the first four ads 
have been aired with the further journeys of the Eclipse, "this remarkable 
creature," after it has landed on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial television ad, "Creation," premieres today on the three largest 
broadcast networks and on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1995 model is a complete redesign of the original Eclipse that was 
introduced in 1989.

 Gasoline Prices Rise More Than 3 Cents: The overall retail price for the fuel 
has been climbing over the past two weeks at double the pace of last month, an 
industry analyst said.The average was $1.2381 a gallon as of Friday, up 3.35 
cents from the previous survey, said analyst Trilby Lundberg, author of the 
Lundberg Survey. Lundberg said the increase is because of higher crude oil 
prices and strong demand. A month-old strike by oil workers in Nigeria, the 
world's 10th-largest oil producer, contributed heavily to the rise in crude 
prices, she said. The biweekly survey is based on a review of prices at 10,000 
gas stations nationwide.

U.S. BORROWS, FOREIGN 'FEDS' LEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Treasury comes to market this week in its quarterly "refunding." 
Uncle Sam will suck up $40 billion in cash, issuing a like amount of IOUs in 
three-year, 10-year and 30-year notes and bonds consecutively beginning on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 And who will buy these securities? Wall Street brokerages, institutional 
investors here and abroad, and individuals will invariably show up in numbers 
great enough to assure that every note and bond is sold. They always do. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's another type of investor in whose coffers U.S. debt is piling up, 
and with worrisome implications: Foreign central banks. 
</P>
<P>
 James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer newsletter in New York, 
notes that foreign central bank holdings of U.S. Treasury securities have 
rocketed from $300 billion at the start of 1993 to $391 billion now. 
</P>
<P>
 That total exceeds the $348 billion in U.S. Treasuries held by the U.S. 
Federal Reserve Bank system, Grant points out. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes two observations about the buildup of Treasury debt among the foreign 
"Feds": 
</P>
<P>
 * First, it tells us that foreign private investors are less and less 
interested in holding U.S. Treasuries, because if they were, the foreign 
central banks (as buyers of last resort) wouldn't be obliged to hold as much. 
</P>
<P>
 To put it another way, Grant says, the burden of financing the huge U.S. 
current account deficit -- soaking up the excess dollars we send abroad because 
of our trade and budget deficits -- is falling increasingly to central banks 
rather than to private investors. Not a good sign for Uncle Sam's long-term 
credit-worthiness. 
</P>
<P>
 * Second, Grant argues, it's a reasonable bet that the mountain of Treasuries 
at central banks will ultimately become inflationary for the world economy. 
"Sooner or later . . . voluminous net central-bank purchases of any financial 
asset (bills, notes, currencies) tend to create a monetary surplus, the first 
cause of inflation," he says. Too many dollars chasing too few goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Could that be another reason long-term bond yields worldwide have remained 
much higher this year than current low inflation would warrant? TOM PETRUNO

 Foreign Satellite Broadcasts to Be Banned: The government will prohibit the 
reception of such broadcasts in an effort to protect the Communists' one-party 
rule, according to a report in the Daily Yomiuri. Last month, police cited 120 
Vietnamese citizens for watching foreign TV programs without government 
permission. The country allows foreign-owned companies and hotels to set up a 
system to monitor satellite TV programs.

THE PACIFIC; CHINESE COLAS GO FLAT AS U.S. BRANDS TAKE OVER; TRADE: THE 
COUNTRY'S SOFT DRINK MAKERS SAY THEY CAN'T COMPETE AGAINST COKE AND PEPSI, 
WHICH NOW HAVE 20% OF THE MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On a scorching afternoon at Blue Island, one of this city's biggest department 
stores, the long line is not for rows of warming Chinese colas and fruit juices 
but for refrigerator-cooled Sprite, Fanta and Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
 To the dismay of Chinese soft drink makers, who have seen many of their brands 
die, the U.S. cola invasion is in full swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Official figures show Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo. last year sold 700,000 tons 
of soft drinks in China. They accounted for 20% of the country's carbonated 
drinks market, with Coke having 15% and Pepsi 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse is to come, with each U.S. giant setting up 10 new plants in China. 
</P>
<P>
 "On our own, we do not have the capital or technology to compete," lamented Li 
Jingwei, general manager of Jianlibao, one of China's biggest soft drink makers 
with output value this year of $345 million. "We need preferential loans from 
the government to expand production, improve technology and develop new 
markets. There should be appropriate controls on the expansion of foreign 
brands in the Chinese market." 
</P>
<P>
 He said joint ventures enjoyed preferential treatment in supply of capital, 
raw materials and exports. 
</P>
<P>
 His firm, by contrast, was hit by a sudden recall of $9.2 million in loans 
that shut down one of its can-making companies this year, causing millions in 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Tighter curbs on foreign borrowing make it harder to raise money from abroad 
to make up for the domestic cash shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 But if it's down, Jianlibao isn't out. The company exports 35,000 tons a year, 
with 8,000 of that sold last year in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many famous Chinese brands have disappeared under the U.S. onslaught. 
The most poignant loss came last January, when Pepsi bought a 60% share of Tian 
Fu Cola, which had been the great hope of the nation's soft drink industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepsi executives exulted in their triumph, but it was a bitter moment for Tian 
Fu Chief Executive Li Peiquan, a longtime campaigner against the foreign cola 
invasion. After the takeover, Li resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to apologize to the entire work force," he said bitterly. 
</P>
<P>
 It was because of pressure from him and the seven other big domestic makers 
that the national cabinet and the Light Industry Ministry was persuaded in 1987 
to issue guidelines limiting the number of new plants foreign soft drink makers 
could establish in China. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort failed, however. Domestic makers -- hobbled by debts, poor 
management, lack of capital and an abundance of counterfeits -- failed to rise 
to the challenge. Many closed and others set up joint production with Coke or 
Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
 A Light Industry Ministry official said the days of the closed door are long 
over: "Our policy is to develop both local and foreign brands. With 
competition, Chinese brands will become stronger, like Jianlibao." 
</P>
<P>
 The consumers at Blue Island, however, see the victory of the U.S. colas as a 
triumph over poorly organized competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I drink Coke every day with meals," said one 25-year-old man. "It is cool and 
stimulating. Its advertising is very impressive, such as during the (soccer) 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no exact Chinese competitor. Look here: All the Chinese drinks are 
warm, not cold. The quality of the Chinese goods is not stable, and there are 
many fakes." 
</P>
<P>
 A can of Coke costs 40 cents, against 34 cents for Sprite or Fanta and 40 
cents for Jianlibao, a fizzy honey-flavored drink. 
</P>
<P>
 A 45-year-old engineer said foreign products are more fashionable than 
domestic ones. "If you have guests, you must serve foreign beer or soft drinks. 
It is a question of face." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the front entrance of Blue Island opposite the McDonald's outlet is a 
large advertisement of entertainer Michael Jackson inviting people to try 
Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepsi and Coke are seeking still more sales. In February, each company signed 
a memorandum with the Light Industry Ministry allowing it to set up 10 more 
factories in China. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepsi plans to spend $350 million over the next seven years to double its 
sales in China, and Coke intends to bring its investment here to $500 million 
over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of Chinese firms able to compete with the foreign brands is 
dwindling," commented the China Economic News. "Apart from the excellent 
Jianlibao, there is only young Hainan Coconut Juice."

 Inflation Nearly Double '94 Target: The National Information Center put the 
country's annual inflation this year at 18.8%, against an official target of 
10%, and said that authorities should consider raising interest rates.The China 
Securities News quoted the agency, part of the State Planning Commission, as 
saying that, after having fallen in the first four months, inflation started to 
rise again in May. Official figures show that annual inflation in the first 
half of 1994 was 19% over the same 1993 period. Inflation for all of 1993 was 
13% over that of 1992. The center said inflation would continue at a high level 
in the second half.

 Investment Law Passed: The national assembly has passed a long-awaited 
investment law, but business people and others say it is unlikely to bring a 
rush of investment although it may warm the economic climate. "This law is not 
going to change the comparative advantage of Cambodia vis-a-vis other countries 
in the region," one foreign observer said. International confidence in Cambodia 
has been shaken by bouts of fighting between government forces and Khmer Rouge 
rebels, an attempted coup last month and the kidnaping and apparent murder of 
three young foreigners in April.

 Sales of U.S.-Made Autos Jump: Sales of imported vehicles, led by U.S.-made 
models, rose 49.6% in July to 30,467, marking the ninth straight year-on-year 
gain, the Japan Automobile Importers' Assn. said. U.S.-made cars shot up 78.8% 
from a year earlier to 10,359; German cars rose 7.6% to 10,398. Of the U.S. 
total, Honda Motor Co. sales topped the list with 6,054 cars, up 104.2% from a 
year ago.But industry analysts also say improvements in cars made by U.S. 
companies are helping to boost the import figure. Sales by the Big Three car 
makers saw healthy growth in July. Chrysler Corp.'s totaled 1,370, up 129.5%, 
and Ford Motor Co.'s were 1,289, up 105.6%. But General Motors Corp.'s sales 
fell 13.6% to 727.

 Machine Tool Orders Rise: Year-over-year orders rose for the first time since 
November, 1990.Total orders climbed 3.6% on the year in June to $491 million, 
the Japan Machine Tool Builders Assn. said. Most of the boost came from surging 
overseas demand. But domestic orders, although down 5.9% on the year, seem to 
be pulling out of a three-year slump. In April, domestic orders had fallen 
20.2%. Because machine tools are used to make machines and parts used by larger 
manufacturers, their fate is closely associated with that of the economy 
overall.

 Drought Continues: Much of central and eastern Australia is being devastated 
by a fourth consecutive year of low rainfall.A prolonged drought could slow the 
nation's growth, blunt government plans to whittle the budget deficit and 
aggravate the country's trade deficit, analysts said. Agricultural products 
account for about a third of exports and contribute billions of dollars a year 
to export earnings. Forecasts call for below-average rainfall in most major 
agricultural areas for the next three months.

 Question: I'm an independent sales representative on a month-to-month 
contract. I've been with one manufacturer for 10 1/2 years and they just had a 
change in management and decided not to use my services any more. I'm just 
wondering, because of the duration of the relationship, whether it is 
worthwhile to pursue some kind of settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.B., Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: While sometimes the courts will recognize an implied contract for 
employment that is terminated for cause based upon, among other things, length 
of service, that principle typically applies only to employees and not to 
independent contractors. As an independent contractor there really is not much 
you can do, provided that the manufacturer followed the termination procedure 
outlined in your contract. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be some question whether you were actually an independent 
contractor, however. If the manufacturer closely supervised your work, required 
you to work specific hours, withheld payroll taxes from you or covered you 
under its health plan and workers' compensation insurance, a court might 
consider you to be an employee with certain implied contract rights. If you 
believe there is a realistic possibility that you might have qualified as an 
employee, you should probably consult a lawyer to examine the issue more 
closely.

 Question: I work for a company that offers no health benefits. Am I still 
covered for an on-the-job injury? 
</P>
<P>
 -- C.J., Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Almost every employee in California is protected by workers' 
compensation, though there are a few exceptions. Individuals in business for 
themselves and unpaid volunteers may not be covered. Also, federal employees, 
railroad and maritime workers are covered by similar laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers' compensation is a job-related insurance program in which the premium 
is paid on behalf of employees by their employer and supervised by the state. 
If an employee is unable to work because of a job-related injury or illness, 
workers' compensation automatically pays the medical bills and provides a 
proportion of the injured employee's wage until he or she is able to return to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers' compensation is often confused with State Disability Insurance. 
Though very similar, workers' compensation insurance covers "on-the-job" 
injuries or sickness and is paid for by the employer. However, SDI covers 
"off-the-job" injuries or sicknesses and is funded by an employee's deductions 
from his or her paycheck. SDI will then provide a proportion of the injured 
employee's wage until he or she is no longer disabled or the benefits are 
exhausted.

 Question: I work for the U.S. Postal Service. Several years ago we brought in 
a program called E.I.: Employee Involvement. However, non-union employees are 
not allowed to take part -- we can't vote or anything else. Only union 
employees can participate. Is this a fair labor practice? 
</P>
<P>
 -- G.W., San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There is no legal requirement that an employer impose any employee 
involvement program. Union employees are under a contract and often have many 
rights and privileges not provided to non-union employees. Excluding non-union 
employees may be unfair and may even harm the morale in the work force, but it 
is not illegal.  
</P>
<P>
 As a practical solution, you might join with the other non-union employees and 
make clear to your employer that relations in the workplace could be improved 
if you were allowed to participate.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, consider participating informally by giving management a memo with the 
results of an unofficial "vote" by non-union employees on a particular issue 
being considered by the union employees. The employer may see the mutual 
benefit of full participation. 
</P>

 Question: Our business is in the process of being sold. There is a rumor that 
our present owners intend to declare bankruptcy after the sale has been 
completed. All eight of the employees here have accrued vacation time that our 
present company owes us. Is there a possibility that we will not be paid for 
this time due us if the bankruptcy rumor becomes a reality? If so, do we have 
any legal recourse to recoup the time off or money owed? 
</P>
<P>
 -- M.S., Cypress 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The answer to both questions is "yes." Like other forms of 
compensation, vacation pay is a debt that can be discharged in and does not 
survive a bankruptcy. However, there may be two ways to recoup some or all of 
the accrued vacation pay.  
</P>
<P>
 First, in a bankruptcy, people holding wage claims -- including vacation pay 
claims -- do have priority (for amounts up to $2,000) over general creditors. 
Therefore, there may be enough money in the bankrupt estate to satisfy your 
claims, and you need to be sure to assert our claims in any bankruptcy 
proceeding.  
</P>
<P>
 Second, under certain circumstances, the purchaser may expressly agree or 
imply to agree to assume the company's vacation pay obligation. If there is a 
purchase of your employer's business and the issue of your vacation pay is not 
clarified for you, you should correspond immediately with the purchaser to 
learn the status of your pay as far as the purchaser is concerned.

O.C. ENTERPRISE: CLEANING UP ON NATURAL GAS CARS; HUNTINGTON BEACH AUTO SHOP 
FINDS A LUCRATIVE NICHE CONVERTING VEHICLES TO RUN ON THE LOWER-EMISSIONS FUEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A walk around the Eikelberger shop is like strolling through the past and 
future of the automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 The past is represented by a black and burgundy 1938 Ford pickup truck 
awaiting delivery to a customer, or the rare 1951 Chrysler-powered Allard JTX 
roadster being restored. 
</P>
<P>
 The future is tucked away at the far end of the shop, where Bryce Eikelberger 
is drilling mounting holes under the hood of a new white Ford F-series pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 It is there that the Eikelbergers convert cars and trucks to run on natural 
gas, an alternative fuel that delivers nearly the same performance as gasoline 
at lower cost and with far lower emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternative Fuel Technologies in Huntington Beach is one of a handful of 
conversion shops around Southern California. The company grossed $1.8 million 
last year converting about 365 vehicles to run on either gasoline or natural 
gas. Despite competitive bidding, the company said its profit margins are 
respectable because of the special expertise required. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Eikelberger, Bryce's dad and the shop's founder, says the conversion 
business is being threatened by new rules from the state Air Resources Board. 
To keep afloat, he said he is ready to branch out his company into other kinds 
of business -- or move out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at offshore things and flat getting out of state. There are 
other states that don't have these problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, Alternate Fuel Technologies has been making a good business 
from the alternative fuels craze. Parked in his shop is a Federal Express 
delivery van, one of several he is converting, and a white Ford pickup, being 
converted for the city of San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 He said other customers have been Southern California Gas, the governments of 
San Bernardino and Los Angeles counties and the South Coast Management 
District. But the biggest customer has been the city of Long Beach, for whom 
AFT has converted about 250 vehicles -- from police cars to garbage trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipalities and fleet operators have been enticed to undertake the $4,000 
vehicle conversions because there are various grants and incentives available, 
all in the name of clean air. The gas company alone offers an incentive of 
$1,700 per converted vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to clean up the air," said Mike Marelli, natural gas vehicle sales 
manager for the Southern California Gas, which itself has 60 vehicles operating 
on the fuel it sells and another 140 on order. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternate Fuel Technologies is one of seven recommended converters in the 
area, he said, adding: "They do good work." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Eikelberger said that the conversion business was a natural for the 
company. He built his life around cars, first as a mechanic and engineer in a 
top racing shop in the 1960s and later on his own as a vehicle customizer. And 
early on, he discovered the appeal of alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, he converted a van to run on propane. When a gasoline shortage 
hit in the latter part of the decade, Eikelberger recalls driving by the gas 
lines. As a result, he developed a small business around propane conversions -- 
although it was dwarfed by the larger business of converting vans to four-wheel 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, natural gas became more widespread as an alternative vehicle fuel. 
Government agencies, the gas company and fleet operators started installing 
refueling stations around the Los Angeles Basin as a way of fighting air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the obvious benefit of cleaner air, natural gas is also cheaper than 
gasoline, he said. The amount of gas that is equivalent in energy content to a 
gallon of gasoline would cost about 75 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 It also burns so cleanly that engines last longer, according to Eikelberger. 
He said his propane-powered 1979 Dodge van has similar properties to natural 
gas -- and has run 400,000 miles without an engine rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 But natural gas fuel tanks are bulky. A tank that could hold 35 liquid gallons 
has only the equivalent storage space for five gallons of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 Engines running on natural gas have a little less pick up and speed as 
gasoline burners. And there is still a limited number of refueling sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Eikelberger said he has tried to counter the disadvantages. Tanks are usually 
installed in car trunks or in the beds of pickup trucks where they do no 
interfere with interior space. The vehicles are configured so that they can run 
either on gasoline or natural gas with the flip of a switch -- so the driver is 
never stranded. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Long Beach's natural gas-powered police cars, Eikelberger said 
the engine automatically switches to gasoline for extra performance when the 
driver stomps on the pedal, such as would be the case when becoming involved in 
a high-speed chase. There are no switches to change between fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police departments are a hard sell so we make it the most user-friendly thing 
we possibly can," he said. "The cop doesn't touch a thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach has converted 250 vehicles, about halfway to its goal of 500, said 
Ralph Crouch, the city's general supervisor of acquisition. He said Alternate 
Fuel Technologies has lived up to the terms of its contract and "I haven't had 
a problem" with their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternate Fuel Technologies once had 12 employees, but Eikelberger said he had 
to lay off six at the end of last year. He blames the layoffs on the new rules 
issued by the state Air Resources Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules say that companies must test their natural gas conversion equipment 
on every type of engine set for installation for at least 100,000 miles before 
it can be certified for use, the same types of tests that are required now of 
gasoline engines. 
</P>
<P>
 Such tests are so expensive and the market so limited at present, Eikelberger 
said, that equipment makers are not willing to make many of the tests. Without 
equipment that has been tested, vehicles can't be converted to natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ARB, with its arrogant attitude, has pushed a lot of industry out of 
California and are putting a lot of conversion houses out of business," he 
said. An Air Resources Board spokesman could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternate Fuel Technologies may be the next to go. Now 52, Bruce said he is 
nearing retirement and is considering moving the business to New Mexico. He 
would pass on the operations to Bryce, 31. 
</P>
<P>
 It would certainly keep things in the family. Bryce is the only one of his 
four sons who has shown a major interest in the vehicle conversion business and 
Bruce Eikelberger's wife -- Bea Dallas, the company president -- handles the 
paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 If the conversion business gives out, he said, they can always concentrate on 
the another automotive specialty -- such as restoring old cars or finding other 
kinds of custom work, such as building a car that is designed to break speed 
records for natural gas-powered vehicles, which is under construction in the 
shop. Being flexible is how the business has survived for 14 years at its 
present Huntington Beach site. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a niche business. We climb into a niche until it gets crowded, then 
we look for a new one," he said.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SPOTLIGHT; CERAMICS MAKER FIRED UP IN RECEPTIVE MARKET ;

<P>
 Clambering over earthquake rubble in his West Los Angeles pottery factory, 
Laurie Gates searched for more disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahead in the darkness on Jan. 17 stood dozens of gold-emblazoned rabbit cookie 
jars that were scheduled to be packed that very morning for shipment to the 
Bloomingdale's spring catalogue operation. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was a sweet sight when Gates rounded the last corner to find the first 
rays of morning glinting through a skylight onto unscathed 24-karat gold: Not 
one rabbit had toppled over, and the $8,000 order was saved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took it as a good sign," Gates said, despite the $200,000 in lost 
inventory, equipment and other damage caused by the Northridge earthquake. "It 
was a good day for bunnies." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a good two years all around for Gates' company, Los Angeles 
Pottery, which produces hand-painted ceramic bakeware, dinnerware, serving 
pieces, tile, salt-and-pepper shakers and lots and lots of cookie jars in 
little more than 18,000 square feet of jam-packed space. 
</P>
<P>
 In its short life, Los Angeles Pottery has survived earthquake, fire and 
recession, as well as low-cost foreign competition. It is one of the few 
remaining domestic firms in this sort of labor-intensive business. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviving the name of a long-defunct maker of early California ceramics, Gates 
has built a thriving company from the ruins of his previous employer, a dish 
manufacturer on the same site that fell victim to the changing marketplace. Los 
Angeles Pottery's sales reached nearly $3 million in 1993, more than triple the 
first year's total. Employment has climbed past 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates credits the designs of his hand-painted wares -- 25 patterns and growing 
-- coupled with an increasing interest by major retailers in buying from 
domestic sources for quicker turnaround of orders and less need for tying up 
capital waiting for container loads of dishes to arrive from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's something more at work here than attractive, pricey dishes: Behind 
it all is an entrepreneur who is not afraid to take some very big chances. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Gates chucked a comfortable life ranching and farming on 2,000 acres 
in Alberta, Canada, and running a few small businesses on the side, to move to 
Los Angeles with his 11-year-old son. Gates said he was looking for a change 
and some new business opportunities, and he liked the zest for life that Los 
Angeles was showing in that optimistic Olympic year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a turning point in my life," said Gates, now 43. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates launched a new career as a manufacturers' representative for a large 
gift company, collaborating with clients on design ideas. After five years, 
Gates was asked to help straighten out a struggling dish manufacturer called 
Designcraft. But the company had too few designs to keep its products selling 
briskly, he said. In early 1992, Gates, by then general manager, was told to 
shut the firm down. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he took another chance and bought it with $435,000 in cash -- an 
investment recouped by the end of the year. Los Angeles Pottery remains 
debt-free, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up on the prairies on Canada, I never really believed in debt," he 
said, shrugging. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession was a scary time to launch a new venture, Gates acknowledged. 
But languishing retailers were desperately looking for products that would sell 
quickly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a good reputation for sales and for selling lines that moved well for 
retailers, and they were open to me," Gates said. "The associations I had made 
from years of sales and from working (at Designcraft) kind of all came 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been challenges. The Northridge earthquake was a hard blow, but it 
closed Los Angeles Pottery for only three days, Gates said. A still unsolved 
arson fire last year slowed the firm down for only a few hours, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates found a receptive market for his designs, which range from ethnic to 
modern to country, and the quick turnaround he promised. Merchandise can be 
made and shipped in less than four weeks -- for a rush, within days -- compared 
to up to six months for overseas orders, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Pottery's wares have found their way to such retailers as Macy's, 
Williams-Sonoma, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom, Harrods and even the new 
Flintstones store opening Memorial Day weekend at CityWalk. Gates has designed 
three fossil-themed dish lines for the store. 
</P>
<P>
 The stuff isn't cheap: A hand-painted dinner plate retails for under $20 and, 
when fired with gold or platinum, plates sell for close to $50. A snowman 
cookie jar wearing a gold-painted tuxedo was popular last Christmas for between 
$90 and $100, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
 All the work is done in-house, including mixing clay, making molds, 
hand-painting products and firing goods. Each piece is handled again and again 
in a process that takes more than 30 steps. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an activity seldom seen these days in Southern California, which was 
once home to a thriving ceramics industry. Metlox Potteries and Franciscan 
Ceramics are two of the better known manufacturers to have closed their 
factories in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The competition is really tough," Gates said. "There are hundreds of 
factories in Italy that are hand-painting, and they can sell at cheaper 
prices." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gates insists that domestic manufacturers can deliver a unmatched level of 
service. Major retailers are beginning to get the message, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even one small client praised the firm's flexibility. When Livingstone's, a 
Beverly Hills gift shop, asked Gates to change the color of the fruit painted 
on one dish line, he did it, said buyer Sam Ouldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two ways of doing business," Ouldhouse said. "There is, 'This is 
what the business is,' and there is, 'How can I help you?' They're more 'How 
can I help you?' "

HOT JOBS: THE FRAMERS COME FIRST IN CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a framing foreman for Davis Bros. Construction, Mike Forrest supervises 
anywhere from 10 to 70 workers, depending on the size of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to provide the manpower and push to get the work done," Forrest 
said. . 
</P>
<P>
 He decided on a construction career because his father was a carpenter and he 
thought it looked like an easy way to make a living. "But it didn't take long 
for me to find out that this is actually a lot of hard work," said Forrest, 36. 
</P>
<P>
 "The framers are responsible for the structural integrity of the building. All 
of the other trades come in behind us, so our work has to be exact or it throws 
everyone else off.  
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we're working on 44 homes in California Cortina, a new home 
development in Dana Point. So we have to pay attention and stay consistent with 
the model, since that's the kind of house the consumer agreed to buy." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in high school, I did not think much about subjects like algebra 
and geometry since I never thought I would use them. But in construction, math 
skills come into play in almost everything."  
</P>
<P>
 Another skill that Forrest finds helpful is knowing how to motivate his crews, 
"which in my case is a little easier because I'm fortunate to have a good group 
of workers.  
</P>
<P>
 "But sometimes you have to pacify people and be responsible for all of the 
expectations that management has to keep the project on track." OCCUPATION: 
Construction foreman 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Construction foremen supervise groups of workers building 
homes or other structures. In most cases, they oversee a single aspect of the 
work, such as framing, roofing or drywall installation. They are responsible 
for staffing and the quality of work performed by their crews. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Many construction foremen learn their trade through 
union-sponsored apprentice programs. Most have at least a high school diploma 
and some have taken college courses, but the bulk of their construction 
training takes place on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of construction foremen is projected to 
increase by 8.9%, to 2,580. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: $30,000 to $45,000 per year 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Construction foremen enjoy working outdoors and report satisfaction 
from seeing a building project through from start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Construction work usually starts very early in the morning, requiring 
workers to rise as early as 4 a.m. if they have to commute a long way to the 
work site. Bad weather can also delay progress for long periods.  
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: Construction foremen may advance to project superintendent or 
to other administrative positions such as vice president of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "The guys on my crew are among the best in Southern California. 
Framing is a huge teamwork, effort and they work really hard."

O.C. AD SHOP G2 PUSHING MITSUBISHI'S REDESIGNED ECLIPSE IN FIERY TV BLITZ 
</P>

<P>
 Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America is launching its redesigned Eclipse sports 
coupe today with the biggest advertising campaign in the company's history. 
</P>
<P>
 The more than $35-million effort will play out in the media through November, 
highlighted by a series of television ads directed by Mikael Solomon, the 
cinematographer whose special effects made fire a leading co-star of director 
Ron Howard's 1992 film "Backdraft." 
</P>
<P>
 True to Solomon's background, the first of the four commercials features 
scenes of the new Eclipse rising from the fiery solar surface during a total 
eclipse of the sun and then plummeting to Earth as a blazing new comet. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme is a constant in each of the commercials, a blending of 
computer-drawn images, live action and special effects shot in the desert near 
Moab, Utah, said Holly Hood, art director for Mitsubishi's ad agency, G2. 
</P>
<P>
 G2 is the Huntington Beach-based subsidiary of New York's Grey Advertising 
that was formed last year to handle Mitsubishi's $100-million-plus ad account. 
Previously, Grey had operated a branch office in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the television spots, the model launch includes national print, 
radio and billboard campaigns as well as several promotional tie-ins with MTV. 
Mitsubishi is a sponsor of the MTV Video Awards to be broadcast Sept. 8 and 
also will sponsor the rock video channel's summer "Beach House" program through 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Stone, G2 creative director, said the campaign is aimed at the Eclipse 
target market of 18- to 34-year-olds and will continue after the first four ads 
have been aired with the further journeys of the Eclipse, "this remarkable 
creature," after it has landed on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial television ad, "Creation," premiers today on the three largest 
broadcast networks and on MTV, said Frances Oda, Mitsubishi's marketing 
services director. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eclipse is one Mitsubishi's signature cars -- a model that helps bring 
shoppers into its showrooms, even if a minivan or economy sedan is what they 
are really looking for. The company employs about 390 people at its Cypress 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1995 model is a complete redesign of the original Eclipse that was 
introduced in 1989 and quickly became Mitsubishi's best-selling car, with 
270,000 sold through the end of the 1994 model year. 
</P>
<P>
 The new cars have begun showing up on dealers' lots already, although 
Mitsubishi considers mid-August to be the official introduction period. The 
1995 Eclipse will range from a $14,000 front-wheel drive model with a 
four-speed manual transmission and a 140-horsepower four-cylinder engine to a 
turbocharged 210-horsepower model with all-wheel drive, a five-speed 
transmission and a $22,000 price tag that is more affordable for those who see 
the ads on "Northern Exposure" than on MTV's "Beach House." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitsubishi, flush with the success of its 1994 redesign of the Galant sedan, 
reported last week that its U.S. sales for the first seven months were up 26% 
to 134,487 cars and trucks from 106,797 in the same period a year earlier. 
Eclipse and Galant models -- both built at Mitsubishi's plant in Illinois -- 
accounted for more than half the 1994 total through July.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; BAILEY MAY STILL HAVE EARTH, WIND, BUT FIRE'S GONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the golden-hued voice of Earth, Wind and Fire, Philip Bailey set hearts 
aflutter with his amazing range and soulful presentation. Bailey has played on 
that reputation now that he's out on his own, dealing in romantic ballads and 
funk-fluff designed, it seems, specifically for lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was little romance involved Friday when Bailey appeared at the Hyatt 
Newporter's outdoor amphitheater. Though Bailey has a new, eponymous album out, 
he chose to do only one song from it, instead working through a program of pop 
and jazz tunes and the occasional ditty from his EW&F days. If the program 
seemed hardly inspired, his singing was even less so. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was the format. Teaming with a mostly ad hoc band that had rehearsed 
only briefly the day before -- and that session, Bailey admitted to the 
audience, contained more eating than playing -- the singer was strapped into 
material that was less than representative of his current direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd didn't seem to mind. They wanted to hear the kind of numbers that 
Bailey has been associated with over the years and they weren't disappointed, 
coming to their feet at the end of most of the familiar tunes. But, truthfully, 
there was little about his presentation worth cheering. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey's fabled falsetto betrayed him at every turn. Though he still climbed 
to amazing highs with tones that pierced the upper ranges with the bite of a 
toothy whistle, his pitch was often unsettlingly flat. At times, he seemed to 
be unable to decide between the falsetto and his normal tones, falling away to 
tenor-pitched range just when it seemed he was ready to soar. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, the singer's many attempts at scatting rang with amateurism. Empty of 
snap, his wordless vocals came off as more of an attempt to show off his range 
than any exhibition of rhythmic savvy. And when he broke off into "A Tisket, A 
Tasket" in obvious deference to Ella Fitzgerald, one couldn't help but wince at 
the comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite sound balance problems, the program started out with some promise as 
Bailey's "jazz quintet," as they were introduced, worked out the kinks on an 
up-tempo blues tune. Then Bailey came out to "Shining Star," moving handily 
through the verse and throwing some promising variations into the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 But things went down from there. "Return To Paradise" fell flat, and Bailey's 
attempt to close the song with lines from Sinatra's "It Was A Very Good Year" 
only made it worse. The upbeat numbers that followed seemed to drag. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, Bailey's best effort came on the standard "A Time For Love," as 
he avoided the falsetto and sang with concentration and conviction. If only 
more of the songs had been treated with such respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey was repeatedly saved by his band, which added excitement missing from 
the vocals. Saxophonist Brandon Fields fired up every tune in which he soloed 
and keyboardist Rob Mullins added strong funk accompaniment and a palette of 
tonal color, often presented in funky fashion. Guitarist Kevin Chokan was often 
missing in action due to the sound mix while bassist Don Patterson and drummer 
Laval Belle, both part of Bailey's regular ensemble, held things together 
admirably. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening act, singer Kevyn Lettau, presented a more professional set. 
Backed only by her percussionist-husband Michael Shapiro and keyboardist Lou 
Pardini, Lettau displayed her sweet-toned, Brazilian-flavored delivery in a 
performance of mostly original material. Pardini also sang, but it was Lettau 
who came away as the evening's best vocalist, upstaging the night's headliner 
before he even came on.

<P>
 Turned Down: The National Endowment for the Arts' advisory body, the National 
Council on the Arts, voted Friday to reject fellowship grant applications from 
three photographers -- Andres Serrano of New York, Barbara DeGenevieve of 
Oakland and Merry Alpern of New York. Serrano's photograph "Piss Christ," which 
appeared in a 1989 exhibition funded by the NEA, touched off a continuing 
firestorm of conflict between the political and religious right and the NEA. 
This new application contained photos of corpses for Serrano's "Morgue" series, 
a series of 36 photographs taken in a morgue, each titled by the way the 
subject died. Serrano's reaction to the decision: "I'm very disappointed. I 
think it's unfortunate that most of the NEA's members aren't committed to 
freedom of expression in the arts. Also, I feel like I've been unofficially 
blacklisted by the NEA." The decision, which cannot be overturned by NEA 
chairwoman Jane Alexander, comes at a time when the House and the Senate are 
debating reducing the NEA budget by 2% or 5%. An NEA spokesman said the NEA had 
no comment on the rejections. TELEVISION

 'Blue' Without Caruso?: David Caruso, who plays the carrot-topped and 
occasionally bare-bottomed detective John Kelly of ABC's "NYPD Blue," is 
quitting the acclaimed TV show because producers have refused his demand for 
$100,000 per episode, the New York Daily News reported Sunday. But sources also 
told the News that Caruso's decision has more to do with movies than money. 
Caruso wants to pursue a career on the big screen -- he has already earned $1 
million as star of the upcoming movie "Kiss of Death." Caruso's "NYPD Blue" 
co-star Dennis Franz, interviewed Sunday on the local New York show "Today in 
New York -- Weekend," said he hadn't heard about Caruso's departure. But the 
newspaper reported that Caruso, who is nominated for an Emmy for his role, 
would leave shortly after the start of the show's second season.

"Pigasso's Place." The new weekly children's series, featuring Pigasso and his 
pal Pookie the wolf, will premiere in September in first-run syndication. The 
educational show set in a magical curio shop combines live action and 
three-dimensional computer animation. The series, distributed by Kushner-Locke,

 Hungarian Honeymoon: Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley-Jackson handed out 
Barbie dolls, toy cars and stuffed animals at two children's hospitals in 
Budapest Saturday in their first public engagement as husband and wife. The 
couple will be in the Hungarian capital until Jackson finishes shooting a video 
promotion for his upcoming album, "History." The shooting began Sunday when 
Jackson, along with hundreds of extras apparently dressed as Red Army troops, 
marched through the streets. (Jackson plays a hero who rescues a generic 
communist state from the Red Army.) Witnesses of Sunday's shoot said Jackson 
led marching troops amid a shower of confetti and the cheers of spectators.

 Cash Withdrawal: Johnny Cash is bowing out of Woodstock '94 because of

MUSIC REVIEW; WILLIAMS FILLS THE BOWL WITH SCORES OF VARIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing is guaranteed, but some names apparently have the ability to fill 
colisea, auditoria, arenas, amphitheaters and smaller halls. Among composers 
with that ability, especially but not exclusively at Hollywood Bowl, are 
Beethoven and John Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, in person, again filled the Bowl Friday and Saturday to its legal 
capacity of 17,979, and certainly seemed to please those happy listeners, at 
least on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? The composer-conductor and his widely admired music for films -- 
written in three and a half enormously successful decades -- have long been 
fixtures at this amphitheater. Furthermore, Williams' catalogue of scores -- 
each with its own personality, but all highly accomplished in the areas of 
melody, evocativeness and technical skill -- offers a genuine variety from 
which to choose. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, those excerpted scores included "The Cowboys," "The Reivers," "Star 
Wars," and a raft of Steven Spielberg-directed films: "Raiders of the Lost 
Ark," "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," "Jurassic Park," "Always," 
"Schindler's List" and "E. T." At the beginning, there was the "Olympic 
Fanfare" from 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 In all this music, the Los Angeles Philharmonic gave Williams its consistent 
alertness and virtuosity. Not all these scores received the virtually 
immaculate playing heard in the "Reivers" music -- wherein veteran actor 
Burgess Meredith read with aplomb the Faulkner narration he originated in the 
1969 film. But mechanical glitches in the orchestra still remained infrequent. 
</P>
<P>
 The sold-out and loudly approving audience on Friday gave the 86-year-old 
Meredith a standing ovation. It later cheered violinist Mark Baranov, 
concertmaster of the weekend, who delivered both of the "Schindler's List" 
solos with poignancy and resplendent tone. Also taking a bow was William Lane, 
who played the important horn solo in the "Always" excerpt.

POP; BOZ SCAGGS: ROCK TAKES A SNOOZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boz Scaggs, who enjoyed his greatest commercial success in the mid-'70s with 
his eclectic mixture of pop, blues, R&B and rock, is trying another comeback. 
His latest album, "Some Change," has been a slow seller, needing strong live 
shows to boost sales. 
</P>
<P>
 His performance Saturday at the sold-out House of Blues was the start of 
Scaggs' first U.S. tour in 14 years, but it was a real snoozer -- tepid 
rocking-chair rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Scaggs' voice has lost some of its edge and power, but that's to be expected. 
What wasn't expected was Scaggs' mellow manner. Though never a great performer, 
he at least used to deliver a fairly rousing show. For most of Saturday's set, 
however, he and his accompanists -- a six-piece band and two female backup 
singers -- were far too laid back. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is his new material, which mostly lacks punch. For it to click 
live, the music needs a high-energy presentation -- pounding percussion and 
thunderous lead-guitar work. For some reason, though, Scaggs chose the mellow 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the time the crowd seemed to tune him out. Sometimes the din from the 
chattering customers was so loud you could hardly hear the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Scaggs did finish on a high note, flashing some muscle on a few oldies, 
showing he hasn't forgotten how to rock 'n' roll. But wading though a lot of 
dull songs to get to a few choice ones hardly seemed worth the effort. DENNIS

DANCE; CLASH OF STYLES ON STAGE AT 'KALEIDOSCOPE '94' FINALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Elephanta Island, not far from Bombay, India, you can see a monumental 
cave-sculpture of the Hindu god Shiva. Divided vertically, the figure is 
half-male, half-female, symbolizing the fusion of opposites in something like 
the perfect marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Dancing side by side, arms tightly around one another's waists, Ramaa and 
Swetha-Lakshmi Bharadvaj brought this classic vision to the stage of the John 
Anson Ford Amphitheatre on Saturday as part of the final program in the annual 
"Dance Kaleidoscope" series. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-choreographed by Ramaa Bharadvaj and Uma Suresh, their remarkable 
"Ardhanariswara" duet incorporated dramatic gesture and percussive footwork in 
South Indian Bharata Natyam style -- conditioned by the need to move gracefully 
as one, to achieve the artistic fusion that can take dance metaphor into the 
realm of the spiritual. 
</P>
<P>
 Their success crowned a curious world dance potpourri marked by other 
prominent dualities: clashing dualities, however, in nearly every other 
instance. Consider the two Filipino American and two Mexican American companies 
on the bill: 
</P>
<P>
 In an uncredited, passably executed Maranaw suite that could have been titled 
"The Dance of the Thousand Sequins," Kultura Philippine Folk Arts trivialized a 
great culture by emphasizing glitz and empty display. But Kayamanan Ng Lahi -- 
Philippine Performing Arts honored that same culture with artful Igorot folk 
dances anchored in daily work activities and human relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 The same musicians participated in each, but switched off the amplification 
for the latter so that their gongs reverberated sweetly in the warm night air 
and an Igorot song drifted magically down from the hillside as 11 women 
descended to the stage balancing large baskets on their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 The dignity of those women remained unshakable even when the volatile, 
flamboyant males swirled around them during the final moments of Ramon Obusan's 
four-part suite -- giving the outsider some sense of the values of these people 
quite apart from the entertainment value of their performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with tubby, canned accompaniment blasting from the loudspeakers, Ballet 
Folklorico del Sur de California sustained a mood of easygoing tropical 
conviviality during Deanna Venegas' selection of dances from the Mexican state 
of Campeche. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the unison footwork in the final "Los Almudes" section (with a dozen 
dancers atop small wooden boxes) displayed a level of technical prowess that 
Ballet Folklorico del Pacifico couldn't match in its adaptation of a Mayan 
dance drama originally choreographed by Amalia Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like Kultura in its Maranaw suite, Jose Vences and Adriana Astorga-Gainey 
aimed for a kind of mythic grandeur in their budget knockoff of Hernandez's 
showpiece, but the result looked cheap and fake despite the best efforts of a 
large, hard-working cast. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Presenting an entirely different selection of music and dance from Hawaii and 
Tahiti than was listed in the "Dance Kaleidoscope" program booklet, the large, 
aggressive Keali'i O Nalani company stripped Polynesian performance to basic 
moves and rhythms: folk dance without any taint of folklore left in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides launching a drill-team hula and a military-parade ote'a (both 
projected with excellent technique and relentless painted smiles), director 
Keali'i Ceballos offered the audience such explanatory insights as, "We close 
with our finale."  
</P>
<P>
 And not a moment too soon. Keali'i O Nalani, Kultura and Ballet Folklorico del 
Pacifico all aim to showcase traditional cultures in the glossy, 
professionalized and sometimes soulless styles of the official national touring 
ensembles that turn up semiannually in our culture palaces. 
</P>
<P>
 They ask nothing from the audience, retail plenty of exotic local color along 
with the dancers' energy and physical beauty. But the danger is their 
capitulation to contemporary show-biz values. Broadway pizazz. Hollywood 
spectacle. MTV flash. The best concert dance always goes deeper than this. Why 
not the best concert folk or world dance? 
</P>
<P>
 Equally modern in its values, Sen-Hea Ha's meditative "Cho-Sin" managed to 
look back at Korean shamanistic traditions and fashion an homage to them 
without belittling the source. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe there were too many changes of musical context, too much reliance on 
fan-and-flag effects. But, danced with refinement and concentration, the solo 
forged an imaginative connection between the world that Sen-Hea Ha now inhabits 
and a world in which dance can be a bridge between spheres of existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Liliana de Leon also invoked dance transcendence when holding a man's hat as 
if it were a living partner in her uneven flamenco "Garrotin." But only Sen-Hea 
Ha made it indispensable, insisting on it, glorying in it, when so many others 
on the program had rigorously weeded it out.

MUSIC REVIEW; VAN DRIEL: BLOWN AWAY BY CRYSTAL CATHEDRAL ORGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Crystal Cathedral's Hazel Wright organ -- with 16,412 pipes and 268 ranks, 
the second largest fully functional organ in existence -- dangles the promise 
of Gargantuan power to those who dare. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night, Dutch organist Jan Pieter van Driel seized the opportunity to 
unleash the instrument's sonic potential with no apparent thought about whether 
his experiments suited the style or historic period of the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Works from the late Renaissance through pre-Classical eras astonished through 
the same inventive use of multi-antiphonal registration as large-scale, 
romantic pieces. Never mind that technology of the earlier periods would not 
have permitted such couplings and that therefore the results could hardly have 
approximated anything the composers might have had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, while relishing the myriad choices before him, Van Driel offered plenty 
of careful delineation of voicing and phrasing in a varied program comprised 
largely of music that is rarely -- if ever -- heard here. Sweelinck's Toccata 
No. 16, Flemish composer and organist Abraham van den Kerckhoven's 
"Cornetfantasie" in D minor and the Fourth Sonata by C.P.E. Bach all emerged as 
dialogues between the great organ in front and the balcony organ behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Of these, the "Cornetfantasie," for which Van Driel read a copy of the 
original manuscript, shone as a little-known example of early Baroque style, 
its florid cornet solo soaring over a less obtrusive polyphonic accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as in much of his playing on this occasion, the continuity of the 
composition suffered interruptions by frequently fluctuating tempos and 
rhythmic inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Driel's real bent seemed toward more grandiose Romantic and 20th-Century 
works, particularly those of his mentor, the late Flor Peeters. The Belgian 
organist's difficult "Veni Creator" Variations impressed by sheer harmonic and 
registrational dimensions. His far-from-tranquil chorale, "Now Rest Beneath Thy 
Shadow" -- which was played at the composer's funeral in 1986 -- served as the 
final encore, following a massive Toccata by Jan Nieland.

JAZZ REVIEWS; SINGERS WARM TO SPOTLIGHT AT JAZZ FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Improvisation may be at the heart of jazz, but the blues is in its soul -- a 
fact convincingly demonstrated Saturday night in the opening session of the 
two-day Pasadena Jazz Festival at the Ambassador Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisely, the program did not cast its net too far in the direction of pure 
blues, sticking instead with acts -- Jeannie and Jimmy Cheatham, Hank Crawford, 
Jimmy Smith and Marlena Shaw -- whose music is both blues-based and 
jazz-expansive. 
</P>
<P>
 Headliner Smith's organ style has become so classic, and its foot-tapping, 
rhythmic drive so familiar, that he changes it only in the smallest increments 
-- an extended run here, a double-time riff there. But this was not one of his 
better outings. 
</P>
<P>
 The late-starting program delayed Smith's arrival until nearly 11 p.m., and he 
was clearly unhappy with recurring technical problems. After playing a few 
tunes that confirmed his continuing mastery of the style, and providing 
powerful support for Shaw's vocals, he closed with a repetitious sequence of 
groove-tinged hits. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, it was the singers who actually commanded much of the 
evening. Jeannie Cheatham picked some choice items: "In the Dark," "Ain't 
Nobody's Business" and Percy Mayfield's plaintive "Please Send Me Someone to 
Love." She sang them with a sound that alternately was darkly insinuating and 
brashly declamatory, a superb example of how a gifted performer can tap into 
the enduring life of the blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw's more extroverted approach was no less compelling. At her best, as she 
was on "Is You Is, or Is You Ain't," she combined the soaring sensuality of 
Sarah Vaughan with the precisely articulated swing of Carmen McRae. 
</P>
<P>
 The horn players also had their moments. Crawford's highly dramatic alto 
saxophone, the foundation for many young contemporary horn men, was not in peak 
form, his soloing dimmed, perhaps, by the need to fit into the well-integrated 
sound of the Cheathams' Sweet Baby Blues Band. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenor saxophonists Rickey Woodard and Herman Riley (sidemen with, 
respectively, Cheatham and Smith) more than filled in the gaps, however, in a 
series of brash, hard-driving choruses. And on "Ain't Nobody's Business," 
Woodard added a brilliant clarinet solo resonating with echoes of Barney Bigard 
-- a perfect illustration of the undying love affair between jazz and the 
blues. DON HECKMAN

JAZZ REVIEWS; HERSCH'S ARTISTRY SHINES THROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fred Hersch owns that rare artistic commodity: a unique creative style. The 
pianist's personal jazz stance was displayed on Friday at the Jazz Bakery, 
where he performed with bassist Drew Gress and drummer Tom Rainey.His 
distinctive touch made his notes sound like gentle bells -- or like walls 
shaking from a gust of wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the Things You Are" began with an unaccompanied piano intro that mimicked 
a baroque classical piece; the usually somber ballad "You Don't Know What Love 
Is" was taken at a snappy medium up-tempo, and "As Long as There's Music" came 
outfitted with a loping, rumba-ish beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersch, long called a man who works in the substantial afterglow of the great 
Bill Evans, is anything but a clone. His solos were uncommon: a pleasing 
amalgam of brief fragments that seemed bitten off, sweeping melodies that 
curved majestically and choppy, chattering block chords. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-based trio's take on group interplay was also personal, as Gress 
and Rainey alternated between accompanying Hersch and offering ideas that made 
the unit seem to be involved in a serious but fun give-and-take discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately receiving a lot of attention from his recent disclosure that he is both 
gay and HIV-positive (albeit AIDS asymptomatic), now is the time for Hersch to 
get some recognition for his artistry. ZAN STEWART

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; PROCLAIMERS: POWER OF POSITIVE THINKING

<TEXT>
<P>
 It must take a lot to discourage Craig and Charlie Reid, the Scottish twins 
who bill themselves as the Proclaimers. 
</P>
<P>
 Their celebrity from last year's surprise "Benny & Joon"-fueled hit of "I'm 
Gonna Be (500 Miles)" has already evaporated and their show Friday was 
downsized from the 2,200-seat Wiltern Theatre, where it had been originally 
scheduled, to the 500-capacity Troubadour. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Reids -- whose songs are deep testimonials to hard-earned spiritual 
and romantic faith -- didn't seem the least bit downhearted. 
</P>
<P>
 With a core of vociferously loyal fans cheering them on, the bespectacled pair 
and a four-piece band reveled in the spirited scene, delivering a 
hard-to-resist set of songs marked by both soaring hearts and melodies powered 
by a devotion to Elvis Presley. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs were presented with a cheerful determination that marks the power of 
positive thinking, Proclaimers style. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheerfulness also helped elevate the opening set of the Greenberry Woods above 
the Baltimore quartet's obvious Beatles-Cheap Trick reference points. But it 
wasn't quite enough to give the well-intentioned young group an original spin 
on an old, oft-recycled sound. STEVE HOCHMAN

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; AFRICA FETE, KASSAV FIND DIVERSE GROOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Africa Fete '94, headlined by Kassav before a full House of Blues on Friday, 
naturally glorified the groove, but to leave it at that would sell the artists 
and the creative breadth of African music short. 
</P>
<P>
 Kassav's 90-minute set celebrated the sparkling zouk sound that heavily 
influenced Caribbean and African music for the past decade, but it was 
Angelique Kidjo's cosmopolitan, contemporary mix that may win over new fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Kassav started as a studio band, so the 14-piece ensemble displayed stellar 
musicianship and sophisticated arrangements. The flashy, staccato lines of an 
extremely tight five-piece horn section provided a perfect contrast to the 
smooth zouk rhythm and the vocals of Jocelyne Beroard, Patrick Saint Eloi and 
guitarist Jacob Desvarieux. 
</P>
<P>
 There were times when Kassav risked losing momentum with explanations of the 
songs, but invariably the group found a mid-tempo, long-distance groove that 
sounded like it could roll on for . . . oh, seven hours or so, without getting 
boring. 
</P>
<P>
 Kassav's smoothness and sweeping sound also offer a vivid contrast to the 
kinetic stage presence and funky, African-Parisian dance floor blend of the 
Benin-born Kidjo, who was reviewed here recently.  
</P>
<P>
 The local debut of Ziskakan from Isle Reunion had its moments, particularly 
when the music emphasized the near-drones created by Harry Perrigonne, seated 
astride the large rouler drum. But aside from some flute-like synthesizer 
melodies, the electric instruments sounded added on rather than fully absorbed, 
and Ziskakan's sound generally was too atmospheric for a club environment. DON

SEASONAL LIFEGUARDS SEEK UNION; EMPLOYMENT: THE GROUP PLANS TO PETITION 
HUNTINGTON BEACH FOR RECOGNITION. THEY SAY WAGES, BENEFITS AND PUBLIC SAFETY 
ARE THE KEY ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Surf City's 100 seasonal lifeguards are organizing and plan to petition the 
city today for formal recognition of their labor union. 
</P>
<P>
 The part-time lifeguards, who work without benefits and for lower pay than the 
city's 12 full-time, year-round lifeguards, are organizing to improve their lot 
and that of the public, said several of the lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Ferry, a high school teacher who has been a part-time lifeguard since 
1987, said more than 70% of the seasonal marine safety personnel favor union 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to do now is as quickly as possible get recognized by the city," 
said Ferry, 25. "It would be in everybody's best interest to recognize us as a 
union so we can . . . negotiate (better) wages and working conditions and have 
representation." 
</P>
<P>
 The seasonal lifeguards say they are essential for the city to have safe 
beaches and deserve to be treated like employees, not contract workers. In 
addition to seeking benefits and better pay, the guards are upset this year 
that the city is enforcing a 1,000-hour limit on part-timers' work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now they're not even recognized as employees by the city. . . . And 
that is wrong," said Richard J. Silber, the attorney representing the seasonal 
lifeguards. "There is no personnel policy that governs wages, hours and 
employment conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Graham, 40, who has 14 years' experience in the lifesaving profession, 
thinks "the city of Huntington Beach is not treating us fairly." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham, a Seal Beach resident, said lifeguards are organizing primarily 
because of their concern for public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to protect the public. We need (experienced) lifeguards on the 
beach to protect the people," Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Administrator Richard Barnard said the city's legal department is 
examining the lifeguards' concerns and is trying to determine if it can satisfy 
them. He said it is an open issue whether the part-time employees can form a 
union. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in the hands of our attorney's office to decide legally what we can or 
cannot do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has kept the beach guard positions temporary, he said, because it 
needs the lifeguards only five months of the year and having seasonal employees 
saves money and allows the city more flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Seasonal lifeguards are paid from $10.47 to $14.44 an hour, depending on their 
experience and work assignment, and have had no pay raise since 1989, said Ron 
Hagen, director of community services. The full-timers' pay ranges from $18.61 
to $23.05 an hour, and they receive a benefit package including vacation, sick 
leave, health insurance and a pension, according to Lt. Steve Seim, a lifeguard 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifeguard Brad Smith, 24, of Santa Monica said that unionizing would be one 
way to end these inequities. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have lifeguards that are very appreciative of the job they have and they 
are respectful of their jobs," said Smith, a UCLA political science student who 
has been a lifeguard for seven years. "But the problem is sometimes we feel 
neglected." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the seasonal lifeguards are 17 to 29 years old. And they are a varied 
lot: Some are also doctors, teachers, attorneys and college students, all of 
whom choose to work on the beach for the love and enjoyment that comes with 
being a lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real nice feeling to help people. It's a very important job," Graham 
said. "You enjoy working with the public. It's a real satisfaction when you 
pull someone from the water and you know they could have died." 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, a part-time lifeguard works a 40-hour week, Ferry said. Most are 
employed during spring break and from June to mid-September, with some also 
working during the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 A key issue for the part-time lifeguards is the city's limiting their work to 
1,000 hours a year. The city began enforcing the rule last November because it 
wanted to be sure the part-timers did not become eligible, under state law, for 
benefits offered city employees who work more than 1,000 hours annually, Seim 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham and co-worker John Beebe this summer filed a grievance with the city 
because of the denial of employment rights and benefits when they were laid off 
after reaching 1,000 work hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "They refuse to give me the rights and benefits of a full-time employee even 
though I work full time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, Graham said, he has worked more than 1,000 hours in a fiscal year. 
In 1992-93, he put in 2,098 hours, Graham said, adding that nine other seasonal 
lifeguards also worked more than 1,000 hours a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham said he filed the grievance because "you just have to stand up for what 
you believe in." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferry described how his interest in organizing a union arose out of problems 
he had this summer in being compensated when he injured his knee at work. He 
said the city was reluctant to pay for his medical expenses and disability 
costs. Eventually, the city decided he had a legitimate claim, but the 
experience soured him on the employment arrangement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said a union is the lifeguards' only way to have a say over their job 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, if you were unhappy as a lifeguard you would talk to an immediate 
supervisor or lieutenant and that's as far as it went. Being organized, you 
have your own rank and file," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ferry also said a union will protect seasonal workers' rights and ensure that 
they are treated equally in terms of pay and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past the city has been able to make up its own rules in regards to 
wages and working conditions," Ferry said. "The reason we're coming together as 
a union is to have a say in those arbitrary decisions they make about us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a union, we have no bargaining power, and in these times with the 
cutbacks we are going to protect ourselves by having an organized voice and 
bargaining unit."

INCURABLE FUNGUS ATTACKING HISTORIC PALMS; LANDSCAPE: FUSARIUM WILT IS KILLING 
ABOUT 40 TREES THAT HAVE LINED CAPISTRANO BEACH STREETS SINCE 1920S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN and LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An incurable and fatal fungus is ravaging a group of historic date palms in 
Capistrano Beach and is turning once stately green fronds atop the trees into 
brown skeletons. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 of the 250 palms, planted in the 1920s when the Doheny family 
developed the area, have been hit with the fungus known as fusarium wilt, 
according to Rick Still, parks superintendent for the city of Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadly disease is usually passed on when pruning equipment is not properly 
sterilized, Still said. He said that pruning equipment can be sterilized by 
soaking it for five minutes in a 2.5% solution of hypochlorite. He said chain 
saws should not be used for trimming because they cannot be sterilized. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly when the fungus was spread is unclear, but some residents said they 
believe the city, which contracts with trimmers to groom the palms, is to 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a homeowner, I'm upset," said Mike Major, an arborist and landscape 
contractor. "I feel that the city is responsible and they need to correct the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The city first became aware of trouble in March. The trees, on a city 
right-of-way, are among those that line Avenida las Palmas and Calle Fortuna. 
</P>
<P>
 The city took over responsibility for maintenance of the trees last year after 
the Capistrano Bay Parks and Recreation District was consolidated with the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Still said it's hard to tell if the 40 dying palms were all infected about the 
same time, but he suggested that varying conditions of the diseased trees means 
they were infected at different times. 
</P>
<P>
 Still said that some homeowners had hired their own tree trimmers in the past, 
and city-contracted crews most recently trimmed a batch of palms last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have followed all the guidelines to keep from spreading the fungus," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The infected trees are as good as gone, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Donselman, a former palm specialist for the state of Florida who now has 
a consulting business in San Diego County, said fusarium wilt is almost always 
fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's a very slow progression, but it can't be reversed," Donselman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donselman said the fungus, which has been limited to California so far, could 
incubate in a tree for six months to two years before symptoms show. 
</P>
<P>
 Doris Conroy, who lives in the neighborhood, said Friday that she was unaware 
of the fungus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame," she said, peering at the tree. "It's pretty sad looking." 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Duzich, a city code enforcement officer, said she was also saddened. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're sick," Duzich said. "They're really sick, and there's no cure for 
them. It breaks my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to send letters soon to neighborhood residents, warning them of 
the fungus and how to prevent its spread to other trees, Still said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to remove the trees and replace them will also be studied, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Major estimated it would cost between $5,000 and $6,000 to remove and replace 
each of the 20- to 25-foot-tall palms, which originate in the Canary Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Muir, former director of the Capistrano Bay Parks and Recreation 
Department, said he hopes that the city will change its trimming schedule to 
allow the palms more growth on top. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir, who is also the director of the International Palm Society, said the 
palms should only be pruned for their health, not aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is, they shouldn't trim any green sections," he said.

TOPS IN HIS FIELD; IN UNENDING PROCESS, WORKER'S EFFORTS HELP PRODUCE YEARLY 
BOUNTY OF BERRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Summer means vacation for most families, but for Ezekiel Contreras it signals 
the beginning of an annual ritual -- mowing and digging up acres of strawberry 
plants after they have stopped giving fruit, then readying the soil for the 
coming season's crop. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras, 34, has worked year-round in the same strawberry field, wedged 
between the confluence of the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways, for the past 
eight years. He is among many hands employed by Hiroshi Fujishige, a long-time 
Orange County farmer. 
</P>
<P>
 A Santa Ana resident and father of four young children, Contreras said his 
family's livelihood depends on the 100-acre field. It lies in the shadow of an 
encroaching highway overpass, which has already claimed several acres of 
farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving an antiquated International Harvester tractor that chugs along mostly 
in second gear, the cheerful Contreras recently drove back and forth across the 
bumpy field, sometimes forward and other times in reverse, mowing two rows of 
depleted strawberry plants at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 The native of Guerrero, Mexico, seemed oblivious to the monotonous hum of 
speeding cars and occasional roar overhead of FA-18 Hornet jets, practicing 
touch-and-go landings at nearby El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "After eight years of working this field, I am able to see the cars and jets 
without hearing them," he said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras' workday had started at 6:30 a.m., when he prepared the old tractor 
by first attaching a rear mower and then hand-cranking the engine to start it. 
After a hot and dusty day in the field, he leaves for home about 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Contreras got the tractor's engine going, 50 or so workers were 
already stooped over the low-growing plants, picking the third and last 
strawberry crop of the season. From a distance, the workers' bent backs 
reflected colorful dots, scattered over a lush, green landscape like a Christo 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I start mowing today. Come back a week from now and you'll see a dirt field. 
You'd never know that there were strawberry plants growing here at one time," 
Contreras said on a recent morning. 
</P>
<P>
 He mowed behind the pickers, shredding hundreds of plants that had yielded 
baskets of fruit to nimble fingers the day before. Row after row of plants 
disappeared under the mower, exposing sheets of clear plastic that had been 
stretched underneath to keep insects and weeds away and moisture in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Days later, after the mowing was finished, Contreras ran four discs across the 
length of the rows, which were about four feet wide and one foot high. The 
shiny metal discs cut straight lines, which make it easy for workers to pull 
the plastic up in narrow strips. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Contreras plowed what remained of the plants back into the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like working outdoors. I used to work on a farm when I lived in Mexico, but 
farm work is so much easier here. It was backbreaking in Mexico," said 
Contreras. "I earn enough money here to make a decent life for my family, and 
hopefully to give my children an opportunity to get better jobs when they grow 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 After plowing the field, Contreras and the other workers waste no time in 
beginning another annual ritual by preparing the soil for next year's 
strawberry crop, which will be planted in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers add carefully measured amounts of a nutrient-rich humus material 
to the soil. They also add gypsum to neutralize the soil's salinity. It is a 
time-consuming process without any shortcuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to prepare the soil properly in August and September can lead to a 
poor crop, both in quality and quantity, when the first strawberries are ready 
for harvesting in late December or early January. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can also pick strawberries in February and March, but the peak of the 
season is really April and May. Come back in May and you'll find 150 people 
working this field," Contreras said. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual ritual of planting, picking, mowing, plowing and replanting 
prompted a visitor to comment on the Beatles' song "Strawberry Fields Forever." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I've ever heard of the Beatles," Contreras said. "Why would 
they sing a song about strawberries," he asked, with an apologetic smile and 
shake of his head. 
</P>
<P>
 The swath cut through the plants by Contreras' tractor seemed to offer its own 
message about the permanence of strawberry fields.

MAN ADDS DETAILS TO SIMPSON CASE; INVESTIGATION: BRENTWOOD ICE CREAM PARLOR 
MANAGER SAYS NICOLE, HER CHILDREN AND A MAN VISITED HIS SHOP THE NIGHT SHE 
DIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Adding details of the last hours of Nicole Brown Simpson's life, the manager 
of a Brentwood ice cream shop said Sunday that the ex-wife of O.J. Simpson had 
stopped in with her children and a young man for a snack sometime on the 
evening of June 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The observations of the store manager apparently have drawn intense interest 
from the Simpson defense team. Bill Chang, 21, who runs the Ben & Jerry's ice 
cream parlor, said investigators hired by the defense interviewed him four 
times last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman, with slashed throats and 
numerous stab wounds, were discovered outside her nearby Brentwood condominium 
hours after the visit to the ice cream parlor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chang said the man with Nicole Simpson in the shop did not resemble news 
photos he had seen of Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop closes at 11 p.m. Sundays, Chang said. "I really don't recall what 
time they were in here. It was a busy night. I didn't have time to look at my 
watch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson team, which was particularly interested in the time of the visit, 
apparently located Chang through an ice cream cup found at the murder scene. 
Neither police nor district attorney's investigators have interviewed him, 
Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the murder charges and is scheduled to go on 
trial Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them what I knew, but I didn't think it would help them," Chang said, 
referring to the questioning by defense investigators. "I served her ice cream 
and that was about it. Whatever happened after that I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Shapiro, Simpson's lead attorney, could not be reached for comment 
Sunday. A police spokesman and the district attorney's office declined to 
comment on Chang's statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have said the two were killed between 10:15 p.m. and 11 p.m. June 
12. By 11 p.m., O.J. Simpson was on his way to the airport for a flight to 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 His defense team has sought to show the killings occurred too late for him to 
have committed them. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night of her death, Nicole Simpson dined with family members at the 
Mezzaluna restaurant, directly across the street from Ben & Jerry's. Goldman, 
who was working as a waiter at Mezzaluna the night he was killed, volunteered 
to take to Nicole Simpson's condominium a pair of glasses left at the 
restaurant by someone in her group.

A WARM SEND-OFF; RETIREMENT: ICE PLANT EMPLOYEE DON MOORE HANGS UP HIS PARKA 
AFTER 50 CHILLY YEARS ON THE JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The iceman goeth. 
</P>
<P>
 But after his 50 years on the job, Don Moore's bosses at the Union Ice Co. in 
Commerce wouldn't let him go far after he retired the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd started as an ice delivery boy driving a Model-A truck and worked his way 
up to being the man in charge of keeping the plant's 27 huge refrigeration 
compressors pumping zero-degree temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 So as Moore hung up his parka and walked from the plant Friday afternoon, 
officials ran after him -- to ask if he could stay and fix the office air 
conditioner that suddenly conked out in the 100-degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
 No sweat, said Moore, 66, of Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a fitting finale for a man who thought nothing about slipping into 
insulated overalls and crawling into giant freezer machines to break up ice 
jams. Or racing to the ice plant in his pajamas in the middle of the night and 
climbing on the roof with a hose to keep a nearby fire from spreading to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't feel like I've spent 50 years here," Moore said. "In some ways it 
feels more like 100." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it was a different era in 1944 when Moore hitched a ride on an ice 
truck -- and on a lark filled out a job application at Union Ice's Redlands 
plant. The plant manager picked up Moore the next day at his home in Yucaipa 
and said, "Let's go to work." 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd carry 300 pounds of ice in a 1929 Ford and put 25 or 50 pounds on ice 
carts and take them up to houses," Moore recalled. "People would leave money or 
coupons for us. In many cases we had keys to peoples' homes. A lot of times 
they didn't even lock the door." 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, home refrigerators were available and the wooden ice box 
disappeared. In time, ice companies branched out into the cold-storage 
warehouse business to handle supermarkets' frozen food supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ice plant remained a cool place to work, according to Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Along with making ice for such places as the Rose Bowl and Dodger Stadium, 
Moore and his co-workers provided "snow" for outdoor winter events around Los 
Angeles. And they often froze objects in ice for local movie-makers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've put fish, car batteries, motor oil, shoes, money, you name it, inside 
300-pound blocks. We actually froze a car for a commercial. We sprayed water on 
it and encased it. Its engine started right up: it was insulated like an igloo 
inside there." 
</P>
<P>
 Summertime always meant increased demand for 50-pound bags of party ice. And 
that meant that Moore rarely got a vacation. In fact, he had 690 hours of 
unused vacation time on the books when he retired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never wanted to take vacation in the winter. I didn't want to go skiing 
because I never liked the snow. I was born in the Midwest and I'd had my fill 
of cold," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Working in the cold became second nature, however. He didn't even notice the 
chill of a 40-degree ice-bagging room, where he spent part of his last day on 
the job working in shirt-sleeves. "By now, I've got ice water in my veins," he 
joked.  
</P>
<P>
 But Moore admitted he never turns on the car air conditioner unless his wife, 
Katie, is with him. "I like warm weather better than cold," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During his Union Ice career, the firm changed hands three times and he worked 
for seven company presidents. Rich Burke, the current president, said Moore has 
agreed to sign on as a consultant to help keep the ice plant machinery -- some 
dating to the 1930s -- running. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, ice plant co-workers staged a farewell party for Moore. They 
said picking his retirement gift was easy. 
</P>
<P>
 They're sending the iceman on a vacation to sunny and warm Hawaii.

PLAN TO DREDGE MARINA DEL REY SILT PROPOSED; ENVIRONMENT: OPPONENTS FEAR THAT 
REMOVING CONTAMINATED SEDIMENT MAY THREATEN THE WATERWAY. THE STATE COASTAL 
COMMISSION WILL CONSIDER THE PLAN TUESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned that silting at the mouth of Marina del Rey could choke off boating, 
Los Angeles County officials propose to haul tons of contaminated silt and sand 
to the Port of Los Angeles to use as fill for a new marine wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to remove 530,000 cubic 
yards of sediment containing lead and other harmful materials, place it in 
special plastic tubes and bury the tubes in a shallow area of the harbor at San 
Pedro as part of the port's expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents warn that the dredging could cause environmentally damaging 
materials to spread at the mouth of the marina. They also say the containers, 
which have never been approved for such a project in California, may leak once 
they are placed in the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an old problem that's come back to haunt us," said Roger Gorke, 
science and policy analyst with Heal the Bay, an environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission, whose staff has recommended that the plan 
be rejected, is scheduled to hear the matter Tuesday, when it meets in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have already closed 40% of the marina's north and south entrances 
to boating. They warn that unless the sediment is removed, runoff from heavy 
winter rains could choke off the marina entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 The sediment is largely the result of runoff from nearby Ballona Creek, which 
drains a 126-square-mile area from Downtown Los Angeles to the Pacific Ocean 
and picks up contaminants along the way. In places, sand, silt and dirt lie 
barely beneath the waves, making it tricky for pleasure boats to negotiate the 
entrances. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being used for pleasure boating, the county-owned marina is the 
headquarters of a Coast Guard air-sea rescue unit whose proximity to Los 
Angeles International Airport is considered vital in case of a plane crash at 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying it has no other affordable way to dispose of the sediment, the county 
Department of Beaches and Harbors, which governs the marina, has pushed for its 
disposal at the port, even though port officials have said they do not want it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we're about as welcome as the kid who goes to kindergarten with 
chickenpox," said James A. Fawcett, the department's chief of planning. "The 
fact is, we don't have an alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 In recommending against the plan, Coastal Commission staff members expressed 
concerns about the removal, transport and placement of the sediment. They 
criticized the Corps of Engineers and county officials for dragging their feet 
since 1992 in solving the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials and the Corps want the coastal panel to expedite approval so 
that the dredging can take place before the federal fiscal year ends Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, county officials say, $1.7 million allocated to the Corps for 
dredging the marina cannot be spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Port officials, meanwhile, want no part of the plan for fear that accepting 
the sediment will trigger a new round of regulatory hurdles just when they are 
finally ready to go forward with a planned $150-million expansion after years 
of planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The port project includes deepening shipping lanes and building a new pier. It 
will involve dredging 23 million cubic yards of sediment -- including 800,000 
cubic yards of lightly contaminated material that state and federal officials 
are allowing the port to dump in the planned 20-acre marine wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 The state required that the wildlife habitat be created to mitigate the 
environmental effects of the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwayne Lee, the port's deputy executive director for development, said that 
while port officials sympathize with the marina's problem, they cannot afford 
to jeopardize the port's expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 One source said port officials would have told the county and the Corps "to go 
fly a kite a long time ago" had it not been for the personal intervention of 
County Supervisor Deane Dana and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who have 
encouraged cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is not new for the marina, where the Corps has had to dredge 
frequently to keep the entrances open since the giant pleasure boat harbor was 
built in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has become more severe in recent years as federal rules -- which once 
allowed lightly contaminated materials to be dumped on beaches for separation 
and removal -- have become more stringent. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the Corps sought permission to dump the sediment into the ocean five 
miles off the Palos Verdes Peninsula, but the federal Environmental Protection 
Agency refused, saying the material was unsuitable for ocean disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the Coastal Commission reluctantly allowed the Corps to use 
huge dredges to flatten the bottom of the marina channel in a procedure known 
as a "knockdown" after county officials warned that the marina was about to be 
choked off. 
</P>
<P>
 In giving its approval, however, the state panel urged the Corps and the 
county to find a permanent solution, and warned that it was unlikely to approve 
another interim solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the county and the Corps say they have explored numerous 
alternatives to no avail.

STREET SMART / RICHARD SIMON: IN A WORLD OF ADVERTISING VEHICLES, THESE 
BILLBOARDS PICK UP RIDERS

 The MTA spends $12 million a year to take pictures and messages off its buses. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA collects $5 million a year to put pictures and messages on its buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Confused? Remember, this is, after all, the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The transit agency, long engaged in a costly struggle to wipe out graffiti, 
has during the past year turned 10 of its buses into rolling bus-length murals. 
</P>
<P>
 The buses' exteriors have been covered almost entirely with advertising that 
wraps over even the side windows; passengers can see through the material. 
</P>
<P>
 One eye-catching ad -- stretching from headlight to taillight -- depicts a 
flying bus from "Speed," a movie about a Santa Monica bus wired with dynamite 
by an extortionist so that it will explode if it slows to less than 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 In another ad, a picture of a jumbo jet flying through the air extends along 
the entire side of the 40-foot bus. 
</P>
<P>
 And a Dodgers ad features Orel Hershiser delivering a pitch while Mike Piazza 
swings a bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the ads on wheels provide an artful break from a tedious urban 
landscape. Advertisers say they are the perfect vehicle, so to speak, to reach 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, where the Orange County Transit District has sold bus-wide 
advertising space for years, one bus is covered entirely on one side with a Big 
Mac and on the other side with an Egg McMuffin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like getting into this giant Egg McMuffin," said Brian LaBadie, whose 
firm, SuperGraphics, produces the computer-generated ads. "It's very 
appetite-stimulating." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet one man's art is another's graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the murals are just more visual pollution in a city that already 
suffers from too much sign clutter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Wu, an activist with Los Angeles Beautiful Inc., issued a "blight alert," 
objecting to the "legalized graffiti" and calling it "demeaning to the bus 
riders who are forced to ride in roving billboards." 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop this experiment," Richard Seeley of La Crescenta appealed to MTA. "Or 
the next step will undoubtedly be to drape our public buildings with signs and 
banners trumpeting the advantages of using Pampers or Preparation H." 
</P>
<P>
 Adman LaBadie defended the ads, saying they "provide something unique in the 
day-to-day traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 Just what L.A. drivers need -- another distraction. Isn't it enough that 
motorists here jabber away on cellular phones, apply makeup or brush their 
teeth driving 50 m.p.h.? 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA makes $20,000 a year from the bus murals -- $2,000 a year on 10 buses. 
The rest of the $5 million in bus advertising that the agency takes in annually 
comes from traditional messages slapped on the sides and backs of the MTA's 
1,900 buses. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no commercial advertising yet on the Blue Line trolley or Red Line 
subway because of the low ridership; MTA officials believe that the rail lines 
eventually will become popular advertising venues. In New York City, 
advertising agencies like the subways because riders -- who never like being 
seen looking at each other -- spend a lot of time looking at the ads. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the wittiest, and occasionally the most controversial, are found on 
the back of blue Santa Monica city buses, spouting pithy wisdom from Santa 
Monica Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent entry: "Loans. No sniveling, groveling or bootlicking required." 
</P>
<P>
 Others have included: "Experts on the Reproductive Habits of the North 
American Greenback," "To Get to College Your Kids Need A's, B's and CD's," and 
"Old and Wrinkled Is Beautiful. Especially in Large Denominations." 
</P>
<P>
 There was also one that angered some feminists: "Girls Just Wanna Have Funds." 
</P>
<P>
 "The slogans go a long way toward dispelling the notion that bankers are 
uptight . . . hopefully, they humanize banking somewhat," said Pat Robertson, 
vice president/account supervisor of Team One Advertising, which produces the 
Santa Monica Bank ads. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank plans to issue a book on the bus cards, featuring a chapter on lines 
that were never used, such as: "Congratulations on Your Settlement, Ivana 
Trump. We Open at 10:00." 
</P>
<P>
 So well-known are the ads that the producers of "Speed" included them in the 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials shrug off criticism of the bus mural ads, saying they bring in 
money to the cash-strapped agency. 
</P>
<P>
 An MTA spokeswoman also contended with a straight face that the giant ads 
increase ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to get on what we call a moving environment," insisted MTA 
staffer Andrea Greene. "They think it's neat." 
</P>
<P>
 These new ads are computer-generated, "photo-realistic" images, produced in 
long, thin strips with adhesive backing -- like shelf paper. 
</P>
<P>
 When a bus accident tears off a piece of the ad, the company just prints out 
another strip and sticks it on. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a passenger, it's like looking through a screen door," said adman 
LaBadie. "If you're a pedestrian, you can see the advertisement." 
</P>
<P>
 For drivers and pedestrians, the full-bus ads have "bigger impact than a 
billboard," said Frank Sandusky, vice president and regional manager of 
Transportation Displays Inc., which sells bus advertising. "You can put it 
wherever you want."

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 We have all seen countless movies in which a police officer stops an 
unsuspecting motorist and commandeers his car in order to pursue a fleeing 
suspect. Rarely, if ever, do these motorists stop and question the authority of 
police officers to commandeer their cars for official business. Instead, they 
merely slide out of the way or get out and let the cops take over. 
</P>
<P>
 So, our question is this: Is there any law that compels a motorist to turn 
over the use of his vehicle to a law enforcement officer upon demand? If so, 
who would be responsible for any resulting damage to that vehicle while it was 
being so used? 
</P>
<P>
 David Mikkelson, San Fernando Valley Folklore Society 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The practice is more common in the movies than in real life -- although it 
does happen. But there is some disagreement among law enforcement officials 
over whether the practice is even legal. 
</P>
<P>
 A legal notion called posse comitatus -- not to be confused with the militant 
anti-tax group with the same name -- requires able-bodied adults to assist 
uniformed law enforcement officers when they are requested to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who refuse can face a fine of between $50 and $1,000, according to the 
California Penal Code. 
</P>
<P>
 While some interpret the notion of posse comitatus to include commandeering 
vehicles, others say it applies only to situations such as helping an officer 
restrain a suspect. Even then, the officer must be uniformed. 
</P>
<P>
 It leaves us wondering, though, what would have happened if the driver of the 
convertible in "Speed" had refused to give the jogging -- but out of uniform -- 
Keanu Reeves a lift along the Santa Monica Freeway? 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Zine, director of the Los Angeles Police Protective League and a former 
street cop, said he has exercised posse comitatus three times to take control 
of vehicles in his 26 years with the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 That's three times more than most cops. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he commandeered a private delivery truck. Another time he took over a 
city trash truck. And once he borrowed a bicycle to chase a fleeing forgery 
suspect. "The only bad thing about the bike," Zine recalls, "was that it didn't 
have any brakes." 
</P>
<P>
 In answer to the second part of your question, the agency employing the 
officer who commandeers a vehicle is responsible for any damage. So if a Los 
Angeles Police Department officer hops in your car and demands the wheel, the 
city of Los Angeles would have to ensure that the car was returned to its 
original state. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't know, however, if that includes filling the gas tank. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I have lived in Los Angeles for 18 years. During that time, I have seen many 
school buses stop on city streets and roads to discharge children. Not once 
have I seen a school bus use its red flashing lights to warn and stop traffic 
while children get off -- a practice I'm used to from back East. I've never 
been able to determine why. Is there some type of rule prohibiting the use of 
school bus warning lights in the city? Or is it something else? 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Diernback, Tarzana 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The reason you may never have seen a bus flashing its red lights is that the 
instances in which drivers must activate them are fairly limited. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Los Angeles Unified School District Transportation Director Alan 
Tomiyama, drivers are required to turn on the lights only when they leave the 
bus to escort children across an intersection not controlled by a signal. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bus lets out children in the middle of the block, the lights stay off. 
If the bus lets children out at a signaled intersection, the lights stay off. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the bus stops at an intersection controlled by stop signs and the 
driver knows children must cross the street, the lights must go on. The driver 
then must escort the children across the street with a hand-held stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
 When they see the red lights, drivers in both directions are required to stop.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; BUSINESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a city that takes pride in its clean, modern and vibrant appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the only drawback in being so thoroughly pristine is that Irvine 
cannot take advantage of many grants, low-interest loans and other perks older 
municipalities use to revitalize urban centers. 
</P>
<P>
 But that might change. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are drafting a plan designed to help local businesses expand 
and create new jobs. The plan would make low-interest federal loans available 
to small businesses and make it easier to obtain larger loans from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to help generate the kind of strong economic growth in Irvine that 
urban areas are producing through redevelopment agencies and enterprise zones. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal comes as city and business leaders are teaming up to examine ways 
of improving the city's business climate. Several committees are examining ways 
of reducing government regulations, attracting new businesses and keeping 
existing ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the plan to help businesses fits into this larger strategy of 
bringing more jobs into the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are already a very marketable city," said Steve Weiss, Irvine's principal 
planner for economic programs. With the business-assistance program, "we are 
going a little bit further." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is expected to vote in September on the proposal, which calls 
for the creation of new programs as well as the continuation of existing ones. 
</P>
<P>
 One new concept is to use federal community block grants to make modest 
low-interest loans to the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 At least $100,000 a year would be earmarked for the loan program. Businesses 
could receive loans of between $5,000 to $50,000. Once a loan is repaid, the 
money would be lent again to another business, Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city currently allocates most community block grants to nonprofit 
agencies. Weiss said the business loan program would use excess grants not 
allocated to public service groups. The loan program would not cause a 
reduction in the amount of support to the nonprofits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal also attempts to streamline an existing state loan program that 
uses industrial-development bonds. Businesses seeking to expand can receive 
between $1 million and $10 million under the program, which uses state money 
allocated through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials also want to continue and perhaps expand a fledging loan 
counseling service sponsored by the city, eight local banks and the Irvine 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The program provides businesses with information about different banking 
services and lending practices. Businesses can receive printed information 
about the banks and can speak with an accountant.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; FUNDS SHIFT TO AID YOUTH PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Youth programs that provide scholarships and anti-gang recreational activities 
will be benefited by a shifting of $450,000 of city funds and community block 
grants.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week unanimously approved new funding of $300,000 for 
the Santa Ana 2000 community college scholarship program and $150,000 for the 
anti-gang program Project PRIDE. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel it's money well spent," City Manager David N. Ream told the council 
before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift of funds was in response to meetings with community groups such as 
the Orange County Congregation Community Organization, whose members have 
called recently for more youth-related education, recreation and employment 
activities, Ream said. 
</P>
<P>
 About $401,000 in city funds became available recently after negotiations with 
health care providers for city employees and because of unanticipated payment 
credits from the state's public retirement system, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the new funding for the youth programs came from community block 
grants that the council shifted from the Santa Ana Unified School District's 
Head Start preschool project and the Santa Ana Fire Prevention Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The council reallocated the money because the two programs would not have been 
able to spend the money within the next year, said Lorraine Lazarine, council 
services manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The $300,000 allocated to Santa Ana 2000 matches the amount the city paid into 
that scholarship program last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest earned on the money will be used to fund scholarships for local high 
school students to attend Rancho Santiago College, Lazarine said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The philosophy is that we are the 'Education First' city," she added. "It's 
very important to the people of Santa Ana. It's in everyone's best interests if 
kids stay in school, graduate from high school and continue with their 
education." 
</P>
<P>
 New funding for Project PRIDE will be used to expand hours of after-school and 
recreational programs and to increase the number of sites at which they are 
offered. PRIDE stands for "Parks and Recreation Inspire Dignity and Esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 The council also hired a parent and volunteer coordinator for the PRIDE 
program at a cost of $29,000. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; ANTI-SMOKING LAW BEING ENFORCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tougher restrictions on public smoking are now being enforced in the city, 
less than five months before even stricter, statewide controls are to go into 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin's law bans smoking in any building owned, leased or operated by the 
city.Smoking in other indoor public places is also prohibited, except in areas 
specifically set aside for smokers. Local restaurants, therefore, can continue 
to offer smoking sections -- at least through the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the fight for the new municipal law was Councilwoman Tracy Worley, a 
former professional tennis player who describes herself as a "big no-smoking 
advocate." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad we have something on the books," she said. Worley said she favored 
even stricter regulations but doubted they would win council approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Worley in voting for the smoking restrictions were Mayor Thomas R. 
Saltarelli and Councilmen Jim Potts and Jeffery M. Thomas. Councilman Michael 
J. Doyle opposed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Gov. Pete Wilson signed one of the toughest statewide anti-smoking 
laws in the nation. The legislation, which will go into effect Jan. 1, bans 
smoking in most enclosed workplaces, including restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 If the statewide regulations go into effect, Tustin will still have the option 
of imposing even stricter controls on smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 The state regulations and Tustin's new law will be superseded, however, if 
California voters approve Proposition 188 on the November ballot. Sponsored by 
Philip Morris U.S.A., the nation's largest tobacco company, the ballot 
initiative would permit smoking in restaurants and most other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has announced his opposition to Proposition 188, as has his campaign 
rival, State Treasurer Kathleen Brown. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; COLLEGE DISTRICT GETS $1-MILLION GRANT

<P>
 The Rancho Santiago College District has received a $1-million grant from the 
U.S. Department of Education to create a program encouraging at-risk youngsters 
to complete high school and enter college. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "Talent Search," the program will serve about 700 students in grades 
eight through 12 who have the potential to go to college after high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Youths will receive individual counseling and encouragement to help get into 
the college of their choice, spokesman Dale Ruhe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, the college will receive $200,000 each year for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is one of only 30 colleges nationwide participating in the 
federal program, Ruhe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These programs provide a pipeline by which our students, many of whom never 
dreamed of going to college, can start getting prepared as early as the eighth 
grade," said Audrey Yamagata-Noji, dean of student development. 
</P>
<P>
 Talent Search will also include a special club called "Club Adelante" at four 
middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The club will offer educational and cultural programs as well as help steer 
children away from gangs. JON NALICK

<P>
 Rancho Santiago College professor Wayne Gibson has won a $30,000 grant to buy 
math-related computers and software to improve undergraduate science courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The award, from the National Science Foundation, will be used to create a 
computer laboratory that will free students from tough algebraic calculations 
so they can concentrate on the underlying concepts of experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 The lab will also offer multimedia presentations that explain complex calculus 
concepts in an easy-to-understand manner, spokesman Dale Ruhe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is intended to meet the special needs of the Rancho Santiago 
campus. More than 50% of its students speak English as a second language, and 
almost 70% of incoming freshmen place below average on standard math placement 
exams, Ruhe said.JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; CITY WILL BUY OLD FIRE STATION SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has decided to buy the Old San Juan Capistrano Fire Station site from 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted last week to pay $265,000 for the property at 31411 La 
Matanza St., where the city operates community services programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1982, the city had been leasing buildings on the site for $1 a year, but 
the county told city officials this year that the arrangement would be ending 
for financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had the option of buying the property or paying fair market rent, 
according to Cynthia Pendleton, the city's administrative services director. 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton said the monthly payments to buy the property will be significantly 
lower than rent would have been. The property is being financed at 8% over 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city ever develops the property for commercial use, the county is to 
receive 80% of the revenue generated. JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; HOMEOWNERS ASK TO PRIVATIZE COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playing catch-up to numerous South County housing developments built with 
entrance gates, the El Niguel Heights Homeowners' Assn. has petitioned the city 
to privatize the community's streets and to allow guarded gates at its two 
entrances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission on Tuesday will consider the proposal, which would 
turn over control and maintenance of 22 streets to the association while still 
allowing non-resident access to Seminole Park, a public park within El Niguel 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempers have flared over the gate idea, with opponents accusing the plan's 
backers of supporting segregation and gate advocates saying they want to keep 
their community safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us just want to see our kids grow to maturity and have families of 
their own and not be a victim of crime or a traffic casualty," said Thomas 
Bois, the association president. He likes the idea of controlling access to the 
narrow cul-de-sacs and pricey homes between Niguel Road, Club House Drive and 
the El Niguel Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, nothing can prevent crime, but with gates you can have a little 
control over it happening in your community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates are proposed for Augusta Drive at Niguel Road and for Glen Abby Drive at 
Club House Drive. A guard would be posted at each gate for 14 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 El Niguel Heights resident James Davis said he believes raising monthly 
association dues by $50 to install the gates and maintain the streets won't 
accomplish much, since the area is already safe and everyone wanting to use 
Seminole Park would have to be allowed through the gates during the day anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were a robber," Davis said, "I would just say, 'I'm coming in to use the 
park.' " 
</P>
<P>
 According to the city ordinance that governs community entrance gates, 75% of 
the petitioning community must be in favor of the access controls. The El 
Niguel survey administered by the city showed 76% of the residents favored the 
plan. Davis and other privatization foes say they believe the balloting was 
tainted, because some "yes" votes were mailed on, rather than received by, the 
voting deadline and others were sent by fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Development Director Robert Lenard said, however, that the city 
accepted faxed votes and those bearing the deadline postmark because that was 
the procedure followed when 85% of Bear Brand residents approved privatization 
of their neighborhood. The City Council granted their petition. LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; CITY CRACKS DOWN ON DOOR-TO-DOOR SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Signs soon will go up at entrances to the city to remind solicitors they must 
register with City Hall before knocking on doors. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Fred Maley said the new signs will be installed in about two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have the signs at nine different locations, on streets leading into the 
city," Maley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The warning signs are part of the City Council's crackdown on soliciting. This 
year the council passed an ordinance that in effect allows homeowners to 
declare their property "off limits" to door-to-door sellers and solicitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance allows homeowners to put their street addresses on a "no 
solicitors registry" maintained at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 When solicitors apply for a city-required permit at City Hall, they are given 
a listing of all addresses that have opted not to be disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Solicitors who violate the city law by calling on homes listed in the "no 
solicitors registry" can have their permit revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 They also can be cited for a misdemeanor, punishable with up to six months in 
jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Maley said the city's new anti-solicitor ordinance was beefed up at the 
council's last meeting when the council amended the measure with a penalty 
clause. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Leonard Hampel said that in most cases people violating the new law 
would simply lose the right to solicit within the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the law does provide for the sterner action of jail, a fine, or 
both. 
</P>
<P>
 Maley noted that the new law stemmed from requests by residents, some of whom 
had asked council members to restrict door-to-door solicitations after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that legal research determined that constitutional law limits what 
cities can do to restrict solicitors, including any limitation on hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park's new ordinance is a distillation of laws successfully used by 
other cities and upheld by the courts, according to Hampel. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA, TUSTIN JOIN FIGHT TO KEEP RAMS

<P>
 Brea and Tustin have joined the ranks of cities supporting efforts to keep the 
Rams football team in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea and Tustin both adopted similarly worded resolutions last week citing the 
positive financial benefits the county receives from having a professional 
football team based at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams Booster Club and a task force founded by the club, Save the Rams, are 
leading the effort to obtain municipal support for keeping the team in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities of Anaheim, Buena Park, Fountain Valley, Fullerton, Irvine, Orange, 
Seal Beach, Stanton and Santa Ana have also passed resolutions of support, 
along with the county of Orange, club spokeswoman Linda Moomau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moomau said she hopes additional cities will approve resolutions during the 
next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The complete list of municipal supporters will be announced at the Rams season 
kickoff luncheon sponsored by the Booster Club and the Anaheim Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual event, which is open to the public, is scheduled for 11 a.m. Aug. 
19 at the Anaheim Marriott. Rams head coach Chuck Knox and some team members 
are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 This may be the last season that the Rams play in Anaheim. The Rams invoked an 
escape clause in their stadium lease in May that allows them to leave in 15 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The team has been discussing relocation offers from Baltimore, Memphis, St. 
Louis and other cities.ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; DISNEY ICE FACILITY TO BE CONSIDERED 
</P>

<P>
 A community ice rink downtown? It could happen. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council Tuesday will consider a joint proposal by the city and the 
Walt Disney Co. to build a 100,000-square-foot rink to serve as a practice site 
for the Mighty Ducks hockey team and as a community youth center. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be built on three acres at the southwest corner of Lincoln Avenue and 
Clementine Street. It would house two ice rinks -- one of Olympic size to seat 
300 spectators and the other of National Hockey League size to hold up to 
1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks would use the rink about 200 hours a year, Disney officials say, 
leaving some 12,800 hours of ice time for the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's new nonprofit program called GOALS -- Growth Opportunities Through 
Athletics, Learning and Service -- also would use the rink. Patterned after a 
similar program in Harlem, GOALS will reinforce positive values to 
underprivileged children. 
</P>
<P>
 If the rink is approved Tuesday night, Disney officials say it could be open 
by September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission unanimously approved the project in July. MARTIN

 Pending further study by city staffers, the City Council has delayed action on 
a proposal to reinstate the Family of the Year competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The city launched its Family of the Year award in 1992 but later dropped it 
because of budget problems. The competition was coordinated by a city advisory 
group, the Cultural and Beautification Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Grover, a member of that committee, urged the council last week to 
reinstate the Family of the Year competition. Grover said the Cypress Stake of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints has offered to donate $250 to 
La Palma to pay the annual cost of the family competition. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members told Grover they appreciated the church's generosity. But 
several council members expressed reservations about reinstating the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Wally D. Linn said that when the first family competition was held in 
1992, he felt "uncomfortable" in having to pass over the nominated families who 
did not win. "I was worried about how they were going to feel," Linn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor added that he has nothing against the idea of honoring families. 
"I'm not opposed to the concept," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Larry A. Herman said: "I feel that if a program like this is going 
to be run, it ought to be run by a service organization, such as the Lions or 
someone else -- not the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members said they needed assurance that there would be a 
source of continued funding for the competition if it is reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 Grover said she felt sure the Latter-Day Saints Cypress Stake, which includes 
La Palma, would agree to a continuing commitment to pay for the program. She 
said she would try to get a written commitment and bring it to City Manager 
Pamela Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously voted to have Gibson and other city staffers further 
study the competition proposal and to submit a report to the council later this 
year.BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; FORMER BAR MAY BE DEMOLISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A bar that has been closed for four years is causing the city trouble and 
officials want to call in the wrecking ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years after the owner boarded Zavala's Place, which is in the city's 
historic downtown area, the city says it remains a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has given Hilario Zavala 30 days to come up with a plan to either 
renovate or tear down the peach-colored building, or the city will level it and 
bill the owner. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Orange County Fire Inspector Tony Riniti declared the building a fire 
hazard, with rubbish spread throughout the interior. Two exterior walls are in 
danger of collapsing. A shed roof at the rear of the building shows massive 
deterioration, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is always graffiti, it has accumulated a lot of junk inside and it is 
falling apart," said Joyce R. Rosenthal, director of development services. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the city council declared the building at 309 W. Santa Fe Ave. a 
public nuisance. At that time, the city asked Zavala to submit a plan to 
renovate the former bar, but Zavala offered to board the windows and clean and 
lock Zavala's Place until he has the money to renovate the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council rejected that plan, saying the city could not wait 
indefinitely for Zavala to correct the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the building is 70 years old, the Placentia Historical Society 
determined it does not have historical value. The building's location in the 
Santa Fe commercial district makes it eligible for low-interest rehabilitation 
loans but typically those loans are not granted to bars, Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Zavala has indicated his intent was to bring it back as a sports bar," 
Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zavala, who could not be reached for comment, has until Sept. 6 to submit a 
timely plan for renovating the building, Rosenthal said. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; BIKINI BAR IN MALL REJECTED BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has unanimously upheld a Planning Commission decision denying 
a permit for a bikini bar -- the subject of dozens of complaints by residents 
who contend the proposed establishment would be morally wrong.  
</P>
<P>
 Steve Smith had proposed opening a nonsmoking bar featuring bikini-clad 
dancers and servers, as well as pool tables and video games for customers 17 
and older. Smith's attorney, Joshua Kaplan, argued that denying the permit 
would be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan said the bikinis would be no different from those worn at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "There (would) be no exposure to any portions of the female anatomy or sexual 
activities," he said, adding that his client would provide two uniformed 
security guards and surveillance cameras to keep the business under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith had hoped to open "La Habra Polo Grounds" in a shopping center at the 
northeast corner of La Habra and Harbor boulevards.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Juan M. Garcia said La Habra is a "community that really does care, 
and I'll be darned if I'm going to let that type of business in that particular 
location regardless of constitutional rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Local businesses and the Chamber of Commerce opposed the bikini bar. So did 
more than 2,000 residents who signed a petition against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need this kind of garbage in our city," Paula Larson said. "This is 
the type of business that breaks down the family unit that La Habra represents. 
This is a type of pornography that we . . . refuse to have in our city." 
</P>
<P>
 "You go from cutesy and cheesecakey to hard-core every time," resident Pamela 
Shurilla said at a public hearing. . "Where is Mr. Smith's conscience? Where is 
his heart?" 
</P>
<P>
 Smith declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said the bikini bar issue has pulled the community together. "We 
wish to unite our city against this ridiculous evil," Carrie Votaw said. MIMI

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; LOW-COST HOUSING REPORT FAVORABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cypress is doing well in its efforts to provide low-cost housing, according to 
a recent city report. 
</P>
<P>
 The document, presented to the City Council last month, says Cypress has 
achieved 118% of its state-required goal for new homes for "very low-income" 
residents and 111% of the required goal for housing "lower-income" residents. 
</P>
<P>
 As in most cities with redevelopment plans, the City Council in Cypress 
doubles as the city's Redevelopment Agency. In its role as the Redevelopment 
Agency, the council last month heard a progress report on low-income housing 
from Christine Eynon, the city's community development director. She told the 
council that Cypress is among very few cities currently meeting or exceeding 
the state goal for low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing very well," Eynon said. "It's rare that a city meets its 
requirement. We look very good, compared to other cities." 
</P>
<P>
 The "lower" and "very-low" brackets are established by a complicated formula 
based on area median incomes, adjusted for household size. State law requires 
cities with redevelopment agencies to construct housing for residents who fit 
these brackets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redevelopment Agency report showed that Cypress had been assigned a goal 
of 104 units of "very low-income" housing and 127 units of "lower-income" 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said that the city currently has 123 units of "very low-income" 
housing either built or in the process of construction, thus meeting 118% of 
the city's goal. The city has 141 units of "lower-income" housing built or in 
process, for 111% of the goal, the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
 The only housing category in which Cypress lags, according to the report, is 
in "moderate-income" housing. The city has a goal of 178 units of new housing 
in this category, and so far it has attained 117 units either built or under 
construction, for a 66% achievement rate.BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA PALMA; CITY CARS WILL GET FILL-UPS IN CYPRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When official city vehicles need gasoline in the future, they will be driven 
next door, into Cypress, for a fill-up. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council unanimously voted last week to buy gasoline from the Cypress 
city pumps.La Palma city staffers said the action will save taxpayers five 
cents on every gallon of gasoline, compared to the cost at commercial outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 Ismile H. Noorbaksh, La Palma's public works director, told the City Council 
that the city had purchased gasoline before from Cypress for about 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But that ended about two years ago when Cypress had to replace its tanks under 
a requirement of the Air Quality Management District, Noorbaksh said.  
</P>
<P>
 He added that Cypress's fuel facility has now reopened and Cypress proposed a 
new sale agreement with La Palma. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact stipulates that La Palma pay Cypress 10 cents a gallon for insurance 
costs and another 13 cents per gallon as an administrative charge. La Palma's 
total cost per gallon under the agreement is $1.10, compared to $1.15 at 
commercial stations, Noorbaksh said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a question from Councilman Larry A. Herman, city staffers said 
that the La Palma police vehicles are the city's major gasoline consumers. 
Staffers added that only officially identified, La Palma-owned vehicles can 
purchase from the Cypress pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 The gasoline agreement with Cypress can be terminated with a 30 days' notice, 
Noorbaksh said. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; PARKING DISCOUNT AT BEACHES EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reduced parking fees will continue to be offered at Huntington and Bolsa Chica 
state beaches through the end of the summer season, state park officials have 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Ito, park superintendent, said the $5 day-use fee will be extended through 
Labor Day.The normal fee of $6 per vehicle will go back into effect Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito said the day-use fee was reduced in May as a way to increase park 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had noticed there was a decline in the number of cars parking in the state 
beach area," Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito said the drop in beach visitors using state parking lots could have been 
caused by the amount of the fee or the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said, the weather also plays a major role in attendance. According 
to Ito, poor weather caused attendance to decline in May despite the discounted 
fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "May was a horrible month for weather," he said. "We were below the amount of 
tickets sold for last year." 
</P>
<P>
 But in June and July, day-use ticket sales increased by 25%, prompting the 
decision to extend the reduced fee, Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito noted that with the recent sunny weather, weekend beach visitors are 
filling parking lots at the two beaches. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; HEARING SCHEDULED ON REOPENING SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Alamitos Unified School District will hold a public hearing on Aug. 30 
to consider whether Oak Middle School, which has been closed since 1985, should 
be reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials also will seek ideas from the community about how to 
finance reopening the school.One proposal is to sell the closed Weaver 
Elementary School in Rossmoor. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing will begin at 7 p.m. at the Performing Arts Center at Los Alamitos 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the school district considered selling or leasing the 23-acre Oak 
Middle School site to pay for planned improvements to other schools in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 But a group of parents who called themselves SOS, or Save Oak School, 
persuaded the school board to keep the school site, arguing that it may be 
needed in the future to accommodate the growing number of sixth-, seventh- and 
eighth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district, which serves about 7,300 students from Los Alamitos, 
Rossmoor and Seal Beach, has only one middle school -- McAuliffe Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oak Middle School site is currently being used as the campus of the Orange 
County High School of the Arts. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY BUDGET TO BE DISCUSSED TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's $9-million budget for 1994-95 comes up for discussion tonight, but 
few fireworks are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the budget is similar to the one proposed last year and 
calls for no new taxes or significant cuts in city services. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Jerry L. Bankston had hoped to begin building the city's reserves 
this year. But that process will be delayed for another year because of two 
unexpected expenses, the pier fire in May and a $300,000 sand-replenishment 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The added expenses also scuttled the City Council's plan to reduce the 
utility-user tax. The council last year more than doubled the tax that 
residents pay on their monthly gas, electricity and telephone bills to 11% -- 
the highest in Orange County. Council members said they now hope to reduce the 
tax next year.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: VALLEY PILOTS CLUB WANTS TO TAKE WOMEN ON A FLIGHT OF FANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Valley 99's, a group of local pilots, will be at the San Fernando Valley 
Air Show looking for a few good women. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Glassman of Canoga Park, president of the local chapter, says too many 
women think they are too old too learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have women in our Future Pilots Program who are in their 50s and 60s," 
Glassman says. 
</P>
<P>
 The 99's offer a mentor program, educational classes, and lots of new friends 
to take you up whenever you wish. The cost of flying time and instruction 
needed to earn a pilot's license is estimated at $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Glassman says she flew for the first time moments after scattering her 
husband's ashes over the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had gone up with a pilot and gotten very emotional after the ashes were 
scattered, so the pilot told me to take over the controls," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had always been interested in flying, but I had two teen-age girls and 
worked as a cashier for a grocery company. There just wasn't the money then," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years later, she took lessons. Although she does not own her own 
plane, she says getting rides is never a problem when you're a member of the 
99's. 
</P>
<P>
 Member Bertie Duffy says she was thirty-something when she learned to fly. Her 
husband was already a pilot. In their divorce, she says, the custody battle was 
over their six airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally said he could keep the other five, if I could have the Stearman," 
says Duffy, who now makes a business of giving rides in her World War 
II-vintage open-cockpit biplane. 
</P>
<P>
 Duffy's plane will be on display, and the 99's will have a booth, during the 
show at Van Nuys Airport on Aug. 20 and 21. 'A Woman of Independent Means' Goes 
to Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 When Elizabeth Forsythe Hailey came into possession of letters written by her 
grandmother, she couldn't have known what an impact they would have on her life 
and family. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1978, her biographical book based on those missives was published. It 
was titled "A Woman of Independent Means." 
</P>
<P>
 The book became a best-seller and catapulted Hailey into literary stardom. 
Until then, she had been known as the wife of playwright Oliver Hailey. 
</P>
<P>
 The book chronicles the life of a woman who was a living example of 
self-determination, and her victories and challenges seemed to strike a chord 
in many readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Barbara Rush did a celebrated one-woman show based on the book in 1984 
and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons that Hailey, of Studio City, may have once considered annoying but 
now sees as fortuitous, the book never made it to film or television -- until 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer-director Robert Greenwald, in cooperation with NBC, is shooting a 
six-hour mini-series, due to air next year. Tarzana resident Sally Field, who 
told Hailey she has had a long interest in bringing the book to television, 
plays Hailey's grandmother during most of the 60 years recorded in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Hailey's daughter, actress Brook Hailey, will play her mother in the 
miniseries, which is now shooting in Houston. Hailey herself will have a 
walk-on part. 
</P>
<P>
 The past two years have been a period of both joy and tragedy for the Valley 
author, whose husband died last year and whose mother suffered a disabling 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 The joy, she says, is in seeing an actress and director who were moved and 
inspired by her book bring it to life on the small screen. Nudist Lays Bare 
Genesis of Once-Controversial Resort 
</P>
<P>
 Though once considered risque, the nudist camp in Topanga Canyon is peacefully 
thriving, and that's a great relief for founder Ed Lange. 
</P>
<P>
 The Topanga Chamber of Commerce, which once refused to sell Lange a ticket to 
its annual dinner, now meets every month at his Elysium Fields resort. Chamber 
members keep their shirts and everything else on, Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoolchildren take tennis lessons on the grounds and middle-aged, bathing 
suit-clad women take water aerobics classes in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 After surviving everything from prayer vigils to unhappy neighbors, Lange 
appreciates the lack of controversy. Lange, 74, says he became a nudist because 
of something we now call women's lib. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a young man growing up in Chicago, I was struck by the sexual 
games people played with each other," Lange says."It seemed to me the tensions 
between men and women were caused by a convoluted set of game rules. The man 
wanted sex and the woman wanted a commitment, and what went on between them was 
that women cleverly bartered their bodies in exchange for what they wanted to 
gain," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange says he was disgusted by what he considered the blatant gamesmanship by 
both sexes and thought there must be a better way for men and women to relate. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came across a magazine dedicated to the liberation of the human body 
through nudism, I thought, 'Well, there's the answer.' It's pretty hard to play 
games when you don't have anything on," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange checked into nudism and liked the concept. When he came to Southern 
California about 40 years ago, one of his first stops was a nudist colony in 
Sunland called The Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 When that organization was hassled out of existence, he says, he began putting 
together the idea for what has become Elysium Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "My original idea was to open a clothes-optional resort in Ojai, but it was 
too far from the population center of Los Angeles," Lange says. "When I came 
across the Topanga site, I knew it was the place." 
</P>
<P>
 He envisioned a place where families and individuals could enjoy fresh air and 
sunshine without, he says, the clothing barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clothes are one way people judge others as to their financial and social 
status," says Lange. "When you don't have those clues, when you are not 
dressed, people tend to drop a lot of pretenses." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nudity has nothing to do with sex, and we have never tolerated that at 
Elysium. There are sex clubs and swinging organizations for those people who 
are looking for that. That is not what we are about," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Lesley, who has been a member for 15 years and an employee for 10 years, 
says: "There's never been anything racy going on at Elysium. My daughter had 
her wedding reception here. Everyone wore their Sunday best and had a great 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Programs include a purification ceremony and co-ed sweat lodge, conducted by 
Native Americans, and a one-day retreat for women that includes swimming, use 
of the hot tub, a Swedish massage and a facial as well as a humorist and a 
psychic. Overheard

HOMES LOST AS FIRES RAGE IN N. CALIFORNIA

 Fires in Northern California destroyed more than 30 structures, including some 
homes, by late Sunday, shutting down a highway and prompting evacuations as 
firefighters struggled to control the wind-driven flames. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious blaze, in the Sierra Nevada foothills near the town of 
Kelsey, had burned as many as 20 houses and outbuildings as it consumed more 
than 500 acres amid high winds and hot temperatures, according to the 
California Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, in densely wooded terrain, was reported Sunday afternoon near 
California 193, forcing closure of that roadway between Placerville and 
Georgetown in El Dorado County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Forestry said 740 firefighters were on the scene battling 
the Kelsey blaze, as were 12 air tankers. Four firefighters suffered heat 
exhaustion and second-degree burns. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate fire in steep, brushy country near the Gold Rush hamlet of Rough 
and Ready had consumed 10 buildings and 500 acres. Air tankers aided in the 
firefighting until dark, and only 10% of the fire had been contained by late 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I can say is that the fire is out of control and burning like crazy," 
said Department of Forestry spokesman T. J. Cantrell. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities evacuated some residents to an emergency shelter and ordered the 
precautionary evacuation of the Grass Valley Electronics complex, a group that 
manufactures television equipment for broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rough and Ready fire is near the same area ravaged by the so-called " 
'49-er fire" several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On the California-Nevada border, more than 1,000 firefighters gained the upper 
hand on a 7,000-acre wildfire that destroyed three houses and was diverted from 
two dozen others. The flames were about 80% contained late Sunday, with full 
containment expected by today, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire started Thursday in the Tahoe National Forest in California and 
spread quickly eastward to the Nevada line. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said it was started by a U.S. Forest Service contractor doing 
preliminary work on a reforestation project for the Tahoe National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lakeport, 90 miles north of San Francisco, two houses burned after a fire 
spread through 10 acres of a wooded subdivision before it was contained by 
firefighters, air tankers and a helicopter, according to the Department of 
Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
 And a smaller wildfire Sunday in Truckee, Calif. burned to within a mile of 
the ski condos and vacation properties of the Tahoe Donner subdivision, 
officials said.

COLUMN ONE; STALKED BY VIOLENCE ON THE JOB; DOMESTIC ABUSE IS SPILLING OVER

<P>
 To hide from an ex-boyfriend she feared, Yvette Miller used to spend weekends 
at the homes of friends and relatives. But on Monday mornings, there was no 
escaping. 
</P>
<P>
 By her account, Miller would arrive at her job as a department store security 
guard in San Francisco, only to find the ex-boyfriend waiting there. Mainly he 
would taunt and threaten, she says, but sometimes he slapped and choked her. 
</P>
<P>
 A stalker knows, Miller said, "if they can't catch you at home, they can catch 
you at work." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's story illustrates the way domestic violence and romantic disputes are 
spilling into the workplace. Long before the O.J. Simpson murder case put a 
spotlight on the issue, employers and employees were coping with the fallout of 
domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 When these disputes erupt, "you don't just declare a free zone or a neutral 
zone at the workplace," said Los Angeles Police Lt. John Lane, an expert on 
stalking cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the workplace often is a vicious battleground. That is particularly 
true for people who, like Miller, leave their homes and hide with friends or in 
battered women's shelters to escape abuse. In those cases, "the one place where 
the spouse or significant other knows where to find her is at work," said 
Assemblywoman Dede Alpert (D-Coronado), former chairwoman of the Legislative 
Women's Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics show that in this form of workplace violence, it's almost always a 
case of men attacking women. Boyfriends and husbands, both current and former, 
commit more than 13,000 acts of violence against women in the workplace every 
year, according to estimates in a U.S. Justice Department report released two 
weeks ago. Most of these incidents are non-rape assaults, but the figures also 
include robberies and rapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some employers deal with the issue simply -- and frequently illegally -- by 
firing or suspending the workers dogged by domestic problems. Other firms 
struggle to craft a fair balance between keeping the company safe for all 
employees while protecting the rights of the worker who is being stalked. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because of a lack of research and partly because many battered women do 
not want to acknowledge spousal abuse because of the stigma, the economic toll 
of domestic violence may be impossible to measure. Experts say, however, that 
employers face substantial costs in the form of medical bills, legal fees, 
increased absenteeism and lower productivity linked to workers dealing with 
domestic abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 At their worst, disputes that invade the workplace are deadly. One much-cited 
tragedy was the murder of seven people at a Sunnyvale defense firm in 1988 when 
a computer engineer -- obsessed with a female employee who had long spurned his 
advances -- went on a shotgun rampage. (The woman was shot but survived.) 
</P>
<P>
 Last year in California, there were similar homicides or attempted homicides, 
including shootings in the Dana Point post office, at an Escondido dental 
practice and outside a Sacramento office building. 
</P>
<P>
 But the vast majority of the crimes are far less sensational. Sometimes an 
angry husband comes in and strikes a wife working at a fast-food restaurant or 
factory during the night shift, when fewer guards and supervisors are on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Other times, on-the-job harassment consists mainly of barrages of nasty phone 
calls, often intended to humiliate the victim in front of bosses or co-workers. 
One woman, who asked not to be identified, said her ex-boyfriend sends faxes -- 
realizing they will first be seen by her co-workers -- accusing her of allowing 
a male acquaintance to sexually abuse her 6-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the problem is kept private from co-workers, domestic clashes take a 
toll on the careers and job performance of the workers suffering the abuse. 
They sometimes lose out on promotions -- or get fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Battered women frequently miss work or arrive late. Their appearance and 
self-esteem can worsen, destroying their ability to gain the confidence of 
co-workers. They often seem distracted. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't concentrate. You can't focus on anything," said Sheila Hazlett, a 
job placement specialist from North Hollywood. She speaks from personal 
experience: Her former husband pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge 
after she told police that he repeatedly beat her. 
</P>
<P>
 Long after the violence ends, Hazlett says, the emotional scars of spousal 
abuse still may plague an employee's working life. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than one year after leaving her husband, with whom she ran a weekly 
newspaper, Hazlett paid her bills doing free-lance graphics design and editing. 
Looking for a full-time job was out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just could not face going out into the work force," she said. "It takes a 
long time to get the self-confidence back to even look for a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazlett, 55, also avoided returning to the job market because she feared 
interviewers might pry into why she left the newspaper. "I would feel myself 
getting frightened they would ask more (questions), and I didn't feel ready to 
talk about that with a stranger," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, more than three years since she quit living and working with her 
ex-husband, Hazlett says she sometimes is "still fearful, constantly looking 
over my shoulder, feeling very vulnerable." But with the help of supportive 
colleagues, Hazlett is working for a nonprofit agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But Linda, a secretary and office manager who asked that her last name not be 
used, says she has been able to perform her job well most days. That, she says, 
is despite years of beatings and psychological abuse by her husband, whom she 
is divorcing. 
</P>
<P>
 Work, she said, "was my salvation. Being away from him was a pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there have been many days when her work suffered. For instance, she 
said, her husband would sometimes call her five to 10 times in the course of an 
eight-hour working day to badger and threaten her. On other occasions, Linda 
said, he would take her keys in the morning so she would arrive late to the 
office, or he would keep her up all night, leaving her exhausted for work the 
next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Among employers and employees alike, the potential for deadly domestic 
violence arouses deep fears. Workplace murderers "not only kill the person 
they're after, but they may kill many others as well," said Alpert, the 
legislator from Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
 These tragedies are far less common than nonfatal assaults. In 1992, the most 
recent year for which data is available, 31 women were slain at work by current 
or former boyfriends, husbands or other relatives, according to the U.S. Bureau 
of Labor Statistics. Homicides surpassed traffic accidents that year to become 
the leading killer of women in the workplace, but many more women were murdered 
by unknown assailants in robberies than by ex-lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, to try to prevent future tragedies, Alpert sponsored a bill that 
would enable employers to obtain restraining orders to protect employees 
stalked or threatened on the job. The bill, approved by the Assembly and 
awaiting a state Senate vote, is designed for employees who will not seek the 
restraining orders themselves, perhaps out of fear that it would further 
antagonize their harassers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, women's advocates say that many employers do little to protect or 
counsel victims of domestic abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Nussbaum, director of the U.S. Labor Department's women's bureau, urges 
employers to provide the same type of help for victims of domestic violence 
that they offer to people with drug and alcohol problems. "These are not just 
personnel problems you avoid by getting rid of an individual," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many workers fail to tell their bosses about their fears of violence at work 
because "they're afraid their job may be jeopardized," said the LAPD's Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most employers are very aware of the problem of workplace violence, and if 
they feel a real danger is presented, the easiest way to deal with it is to 
terminate the employee," Lane added. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Miller, the retail security guard, she said she got into trouble at 
work and wound up quitting because of several incidents involving her 
ex-boyfriend. One of the worst moments, she said, was when the ex-boyfriend 
came through her store "ranting and raving" as he looked for her. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her supervisors told her, " 'You're a good person. We like you. But 
we don't want problems to be brought in here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has moved to another retail security job and, in a June court hearing, 
won a three-year restraining order against her ex-boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers who are unfairly fired by domestic violence-wary employers can sue for 
reinstatement or damages under state and federal laws, including statutes 
barring wrongful discharge and discrimination on the basis of gender or marital 
status. As a practical matter, though, it's hard for many women to pursue such 
cases in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got a lot of problems in their lives besides this," said Garry 
Mathiason, a San Francisco management lawyer who specializes in workplace 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, employers must weigh the ethical and practical questions 
involved in keeping workers whose lives -- along with the lives of co-workers 
and customers -- are threatened by stalkers. The legal equation, Mathiason 
said, is: "Do I keep the person employed, let someone get shot and then get 
sued for negligent retention (of an employee)? Or do I let the person go and 
get sued for wrongful dismissal?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mathiason says that, on two or three occasions, he has advised clients to 
suspend employees whose lives appear to be in danger on the job as a way to 
protect the safety of others at the work site. He says he counsels his clients, 
however, to continue paying the workers and to bring them back when the danger 
fades. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers also use other options. For instance, when employers suspect 
violence is possible, they sometimes add security guards and relocate the 
employee to make it harder for a potential assailant to find her. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, many employers offer employee assistance programs for staff members with 
personal problems including domestic violence. The specialists -- typically 
outside psychologists and other counselors on contract -- give advice on 
dealing with the emotional consequences of spousal abuse along with, when 
necessary, tips on finding a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the benefits of these programs, at least in theory, is that employees 
can get help confidentially -- an important consideration for a problem as 
stigmatizing as domestic violence. Supervisors, meanwhile, avoid getting 
directly involved in messy family disputes -- unless there is a threat of 
workplace violence and they need to take action to protect staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows if you get sucked into the middle of a spousal dispute, 
there's no end to it," said Frank Cronin, a Los Angeles management lawyer who 
specializes in employment issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Libbey, Bank of America's manager of employee assistance programs, added 
that "these kinds of problems are highly personal and it's more than likely 
that someone will follow through and get help with a confidential resource" 
than with a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Libbey said, "you really don't want managers getting into areas where 
they aren't competent, because they might give bad advice." 
</P>
<P>
 At Bank of America, employee assistance counselors indicate that domestic 
violence caseloads have risen noticeably in recent years, a trend Libbey 
attributes to increasing media attention. 
</P>
<P>
 However, problems involving drug and alcohol abuse, along with issues related 
to divorce and raising teen-agers, still come up more frequently than does 
domestic violence, say Libbey and other employee assistance specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 For employees such as Kimberly, an accountant for a retailing company who did 
not want her last name used, frequent support from her employer has been a huge 
help in protecting her from an ex-boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's security staff and receptionists have been given descriptions of 
her ex-boyfriend and are on the alert to make sure that he does not sneak into 
her office. 
</P>
<P>
 Her bosses let her change her work schedule to make her routine less 
predictable and make it more difficult for her ex-boyfriend to follow her. 
Kimberly also was given permission to repeatedly take time off to go to court 
hearings and file police complaints, without losing vacation or sick days. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even at a supportive company, problems emerge. To stop her ex-boyfriend 
from leaving threatening messages on her voice mail, Kimberly asked if all of 
her incoming calls could be routed through the switchboard. When her boss 
balked, she dropped the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly says her work performance has held up well despite her concerns but 
sometimes, when she becomes preoccupied with her ex-boyfriend's threats, 
mistakes find their way into her calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the week when a judge sentenced her ex-boyfriend to jail for violating 
a restraining order protecting her, Kimberly said, "I just sat at my desk. I 
couldn't do anything."

HIV RESEARCHERS STRUGGLE TO HIT THEIR MOVING TARGET; DISEASE: THE VIRUS 
FRUSTRATES SCIENTISTS WITH ITS ABILITY TO MUTATE AND HIDE FOR LONG PERIODS IN A 
HOST'S GENES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There is no cure for AIDS, no good treatment to control its symptoms for long 
periods and no vaccine to prevent it, for one major reason: HIV, the human 
immunodeficiency virus that causes the disease, is a sloppy housekeeper when it 
comes to tending its genetic endowment. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time HIV replicates, it makes mistakes, at least one error per 
generation of the virus. Within a few generations, it can begin to take on 
subtly different characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 By all rights, such sloppiness should be devastating to HIV, causing it to 
mutate itself out of existence. Instead, it gives the virus an immense 
advantage in its fight for survival, not unlike the morphing android of the 
movie "Terminator 2." 
</P>
<P>
 Every time the Arnold Schwarzeneggers of science have the virus in their 
sights for destruction by a drug, it transforms into something else and shrugs 
the drugs off. When researchers erect a vaccine to keep the virus out of the 
body, it changes into a form that can slip through defenses like the Terminator 
slides between the bars of a fence. 
</P>
<P>
 HIV is a moving target that is always one step ahead of scientists, says 
virologist Jerry Schochetman of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
in Atlanta. "As one variant is knocked down, another pops up," he said. "The 
next variant is attacked, but the virus continues to keep changing and 
escaping. . . . Eventually the virus wins." 
</P>
<P>
 It is this mutability, combined with the ability of the virus to hide in genes 
-- undetected by the host -- for long periods, that makes HIV such a difficult 
and deadly opponent, experts say. "This is one of the meanest viruses of them 
all," said G. Kirk Raab, president and chief executive officer of Genentech 
Inc. of South San Francisco, which is working on a number of approaches to AIDS 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is that inherent difficulty that has slowed the search for an AIDS 
therapy and vaccine to what many consider a crawl. 
</P>
<P>
 "The classical approach to new diseases is to identify a viral agent and 
develop a vaccine," said Irvin S. Y. Chen, director of the UCLA AIDS Center. 
"That's been the case for all the viruses that we know. For AIDS, we thought 
early on that we would be able to do the same thing. It hasn't turned out to be 
that easy because these properties make it different from all the other 
viruses." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dr. Jay Levy of UC San Francisco, "It is a very difficult (virus) to 
figure out." 
</P>
<P>
 Levy should know, because he has been probing HIV from the time of its 
discovery about 11 years ago. It is widely acknowledged in the scientific 
community that Levy, unheralded and largely unfunded, isolated and identified 
the virus that causes AIDS in late 1983, only to be beaten into print by Dr. 
Robert Gallo and Dr. Luc Montagnier. "I guess I held off (on publishing 
results) too long," he says cheerfully, albeit a bit ruefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy's is one of the relatively few laboratories in the country that 
emphasizes study of the basic science of the virus, rather than concentrating 
solely on finding a cure or vaccine. Indeed, since the virus was discovered 
there has been little progress toward finding the "magic bullet" to cure or 
prevent AIDS, as HIV continues to claim succeeding generations of victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy and others now believe that a better understanding of how the virus works 
will lead to new ways to control it. 
</P>
<P>
 With a team of 20 postdoctoral researchers and technicians and a budget of 
nearly $1 million per year, he is continuing his long quest for an answer to 
AIDS. On the 12th floor of the medical center, they are examining the virus' 
strengths, probing it for weaknesses and deciphering its genetics in half a 
dozen projects that typify HIV research around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The HIV that Levy is studying is, like all viruses, a wispy organism that is 
neither inanimate nor fully living, but somewhere in between. Strictly 
speaking, viruses are not alive because they do not consume food for energy and 
cannot reproduce without assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Viruses are simply small bundles of genetic information encapsulated in a 
protective protein coat and a viral membrane stolen from the last cell they 
visited. They are extremely simple, containing as few as four genes or perhaps 
as many as a dozen, compared to the estimated 100,000 genes necessary to 
describe a human. 
</P>
<P>
 But their power is disproportionate to their size. They attack by sneaking 
into cells and hijacking the host's protein- and gene-producing machinery, 
proliferating until their sheer numbers force the cells to break open in a 
death spasm, freeing the newly made viruses to infect other cells and other 
hosts. Because viruses use the cell's own machinery to reproduce, it has been 
almost impossible to develop antiviral drugs that do not kill healthy cells 
along with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Sore throats occur, for example, when the influenza virus kills cells lining 
the throat. Paralysis occurs when the polio virus bursts muscle cells. Dementia 
occurs when the rabies virus short-circuits brain cells. Death occurs when the 
hantavirus destroys lung cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Although HIV shares broad characteristics with other viruses, it falls into a 
special category called retroviruses, which makes it especially unpredictable 
and, therefore, deadly. 
</P>
<P>
 Viruses can have two types of genetic material, DNA or RNA. DNA viruses share 
the same deoxyribonucleic acid that encodes the genes of all living organisms. 
Most DNA viruses cause relatively trivial infections, ranging from warts to 
colds, but one family, the herpes viruses, causes illnesses ranging from cold 
sores to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most serious diseases, including measles, mumps, encephalitis, polio, 
hepatitis and rabies, are caused by RNA viruses. Ribodeoxynucleic acids, which 
are chemically similar to DNA, are used for carrying messages inside cells of 
all living organisms, but in viruses they store genetic information. 
</P>
<P>
 HIV and other retroviruses are RNA viruses, but they are unusual ones because 
they contain an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, or RT, which makes a DNA 
copy of the virus' RNA genes. This DNA "transcript" can then be used as a 
pattern for making more viruses. Reverse transcriptase is the sloppy 
housekeeper in HIV, introducing genetic errors and then failing to correct 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 All other organisms, including other viruses, also make mistakes when 
replicating their genetic information. But they typically have a mechanism, 
perhaps a second enzyme, that identifies and corrects mistakes like the 
spell-check function on a word processor. 
</P>
<P>
 Retroviruses don't have such a mechanism, UCLA's Chen said. As a result, HIV 
makes mistakes a million times more often than other cells, or about one per 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Those miscues give the virus a wealth of subtle variants to use in adapting to 
changing conditions -- and in eluding therapeutic drugs. AZT, the most 
successful anti-HIV drug, inhibits the replication of the virus by blocking the 
activity of reverse transcriptase. But lurking somewhere in each HIV-infected 
person is at least one mutant form of the virus with a slightly different RT 
that is not blocked by the drug. That variant eventually predominates, killing 
the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "This virus has impressed us again and again with its ability to change," said 
Dr. David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond Center in New York City. "It always 
has a new (variant) to counter our efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 But mutation is not the only unique -- and ultimately, lethal -- 
characteristic of retroviruses. At the beginning of an HIV infection, another 
enzyme produced by one of the virus' genes inserts the DNA copy into the cell's 
own DNA. This copy of the virus' genetic information becomes permanently hidden 
from the host's immune system, until it re-emerges months or years later to 
cause disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The ability of HIV to lie dormant for long periods presents the body's immune 
system with a seemingly impossible task. 
</P>
<P>
 "How does the defense mechanism of an organism recognize this foreign DNA from 
its own?" asked Schochetman. "It can't. If the virus is not functioning, 
there's nothing for the immune system to recognize. The virus can actually lie 
there hidden for long periods of time, and neither we nor the body are used to 
dealing with such long-term infections." 
</P>
<P>
 "It becomes very tricky to attack the virus," said epidemiologist Jonathan 
Kaplan of the CDC. "How do you get it out of the genetic material? The answer 
is, we don't know any way to do that. You have to kill the cell." 
</P>
<P>
 The final and crushing blow is the nature of the virus' target. It is not a 
relatively minor throat cell, or even something as vital as a liver cell. 
Instead, it is one of the most crucial cells involved in leading the fight 
against infections: a white blood cell called CD4. 
</P>
<P>
 CD4 is "the conductor of the orchestra of cells in the immune system," 
Schochetman said. "While the immune system is trying to galvanize itself to 
deal with the virus, the virus undermines the system by destroying the leader." 
Without direction, the immune system is lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't very many reasons why progress against AIDS is so difficult, but 
they are very big reasons," Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to understanding HIV is understanding retroviruses. So far, not much 
progress has been made. 
</P>
<P>
 The first retrovirus was discovered in 1911 by Peyton Rous, a biologist at 
Columbia University. He identified a simple virus, containing only four genes, 
that causes tumors in chickens. Rous believed that a similar virus caused 
cancer in humans, but was never able to find one. Other scientists scoffed and 
few joined the search. Researchers looking back today acknowledge that that was 
clearly a big mistake.

 "We were probably very naive to think that retroviruses wouldn't be in 
humans," Levy said. "They're everywhere else in nature. Why not in humans as 
well?" 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not until 1980 that Gallo of the National Cancer Institute 
identified the first human retrovirus, now called human T-cell lymphotrophic 
virus-I or HTLV-I. That virus, which is common in Japan, the Caribbean and 
parts of Africa, causes a rare form of adult leukemia in about 5% of the people 
it infects. 
</P>
<P>
 Some researchers suspect that HTLV-I and a more recently identified companion, 
HTLV-II -- or viruses very similar to them -- may be responsible for a wide 
variety of human illness, including chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple 
sclerosis, as well as some forms of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 HIV is very similar to the HTLVs -- so similar, in fact, that Gallo initially 
named it HTLV-III. The main differences are that HIV has more genes than HTLVs, 
nine versus four, and causes disease in a much higher percentage of the people 
it infects. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the viruses are so much alike, researchers throughout the country are 
now studying the HTLVs carefully in the hope of gaining new insights into HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lessons to be learned from HTLV-I and II," said William Blattner of 
the National Cancer Institute. "They may be the Rosetta stone" for 
understanding HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy thinks researchers will find other new retroviruses as well that will 
also aid the understanding of AIDS. "Every new virus opens up incredible vistas 
of knowledge," he said. He is looking for such viruses, but most of his effort 
is spent on HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Levy and his colleagues are working out the mechanism of 
Kaposi's sarcoma, a tumor that frequently strikes AIDS patients; studying ways 
to block transmission from infected mothers to infants; exploring the function 
of one of the HIV genes whose role in reproduction is still a mystery; and 
probing relationships between strains of viruses in different parts of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his most promising leads involves the discovery by molecular biologist 
Chris Walker, a former postdoctoral associate of Levy's, that a white blood 
cell called CD8 holds HIV in check by preventing viral replication while HIV is 
hidden in the host genome, the complete genetic blueprint of an organism. 
People who have been infected by HIV for many years but who still have not 
developed full-blown AIDS may possess a stronger or more resilient CD8, 
scientists suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that the loss of this ability to restrain the virus contributes to 
the development of full-blown AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply transfusing AIDS patients with CD8 cells from long-term survivors to 
slow HIV infection would not work because the cells themselves would trigger an 
adverse immune reaction. So researchers are instead exploring a protein 
produced by CD8 -- called CD8 antiviral factor, or CAF -- that they believe is 
the key component in checking the progression of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Molecular biologists Ed Barker and Carl Mackewicz are now trying to collect 
and purify enough of this protein so they can identify its composition and 
produce large quantities by genetic engineering techniques. That's a daunting 
task, Levy said, requiring 100 liters of fluid from CD8 cells, which costs them 
$2,000 per liter just for materials to produce the fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Levy said he is "very encouraged by this approach," because the 
virus doesn't seem to be able to evade this protein by mutating into a 
different strain. "We haven't met a virus yet that can escape it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The approach may even have the potential to completely rid the body of an HIV 
infection, Mackewicz said. All white blood cells die off over a period of a few 
years to be replaced with new ones. If viral replication could be suppressed by 
CAF, perhaps in conjunction with drugs, until all the infected cells die 
naturally, theoretically the infection would be over. 
</P>
<P>
 Mackewicz concedes that such a scenario may be overly optimistic. But even if 
CAF controlled only 90% of replication, he said, "you could get a situation 
like herpes, where you are infected for life but don't die from it." 
</P>
<P>
 But "the most exciting thing we have going on right now," Levy said, is the 
development of a new animal model for AIDS. Although primates have their own 
version of HIV -- called the simian immunodeficiency virus, or SIV -- it is 
distinctly different from HIV and does not provide the best possible gauge for 
testing the effectiveness of new drugs and vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal models are crucial in studying AIDS, according to virologist Stephen 
Morse of Rockefeller University in New York City, because it is the interaction 
of the virus with the entire organism that produces its adverse effects, and 
this interaction cannot be mimicked by growing the virus in cells in the 
laboratory. "The fact that we haven't had a good animal model is a tremendous 
disadvantage," Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chimpanzees can be infected with HIV, but the infection is not pathogenic -- 
the animals do not get sick and die. This makes it impossible to tell if 
potential vaccines or drugs tested in the animals are effective. Chimps are 
also rare and expensive. A far better model would be the baboon, which is more 
common and less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists have long believed that baboons cannot be infected with HIV, much 
less develop AIDS. But David Blackbourn in Levy's laboratory has proved them 
wrong. He has infected several baboons on a farm in Texas with HIV-2, a less 
virulent strain of HIV that is most common in West Africa. Moreover, Levy will 
report this week at the 10th International Conference on AIDS in Japan that two 
of the baboons have now developed symptoms of AIDS, including lymph node 
destruction and fibromatosis, a tumor similar to Kaposi's sarcoma. 
</P>
<P>
 That could open up a whole new track of research. "When I said I was going to 
work in baboons, they laughed at me," Levy says now with a glint in his eye. 
"It's extra pleasant to get these results because we stuck with it." 
</P>
<P>
 A sense of urgency pervades the laboratory, more so than in a cancer research 
center, according to Barker, who has worked in both. "Perhaps it's because AIDS 
affects younger people who are . . . educated and more vocal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It may also be because many people with AIDS come through the laboratory 
regularly, donating blood for research and becoming, in Levy's words, "a part 
of the laboratory." Sooner or later those donors will die. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the ultimate difference is that the number of cancer victims has 
stabilized while the number of AIDS victims is still growing. "I don't know 
where AIDS is going," Levy said. "But if we don't stop it soon, it may spread 
beyond all our imagining." 
</P>
<P>
 Next: The search for an AIDS vaccine A Stealthy Virus 
</P>
<P>
 The AIDS virus evades efforts to control it because of its unique cycle of 
replication, which occurs in a white blood cell called a T-cell. 
</P>
<P>
 1) Infection begins when the virus binds to the outside of a healthy T-cell 
and injects its genetic material into the cell. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Inside the cell, viral RNA is converted to "proviral" DNA by an enzyme 
called reverse transcriptase. This enzyme makes at least one error every time 
it reproduces the RNA. These errors allow the virus to mutate rapidly, giving 
it the abiity to develop resistance to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Another enzyme unique to retroviruses integrates the proviral DNA into the 
host cell's own DNA, where it can remain hidden for years. Eventually, it 
serves as a template for the production of more viral RNA. This material forms 
a "bud" that is released from the cell. 
</P>
<P>
 4) The enzyme proteinase completes the formation of the new infectious HIV 
particles, which is then free to continue the cycle by infecting new T-cells.

HAITI MILITARY MAY NOT RESIST IF U.S. INVADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED and ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. military could hardly ask for an easier target. 
</P>
<P>
 If the United States intervenes in Haiti, as President Clinton has been 
threatening for several months, U.S. troops are unlikely to encounter any 
fierce opposition. In fact, there may be no opposition at all, military 
strategists say. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti has virtually no air force or navy, defense experts say, and the Haitian 
army -- though 7,400 strong on paper -- is poorly equipped and assigned to a 
variety of side jobs, such as firefighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Its combat force consists of only three infantry companies and one 
heavy-weapons company, and most of its equipment is old and badly maintained. 
Only a handful of its 11 armored personnel carriers work, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Haitian military sources say that their contingency plans in the 
event of a U.S. invasion call for most of the island nation's troops to 
"evaporate" -- that is, to take off their uniforms and blend in with the public 
rather than put up a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The few Haitian officers and enlisted men who do remain in uniform will stay 
in their barracks and offer no resistance, hoping to avoid being singled out 
for retribution by the invading U.S. forces or by Haitian civilians looking for 
scapegoats. 
</P>
<P>
 One officer said Haitian army commanders hope that by offering no resistance, 
they will be able to avoid large-scale arrests during the expected U.S. 
occupation of the country and will be able to dissuade American officials from 
trying to destroy the Haitian military as an institution. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all think that the Americans ultimately will have to turn to (the 
Haitian army) to maintain order," a foreign analyst said. "They think the 
Americans won't have the stomach to shoot . . . civilians. So (eventually they 
will have to) ask the Haitian army to step in" to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not mean that the invading U.S. forces can be assured of avoiding 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 Military experts warn that, as in any such situation, there is likely to be 
danger from snipers and gangs of thugs. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for all the expected acceptance of U.S. military authority, there still 
are a few groups -- some connected with the current Haitian strongman, Lt. Gen. 
Raoul Cedras, and the army -- that have vowed to mount some resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras himself, interviewed on CNN in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince 
over the weekend, continues to take a hard line, saying that military 
preparations are being made to defend the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you intervene, it will mean bloodshed on both sides. . . . Every 
(military) barrack is filling up with young people who are fighting to sign up 
and get training because they know they must defend their country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of Gen. Cedras. It's not a matter of (ousted President 
Jean-Bertrand) Aristide. The matter is to defend Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Intelligence officers say the Haitian military has distributed at least 1,000 
rifles to its civilian allies over the last two months, including Galil assault 
rifles and other automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 One self-appointed militia, headed by Romeo Aloun, a U.S. citizen who is the 
son of a prominent Haitian businessman, has between 35 and 50 heavily armed 
followers who have been setting up nighttime roadblocks and imposing their own 
form of security at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 There also is some uncertainty in Haiti about which forces would deal with 
quelling looting and protecting private property during an invasion. Presumably 
U.S. troops would help keep order, but they may be busy with their broader 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason that U.S. planners are so confident of little resistance is that 
the Haitians historically have been nonviolent and friendly to foreigners, 
especially Americans. The infamous Tontons Macoutes hit squad was disarmed 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior U.S. military planner -- a three-star general -- told reporters 
earlier this year that even now during visits to Port-au-Prince he goes jogging 
unaccompanied by security guards, occasionally even passing Haitian military 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Haiti's few militiamen and other potential resistance groups do not 
have rocket-propelled grenades and other more destructive weapons such as their 
counterparts in Somalia had. Private arms caches are thought to be very 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, U.S. officials are planning to take a firm stance from the start 
to discourage resistance or sniping. "We will be arriving in force, ready and 
willing to shoot," a U.S. official who has been involved in the planning said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't expect any resistance, and we expect we won't have to do anything 
but put locks on the gates to keep them from running away," one military expert 
said. But, he added, "No one will be taking any chances." 
</P>
<P>
 After U.S. troops have secured the Haitian capital and imposed a curfew, they 
are expected to spread out and control the rest of the country. Within 24 
hours, they will take over other important cities such as Cap-Haitien, 
Gonaives, Jacmel, Jeremie and Hinche. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon planners say the real problem is likely to come after the island is 
"secure" and that order will have to be maintained during the several months 
required to help Aristide form a new government and restore the island's 
economy. Haiti: An Invasion Blueprint 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. strategists say the Battle of Haiti, if there is one, would be over in a 
scant eight hours to two days. Although U.S. troops would sustain some 
casualties in the fray -- or from sniper fire after the ground fighting ended 
-- the number of killed or wounded would probably be small. How an invasion 
might take place, according to military analysts: 
</P>
<P>
 INVASION FORCE: A total of about 15,000 soldiers and Marines is predicted. 
They would land from ships and helicopters or by parachute from C-141 and C-130 
transports. 
</P>
<P>
 THE OPERATION 
</P>
<P>
 PHASE ONE: The night before the actual invasion, U.S. special forces teams -- 
including Army Rangers, special operations forces and Navy SEALs -- would land 
under cover of darkness at the twomajor cities of Port-au-Prince and 
Cap-Haitien and secure the docks, the airports and the U.S. Embassy in 
Port-au-Prince. They also would take control of a half a dozen major roads -- 
such as Highway 102 to the Dominican Republic and routes 100 and 300. And they 
may capture Ile de la Gonave, a small island just off Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 PHASE TWO: Just before dawn, an initial force of 2,000 Marines from the Marine 
expeditionary unit aboard the helicopter carrier Wasp would come ashore in 
landing craft, both to help secure Port-au-Prince and to evacuate any Americans 
who may be in danger. Navy or Air Force planes could be called upon to provide 
close air support for Army and Marine ground troops, but most likely they would 
not be needed. There is little to bomb in Haiti, and the risk of civilian 
deaths from bombing runs is high. 
</P>
<P>
 PHASE THREE: A few minutes later -- or hours, if the situation warrants -- 
elements of the 82nd and 101st airborne divisions would come ashore or 
parachute in to mop up after the Marines. The soldiers would set up staging 
areas at Port-au-Prince, Cap-Haitien and, possibly, Port-de-Paix on the 
island's north coast. They then would swarm through Port-au-Prince and 
Cap-Haitien and deal with any guerrilla groups or snipers who have not 
surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 THE REBEL LEADERS 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear whether U.S. troops would try to capture Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras 
and other leaders. Finding such targets in a country such as Haiti often is 
very difficult and risks making martyrs of them, as was the case with 
Panamanian Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, who eluded U.S. troops for days after the 
U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989. Instead, Washington may let Cedras and his 
aids flee to the Dominican Republic or perhaps another country. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT U.S. TROOPS WOULD FACE 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti air force and navy are very small, and the Haitian army is poorly 
equipped and spread thin. Most of its equipment is old and badly maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 ARMY 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers: 7,400 active-duty Haitian troops and officers Equipment 11 armored 
personnel carriers 9 towed artillery pieces 37 mortars 20 antitank guns 30 
recoilless rifles 16 air-defense guns AIR FORCE Airmen: 150 active-duty airmen 
and officers Aircraft: 2 combat aircraft, 4 transport aircraft, 9 training 
aircraft NAVY Sailors: 250 active-duty sailors and officers Ships: 1 patrol 
craft plus 3 miscellaneous small boats, 1 shore base (Port-au-Prince) AFTER 
NATION IS SECURED 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon planners say the real problem would likely come during the several 
months when an international force would have to maintain order as President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide tries to form a new government. U.S. forces would be 
joined by a multinational peacekeeping force operating under U.N. auspices that 
would swell the total force to about 30,000 troops. The U.S. troops would 
gradually withdraw, dropping to no more than a few thousand by the end of the 
first month. U.S. and U.N. troops almost certainly would have to remain on the 
island for months, both to help provide security and to train the new 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 TIME ESTIMATES 
</P>
<P>
 * Invasion: Between eight hours and two days. 
</P>
<P>
 * Restoring government: Two months to a year. 
</P>

FEAR OF REPRISALS IN RWANDA IS GROWING; AFRICA: REPORTS OF ATTACKS ON RETURNING 
REFUGEES FILTER BACK TO CAMPS. KIGALI REGIME RENEWS PLEDGE TO PROVIDE SAFETY, 
U.S. SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Even as the stakes for hundreds of thousands are rising, even as a whole 
season of crops is ripening and threatening to rot in the fields of Rwanda, the 
most important question for refugees cannot be answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Are they safe going home to Rwanda? 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three days, a swirl of fresh rumors has swept the refugee camps 
here: Ethnic Hutus are facing retaliatory attacks when they try to return home 
after their bitter civil war with the minority Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports are isolated but are becoming more widely believed. And they come 
as Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, toured 
the small U.S. military assistance effort here Sunday and stressed that the 
United States remains committed to avoiding any peacekeeping role in Rwanda. 
"The U.S. is not going to get involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, the stories of retaliation were largely dismissed as a cruel 
manipulation by politicians and militias from the defeated government who want 
to keep control over more than 2 million Rwandans who have fled to the refugee 
camps here and to the southwestern corner of Rwanda, where their security is 
temporarily guaranteed by French troops. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last few days, Western journalists have come to believe that there 
is more to the reports. Although their accounts are still second- and 
third-hand, refugees are increasingly being taken at their word when they say 
they know of a brother or an aunt who was attacked upon returning. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, John Shattuck, the assistant secretary of state for human rights, 
added credibility to the accounts, offering this preliminary conclusion after a 
visit to Rwanda and Zaire: "There have been some isolated attacks, and we're 
very concerned about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Shattuck hastened to add that he has no solid evidence of renewed killing in 
Rwanda. And he said he had received a fresh pledge from Rwanda's new government 
that it condemns any reprisals against returnees. 
</P>
<P>
 Such attacks would hardly be surprising. In the unimaginably morbid statistics 
of this war, the losing Hutu majority -- and specifically its Interhamwe 
militia -- is accused of butchering up to half a million Rwandans, mostly 
Tutsis, between April and last month, when their forces were routed from the 
country. And in a culture in which ethnic rivalries have existed for 
generations, vengeance is a deeply rooted tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 But repatriation is the only lasting hope that officials can offer to 900,000 
refugees encamped in squalor and disease here and the more than 1 million 
others who are uprooted and threatening to flee southwestern Rwanda if their 
shield of French troops leaves Aug. 22 as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that 
100,000 refugees have left the camps in Zaire and begun the trek home. Weakened 
and on foot, many face a walk of five days or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugee agency officials continue to say they have no evidence of attacks on 
returnees and continue to try to entice them home with promises of food, soap 
and blankets to be distributed en route. And for the first time, a fleet of 42 
trucks was deployed on the roads of Rwanda on Sunday to assist those who need 
transportation home. 
</P>
<P>
 An agency-sponsored radio station established for refugees said it plans to 
broadcast testimonials from Hutus who returned and were not harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agency here stopped far short of guaranteeing the safety of refugees 
once they get home. Spokesman Panos Moumtsis noted that the first thing each 
refugee faces upon returning is a border guard and registration process. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a psychological barrier, and it's causing a lot of fear," Moumtsis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victorious Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front has listed three 
priorities regarding the Hutu refugees. It has welcomed them home in hopes of 
bringing in the crops before the rainy season begins at the end of the month or 
early in September. But it also said the sick should not be rushed out of the 
camps to spread disease in Rwanda. And lastly, it is demanding punishment for 
those responsible for the slaughter of Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 At meetings in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, over the weekend, U.S. officials 
said they had received assurances that a U.N. tribunal would be given 
jurisdiction over any genocide investigation rather than leaving justice to the 
Tutsi leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased to say they committed themselves to that process," the State 
Department's Shattuck said after meeting with Paul Kagame, the leader of the 
successful revolt and now vice president and defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-member panel of African judges has already been appointed under the 
International Court of Justice to begin the difficult process of identifying 
those responsible for the bloody rampage. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalikashvili traveled to Kigali on Sunday for talks with the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front. The general reviewed the troops here earlier in the day -- 
joining a parade of notable Americans that threatens to become as big as the 
military operation itself. 
</P>
<P>
 He flew in with Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice President Al Gore, and an 
entourage of escorts. Their arrival came on the heels of a visit by the 
thundering African American civil rights leader Al Sharpton and just before an 
advertised visit by singer Harry Belafonte. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,500 U.S. troops are now engaged in the relief effort in Goma, in 
Kigali and in Entebbe, Uganda. Shalikashvili praised the troops but expressed 
new impatience for a U.S. withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look at this as a long-term commitment," he said, adding that he 
hopes U.S. water treatment facilities and other chores could be turned over to 
private contractors and "permit us to disengage fairly soon. . . . I see us 
here shorter rather than longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Just a week ago, Defense Secretary William J. Perry visited the region and 
said U.S. troops could be here "a year or more" offering humanitarian 
assistance. And that followed President Clinton's pledge of "immediate and 
massive" aid. 
</P>
<P>
 In southwestern Rwanda, French troops are preparing their pullout and are 
being replaced by U.N. peacekeepers. But many Hutus who have crowded into the 
region from their homes farther north said they do not trust the United Nations 
to protect them and are poised to flee across the border. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugees are already desperately hungry, and aid workers said they are 
only just beginning to send significant supplies into the region. And if the 
Rwandans choose to bolt en masse across the border, another outbreak of 
catastrophic disease and death looms.

OUTLOOK IS PESSIMISTIC AT AIDS CONCLAVE

<P>
 A sense of foreboding pervaded the gathering Sunday of more than 11,000 
scientists, journalists and AIDS activists and patients from 128 countries for 
the 10th International Conference on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Asia has so far escaped most of the ravages of the disease, but that situation 
is changing rapidly -- almost literally in front of the delegates' eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last year alone, the number of cases in Southeast Asia has 
increased more than 700%, from 30,000 to 250,000. In northern Thailand, 8% of 
pregnant women and 20% of military recruits are infected with HIV, the virus 
that causes AIDS, according to Dr. Michael H. Merson, head of the World Health 
Organization's Global Programme on AIDS. In Bombay, 30% of prostitutes are 
HIV-positive, as are fully 50% of intravenous drug users in some regions of 
northeast India, he said. 
</P>

 The World Health Organization expects the number of HIV-positive individuals 
in Asia, 2.5 million now, to quadruple to 10 million by the turn of the 
century. Dr. Naoko Yamamoto, chief executive of the conference, said it is 
important to "bring the world's leading experts on AIDS to a region that is 
rapidly becoming the center of the global AIDS epidemic." 
</P>
<P>
 Those experts are not bringing words of good cheer. Advances in treating AIDS 
are few and far between, and most experts expect few revelations in Yokohama. 
"There will not be major breakthroughs (announced) here," said Dr. Peter Piot 
of the World Health Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first of these conferences, held nine years ago in Atlanta, researchers 
predicted the development of a vaccine by 1986. On Saturday, in contrast, Dr. 
George Lundberg, editor of the prestigious Journal of the American Medical 
Assn., predicted that "no successful method of treatment or prevention will 
have been fully implemented" at the end of the next century and that "AIDS will 
still be a serious endemic disease throughout the world" then. 
</P>
<P>
 While other experts think that's an extreme expression of pessimism, the pace 
of research has been so slow that the conference sponsors are abandoning their 
yearly format in favor of holding the gatherings every other year. The next 
meeting will be in Vancouver, Canada, in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the pace of research, the pace of disease is quickening. Worldwide, the 
estimated number of AIDS cases has gone up 60% in the last year, from 2.5 
million in July, 1993, to about 4 million today, according to the World Health 
Organization. The total number of HIV-infected individuals is 17 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace of increase is somewhat slower in the United States, according to 
figures released Saturday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Through the end of June, CDC had received reports of 401,749 cases of 
individuals with AIDS, 243,423 of whom had died. In the last 18 months, 47% of 
new cases were among gay men, 28% among intravenous drug users and 9% among 
heterosexuals who contracted it through sex. The proportions of cases among 
females, African Americans and Hispanics all increased slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan has a low incidence of AIDS so far, according to Dr. Simpei Ozaki of the 
Japan Ministry of Health and Welfare. Through the end of June, he said, the 
country had 764 cases of AIDS reported to the government and 3,075 HIV-positive 
individuals. Three out of every five of those cases were related to the use of 
contaminated blood in transfusions and blood products in hemophiliacs. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the problem of contaminated blood has been brought under control by 
testing, Ozaki said, the biggest number of new infections has been among 
"female foreign residents" -- the euphemism for prostitutes from Thailand and 
other developing countries, most of whom contracted the virus in their home 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozaki insisted that the number of new infections reported among such women 
dropped substantially last year. Japanese journalists, however, said the women 
simply stopped reporting new cases, both because they were getting in trouble 
for their reports and because they were not receiving treatment from the 
national health system. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese AIDS patients have also complained recently about discrimination in a 
homophobic society, alleging that they have been turned away from some 
hospitals. Ozaki conceded the charges, noting that "current arrangements are 
not satisfactory." His ministry intends to establish "model hospitals" to 
demonstrate appropriate AIDS care in all the country's 47 prefectures, or 
states, he said, but so far only eight are operating. 
</P>
<P>
 That homophobia and fear of AIDS has so far apparently not proved to be a 
problem for the meeting, however. The government went out of its way beforehand 
to make it clear that AIDS patients and HIV-positive individuals were welcome 
to attend, and special classes in dealing with such people have been held for 
the staffs of Yokohama hotels. So far, the only complaints have been about the 
high cost of staying here. 
</P>
<P>
 Delegates to the conference, which has been widely publicized here, were 
greeted Sunday with a lively opening ceremony that featured a laser show and 
computer graphics on a large screen behind the speaker's podium. The kickoff 
event was attended by Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and Crown Prince 
Naruhito. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those addressing the session was Toshihiro Oishi, one of the few 
Japanese to publicly admit being infected with HIV. Japan is "a difficult 
society for us PWAs (people with AIDS) to live in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A nation with a budding AIDS problem is India. The world's second most 
populous country had only 768 reported AIDS cases through the end of June, 
according to Dr. Prasanta K. Choudhuri, president of the Indian Medical Assn. 
But he conceded that the number of cases is probably substantially 
underreported and that the incidence is growing at "an alarming rate." He 
predicted that the country will have 5 million HIV-positive individuals and 1 
million AIDS cases by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the country's main problems, he said, is that the quality of condoms -- 
the best method for preventing spread of the virus during sex -- "leaves much 
to be desired." The devices, he said, have a nasty habit of breaking. Foreign 
manufacturers are being brought in to help local suppliers, he said.HUMAN IMM

SHAKE-UP EXPECTED AT TREASURY DEPARTMENT; WHITEWATER: LAWYER WHO GAVE 
EMBARRASSING TESTIMONY MAY BE FIRST TO GO. WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT STANDS BY 
OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jean Hanson, the Treasury Department lawyer who contradicted a senior Clinton 
Administration official before a bank of television cameras, appears likely to 
become the first casualty of congressional hearings into the Whitewater affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Before it's over, she may have plenty of company. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson, the department's general counsel, is expected to be pressured to 
resign by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen in the near future, according to 
department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not put a lot of money on Hanson staying," one source said. 
"Secretary Bentsen is loyal to his staff, but she did not help herself in these 
hearings." 
</P>
<P>
 During two weeks of nationally televised hearings into the Administration's 
handling of the Whitewater controversy, Hanson testified that Deputy Treasury 
Secretary Roger Altman had not fully disclosed the history of contacts between 
White House officials and savings and loan regulators who were looking into one 
aspect of the tangled Whitewater affair. She said Altman instructed her at one 
point to brief a top White House official about the status of the case, a 
directive that Altman said he did not recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury officials said Hanson's performance during the Whitewater hearings 
has poisoned her relations with Altman, and few in the department believe that 
the two can continue to work together. "If she does manage to stay, she is 
going to have to have a peace summit with Altman," one senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Hanson decides to step aside, she may be only the first to fall, 
sources said. The jobs of other senior Treasury officials -- most notably 
Altman -- remain in jeopardy despite repeated statements of support from 
President Clinton, according to senior officials at both the White House and 
the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, at least, the White House continues to stand by the team at the 
department. "We have confidence in the people that serve in this 
Administration," White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta said Sunday on 
NBC-TV's "Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
 But privately, aides say it seems certain that a major shake-up is in store at 
the department as a result of embarrassing disclosures about the department's 
role in relaying information about the S&L probe to the White House early this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Treasury officials had knowledge of the investigation because the 
department oversees the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency responsible for 
cleaning up the wreckage of the thrift industry. RTC investigators were trying 
to determine whether the Whitewater Development Corp., an ill-fated Ozarks land 
venture involving the Clintons, contributed to the taxpayer-financed collapse 
of an Arkansas thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 The repercussions for the Treasury Department might even be severe enough to 
weaken Bentsen's stature within the Administration, sources said, perhaps 
accelerating his long-rumored plans to retire within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the department's fall from grace could raise new questions about the 
viability and direction of the Clinton agenda in the post-Whitewater period. 
The department has been at the core of the policy-making process on issues 
ranging from international trade and deficit reduction to health care and 
welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the uncertainty over the Treasury Department's future was the 
surprise decision of a three-judge panel Friday to replace Robert B. Fiske Jr. 
as Whitewater independent counsel with Kenneth W. Starr, who was the Justice 
Department's solicitor general under President George Bush. Clinton White House 
officials were careful Sunday not to antagonize the new investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a waste of taxpayers' money," White House Counsel Lloyd N. 
Cutler said on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley," "But I have every 
confidence in Starr, and I think that any fair-minded independent counsel is 
going to conclude that there's not the slightest basis for any criminal 
charge." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta and Cutler both said they assumed Starr would "review" all of Fiske's 
work but not necessarily re-investigate those portions of the case -- including 
whether Treasury officials lied to Congress -- that Fiske had closed. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Clinton's lawyer in a sexual-harassment lawsuit called on Starr to 
step down from the case because of an appearance of "partisanship" against 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert S. Bennett said in a Washington Post interview that he had no personal 
doubts about Starr's "intellect and integrity." But he pointed to Starr's 
recent comments opposing Clinton's argument that he is immune as President from 
being sued by former Arkansas state employee Paula Corbin Jones and to news 
reports that Starr had planned to file a friend-of-the-court brief opposing 
Clinton's position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Starr should decline (the appointment)," Bennett said. "I think there 
is a real appearance of unfairness. If Starr found anything wrong, I don't 
think anybody could have any confidence in that." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), if Starr finds nothing 
wrong, his appointment could be a boon for the Administration because it would 
quell all speculation "that there was a whitewash on Whitewater." Appearing on 
CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," Gramm renewed his call for the firing of Altman, 
Hanson and Joshua L. Steiner, Bentsen's 28-year-old chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, both Clinton and Bentsen are said to be committed to retaining 
Altman, whom they view as one of the most effective members of the 
Administration policy-making team. But Treasury officials concede that Altman's 
government career hinges on whether Democratic congressional leaders make it 
clear to the Administration that they can continue to work with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury officials say they believe that Altman -- the central Administration 
figure in the Whitewater hearings -- has been badly damaged by the fact that 
Democratic senators have joined Republicans in questioning his conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be tough for Roger, and I think the next week or two will be 
critical for him," a senior Treasury official said. "The key will be whether 
Senate Democrats on the committees that Treasury has to deal with signal that, 
even though they think he screwed up on Whitewater, they can still work with 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to head off a congressional stampede for Altman's ouster, Panetta 
has privately ordered senior White House staffers to stop talking to the news 
media about whether Altman can survive the controversy, sources said. Longtime 
friends, including Robert E. Rubin, White House assistant for economic policy, 
have been angered by leaks about Altman and are publicly taking up his cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known Roger for 20 years; I'd vouch for Roger on absolutely anything," 
Rubin said. "As the President has said, Roger has been an outstanding deputy 
secretary, and there's no question in my mind he'll continue to be so going 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
 But some Treasury officials, embittered by reports of an imminent shake-up, 
contend that White House officials in charge of Whitewater damage control have 
been trying to deflect hostile fire toward the department by making Altman the 
fall guy. 
</P>
<P>
 While privately furious over the recent turn of events, Altman remains 
fiercely committed to remaining in office and clearing his name, according to 
sources close to him. "Public service is really important to him," a senior 
Treasury official said. "And anyway, no one wants to be run out of town." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if the Whitewater hearings have been disastrous for Hanson and Altman, 
they have been just as damaging for the Treasury Department as a whole. In 
fact, some officials say they believe the congressional grilling subjected the 
department to disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
 The stain of Whitewater has spread across almost the entire top layer of 
management at the department. Along with Hanson and Altman, whose conflicting 
testimony seemed to underscore a deep rift within the department, Steiner had 
to endure painful, detailed questions about his most private thoughts, which he 
jotted down in a diary that has become a key piece of evidence in the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen, a former U.S. senator from Texas who has generally received kid-glove 
treatment on Capitol Hill, was forced to appear before his former colleagues to 
try to justify the department's actions in the matter. Under surprisingly tough 
questioning, Bentsen distanced himself, insisting that he had no knowledge at 
the time of the department's involvement in the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 And even after he completed his grueling testimony, Altman continued to be 
subjected to public denunciations. Last Friday, leading Republicans intensified 
their demands that Altman resign, and Democratic leaders offered no defense. 
"He should behave honorably and leave," said Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), 
the ranking Republican on the Senate panel looking into Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 If he does not leave, D'Amato said, lawmakers "will be unable to rely upon any 
statement" that Altman makes to Congress. "Mr. Altman will have no 
credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such attacks, Rubin insists that Altman and the rest of the Treasury 
Department's senior staff have continued to work on the Clinton agenda without 
"missing a beat." Treasury officials stress that the bitterly partisan personal 
attacks have not prevented them from collaborating with Congress on other 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman's loss would be particularly troubling for the Administration. A former 
Wall Street investment banker and an old college friend of Clinton, Altman has 
been a leading player in crafting the White House health care agenda. Before 
Whitewater, he was regarded as an effective legislative deal-maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps his most important contribution has been to bring a more moderate 
approach to Clinton's economic and social agendas. Early in the Administration, 
Altman played a central role in persuading Clinton to embrace an economic plan 
that emphasized deficit reduction over new spending. In debates concerning the 
Clinton health plan, he has acted as a counterweight to more activist aides 
such as health care adviser Ira Magaziner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real tragedy is what's happened to Roger -- this is going to hurt his 
effectiveness for a long time," said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper 
Financial Services in Chicago and an occasional adviser to the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, outside analysts say they believe that the ouster of part or all of 
the top echelon at the Treasury Department could have a severe impact on the 
Administration's economic policies, especially overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some players on the Clinton foreign policy team, Treasury officials 
have received high marks from U.S. allies and trading partners. Bentsen, Altman 
and Lawrence Summers, undersecretary for international affairs, have helped 
reassert American influence -- which waned during the Bush Administration -- 
over the direction of international financial policies established by the Group 
of Seven industrialized nations. In addition, Altman and Summers have been at 
the center of the often acrimonious trade negotiations with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 A purge at the Treasury Department could bring economic policy development to 
a screeching halt -- at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest of the world doesn't understand Whitewater, so the scandal itself 
has had zero impact on the credibility of Treasury overseas," said Allen Stoga, 
an international economist with the consulting firm of Kissinger Associates. 
"The impact will come, however, if the Treasury team is taken apart. That would 
increase the appearance of disarray in the Administration's handling of 
economic and foreign affairs. This has been one of the best Treasury 
departments in terms of effectiveness in quite some time, and it has clearly 
been one of the best departments in this Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could be talking about taking apart one of the best parts of this 
Administration."

BELGRADE CUTS OFF KEY REBEL LINK; BOSNIA: SERB STRONGMAN MILOSEVIC SHUTS DOWN 
TV BROADCASTS ONE DAY AFTER CRITICISM BY RENEGADE LEADER KARADZIC. MOVE 
STRENGTHENS BID TO ISOLATE FACTION AND FORCE ACCEPTANCE OF PEACE PLAN. 
</P>

<P>
 Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic on Sunday cut the television link used by 
his renegade Bosnian Serb proxies to stoke war fever, strengthening his 
position in a Serb-versus-Serb power struggle in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 The relay of broadcasts from Pale, the Bosnian Serb stronghold 10 miles east 
of Sarajevo, was stopped a day after rebel leader Radovan Karadzic indirectly 
criticized Milosevic in interviews seen by Bosnian Serb viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The TV connection was cut today," U.N. Protection Force spokesman Michael 
Williams reported from mission headquarters here. "It doesn't affect our 
operations, but it would seem to be another psychological blow to the Bosnian 
Serb people." 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic announced last week that he was breaking all political and economic 
ties with the Karadzic regime for its refusal to endorse a U.S.-European peace 
plan that would give Serbs internationally recognized rule over almost half of 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The current Pale leadership refuses that formula because it would require 
Bosnian Serbs to give up about one-third of the 70% of Bosnia they now hold and 
would hinder their objective of annexing conquered territory to Milosevic's 
republic to form a Greater Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Trucks carrying munitions, fuel and other supplies to the rebels have been 
stopped at the Yugoslav border with Serb-held eastern Bosnia since Thursday, 
and Belgrade severed telephone links with the rebels a day later to underscore 
its umbrage over their refusal to compromise in the name of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic complained in television footage aired Saturday that Belgrade's 
actions had encouraged the Muslim-led Bosnian government to step up offensives 
that have cut into Serbian territorial war spoils. He also suggested that a 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization air strike Friday near Sarajevo was a 
consequence of Milosevic having abandoned the nationalist cause. 
</P>
<P>
 By interrupting the flow of televised propaganda from Pale to the Bosnian Serb 
people, Western diplomats say, Milosevic is in position to monopolize the most 
influential instrument for affecting public opinion among the war-weary Bosnian 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 If Milosevic triumphs in his bid for the hearts and minds of the Bosnian Serb 
people with telegenic appeals for them to dump Karadzic and endorse the peace 
plan, the isolated rebel population could end up with an even more radical 
nationalist as its leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The Milosevic crackdown may widen a longstanding rift between the Pale 
leadership and radical proponents of Serbian unity in the nationalist hotbed of 
Banja Luka, in northern Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers see Karadzic as the likely fall guy for the holdout policy currently 
espoused by the Bosnian Serb leadership; Belgrade media controlled by Milosevic 
have been at work for weeks on a negative campaign against the portly rebel 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear which of several ultranationalist lieutenants in the 
Bosnian Serb hierarchy might be maneuvered into Karadzic's self-styled 
presidency. But all of the potential candidates are ardent believers in 
Milosevic's drive to expand Serbian territory to unite all Serbs in the Balkans 
in one state. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Serbian president blamed for stirring up the deadly Balkan 
conflict is getting crucial backing from the international community in his 
effort to oust Karadzic and elicit rebel acceptance of the peace plan drafted 
by the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats from all five countries have praised Milosevic's recent moves to 
secure his proxies' agreement to the peace plan, and Russia has succeeded in 
convincing the Western powers that the Serbian president should be rewarded 
with immediate relief from U.N. economic sanctions if he manages to compel the 
Bosnian Serbs to sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic has set an Aug. 27-28 referendum on the peace plan following three 
rejections by his rogue government on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 With control over the airwaves and the incentive of sanctions relief for his 
own economically devastated country, Milosevic could wear down popular 
resistance to the compromises in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our view is that the referendum is still a helluva way off," U.N. spokesman 
Williams said when asked if Belgrade cut the TV link in hopes of getting 
Bosnian Serbs to favor the peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats say Milosevic, a master of political maneuvering, can be expected to 
appeal to Bosnian Serbs publicly to accept the partition formula that gives 
them 49% of Bosnia while privately assuring the hard-liners in the rebel 
leadership that no outside military force has any interest in enforcing the 
agreement.

FLAT TAX PROPONENTS WAGING AN UPHILL BATTLE; INITIATIVE: GROUP WANTS TO SET 
STATE TAX AT 2 1/2% OF ANNUAL INCOME, WITH NO DEDUCTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE CONCEPT 
HAS ATTRACTED MUCH INTEREST, BACKERS ARE FAR SHORT OF GETTING THE PLAN ON THE 
BALLOT.

<P>
 Like many Americans, Roland Boucher has long been irked by complex tax codes. 
So the Orange County retiree is trying to unleash California's next great tax 
revolt -- on behalf of a "flat tax." 
</P>
<P>
 Boucher and two associates -- who were drawn together by Ross Perot's 
unsuccessful presidential campaign -- say they have recruited 1,500 volunteers 
to help qualify a proposition for the 1996 statewide ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling themselves United Californians for Tax Reform and operating out of a 
cramped office near John Wayne Airport, they propose that the state simply 
collect 2 1/2% of a worker's annual income. That's the equivalent of one hour's 
wages each week, leading to the group's motto: "An hour a week is all 
Sacramento gets to keep." 
</P>
<P>
 The rate also is just a fraction of current state income tax, which can rise 
as high as 11% for upper-income brackets. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is hardly alone in its pursuit of the flat tax. The concept has been 
embraced by politicians as disparate as Jerry Brown and Bruce Herschensohn. In 
Washington, several congressmen are pushing various versions of the tax these 
days. Closer to home, Reagan-era economist Arthur Laffer has been busy drafting 
a flat tax initiative of his own for the 1996 statewide ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 In each case, simplicity is a paramount part of the sales pitch. United 
Californians for Tax Reform boast that their proposal is so uncomplicated, 
returns would be filed on postcard-sized forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's great populist appeal in the idea of a simplified tax form," 
said Steve Hayward, research director at Pacific Research Institute, a 
conservative think tank in San Francisco. "This could become one of the 
political ideas of the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
 Backers say a streamlined tax code would give the economy a boost by slashing 
the cost of tax preparers, accountants and attorneys. Investors, meanwhile, 
could focus on economic considerations rather than the art of avoiding taxes, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, meanwhile, say the flat tax favors the rich, who stand to gain with 
lowered rates, and would limit government's ability to handle emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a can of worms," said Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Sacramento), chairman of the 
Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee. "They're saying we know everything 
that's going to happen, every cost to the state, and that's not the case. What 
about the Medfly, the occasional riot, earthquakes?" 
</P>
<P>
 Greene also says that trying to revamp the state tax system via the initiative 
process is fraught with peril. Instead of going through "the crucible" of 
countless Legislative hearings before experts, initiatives are the product of 
only a few minds, he said, and "the odds are they got it wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 A review by the state legislative analyst concluded that the proposal by 
United Californians for Tax Reform could cost $179 million each year in lost 
revenue. The group insists that the loss -- roughly 1% of the more than $16 
billion in income taxes now collected by the state -- would hardly bankrupt 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 To help ease the transition from the status quo, an additional 2 1/2% would be 
assessed for the first five years on individual income over $52,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Boucher, a former aerospace manager, said he became frustrated with the tax 
system after he launched a business in the 1970s selling radio-controlled toy 
cars. "Every person making an equal income ought to pay equal taxes," he said. 
"That means no deductions, credits, exemptions. Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 But he and his cohorts -- Paul Arndt, who worked with Boucher at Hughes 
Aircraft and is now retired, and real estate manager Chuck Alvord -- are having 
a rough time revving up their campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the corps of volunteers and a snappy phone number -- (800) 540-FLAT -- 
United Californians for Tax Reform has collected only 50,000 signatures for the 
measure, far short of the 376,000 they need by the end of September to qualify 
for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also is short on cash, and they haven't it hasn't even been able to 
get an endorsement from United We Stand, the grass-roots group formed by Perot 
followers. "We've been ignored," lamented Boucher. 
</P>
<P>
 If Boucher's tax plan makes the ballot, it would likely end up in competition 
with the proposal being sculpted by Laffer. His idea, similar to the proposal 
pushed by former Gov. Brown during the 1992 presidential race, is to eliminate 
all taxes -- everything from property to income taxes -- and replace them with 
a flat tax that would be the same for individuals and business. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is still being tinkered with, but the idea is to ensure that 
taxes collected by state and local government remain at 10.71% of the personal 
income of California residents. Laffer's plan also allows a few exemptions -- 
donations to charities, mortgage interest or rent payments, and disability and 
Social Security income. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Orange County group is struggling to collect signatures, Laffer has 
joined forces with an old hand at ballot measures -- People's Advocate Inc., 
the direct-mail group created by the late Paul Gann, co-author of Proposition 
13. Laffer said more than $400,000 has been raised for the signature-gathering, 
which has yet to begin.

IN COURT, POG IS NOT JUST A GAME; MARKETING: TWO GROUPS ARE FIGHTING OVER 
WHETHER THE NAME OF THE POPULAR KIDS' PASTIME IS A TRADEMARK. THE OUTCOME COULD 
BE WORTH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

 A three-letter word for the latest schoolyard rage has landed at the center of 
a high-stakes legal battle that is being played out in an Orange County 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The word is pog . And the issue that will likely be settled during a jury 
trial this fall is who can legally market the name for the colorful, coin-sized 
discs that look like milk-bottle caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal Pogs Assn. Inc. is suing the World Pog Federation, disputing the 
federation's claims of exclusive rights to the name. It's a battle that the 
owner of Universal Pogs says he is prepared to fight all the way to the U.S. 
Supreme Court if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our position that the word pog is generic," said Robert B. Rosenstein, 
an attorney representing Universal Pogs. "Everybody in the world uses the name 
pog." 
</P>
<P>
 World Pog Federation attorneys, however, say the company holds the rights to 
the name and is seeking a court order barring Universal Pogs from using the 
P-word in its name and products. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same claim made by people who have challenged the name Coke as being 
generic for soda, the same people who challenged Kleenex as being generic for 
tissue," said Michael Eidel, an attorney representing the World Pog Federation. 
"Those are still trademark names." 
</P>
<P>
 The legal dispute began last month and is being watched closely by other 
competitors in a fast-growing industry that some predict could generate $1 
billion this year alone. Universal Pogs estimates about 10 million of the discs 
are produced a week in California by just a fraction of the manufacturers that 
have become involved with the game in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be the Hula-Hoops of '94 and '95," said Jim Mitchell, president 
and chief executive officer of Garden Grove-based Safeco Plastics Inc. and SPI 
KAPS, which manufactures milk cap products. "It's a fun game. I love watching 
the kids play." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell is among those in the industry who believe pog should be used 
generically to describe the game, not "milk caps," as World Pog Federation has 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
 He challenges anyone to go out with a stack of regular milk caps and ask 
children and adults alike what they are called. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will get the same response from everybody," he said. "They are pogs." 
</P>
<P>
 The game in the midst of the furor is simple and played much like marbles, but 
with silver-dollar-sized plastic and cardboard milk caps, similar to the flat 
circles once used to seal glass milk bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 Players hurl a heavier plastic disc known as a slammer or kini onto a stack of 
the cardboard caps. The trick is to flip the cardboard caps over by hitting 
them. Rules vary, with children playing for points or to keep the caps they 
successfully flip. Children also collect the discs, which are decorated with 
various logos, sayings, personalities and characters. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the game has become so popular that some local schools have 
banned it during recess and other breaks, citing concerns of gambling and 
disruption. Others, however, praise the game, similar to ones played with 
old-fashioned milk caps dating back to the 1920s, for encouraging social 
interaction and teaching sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 As the legend of the game's revival goes, a teacher at an Oahu elementary 
school rounded up milk covers from a Hawaiian dairy several years ago and 
introduced the game to her students. The disc of choice among the children was 
a cap for a drink of passion fruit, orange and guava, otherwise known as POG. 
Hence the name. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Rypinski, president and chief executive officer of World Pog Federation, 
said he competed against others and in September, 1993, obtained all rights to 
the POG brand name from the Haleakala Dairy for the game, as well as the fruit 
drink. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a company makes a very big success and pays attention, as we have paid 
as a corporation, to launching this brand and this wonderful kids' game for the 
world, there are always a number of (people) who want to tag along," Rypinski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 His company sends hundreds of letters each week warning retailers and others 
that they can't use the name pog unless they are selling trademark products 
from World Pog Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are interested in protecting our rights to the fullest extent," Rypinski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joe Kaufenberg, president of Universal Pogs, said others were using the 
name pog for their products long before World Pog Federation arrived on the 
scene. He disputes Rypinski's claims to exclusive name rights and says such 
claims restrict trade and give World Pog Federation an unfair business 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dairy sells juice, they don't sell pogs," Kaufenberg said. "And even if 
they had a trademark on their juice, that doesn't give them the rights to the 
paper pogs or the slammers." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufenberg, whose company manufactures caps and slammers, said many retailers 
shy away from using other milk cap brands because they want to display the 
recognizable name of pog. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the retailers would know it's a generic name, it would be fair game for 
everybody to go out there and sell their pogs," he said. "It's a new hobby for 
the kids that they really enjoy. It's a cheap hobby for them to get into. It 
keeps the kids off the streets. They spend hours playing." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Jane D. Myers is 
considering motions from both sides on how to handle use of the word until the 
trial begins in November. Rosenstein, Kaufenberg's attorney, said the company 
is also taking federal action to dispute World Pog Federation's trademark 
application. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufenberg said he'll take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court if he has to, 
adding: "There's just too many people in this country using pog. "

DEEP IN HISTORY; RESEARCHERS PLUMB OCEAN, DOCUMENTS FOR CHANNEL SHIPWRECKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scuba diving off the coast of Santa Rosa Island one day, Don Morris came 
across an archeological puzzle: the scattered remains of a ship. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Channel Islands National Park archeologist, Morris had spent years 
researching shipwrecks around the islands off the Ventura County coast. But he 
had no record of a ship sinking at that spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a volunteer came across a paragraph in an obscure 1931 Coast Guard 
document: "received word by radio that the W. T. & B No. 60, a motor barge, was 
on fire and abandoned. . . . Derelict was sighted and towed to East Point, 
Santa Rosa Island, where derelict was demolished." 
</P>
<P>
 Logbooks from the Coast Guard cutter confirmed that the metal and wood Morris 
spotted was the remains of the Washington Tug & Barge Co. ship destroyed 63 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris added another shipwreck to his list. 
</P>
<P>
 That list -- compiled from yellowed newspapers, ships logs, Coast Guard 
records and sightings of remains -- now includes 79 wrecks within a mile of the 
five-island park. Another 25 ships sank within the park's sanctuary, which 
extends for six miles around the islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, working with volunteers, has documented each of those wrecks in a 
250-page report set for publication this December. Researchers, students, scuba 
divers and park rangers trying to protect wreck sites could use the report one 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morris has not finished his research. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've still got 50 wrecks to find," said Morris, running his hand through his 
long graying hair. "I compare the archeologist to a trial attorney. If you just 
went with victims' testimony, that gives you part of the story. But to get a 
fuller picture, you really need to go out and find the physical evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 This is no treasure hunt. Any gold that sank with the ships has long since 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, it is more like a scavenger hunt, searching for odd pieces of history 
that reveal how ships were built, why they wrecked, even the way people lived. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the anchor from the three-masted schooner Comet buried in the sand on 
San Miguel Island. And the pale-blue piece of plank, a clue to what the 
schooner Golden Horn looked like before it wrecked on Santa Rosa. And the brass 
fixtures of the Winfield Scott, the elegant side-wheel paddle boat that sank 
near Anacapa Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of loss to history, the worst thing is when these vessels are 
scrapped," Morris said. "They really do vanish. Wrecks in the water are really 
quite durable. An awful lot is preserved under water." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Morris still remembers the memo he found in his files when he took the Channel 
Islands job in 1985. Written in the 1960s, it asserted that there were no 
shipwrecks in the area. By 1985, the U.S. Park Service had found only two. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a map on Morris' wall is covered with steel thumbtacks, each one 
indicating a wreck site he has surveyed. He scans the map, then adds another 
tack for a wreck he has just found on the south end of Santa Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
 The islands, sprinkled across the Santa Barbara Channel and often shrouded in 
fog, create a natural navigational hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest wreck found in the park's waters is the Winfield Scott, a steamer 
laden with gold that sank in 1853. The most recent occurred this spring, when a 
boat pulled away from its moorings and rammed into the San Miguel coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the shipwreck searches begin in the library, scanning old newspapers 
and merchant vessel books for accounts of accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, researchers turned to the National Archives for further detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Schwemmer, a volunteer from Santa Clarita, traveled to San Francisco and 
Washington, D.C., to tap archives there. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned with century-old handwritten wreck reports. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his document searches solved a Channel Islands mystery, the legend of 
the Legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumor had it that the sleek racing yacht, famous for winning the Transpac race 
from California to Hawaii, had sunk off the islands. There were even pictures 
of the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one had seen the remains or found any records of the accident. 
Schwemmer checked one registry for a pleasure craft called the Legend. When he 
found it, he checked another book for the owner's name. 
</P>
<P>
 He called directory information, got the owner's telephone number, and asked 
him about the Legend. The owner was able to confirm that the yacht had, indeed, 
gone down off San Miguel Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mystery of the research -- it's exciting," Schwemmer said. "It's that 
challenge to uncover somebody's history." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That history will be set down in the 250-page report Morris and his volunteers 
have compiled. The report will appear in a series of National Park Service 
books with the uninspiring title, "Submerged Cultural Resources Assessment." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the Park Service hopes to create a more popular version of the 
book, which students, park visitors and scuba divers can use. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris admits his work this summer has been overshadowed by another 
archeological find: A rare fossilized skeleton of a pygmy mammoth on Santa Rosa 
Island. He was on the island, looking for shipwrecks, when two colleagues 
stumbled across the mammoth. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, he will join an excavation team unearthing the fossil, believed to 
be the first full skeleton of the ancestral elephant ever found. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the mammoth bones, the shipwrecks reveal far more than the battered 
remnants left behind, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take the Gold Rush era. Most people came to California by sea, not land," 
Morris said. "By far the most accessible of these vessels, the easiest one to 
see, is the Winfield Scott. That's the only place to see the best example of 
what's left of the Gold Rush era steamer." 
</P>
<P>
 But the research could also draw new scavengers hunting for treasure in the 
ruined ships. For years, scuba divers have pocketed gold coins, picked up 
antique nails, even sawed off brass fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose we're like the people who run Mt. Vernon," Morris said. "We want 
people to come. We want people to enjoy the history. But we don't want people 
to walk away with the good silverware -- or the bad silverware." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1987 sting operation, the Park Service put two rangers on a diving trip 
and ended up charging the ship's captain and about 20 divers with violations. 
</P>
<P>
 By locating more wreck sites, Morris said, the park rangers can protect them 
better.

CUBANS RALLY AS U.S. PLAYS DOWN UNREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Times Wire Services

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of thousands of Cubans gathered at Havana's Revolution Square on 
Sunday to show support for the government, two days after clashes in the 
capital that injured 35 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The sea of people waved Cuban flags, chanted revolutionary slogans and stood 
through a rain shower to hear Deputy Defense Minister Ulises Rosales del Toro 
reiterate Cuba's angry charge that the United States was behind the 
unprecedented clashes, the worst in the capital in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, officials sought to play down the unrest and the 
possibility of an exodus of refugees from the island. 
</P>
<P>
 The clashes were triggered by at least three hijackings of ferries in 10 days 
by Cubans seeking to leave illegally by sea for the United States. In a speech 
Friday, Cuban President Fidel Castro blamed the United States for encouraging 
the exodus and threatened to allow free emigration, raising the specter of the 
1980 Mariel boat lift, in which about 120,000 Cubans came to South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Without saying how it would do so, the Clinton Administration quickly promised 
to prevent another such influx. An Administration official, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said Sunday that one option is a blockade by U.S. 
warships of the passage between Key West, Fla., and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's gathering in Havana was in honor of 19-year-old police officer 
Gabriel Lamoth Caballero, killed by hijackers who commandeered a ferry 
Thursday. The body of a second officer killed in the same incident has not yet 
been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 That ferry hijacking ended with authorities bringing the hijackers and 
passengers back to Havana after the vessel ran out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday newspaper Juventud Rebelde -- the youth Communist weekly -- said 35 
people, including 10 police officers, were injured in Friday's clashes between 
police and stone-throwers along a stretch of the Malecon seafront drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper said "important groups" had been arrested but did not give a number. 
</P>
<P>
 Juventud Rebelde said 300 to 400 people gathered near the port early in the 
morning and were dispersed. Following that, 21 people tried to commandeer a 
tugboat, even though it had no motor, and were detained, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, about 700 people congregated near the port, and clashes erupted around 
the Hotel Deauville, along the Malecon, the newspaper added. 
</P>
<P>
 Granma, the Communist Party daily, published a graphic account of the clashes, 
quoting members of civilian law enforcement brigades. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hit the eye out of one colleague, broke the skull of another and split 
another's head," Granma quoted one man as saying. Said another: "Stones were 
flying all over the place. . . . It was a body-to-body clash, and we pushed 
them back." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba says U.S. policy stimulates illegal exits because Washington limits the 
visas it grants but allows Cubans who have left the island illegally to stay in 
the United States.

ISRAEL, JORDAN BEGIN TO BRIDGE GAPS; MIDEAST: THE BORDER TOWN OF EILAT HOPES TO 
BASK IN THE GLOW OF WARMING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The "peace promenade" exists now only as a narrow strip of granite walkway 
bordering a few hundred yards of seashore at the southern tip of Israel's 
southernmost coastal town. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Gabi Kadosh is convinced that someday soon, the promenade will 
stretch around the Gulf of Aqaba, linking the Egyptian resort of Taba to 
Israel's Eilat, meandering on to Jordan's Aqaba and ending somewhere over the 
Jordan-Saudi border. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire distance from Taba to the Jordanian border with Saudi Arabia is 
just 8 1/2 miles, Kadosh pointed out. But for years, to the residents of Eilat 
it seemed much farther than that. This resort town lived in isolation from its 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with relations warming rapidly between Israel and Jordan, the 8 1/2 
miles is shrinking fast and Eilatis believe they will feel the impact of peace 
between Israel and Jordan, when it comes, more immediately than any other 
Israeli city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a prophet, but I have a feeling peace will come very fast now," said 
Kadosh, a member of the nationalist Likud bloc who was elected mayor just nine 
months ago. On his office wall, a new picture -- of Kadosh shaking hands with 
Jordan's King Hussein at last month's White House ceremony ending Israel and 
Jordan's 46-year state of war -- is displayed even more prominently than that 
of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, Likud's first party leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the king began his statement by saying, 'I have waited all my life for 
this moment,' I knew it came from the bottom of his heart," Kadosh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that ceremony, which brought Hussein and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin together publicly for the first time, peace negotiations between the two 
states have gained momentum. On his way back to Jordan last week, Hussein 
thrilled Israelis by flying over Israel for the first time, with an escort of 
Israeli air force jet fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams of negotiators from both nations resume talks Tuesday aimed at 
fashioning a peace treaty. This time, the talks are taking place in Israel 
rather than thousands of miles away in Washington, where they dragged on at a 
desultory pace for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 And today, Rabin plans to join Crown Prince Hassan and U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher for a festive opening of a new border crossing between the 
two nations, just a few miles north of the twin ports of Aqaba and Eilat. At 
first, the crossing will be used only by tourists carrying passports that are 
neither Israeli nor Jordanian, but both sides expect that Jordanians and 
Israelis will also be able to cross soon. 
</P>
<P>
 After the ceremony, Rabin and a small group of Israelis will take a helicopter 
to Aqaba to join Hussein and Christopher for lunch at the king's summer palace. 
Hussein also has invited Rabin and his party to join him for a sail on the 
royal yacht after lunch. Hussein is making the sort of gestures Israelis crave 
as they continue to search for acceptance and offers of friendship from their 
Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the sense of excitement, Israeli President Ezer Weizman telephoned 
Hussein in Amman on Sunday, inaugurating direct communications between Israel 
and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is all happening so fast, it feels like a dream to many of us," said 
Yehudit Ostfeld, a 30-year resident of Eilat who moved here when it was a 
village of 6,000 people. Today, the town boasts 35,000 residents and an 
ever-increasing number of luxury hotels. But for decades, Ostfeld said, Eilatis 
have felt hemmed in, wedged between hostile neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always thought that Jordan was not in the ordinary category of Arab 
enemies," Ostfeld said. "We could look across the bay and see Aqaba. It seemed 
so close, too close for us to be enemies. We felt that if there wasn't this 
huge conflict between Israel and the Arab states, Jordan and Israel could have 
made peace long ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Kadosh said he already is counting on meeting his Aqaba counterpart and on 
being able to enlist his help in tackling the problems of pollution, sewage 
treatment, water supply and insect control that plague the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Eilat, peace will be a huge change," Kadosh said. "Right now, we are a 
border city. Tourists in Europe or anywhere else hesitate to come to Eilat, 
because they think it must be a dangerous place, surrounded by enemies. But 
soon, we will be a city of peace, a bridge for people traveling to Egypt, to 
Jordan to Israel or Saudi Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
 Kadosh said his administration already is working on plans to market Eilat as 
a base from which tourists can visit Aqaba, the ancient Jordanian city of 
Petra, Taba in Egypt's Sinai desert or even Mecca, Islam's holiest city, in 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 Kadosh's office is cluttered with drawings for vacation villages and housing 
tracts that he believes will begin to sprout rapidly once a peace treaty is 
signed. By the turn of the century, he predicted, the city's population will 
have ballooned to 60,000 -- all because of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Washington, at the ceremony, I felt I was witnessing not just the signing 
of a piece of paper but a marriage, the marriage of two peoples," Kadosh said.

RENO MAY REQUEST INDEPENDENT COUNSEL FOR ESPY INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno could ask as soon as this week for the appointment of an 
independent counsel to complete the stalemated investigation into whether 
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy improperly accepted gifts from a prominent 
Arkansas poultry producer, Justice Department sources said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department investigators concluded weeks ago that Espy's acceptance of 
travel, lodging and professional football tickets from Don Tyson, the head of 
Tyson Foods Inc., the nation's largest chicken producer, constituted a 
technical violation of the Meat Inspection Act of 1907. That law prohibits meat 
regulators from accepting gifts and carries a one-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have alleged that those gifts may also be related to the Agriculture 
Department's decision to delay tougher inspection procedures for the poultry 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Justice Department officials said appointment of an independent 
counsel would not suggest that new and more damaging facts about Espy had come 
to light. Rather, it would provide a means of resolving a dispute between law 
enforcement authorities concerning the Espy case. 
</P>
<P>
 High-level Justice Department officials pressed to close the case this spring, 
saying investigators had found insufficient evidence that Espy's actions 
violated the law. But FBI officials said they believed that they had not yet 
exhausted all avenues of inquiry in the investigation.

 After Congress in June renewed the law creating the office of independent 
counsel, Justice Department officials concluded that they effectively had no 
choice but to seek the appointment of a counsel as a referee. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley," White House Counsel 
Lloyd N. Cutler said the law "requires the appointment of an independent 
counsel for someone like Mr. Espy if further investigation is warranted." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Espy hired former federal prosecutor Reid Weingarten to represent 
him in the case. Before entering private practice, Weingarten had spent several 
years in the Justice Department's public integrity section, which has been 
supervising the Espy case. 
</P>
<P>
 Weingarten and a spokeswoman for Espy did not return calls to their homes 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to the case may hinge on whether Espy accepted favors at the same time 
he was delaying the imposition of Agriculture Department standards governing 
inspections at chicken-processing plants, including 66 plants operated by Tyson 
Foods. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government eventually toughened the regulations, but only after 
the proposals were first scrapped on order of Espy's chief of staff.

IRISH GUERRILLAS KILL WOMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Protestant guerrillas killed a pregnant Roman Catholic woman in her bedroom 
Sunday, but left her five children unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone message to a radio station, the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force 
admitted murdering Kathleen O'Hagan. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hagan, 38, who was six months pregnant, was killed when gunmen broke into 
her house overnight in a rural area known for its hard-line support of 
unification with Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 "She evidently heard them force their way through the back door and had got 
out of bed," said a police spokesman in Omagh, where the attack took place. 
"They shot her a number of times in the bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Her children, all younger than 8, were in the house but were unhurt. A 
17-month-old boy was in a crib by her bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said O'Hagan's husband, Patrick, came home a few hours after the attack 
to find her dead and their children distraught. 
</P>
<P>
 Security sources said he had once been imprisoned for possessing arms and may 
have been the intended target of the UVF, which wants Northern Ireland to 
remain British. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hagan's death brings to 52 the number of people killed in political and 
sectarian violence this year.

WASHINGTON OUTLOOK: NATION SEEKING COMMON STANDARDS FOR SOCIAL POLICIES; MOVE 
REFLECTS A HUNGER FOR UNIFORM RULES OF BEHAVIOR THAT TRANSCEND POLITICS AND 
CULTURAL DIFFERENCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Look around at the most powerful ideas emerging in education, crime and 
welfare policy and the same current runs through them: a hunger for firm and 
simple rules. From Washington to the individual states, shrewd leaders in both 
parties are trying to ground social policies in an idea so old it seems new: 
that common standards of behavior can and should be applied to everyone. If 
this inchoate movement had a motto, it might be: "No excuses, no exceptions." 
Historian Fred Siegel calls this emerging policy trend the "end to 
exculpation." 
</P>
<P>
 The impulse to impose common standards is advancing along two tracks. The 
no-excuses policy line attempts to assure uniformit y of treatment -- so that 
minimum standards are imposed on everyone, regardless of circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment runs through the new national educational standards, which 
establish uniform expectations for rich and poor students alike; the 
proliferating municipal ordinances against aggressive panhandling, which 
establish minimum rules of public conduct even for the homeless and destitute; 
and the push in Congress and states from Colorado to Georgia to treat violent 
young people the same as all other criminals by lowering the age at which 
juveniles can be tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The no-exceptions line of policies attempts to ensure certainty of treatment 
-- by restricting government institutions, from schools to courts, from 
granting exemptions to established standards. That idea is motivating the 
three-strikes provisions that require life imprisonment for three-time 
convicted felons; the truth-in-sentencing laws that require prisoners to serve 
a fixed percentage of their time; the two-year time limit that President 
Clinton has proposed for welfare recipients and the Dianne Feinstein-sponsored 
amendment approved by the Senate last month that generally would require all 
school districts receiving federal money to expel for at least a year any 
student found with a gun in class. 
</P>
<P>
 These policies expose a basic fault line between elite and popular opinion. 
Academic experts and editorial commentators mostly view ideas such as 
three-strikes and the two-year welfare time limit not as simple but simplistic, 
insensitive to nuance, and unforgiving of human imperfection. But it is the 
very certainty of these policies -- the clarity and even rigidity of their 
message -- that makes them overwhelmingly popular with the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people believe is, as a country, we've lost sight of the fundamentals 
and spent too much time arguing about the exceptions to the rules, rather than 
the rules themselves," said Democratic pollster Geoff Garin. 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of these ideas testifies to the anxiety over America's moral 
direction. Implicit in the push for embedding simple rules in public policy is 
the fear that simple rules are no longer being taught in private life. In part, 
this thrust represents the belief that when parents cannot set or maintain 
clear standards, society must -- a calculation most nakedly apparent in the 
proliferation of youth curfew statutes nationwide. Said Garin: "People feel the 
reason we are in trouble with our values is the failure to insist on 
standards." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of these ideas are as attractive to moderate Democrats as to 
Republicans, the common-standards agenda directly challenges the cultural world 
view of the post-1960s left. The belief that uniform rules can transcend racial 
and ethnic differences rejects the dominant academic ideology of 
multiculturalism, which calls for public policy to bend to those differences. 
And the idea that all must meet the same objective standards is an arrow at the 
concept of disparate impact that has guided liberal thought on race relations 
for the past quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
 As a legal matter, the disparate-impact doctrine holds that seemingly neutral 
standards (like a business requiring high school diplomas for new employees) 
can be racially discriminatory if they disproportionately affect members of one 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Extrapolated from the legal to political arena, disparate-impact logic 
inspires the principal objections when common standard proposals are raised. 
Some liberals resisted the national educational standards, for example, for 
fear that a disproportionate number of students from low-income neighborhoods 
might flunk them; in the crime debate, House liberals led by the Congressional 
Black Caucus asserted that tougher sentencing policies would mean the 
incarceration of a disproportionate number of minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Those pushing elements of the common-standards agenda argue that instead of 
focusing on how policies affect specific groups, government should ask how it 
affects the whole. Moreover, proponents like Rob Teir, general counsel of the 
American Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities, argue that poor communities 
suffer when they are effectively exempted from uniform standards -- for 
instance by leaving students with the impression that the schools don't believe 
they can learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the left has legitimate questions about whether, in practice, 
simplicity and certainty can produce irrationality: Congress recognized as much 
in the crime bill awaiting final action by providing potential waivers from 
mandatory minimum sentences for first-time, nonviolent drug offenders now 
jamming expensive prison space. 
</P>
<P>
 And liberals are right to question whether politicians will prove as 
enthusiastic about applying common standards to powerful interests as to the 
dispossessed. One example: as several members of the Congressional Black Caucus 
pointedly asked earlier this year, if it is reasonable to expect a young woman 
to ween herself from government assistance after two years, why shouldn't the 
same standard be applied to farmers or dozens of other interests receiving 
indefinite government subsidies? 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those objections, the common-standards agenda is almost certainly 
going to advance because it reflects the public's hunger for restoring basic 
rules of conduct. For government at all levels, the real challenge will be 
finding a reasonable balance between refusing to accept anti-social behavior 
and ignoring the objective conditions that can contribute to it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's reality, not relativism, to acknowledge that young people growing up amid 
violence, broken families and enervating poverty face enormous barriers to 
meeting middle-class standards of conduct and educational performance. That 
doesn't mean society should condone self-destructive or violent behavior -- but 
it does mean Clinton has a point when he says that while government is 
demanding responsibility, it must also do more to expand opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 That synthesis is Clinton's unique contribution to thinking about social 
policy. But both political parties are resisting the deal. Liberals like aid 
without standards (as in more help for welfare recipients without the common 
standard of time limits). Conservatives like standards without aid (as in 
tougher penalties for lawbreakers without social programs aimed at deterring 
crime). 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the linking of standards and aid that makes possible a broad social 
consensus. The flawed but valuable crime bill underscores the point: After 
years of gridlock, Clinton and Congress have brought it to the brink of passage 
only by combining punishment, law enforcement and prevention. Politically and, 
more important, morally, common standards and common obligations are 
inextricably bound. Ideas in Action 
</P>
<P>
 The common standards agenda is influencing federal initiatives such as the 
"Goals 2000" Education bill, the crime bill and President Clinton's welfare 
proposal. But many of the ideas are already turning up in state and city 
initiatives. Here's a sampling:

HIJACKING ENDS WITHOUT INJURY IN NICARAGUA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Salvadoran claiming he had an explosive device hijacked a commercial 
airliner carrying 78 passengers Sunday, but the crisis ended peacefully when he 
was arrested at the airport here, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicaraguan Interior Minister Alfredo Mendieta told reporters that three 
military intelligence agents posing as civilian negotiators captured the 
hijacker after determining that an alleged bomb he had wielded was a fake. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said he was seeking asylum outside his country, but his motives were 
not clear. The hijacker was carrying a passport that identified him as Angel 
Alberto Salguera Narvaez, 24, but Mendieta said the passport may be fake. 
</P>
<P>
 The hijacking began in Guatemala where Salguera boarded a Panamanian COPA 
airlines Boeing 737 en route to El Salvador. While over his native country, 
Salguera unveiled a taped-up bundle he said was a bomb and ordered the pilot to 
fly to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a COPA press release, the pilot, Capt. Jorge Llaurado, told 
Salguera the plane did not have enough fuel to reach Mexico and instead flew to 
Managua. 
</P>
<P>
 The passengers were allowed to leave the plane as it sat on the runway, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendieta said Nicaraguan and Salvadoran officials were conferring about how to 
proceed since the hijacking occurred in Salvadoran airspace. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Salguera, who was carrying a Bible, was thought to be an opponent of 
El Salvador's rightist government but it was not known if he had fought with 
leftist rebels in the 12-year civil war that ended in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Charry, a Reuters news service technician on board the flight, said the 
crew handled the problem so quietly that passengers were unaware of any problem 
until the pilot announced before landing that an "abnormal situation" had come 
up.

COLOMBIAN CHIEF VOWS TO PRESS DRUG WAR; INAUGURATION: NEW PRESIDENT REJECTS 
U.S. CRITICISM, DENIES CHARGES HIS CAMPAIGN ACCEPTED MONEY FROM CARTEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Promising firm action against drug traffickers and renewed efforts to bring an 
end to the oldest guerrilla war in South America, Ernesto Samper was sworn in 
as Colombia's president Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Samper, an economist and veteran political insider, took power amid suspicions 
that his presidential campaign accepted money from the world's biggest cocaine 
barons. Samper admitted that the offer was made but denied accepting it. 
Nevertheless, the allegations strained relations with Washington and raised 
doubts about Colombia's resolve to press the drug war. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to dispel the suspicions, Samper vowed to make ending the drug 
trade a priority for his government. But he also complained that "nobody in the 
world has the moral right to give our country lessons on how to fight the 
narco-traffickers." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have combatted -- and we will continue to combat -- drug trafficking 
because of our conviction, because of the serious damage that it has done to 
Colombian society," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Samper, 44, spoke during an inaugural ceremony at Bogota's 16th-Century Plaza 
Bolivar with an audience of 4,000, including Cuban President Fidel Castro and 
six other Latin heads of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Security was tight; sharpshooters guarded rooftops and armored personnel 
carriers patrolled streets. 
</P>
<P>
 With emotion, the former economic development minister recalled the 1989 
assassination attempt against him, allegedly by drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 Samper has been the object of international scrutiny since a cassette 
recording revealed attempts by the heads of the Cali cocaine cartel to 
contribute approximately $4 million to his presidential campaign. The 
revelations, coming just days after his narrow June 19 victory and compounded 
by past allegations of drug connections, sent U.S.-Colombian relations 
plummeting to one of their lowest levels in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Insisting on his innocence, Samper has promised to increase penalties for drug 
traffickers, although he said he would continue the policy of offering leniency 
to traffickers who surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have blasted that policy, fearing that it will be used to give 
a break to the leaders of the Cali cartel, believed to be the world's most 
powerful drug organization, with annual profits of between $5 billion and $30 
billion. The cartel is said to control 80% of the world's cocaine trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Samper said Sunday that countries where cocaine is consumed, principally the 
United States, must do their share in the drug war. 
</P>
<P>
 "My government will be as bold and resolute in the eradication of illicit 
crops and the persecution of drug traffickers as it will be categorical in 
demanding effective action by (drug-consuming) nations in reducing demand and 
controlling money laundering," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to a somber and largely impassive audience, the new president also 
expressed his willingness to find a political solution to a decades-old 
guerrilla war between leftist rebels and the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The guerrillas launched a major nationwide offensive last month, attacking 
military bases, blowing up bridges and briefly occupying small towns on the 
outskirts of Bogota in an effort to pressure the new government to the peace 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 government troops were killed, including a senior army officer, 
Maj. Gen. Carlos Julio Gil. 
</P>
<P>
 Samper reiterated his desire for peace Sunday. But he warned that would happen 
only when the rebels offer clear signs of a change of heart, and then only in 
direct negotiations with the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to concerns of both guerrillas and human rights groups, the new 
president promised to curb rampant abuses by the police and military. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia's security forces have been widely accused of assassinating members 
of leftist groups and of "social-cleansing" operations against street children, 
beggars, prostitutes and gays. 
</P>
<P>
 Curbing the killing in this violent nation, with about 28,000 homicides per 
year in a population of 35 million, will be crucial in attracting foreign 
investment to help finance badly needed social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence has been a key factor in perpetuating chronic poverty among an 
estimated 46% of Colombia's population, especially in the badly underdeveloped 
countryside, despite generally healthy economic growth spurred by the outgoing 
government's free-market policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Samper took over from President Cesar Gaviria. Both are of the Liberal Party, 
one of two political parties that have dominated Colombian politics for 
decades.

VATICAN DENIES REPORT OF COMPLICITY IN POPE'S SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Vatican dismissed as ridiculous an allegation by an Italian newspaper 
Sunday that some of the Holy See's senior figures ordered the 1981 shooting 
that almost killed Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily La Voce, quoting testimony from Oral Celik, a Turk suspected at one 
time of helping gunman Mehmet Ali Agca, said that Vatican officials ordered 
Agca to shoot but not kill the pontiff and that other senior Italians were also 
involved in the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors made no comment on the report, but chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin 
Navarro dismissed it. "This daydream is too ridiculous and at the same time not 
clever enough to be considered," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Celik's lawyer denied the claims attributed to his client. "This is absolutely 
untrue. I categorically deny that he made statements of this type," lawyer 
Michele Gentiloni told Italian state television. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said Celik had given details and named names to support his theory 
and was being held at a secret location under 24-hour guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkish gunman Agca shot and seriously wounded the Pope on May 13, 1981, as 
the pontiff toured a crowded St. Peter's Square in an open-top jeep after his 
weekly Wednesday audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Agca is serving a life sentence for the attack.

WORKPLACE SMOKING BANS RAISE CONCERNS; REGULATION: WITH MORE LOCALITIES 
IMPOSING CONTROLS, QUESTIONS ABOUND ON HOW FAR THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD GO TO 
ENSURE EMPLOYEE SAFETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carol Isen, a teacher and tutor of grade school children, is a nonsmoker who 
says she welcomes the growing nationwide movement toward eliminating smoking in 
the workplace. However, as someone who works both in the classroom and in 
private homes, she wonders just how far such restrictions should go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not tutor in a house where there is smoking, but that's my personal 
choice," the Rockville, Md., resident said. "I don't believe the government 
should be legislating homes. I think that's way too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Her sentiments reflect a growing number of concerns being raised across the 
country as the federal government and many states, cities and municipalities 
propose or enact far-reaching restrictions against smoking in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 While ardent anti-smokers are overjoyed about the changes, businesses -- from 
restaurants to hotels to bowling alleys -- fear heavy economic losses if 
smoking is banned in their establishments. Those fears persist despite early 
studies indicating no financial hardships actually occur. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond those sharply focused, pragmatic concerns loom larger questions of 
precisely how to define a workplace and how much government regulation is too 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 Should people whose homes double as places of business -- caterers, plumbers, 
child-care providers, for instance -- be required to maintain smoke-free 
environments? Should a guest be forbidden to smoke in the privacy of his or her 
hotel room just because a maid comes in to clean? 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, how difficult will such rules be to enforce -- particularly when 
workers themselves may not be willing to complain about the practices of their 
colleagues? And who will be responsible for enforcement? 
</P>
<P>
 Governments and other institutions are only beginning to come to grips with 
the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most health regulations involving protecting workers from pollution, you 
can say the pollution is being caused by the company, whereas here, the 
pollution is also being caused by the workers," said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director 
of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, an advocacy group that has pushed 
for worker protections against toxic substances. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many ways, workplace smoking bans will be daunting to enforce, especially 
if they involve workers reluctant to rat on their co-workers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous state and local jurisdictions have enacted -- or are trying to 
initiate -- policies that regulate workplace smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 And the federal government, which traditionally has lagged behind the states 
and cities in this area, has proposed similar work-site bans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department's Occupational Health and Safety Administration has put 
forth a proposal to ban smoking in the nation's work sites, and the Pentagon 
already has executed such a ban worldwide, affecting 3 million employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Congress is deliberating legislation that would prohibit smoking 
in all public places, including malls, sporting arenas, office buildings and 
federal, state and local government buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill now exempts restaurants, prisons and tobacco shops. But its author, 
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee on health, has made it clear that he intends to include 
"family-style" restaurants in the legislation. The bill has been approved by 
the subcommittee but has not yet been taken up by the full committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, California and Maryland recently enacted what are believed to be the 
toughest workplace smoking bans in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 21, Gov. Pete Wilson signed a sweeping provision that will take effect 
Jan. 1 unless California voters approve a pro-tobacco initiative, sponsored by 
Philip Morris Inc., that would substantially weaken it. 
</P>
<P>
 The California law exempts private residences, unless they serve as day care 
centers for children; most hotel rooms, lobbies and banquet halls, as long as 
no food is being served; bars and card clubs; cabs of trucks; medical 
facilities doing research on smoking, and theaters and movie sets where smoking 
is part of the script. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland's law banning smoking was scheduled to take effect Aug. 1 but was 
temporarily blocked in the courts. The restrictions include home offices if 
employees other than the homeowner work there. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the concern in Maryland has been expressed by the hospitality 
industry, which is worried that the law will be interpreted to include hotel 
rooms, where maids do their work. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals with the potential for the greatest impact are those pending at 
the federal level, but they could take the longest time to implement. 
</P>
<P>
 Without weakening amendments, passage of Waxman's legislation could be 
difficult, and it could be many years before the OSHA rules take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, OSHA has yet to tackle some of the tougher questions surrounding 
its proposal, such as defining the workplace, but the agency "has the 
flexibility and capability" of doing it "carefully enough so as to hit all the 
traditional workplaces without infringing on what is typically thought of as an 
individual's private space," said Matthew Myers, an attorney who represents the 
anti-smoking Coalition on Smoking OR Health. 
</P>
<P>
 OSHA could choose to define a workplace by the number of employees, for 
example, or by the amount of time spent working there, said Myers, whose 
coalition represents the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Assn. and 
the American Lung Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 OSHA traditionally has treated small businesses differently from large ones, 
and its rules have not in the past "been construed to include peoples' homes," 
Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Myers said, "the agency has the ability to define this quite carefully 
and precisely, even though they haven't done it yet." 
</P>
<P>
 OSHA officials refused to discuss the proposals during its rule-making 
process. The period for public comment on the proposal ends Saturday and will 
be followed by a series of public hearings in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, OSHA is expected to propose more detailed final rules. Under the 
swiftest scenario, it could be three years or more before the rules take effect 
-- and they almost certainly will face legal challenges from the tobacco 
industry, likely causing further delays. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, states, cities and even individual businesses may get there 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew it was certainly a risk, but we're living proof that it hasn't hurt 
our business," said Sarah Goldsmith, a spokeswoman for California Pizza 
Kitchen, which three years ago instituted a no-smoking policy for the 
restaurants in its nationwide chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to offer a smoke-free environment as much to our workers as to our 
patrons," Goldsmith said. 
</P>
<P>
 California Pizza Kitchen is believed to be the first restaurant chain to 
impose such a ban. In the past year, several others, mostly fast-food outlets, 
have followed. 
</P>
<P>
 California Pizza Kitchen, which has bars in many of its restaurants, has 
experienced no economic hardship as a result of the policy, she said. Indeed, 
on a recent weeknight in Washington, there was a minimum 40-minute wait for a 
table. "We've had a very positive response to the policy, and our sales 
continue to increase," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldsmith's view is supported by at least one recent study. 
</P>
<P>
 The research, conducted by Stanton A. Glantz and Lisa R. A. Smith of the 
Institute for Health Policy Studies at UC San Francisco, analyzed sales tax 
data from 15 cities in California and Colorado with smoke-free ordinances and 
compared the statistics to those in cities of similar income, population and 
smoking prevalence that did not have bans. 
</P>
<P>
 They found that restaurant business had not suffered as a result of the 
ordinances. The work was published in the July issue of the American Journal of 
Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the growing pains of instituting such policies, many experts say they 
believe that the momentum cannot be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the stumbling blocks, "we, as a nation, are moving in the 
direction of . . .protecting nonsmokers in the workplace," Myers said. "The 
only real question is how long it will take."

4 KILLED WHEN PLANE CRASHES ON SAN LUIS OBISPO HIGHWAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A single-engine plane crashed Sunday on U.S. 101, killing all four occupants 
and knocking out power to 11,000 people in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists called 911 from cellular phones just after 12:06 a.m. to report a 
flash of light from the plane's collision with power lines, said California 
Highway Patrol dispatcher Jenny Keith. 
</P>
<P>
 Debris from the plane hit a pickup truck, but its occupant was not injured, 
Keith said. No other vehicles were hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Piper Cherokee Arrow went down shortly after takeoff from San Luis Obispo 
County Airport, according to Jerry Acosta, a Federal Aviation Administration 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The four victims, all from Utah, were identified as pilot Derrick Todd, 21, of 
Provo; Lyman Gregory, 23, of Orem; Daniel Todd, 32, of Salem, and Ann Jeanette 
Marion, 23, of Blanding. The four reportedly had visited family members and 
were on their way back to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Some witnesses said the pilot appeared to be trying to land on the freeway 
when the crash occurred, FAA spokesman Larry Berg said, but that could not 
immediately be confirmed.

 Residents here were rattled Sunday by two more aftershocks of the 1992 Landers 
earthquake, but there were no reports of damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 A magnitude 4.0 quake, which struck at 8:10 a.m., was centered 13 miles 
southeast of Yucca Valley, said seismologist Will Huston of Caltech. The second 
aftershock struck at the same location at 4:43 p.m. and had a magnitude of 3.6, 
Caltech reported.

 Neither the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department nor the Palm Springs 
Police Department had reports of damage or injuries.

HEY, GET THE NUMBER OF THAT BECKER; TENNIS: IT'S UP TO EIGHTH AFTER HE RUNS 
OVER WOODFORDE, 6-2, 6-2, TO WIN THE LOS ANGELES OPEN.

<P>
 It was over quicker than you can say Boom. Suddenly, Boris Becker, absent 
awhile from the forefront of tennis, was back. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker -- "Boom Boom" to fans for nearly a decade -- held the silver trophy of 
the Los Angeles Open above his head Sunday and insisted that he had never left. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeded second, Becker took only 55 minutes to defeat unseeded Mark Woodforde, 
6-2, 6-2, before 7,930 at the Los Angeles Tennis Center. It was the shortest 
final match on the ATP tour this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I am back into top form, and I almost can't wait until the U.S. Open 
begins," Becker, 26, said in a rare show of enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 He had every reason to feel confident after having steamrolled Woodforde. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The first set took only 25 minutes and Becker lost only eight points on his 
serve all day. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He never faced a break point. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He made only nine unforced errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodforde double-faulted twice to fall behind, 30-0, to start the match. 
Becker broke him in that first game and things never got any better for 
Woodforde, a left-hander from Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, had I gotten through that game holding serve, things might have been 
a bit different," Woodforde said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodforde, 28, is better known as a doubles player, with seven Grand Slam 
event doubles titles. He and John Fitzgerald defeated Scott Davis and Brian 
MacPhie, 4-6, 6-2, 6-0, to win the L.A. Open doubles title. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodforde, ranked No. 53 in singles, defeated fifth-seeded Richard Krajicek of 
the Netherlands in the semifinals on Saturday to advance to the final and said 
he was nervous about playing Becker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one of my downfalls is that I give a lot of respect to the top guys," 
Woodforde said. "It's hard for me to say, 'I'm as good as them. . . .' And 
probably that put me on the back foot playing Boris Becker." 
</P>
<P>
 They had never played each other in a tournament match, but played a practice 
set before the Los Angeles Open and joked about how funny it would be if they 
played in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker collected $200,000 in contract incentives to go with the $42,000 
winner's check and is expected to move up three spots to No. 8 when the new 
rankings are released today. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker has won five Grand Slam tournament titles, including three at 
Wimbledon. His last Grand Slam event title was in 1991, when he won the 
Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has gone through off-court changes and slipped. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, he finished the year ranked No. 11 after finishing among the top five 
the previous seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker said he felt betrayed by the media -- especially German journalists -- 
who wrote him off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have explained many times why I didn't practice that much or why I didn't 
concentrate as much. It is because there were other things in my life that 
were, at that time, more important," Becker said. "But I was never gone." 
</P>
<P>
 He recently split with coach Gunther Bresnik and long-time manager Ion Tiriac 
and hired Nick Bollettieri as coach. Becker also married Barbara Feltus, who 
gave birth to his son, Noah, in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker seems to enjoy having a family. Noah usually sits propped in front of 
the television, watching his father play tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "At night, when I come back, he gives me the advice that I need. He really 
gets on my back when I make bad shots," Becker joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Since settling his life off the court, Becker has regained his prowess on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like every month I am playing better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. Open was Becker's second title of the year. He also won an indoor 
title at Milan in February. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what does he want to accomplish in his comeback? 
</P>
<P>
 "Just to be able to compete with the best players again," Becker said. "Just 
to be Boris Becker on the court." 
</P>
<P>
 That was enough Sunday.

THEY DON'T DROP BATON FOR RAIDERS; PRO FOOTBALL: YOUNG RECEIVERS JORDAN, ISMAIL 
AND HOBBS TURN THE GAME INTO A TRACK MEET AS L.A. BEATS THE COWBOYS, 27-19. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tim Brown is happy to be a Raider. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrilled to be a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 And thankful he is not a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown played in the Pro Bowl last season, was the AFC leader last season in 
receiving yards and is the greatest single-season pass-catcher in Raider 
history. But even he wouldn't want to be an outsider trying to make this Raider 
squad as a wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want to be a rookie, Heisman Trophy or no Heisman Trophy," Brown 
said. "This is incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 No argument from the Dallas Cowboys, 27-19 losers to the Raiders on Sunday 
night in an exhibition before 61,932 at Texas Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 It was supposed to be a football game, but it looked more like a track meet as 
the Raiders unleashed their relay squad of young receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Vince Evans has been throwing passes professionally since 1977. 
Has he ever had a choice of targets like this? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I haven't," Evans said. "We have guys who can turn the six-yard hitch 
into a 77-yard run or take it all the way downtown. We have guys who can make 
things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Charles Jordan, who caught a 77-yard touchdown pass from Billy Joe Hobert, 
Jordan never breaking stride after beating Tommy Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rocket Ismail, who caught a 54-yard touchdown pass from Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Daryl Hobbs, who caught a team-high four passes for 77 yards and made a 
spectacular punt return that was called back. 
</P>
<P>
 How deep is this receiving corps? Keep in mind that both Jordan and Hobbs are 
trying to make the team and Ismail has yet to crack the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the Raiders' three top receivers, neither Brown nor James Jett, a former 
Olympic gold medal winner, caught a pass. And Alexander Wright, two-time winner 
of the NFL's Fastest Man competition, was sidelined because of a pulled calf 
muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 And in addition to all of this talent, the Raiders can boast of starting 
tailback Ty Montgomery, a converted receiver, who still looks more comfortable 
catching passes. 
</P>
<P>
 He caught a 34-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Jeff Hostetler after the 
Cowboys' Troy Aikman had opened the scoring with a six-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 But after getting even, the Raiders went ahead on Jeff Jaeger's 42-yard field 
goal and were never caught. Jaeger later added a 50-yarder as time ran out in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 In improving to 2-0 in the exhibition season, the Raiders dropped the Cowboys 
to 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 But in all fairness, this was hardly the Dallas unit that has won the last two 
Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman only played one series. Star running back Emmitt Smith didn't play at 
all as Coach Barry Switzer kept him out, preferring to save Smith for later in 
the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
 And such key performers as Michael Irvin and Alvin Harper, both receivers, and 
Russell Maryland, Leon Lett and Charles Haley, all defensive linemen, sat out 
because of injuries, as did center Mark Stepnoski. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Cowboy scores came on a safety by Tony Tolbert against Evans, a 
25-yard field goal by Chris Boniol and an eight-yard touchdown pass from Jason 
Garrett to running back Judd Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the time for reserves to make their mark, and Ismail was in that group 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago at this time, he was still sitting at home, waiting out the 
contract negotiations that eventually led to a job with the Raiders. But he sat 
out training camp altogether and never caught up. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, he has been there since the gates to the Raiders' Oxnard camp swung 
open and the difference shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Ismail showed the Cowboys a few of his moves on a spectacular play late in the 
second quarter, hooking up with Evans on the 54-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Ismail used his speed to get ahead of defender Dave Thomas, catching 
the ball at the Dallas 10-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Ismail fell at the five, but used his quickness and agility to keep moving. 
Without a Cowboy able to lay a hand on him, Ismail spun to the three-yard line 
and then, with another quick spin move, made it into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Ismail knows that, regardless of how much work he gets at wide receiver, he 
has a spot on the team as a kick returner. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so for Hobbs, who spent two seasons simply trying to make it onto the 
field for the Raiders, finally succeeding in the first playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobbs would like to start playing a lot earlier this season and he tried to 
make a case in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobbs' biggest play didn't even count in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. 
</P>
<P>
 It counted where it mattered most, in the eyes of the coaching staff, who 
watched Hobbs break six tackles and go 37 yards on a punt return before the 
play was called back because of a holding call against Napoleon McCallum. 
</P>
<P>
 Another player trying to make the Raider squad is defensive lineman Alberto 
White, who didn't even make the final cutdown last season. But he is off to a 
big start in this preseason in his bid to find a spot on the Raiders' veteran 
defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 White had a sack and a half last week against the Denver Broncos in the 
Raiders' exhibition opener and, in Sunday's game, he added two more sacks and 
an interception.

DODGERS CLINCH WEST TITLE, IF A STRIKE BEGINS ON FRIDAY; BASEBALL: THEY BEAT 
THE ROCKIES, 6-2. HERSHISER GETS HIS SIXTH VICTORY, BUT FEARS THAT IT MIGHT BE 
HIS LAST GAME FOR L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If the players go on strike Friday as expected, this much is certain: The 
Dodgers, after beating the Colorado Rockies, 6-2, on Sunday, will be in sole 
possession of first place in the National League West.  
</P>
<P>
 What that means, if anything, remains unclear, but the Dodgers, who have been 
in first place for the past 85 days, say they will take it. The San Francisco 
Giants, having lost six games in a row, have fallen five games behind the 
Dodgers with three to play. The Dodgers have four games scheduled before 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "You try not to make it seem like a do-or-die thing, but in reality, it is," 
Delino DeShields said.  
</P>
<P>
 There was more uncertainty than the work stoppage looming for the Dodgers, 
though, as they took the field at Mile High Stadium before a sellout crowd of 
70,372. Orel Hershiser, warming up before the game, wondered if it could be his 
last as a Dodger. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I pitched at home last time I was wondering if that could be the last 
time I pitch in Dodger Stadium and today, I wondered if it would be the last 
time I pitched as a Dodger, period," said Hershiser, who is in the last year of 
his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'This is odd, this could be it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But in the five innings that followed, Hershiser held the Rockies' hitless, 
and that inspired another thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking that if I threw a no-hitter, it wouldn't be my last appearance 
as a Dodger, there would be a pretty good chance I might be back -- or the 
Rockies might take me," Hershiser said jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the sixth, after Hershiser (6-6) had retired eight in a row, Mike 
Kingery tripled over Brett Butler's head in center field. Butler believed that 
he could play the ball off the wall, but instead the ball hit on the warning 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shied off the ball and misread the fence," Butler said. "I feel bad . . . I 
should have caught it, but when Charlie Hayes hit the next ball off the 
right-center fence for a double, I didn't feel so bad." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the Dodgers were ahead, 3-0, having scored twice in the first 
inning and once in the third against starter Greg Harris (3-12). Kingery scored 
on a groundout by Ellis Burks, with DeShields' diving stop of the ball a key 
play because of Hayes' ensuing double. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hershiser, who had pitched most of the game with one pitch -- a 
fastball away -- walked the leadoff hitter in the seventh, and was relieved by 
Ismael Valdes, who held the Rockies to one hit over two innings. Todd Worrell 
pitched the ninth and gave up one run. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hershiser's first 10 starts this season he pitched at least six innings and 
gave up three earned runs or less, but all he had to show for it was a 3-1 
record. The Dodgers, though, went on to win six of Hershiser's first 10 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only had one good pitch today, and they kept hitting it on the ground so I 
wasn't going to change my formula," said Hershiser, who was coming off of two 
consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't a lot of deception about what I was doing out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Wallach, who was three for four with a double against Harris, led off the 
eighth inning with a single and Eric Karros followed with a home run to left. 
Karros is nine for 20 with three home runs against Harris; Wallach is 12 for 
32, also with three homers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Henry Rodriguez had accomplished virtually nothing against Harris, until 
the eighth. He followed Karros by hitting a 422-foot shot to right field, 
giving the Dodgers a 6-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a hell of a lot better about how we have been playing," Wallach said. 
"The way we were playing three or four weeks ago was awful. But we have been 
playing our best defensively, our pitching has been outstanding and our bullpen 
perfect and we are starting to swing the bats like we have the rest of the 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Since returning home a week ago Friday from a 3-10 trip, the Dodgers have won 
seven of their last nine games. Since then, the Giants and the Rockies have 
taken a tumble, with the Dodgers opening their largest lead in the division 
since the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best place to be if there is a work stoppage," said Karros, who 
drove in three runs.

FOR U.S., PERFECT, NOT PERFECTION; WORLD BASKETBALL: DREAM TEAM SLEEPWALKS 
THROUGH 105-82 VICTORY OVER BRAZIL AND RUNS RECORD TO 3-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 No jibes about the golf games of U.S. players, no Oscar shooting from the 
cheap seats, no tweaking the Americans' noses, no nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the decline in Dream Teams, Brazilian basketball has seen better days, 
leading to Sunday's forgettable matchup and a drab 105-82 victory by the 
Daydream Team, which managed to avoid yawning on camera but barely. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're much stronger than Dream Team I," said Brazilian forward Jose Vianna, 
"but there's something lacking there and I don't know what it is. It might be 
some kind of philosophy or character." 
</P>
<P>
 Try interest. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Dream Team had a knack for approaching mismatches with enthusiasm, this 
one is merely bored. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dream Team dispatched its victims by an average of 44 points. This team 
has beaten three opening-round tackling dummies by an average of 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Brazilians, already beaten by Spain and China, had little to scare 
anyone. Oscar Schmidt, the leading scorer in Olympic history, was left off the 
team. Guard Marcel Souza, who challenged Michael Jordan to forget about golf 
and Scottie Pippen to quit laying by the pool at the Tournament of the Americas 
two years ago, has retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt's jump shots and Souza's mouth led the Brazilians to their 1987 upset 
of a U.S. squad that included David Robinson, Danny Manning and Pervis Ellison 
in the Pan-American Games at Indianapolis, perhaps the most embarrassing defeat 
suffered by an American team on American soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt volunteered to play but was turned down by his federation, which 
claims to be rebuilding the team. This would be like the United States turning 
down Larry Bird and remains a cause celebre . 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to talk about the past," said Brazilian Coach Ennio Vecchi. "I 
only want to talk about the players who played here today." 
</P>
<P>
 Vecchi's game plan featured an old-fashioned weave, with three players running 
figure-eights and exchanging handoffs between the top of the circle and the 
half-court line to start its plays. 
</P>
<P>
 The offense has been so long out of fashion in the United States, it's hard to 
recall what it was supposed to achieve. For Vecchi, its purpose was to kill 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether for team harmony or by chance, U.S. Coach Don Nelson went with five 
new starters and even let Larry Johnson jump center, on the theory that 
international referees let players jump early and steal it. But Johnson, 
recovering slowly from his bad back, can barely jump. 
</P>
<P>
 If redistributing the playing time was supposed to energize everyone, well, 
that didn't work either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you tend to relax a little," said Dominique Wilkins. "But we had to 
regroup and say, 'Hey, let's put these guys away and get on back to the hotel.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Missing nine of their 10 three-point shots, the Americans settled for a 
12-point lead at halftime. Shaquille O'Neal and Shawn Kemp went on a 
dunk-a-thon in the second half, but the Brazilians avoided outright humiliation 
and celebrated as if they had won. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have proven to a lot of people," said Vecchi, "that we have good players." 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans, 3-0 in Pool A, advance to the quarterfinal round-robin in which 
they will play Australia on Tuesday, Puerto Rico on Wednesday and Russia on 
Friday. The games will be in Toronto, so at least the Dreamers can move back to 
the big city. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson is giving his players today off, their first since opening camp July 
20. If they can't go home, it's the next best thing. World Basketball Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The round-robin quarterfinals start today with China playing Croatia and 
Greece meeting Canada. On Tuesday, Puerto Rico plays Russia. . . . Puerto Rico, 
needing a five-point victory to advance to the quarterfinals, beat Greece, 
72-64, in Toronto to eliminate Germany from medal contention. . . . China held 
Spain to two field goals during a 9 1/2-minute stretch late in the second half 
for a 78-76 victory and its first berth in the quarterfinals.

MIKE DOWNEY: 1-800-HONEYMOON SKATES ON THIN ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tonya Harding is currently shooting a movie, her second. I have no idea what 
it is about. Maybe she plays Wyatt Earp. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya's first film, meantime, is now available on home video. 
</P>
<P>
 In it, she portrays a newlywed who plunges into romance with a lean young 
hardbody named Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a documentary. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, "My Wedding Night," or, as I like to think of it, "Sleepless in 
Portland," is being sold on home video for $29.95 by an adults-only magazine 
with a toll-free number and a guilt-free conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 The honeymooners, Tonya Harding and hubby/accomplice Jeff Gillooly, are 
captured on camcorder after their wedding, doing the hokey-pokey. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentenced to probation, this is not Tonya's idea of community-service work. 
</P>
<P>
 The former ice skater and mistress of mischief is incensed because somehow a 
bunch of creeps got their filthy hands on her private celluloid. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal mastermind and experimental filmmaker Gillooly is insisting from his 
cramped studio along Cell Block B that he had absolutely nothing to do with 
this amateur production going public. Gillooly says he did not sell the film 
for profit and cellmates agree that Jeff would never do such a thing, even for 
a pack of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya is plenty ticked off, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine, the nerve of anybody, humiliating her this way. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, the lengths people will go to, simply to hurt an innocent person. 
</P>
<P>
 Life is so unfair at times, isn't it? This hurts so much, it's like somebody 
was deliberately trying to wreck Tonya's career. It's like somebody is trying 
to keep both she and Jeff from leading normal lives. And boy, what did we ever 
do to anybody? 
</P>
<P>
 The poor things. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya's attorney -- a pretty busy fellow -- is absolutely livid that someone 
would disrupt her privacy this way. This is America! A citizen has rights! 
</P>
<P>
 Takes a lot of gall for some magazine to run pictures of Tonya, working on her 
axel and her lutz. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, to sell a video as well, what a naughty thing to do. It's like a 
crime! 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, do you have any idea how embarrassing this would be if, say, what's 
her name, that Kerrigan woman, got her hands on this film? How awful it would 
be to have that Kerrigan amuse herself at Tonya's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Gee whiz, Tonya says, I have my pride, you know. 
</P>
<P>
 A person should be entitled to her own life, without interference from anybody 
else, don't you think? 
</P>
<P>
 Our wedding night! Is nothing sacred any more? 
</P>
<P>
 Master Thespian Gillooly never meant for his motion-picture debut to go 
worldwide. At first he was only going to take slides of Niagara Falls, but 
that's so borrrring.  
</P>
<P>
 So, instead, he filmed his wife, a short subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Critic Gene Siskel gives it thumbs-on-the-nose. Critic Gene Shalit calls it a 
feel-good film, the "Citizen Kane" of figure skater honeymoon films. Critic 
Michael Medved says, "Gillooly has a wonderful sort of Capra quality, and it's 
nice to see no violence for a change." Columnist Liz Smith says Cher recently 
shampooed her hair. 
</P>
<P>
 The film recently was entered at the festival at Cannes, where judges gave it 
6.0, 5.8, 6.0 and 5.9. 
</P>
<P>
 I, myself, was aghast at hearing that a magazine was publishing photographs 
and peddling videos without the expressed permission of either Tonya Harding or 
Major League Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 From the slammer, Gillooly says he is absolutely appalled that his film is 
available to the general public, and that he wants either William Goldman or 
Robert Towne to write the big-screen adaptation. 
</P>
<P>
 Having missed the network Tonya movies, I probably won't find time to see this 
one, either. Although I might try the laser disc, if it's letter-boxed. 
</P>
<P>
 I am, however, looking forward to the new feature film Harding is currently 
making. I saw some footage on "Entertainment Tonight" the other day in which 
she was kicking some dude, hurtin' him good. I'm pretty sure these were the 
compulsories. 
</P>
<P>
 It did appear to include a certain amount of violence. But then, so does she. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Gillooly, no word yet from prison on what he is now filming, or who 
with. Talk about entertainment tonight.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE HAS A LOTT OF SUPPORT AS A FUTURE COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He's still playing, but NFL coaches expect New York Jet safety Ronnie Lott to 
join their ranks in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 In its endless quest to leave no public relations stone unturned, the NFL 
quizzed the five head coaches who are starting their first years with their 
respective teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The most interesting result of the page full of trivia? Maybe that when asked 
to name one player, current or retired, who would make a great head coach, 
three of the four who responded to that question named Lott, a certain Hall of 
Famer. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Carroll of the New York Jets, June Jones of the Atlanta Falcons and Norv 
Turner of the Washington Redskins were the Lott fans. The Arizona Cardinals' 
Buddy Ryan listed Mike Singletary. Barry Switzer of the Dallas Cowboys did not 
answer the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Add coaches: Not that he can help it, but Switzer stands out a bit among his 
NFL-grown peers. When asked what was the greatest team they ever competed 
against, Carroll and Turner named the 1985 Chicago Bears. Ryan, who was 
defensive coordinator of that Bear team, and Jones picked the late-'70s 
Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 And Switzer? The 1971 Nebraska Cornhuskers. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia question: Who holds the record for most rushing yards in an NFL 
regular-season opening week game? 
</P>
<P>
 'Tis better to receive: San Francisco 49er quarterback Steve Young says he is 
discovering that it isn't necessarily a bad thing to have receivers complaining 
that they should be thrown to more often. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brent Jones hasn't been covered on any play in his life -- in his mind," 
Young said in Inside Sports magazine. "I'm sure Jerry (Rice) basically feels 
the same way. But you like to have guys like that, guys who want the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was talking to an NFL quarterback the other day who said, 'You're lucky. 
I've got five guys who don't want the ball. They all leave the huddle hoping I 
won't throw to them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: O.J. Simpson, who gained 250 yards in 29 carries for the 
Buffalo Bills against the New England Patriots to open the 1973 season. 
</P>

TENNIS / WOMEN AT MANHATTAN BEACH; NOVOTNA STILL OVERSHADOWED BY COLLAPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The painful Centre Court scene at Wimbledon in 1993 will forever link Jana 
Novotna with the ghosts of the All England Lawn Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the greatest collapses of women's tennis, Novotna lost the final to 
Steffi Graf, 7-6 (8-6), 1-6, 6-4, after leading, 4-1, in the third set. Then, 
during an emotional trophy presentation, Novotna buried her head on the Duchess 
of Kent's shoulder and sobbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'Jana, I know that you will do it someday, don't worry,' " Novotna 
said at the time. "I just, you know, I just let go."  
</P>
<P>
 As she enters the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles, which will be held today 
through Sunday at the Manhattan Country Club in Manhattan Beach, Novotna, 
ranked eighth, cannot escape the images of that Wimbledon final. 
</P>
<P>
 Before then, she was known for doubles, even though she reached the Australian 
Open singles final in 1991. She and former partner Helena Sukova were regarded 
as the world's best doubles team in 1989 and '90 before they split. She and 
partner Larisa Neiland finished 1993 ranked fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a perennial top-10 singles player, the Czech-born Novotna never 
really had a major breakthrough until last year's Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you play well in a regular tournament or do well in doubles, it's 
never the same as if you do well at a Grand Slam," she said. "(Wimbledon) is a 
special time for me, and I showed everybody I was a very good player. I showed 
I was very emotional." 
</P>
<P>
 Some suggest she also showed a lack of mental toughness. Her breakthrough is 
best known as a breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 She insists she did not choke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only the ending was sad," she has said. 
</P>
<P>
 It might take a Grand Slam tournament title to erase that ending. In the 
meantime, Novotna and her coach, Hana Mandlikova, are striving for a few more 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Novotna hopes to polish her game at the weeklong L.A. tournament before the 
year's final Grand Slam event, the U.S. Open, later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 After a first-round bye, Novotna will face the winner of the match between 
Karine Quentrec of France and Karin Kschwendt of Germany in the second round at 
Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong serve-and-volley player, Novotna, 25, still is looking for Grand Slam 
consistency. She reached the quarterfinals of Wimbledon and the Australian Open 
this year, but was upset in the first round of the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was ever a time to make a move in women's tennis, this is it. With 
top-ranked Graf struggling, No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and No. 3 Conchita 
Martinez vulnerable on hard courts and No. 4 Martina Navratilova retiring, 
there is an opening. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening is wide, considering the temporary retirements of former No. 1 
Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati and the continued slide of Gabriela 
Sabatini. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steffi is the only one dominant and very good on all surfaces," Novotna said. 
"All the pressure is always on Steffi." 
</P>
<P>
 Women's tennis once seemed to have three or four dominant players. If one 
lost, the others had a chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now if Steffi loses, everybody has a good chance," Novotna said. 
</P>
<P>
 Is she listening to herself?

 This could go down as the year the Dodgers clinched the NL West title earlier 
than ever, but with their worst record. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of good seats are still available for the series against Chicago that 
is scheduled to begin Friday night at Dodger Stadium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi's 15 assists in 108 games are only three fewer than Roberto 
Clemente had in 125 games during his rookie year of 1955. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Karros should drop the closed stance from his repertoire. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers didn't think Pedro Martinez was big or strong enough to be an 
effective starting pitcher, but he is 10-5 for Montreal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco defense, which used to be the best in baseball, has fallen 
apart. . . .

 How thoughtful of the Angels and White Sox, who probably won't work at all 
next weekend, to work overtime Saturday and Sunday. . . .

 Where They Are Now: Former Angel broadcaster Al Conin is doing some San Diego

 Thirty years ago today, the Angels and the city of Anaheim drew up a letter of 
intent to build Anaheim Stadium. . . .

 Unlike Saturday in their exhibition game, the Rams should be able to score a 
touchdown against the Packers on Oct. 9 at Green Bay. I mean, having Chris 
Miller and Jerome Bettis in the backfield should make some difference. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A team that wisely drafted for need was Pittsburgh, which might have the next 
great wide receiver in Charles Johnson from Colorado. . . .

 Denver backup quarterback Tommy Maddox, who would be a rookie if he hadn't 
bypassed his last two years at UCLA, could be starting for some other teams. .

 Look for fewer long field-goal tries because of the risk of losing about seven 
yards under the new NFL rule.Possession of the ball has been changed to the

 Chapman College in Orange will resume football this season after a 60-year 
hiatus. The Panthers last played when the campus was on Vermont Ave. in L.A. .

 Holchak has been reporting on big-time track and field since 1956 when, as a 
15-year-old Washington High student, he wrote about the Olympic Games in 
Melbourne for the old Los Angeles Examiner. . . .

 One reason the Kings traded Tomas Sandstrom was that they believed he would

 The Mighty Ducks showed their toughness off the ice last week when scout Alain 
Chainey knocked a bank robber out cold with one punch in Quebec City. . . .

 The first Brickyard 400 made for some great television, but ABC analyst Benny 
Parsons set a record for the most "Man, oh, man," utterances during a single

 The award presentations at La Costa lasted nearly as long as Steffi Graf's 
demolition of Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. . . .

 Expert analysis: Karl Malone, while being interviewed at halftime of the 
United States-Brazil basketball game Sunday by NBC's Hannah Storm, said he had

TENNIS / WOMEN AT LA COSTA; GRAF ENDS SLUMP TALK, ROUTS SANCHEZ VICARIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WOLF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Slump? What slump? 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Steffi Graf had reached the final of the $400,000 Toshiba Tennis 
Classic, her subpar play had been the talk of the tournament. She hadn't been 
at the top of her game since winning the German Open in her homeland three 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before Graf took the court Sunday at La Costa Resort & Spa for 
the championship match against Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain. This was a 
showdown between the world's top-ranked women's players, and Graf turned it 
into a 6-2, 6-1 runaway for her 86th tour victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf needed only 1 hour 7 minutes to win the tournament for the fourth time, 
and the second time in a row. She also beat Sanchez Vicario in last year's 
final, 6-4, 4-6, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 During the awards ceremony, Sanchez Vicario told the sellout crowd of 5,800, 
"It was not a nice thing for me. I tried everything, but she was very hot today 
and showed why she's No. 1 in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf holds a 24-6 edge over Sanchez Vicario, including 3-1 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time she plays me, she's so great," Sanchez Vicario said. "She's got 
something against me. I don't know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Graf: "I'm not mad at her. I just played some of my best tennis today." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf was asked later if she could play any better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," she said. "The best I ever played against Arantxa was in the 
Australian Open this year (Jan. 30). This one was probably the next best." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about her so-called slump, Graf laughed and said, "I can't talk about 
slump today." 
</P>
<P>
 Slump or not, Graf had expressed concern during the week about her inability 
to put away seemingly overmatched opponents. She had no such problem Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew what I had to do, and I didn't feel like she had anything to hurt me," 
she said. "I'm very happy now about the week I had here. Even the trouble I had 
earlier in the week, I fought my way out of it, and closing out this way helped 
me a lot to get ready for the U.S. Open (beginning Aug. 29)." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf was asked if her decisive victory was indicative of a vast difference 
between No. 1 and No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she said. "Arantxa wasn't up to the level she can play." 
</P>
<P>
 That being the case, Graf said she had a feeling after four games that she 
would be in command. 
</P>
<P>
 "I broke her (service) in the second game," Graf said. "Even though she broke 
me back, I broke her again in the fourth game. Then I knew what I had to do, 
and I knew I could do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be more aggressive, go for my shots and go in behind them. It 
helps me very much to win this tournament, especially since everybody was 
talking about my two losses in a row -- wow!" 
</P>
<P>
 Graf was beaten by Mary Pierce in the semifinals of the French Open and by 
Lori McNeil in the first round at Wimbledon before coming here. 
</P>
<P>
 All that changed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steffi didn't miss a ball," Sanchez Vicario said. "Normally she's not so 
consistent, but today her volleys, overheads, everything she hit was perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Sanchez Vicario derived a measure of consolation by teaming with Jana 
Novotna of the Czech Republic to beat Ginger Helgeson of Alpine, Calif., and 
Rachel McQuillan of Australia in the doubles final, 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The doubles match was Sanchez Vicario's 29th in 25 days, and she said, "I'm 
not touching a racket or a tennis ball for two days. I deserve a vacation."

GOLF ROUNDUP; COUPLES' ONE-TWO PUNCH WINS

 Fred Couples, recovering from a back injury that kept him out of golf for 
almost four months, shot a seven-under 65 Sunday morning, then had a 68 in the 
afternoon and beat Corey Pavin by two strokes in the Buick Open at Grand Blanc, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very exciting. It was highly emotional for me," said Couples, who lost 
to Pavin by two strokes at the Los Angeles Open in February. "I had a lot of 
thoughts going through my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Couples closed out his first victory of the season -- and the 11th of his 
career -- with a birdie on the final hole, hitting his seven-iron approach less 
than two feet from the pin and making the putt for a 270 total. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corey birdied 17. That kind of puts a lump in your throat," said Couples, who 
earned $198,000 of the $1.1-million purse. "But then I put it close and I was 
very, very happy. I knew this was a wonderful opportunity and I didn't want to 
waste it." 
</P>
<P>
 The 36-hole finish was necessary after the opening round was postponed 
Thursday because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Strange, Steve Pate and Greg Kraft were tied for third at 276. Ben 
Crenshaw and Keith Clearwater finished at 277. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Hill shot a three-under 69 to win the McCall's LPGA Classic at 
Stratton Mountain, Vt., by three strokes over Nancy Ramsbottom. It was Hill's 
first victory in 14 years on the LPGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill tied the tournament record with a 275 total. Ramsbottom, seeking her 
first victory in 10 years on the tour, shot a 70 for a 278. 
</P>

<P>
 Jim Albus saw his lead shrink to one stroke when he bogeyed the 15th hole, 
then birdied the next two holes to win the $700,000 Bank of Boston Senior PGA 
Classic at Concord, Mass., by two strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Albus scored his second victory of the year with a two-under 70 that gave him 
a 54-hole total of 203, 13 under at the Nashawtuc Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Brue, with a 65, and Raymond Floyd, with a 69, finished second with 205 
totals.

 Tiger Woods of Cypress birdied the second hole and never trailed as he

</P>
<P>
 Woods, 18, moved to a 3-up lead with back-to-back birdies on the 10th and 11th 
holes. Riley, 20, of San Diego, birdied the 14th hole to cut Woods' lead to 2 
up, but Woods halved the next three holes.

CHICAGO'S LAVALLIERE HAPPILY SWATS ANGELS' PITCHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Et tu Spanky? 
</P>
<P>
 Yep, that's the way it goes for the 1994 Angels. Ahead, 5-3, in the top of the 
ninth inning, the Angels gave up a two-run, game-tying homer to Chicago catcher 
Mike (Spanky) LaValliere, his first in the American League and only the 17th in 
2,365 major league at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's game went to extra innings tied, 5-5, before the White Sox went on to 
hammer Angel relievers Joe Magrane and Joe Grahe for five runs in the 12th. 
Final score: Chicago 10, Angels 5. 
</P>
<P>
 At game's end, LaValliere happily walked to the visiting clubhouse where he 
was greeted by the home run ball hanging by a wire from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they said it couldn't be done," an attached note read. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a little bet with him that he wouldn't hit a home run this season," 
Chicago pitcher Kirk McCaskill said. "There was something else (money) attached 
to it, but he ripped that off already." 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox, trailing, 5-1, after three innings, viewed LaValliere's homer 
as a harbinger of better things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spanky was the man," second baseman Joey Cora said. "The odds of Spanky 
hitting a bomb are pretty slim, so when he does that you have to figure that's 
a good sign." 
</P>
<P>
 It took a while, but Cora eventually drove in what would be the winning run 
with a single in the 12th off Magrane. 
</P>
<P>
 Four more runs were mere insurance. The Angels seemed lifeless after 
LaValliere's first home run since Aug. 22, 1992, when he was with the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got good backspin on it," LaValliere said of the 3-and-2 fastball he hit 
off reliever Russ Springer with one out in the ninth. "The ball was carrying 
good today. I don't hit that many (homers), so I don't know how they feel 
leaving the bat. But judging from batting practice, I felt like it had a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
 There didn't seem to be much doubt about it. The ball appeared to jump from 
LaValliere's bat, zooming toward the wall in right-center field. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel center fielder Chad Curtis sprinted after it, perhaps thinking it would 
land short and he could hold the slow-running LaValliere to a double. But soon 
enough, Curtis slowed to a trot, watching helplessly as the ball sailed over 
the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just a way to contribute to a win," said LaValliere, who was signed by 
Chicago as a free agent last year. LaValliere was playing Sunday because Ron 
Karkovice and Ron Tingley are on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Manager Gene Lamont chuckled when someone mentioned LaValliere's feat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball was carrying," Lamont said. "I don't want to slight his home run, 
but you saw (Tim) Salmon's home run." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Salmon's two-run homer in the third seemed at first to be nothing more 
than a routine fly ball to left field. But Tim Raines kept drifting back . . . 
back . . . back, until he ran out of room and the ball cleared the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we came back, if we still lost, I still would have been proud of the 
team," Lamont said. 
</P>
<P>
 LaValliere's homer simply gave the White Sox another crack at the faulty Angel 
bullpen. And you ought to know what that can mean by now.

ANGELS GET NO PAY FOR WORKING OVERTIME; BASEBALL: FOR THE SECOND TIME IN LESS 
THAN 18 HOURS, THEY LOSE TO THE WHITE SOX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As if falling 22 games below .500 wasn't degrading enough, the Angels suffered 
the ignominy of losing two extra-inning games in the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 At least they didn't have to play a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
 On the heels of a 16-10, 10-inning defeat that lasted until 12:35 Sunday 
morning, the Angels repeated the experience Sunday afternoon, losing to the 
Chicago White Sox, 10-5, in 12 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels took a two-run lead into the ninth inning, gave up a two-run homer 
to a batter who hadn't hit a home run in almost two years, and then 
disintegrated in the 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozzie Guillen tripled to lead off the 12th inning on a line drive that took a 
bizarre hop behind left fielder Jim Edmonds and bounded to the wall. Joey Cora 
singled over the drawn-in infield, much to the delight of what remained of a 
crowd of 21,921, many of whom apparently want to see Chicago in first place in 
the AL Central if a player strike begins on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox batted around, and Guillen's infield single drove in the fifth 
run of the inning. The Angels' only solace was that nine hours of baseball's 
version of torture was finally ending. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you win, you don't give a damn how long it takes," said reliever Mark 
Leiter, who gave up six runs in the 10th inning of Saturday night's game and 
pitched two scoreless innings Sunday. "But after what I did last night and what 
happened today, speaking as a relief pitcher, you feel like you've let the 
whole team down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to rebound. We really need someone to pick us up, but it seems 
like we can't all screw up at once. Instead, the people we're counting on are 
taking turns doing it at crucial times." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Manager Marcel Lachemann was ready to take the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the worst-managed game I've ever been involved with, and I was 
managing it," he said. "The players were playing hard enough to win, but I 
stunk." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann was upset he used Bo Jackson to pinch hit in the eighth inning with 
Tim Salmon on second base, first base open and the Angels leading, 5-3. Jackson 
was intentionally walked, and Salmon was stranded when Harold Reynolds popped 
up and Gary DiSarcina flied to right. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the roof fell in. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago's Darrin Jackson led off the ninth inning with a single against Russ 
Springer, who was working on a 14-inning scoreless streak. The streak ended one 
out later when Mike LaValliere -- who came to the plate averaging one homer in 
every 148 at-bats and had not hit one since Aug. 22, 1992, when he played for 
Pittsburgh -- hit the 17th home run of his 11-season major league career and 
the game was destined for extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second game in a row, the Angels used six pitchers and too few of them 
were effective. This time, Joe Magrane and Joe Grahe, both of whom pitched in 
Saturday's game, were roughed up in the 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a team ready to face the streaking Kansas City Royals, winners of 14 
of their last 16 games? 
</P>
<P>
 "You come back out and play the next day," Lachemann said. "You either suck it 
up or get out." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as starter Phil Leftwich is concerned, a getaway might be in order. 
After losing six of his last eight decisions, a strike is beginning to look 
like a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, it's tough when you hit five home runs one night and three the next day 
and lose them both," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, things aren't going very well. Maybe the strike couldn't happen at 
a better time."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BELLE BOOMING AGAIN AS INDIANS GAIN SPLIT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Albert Belle made a dramatic return from his seven-game suspension, homering 
and driving in three runs as the Cleveland Indians rallied to beat Boston, 
15-10, in 12 innings for a split of their Sunday doubleheader at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first game, Joe Hesketh allowed three hits in eight innings and Carlos 
Rodriguez went five for five and had three of Boston's six doubles as the Red 
Sox won, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second game, Omar Vizquel had a bases-loaded triple, giving him six 
RBIs, as the Indians scored five runs in the 12th. A throwing error by first 
baseman Mo Vaughn on a bunt was a key to the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle, in his first game back from the suspension for having a corked bat, hit 
a two-run homer in his first at-bat, a 439-foot shot way over the Green Monster 
in left field. It was his 36th of the year and gave him 100 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle added a run-scoring single in the second and went three for seven, 
raising his average to .360. He was thrown out of the game in the 12th after 
arguing with an umpire about a fair-or-foul call. 
</P>
<P>
 The game also featured a remarkable play in center field by the Indians' Kenny 
Lofton. Racing at full speed with his back to the plate, Lofton hauled in Tom 
Brunansky's blast over his shoulder on the warning track. He spun and fired the 
ball to the infield, nearly doubling a runner off first. The catch came with 
the bases loaded and one out in Boston's big fourth inning. Brunansky ended up 
with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 10, Kansas City 6 -- Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 38th home run, capping a 
six-run rally in the seventh inning at Kansas City as the Mariners beat the 
Royals for the second day in a row. Seattle stopped the Royals' 14-game winning 
streak on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey's three-run homer enabled him to tie Chicago's Frank Thomas for the 
American League home run lead. Griffey also made a strong throw to the plate to 
prevent a run.  
</P>
<P>
 Jay Buhner, called in to pinch-hit in the seventh, hit a two-run single and 
then added a two-run homer an inning later for the Mariners, who won for the 
fifth time in six games, overcoming a 4-2 deficit against David Cone (16-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 6, Milwaukee 3 -- Mike Mussina won his 16th game by limiting the 
Brewers to six hits through eight innings at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have good stuff early," said Mussina, who is on pace to win 24 games 
if a strike is somehow avoided. "I was just bad. It was very uncomfortable and 
they were getting hits off everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Mussina (16-5) gave up just three hits after the first, when the Brewers went 
ahead, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 7, New York 6 -- Kent Hrbek, who announced Thursday that he will 
retire after the season, capped a fine series against the American League's 
best team with a two-run, two-out, eighth-inning single off New York relief ace 
Steve Howe at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Hrbek, who also had an RBI double in the first inning, batted .545 with seven 
RBIs during the four-game series, which the Twins and Yankees split. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 8, Texas 3 -- Rickey Henderson hit his record 66th leadoff home run 
and the Athletics moved within 1 1/2 games of the American League West-leading 
Rangers by winning at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Neel hit two homers, drove in three runs and scored three times as the 
A's completed a three-game sweep. Scott Brosius added a three-run shot as 
Oakland blistered Kenny Rogers for four home runs. Rogers (11-8), who pitched a 
perfect game against the Angels on July 28, surrendered five runs in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 8, Toronto 7 -- Kirk Gibson hit a tie-breaking, two-run homer in the 
eighth inning, and Tony Phillips hit two home runs for the Tigers at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Molitor and John Olerud homered for Toronto.

<P>
 Raul Mondesi scored the Dodgers' third run in their 6-2 victory over the 
Colorado Rockies, but, as usual, it wasn't routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi led off the second inning with a single to short right field, but 
didn't stop running, sliding into second base safely with a double."I heard 
(first base coach Reggie Smith) yelling, 'No, no, don't go,' " Mondesi said. 
"What do I have now, 27 doubles? I want to get two more before the strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said this was about the third time Mondesi has ignored his instructions 
at first base. "He's like a mustang," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Center fielder Brett Butler will support that. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second inning, Charlie Hayes hit a fly ball to right-center field that 
Butler and Mondesi converged on. Butler called for it and ended up making a 
lunging catch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wind was blowing from right to left and blew it back in, plus I didn't 
know if a truck was about to hit me too. You never know with that kid out 
there," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth inning, Mondesi tried to reach third base from first on a single 
to short left field by Rafael Bournigal. He was thrown out by about three feet. 
"He can run, but he can't fly," Coach Manny Mota said. 
</P>

 Ismael Valdes has pitched in six of the last nine games and has given up only

inning, giving up a single to Dante Bichette and a run-scoring triple to Joe 
Girardi. MARYANN HUDSON

 Bud Selig, acting commissioner, backed off on the owners' claim that 19 teams 
would lose money this year, saying the minimum number was 12 to 14.

 Union head Donald Fehr called the original estimate laughable, and management 
negotiator Richard Ravitch said last week the list was based on projections.

 "You can debate the numbers," Selig said during a taped interview broadcast by 
CBS. "But you can't debate a minimum of 12 to 14. And we just can't ignore that

 Less than 12 hours after losing a 16-10, 10-inning game Saturday to the White 
Sox, Manager Marcel Lachemann was more upset with his team's early defensive 
and pitching lapses than the six runs reliever Mark Leiter gave up in the 10th 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, Mark pitched well enough in the ninth to earn a save," Lachemann 
said."He came in with runners on first and second, no one out and (Frank) 
Thomas, (Julio) Franco and (Robin) Ventura coming up and got out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Angels trailing, 10-9, and two out in the bottom of the ninth, 
pinch-hitter Bo Jackson reached second on Ventura's throwing error and Greg 
Myers singled to center to score pinch-runner Harold Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels didn't have much time to celebrate, though. Leiter gave up a 
double, a single, a triple, another single, and a three-run homer to Franco, 
before leaving with two out in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, it's tough to keep chipping away and getting back into it and then 
lose," Lachemann said, "but there were some things we did earlier, like not 
backing up a throw, failing to turn a couple of double plays and walking Tim 
Raines with two out and no one on (before Thomas' third-inning homer). Those 
are just things you can't do against good teams and still win." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 What did former general manager Buzzie Bavasi think of Saturday night's 4 
1/2-hour debacle? 
</P>
<P>
 "You kept me up pretty late last night," he told Lachemann, "but I think some 
of your players were asleep."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; HILL GETS HIS 16TH VICTORY AND EXPOS GET THEIR 17TH IN 
19 GAMES 
</P>

<P>
 Ken Hill became the National League's first 16-game winner as the Montreal 
Expos beat the Philadelphia Phillies, 6-4, Sunday at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Expos' 17th victory in 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Moises Alou tripled, doubled and singled and drove in two runs for the Expos, 
who have won 17 of their last 19 games and have the best record in the majors 
(71-39). Alou is 19 for 49 (.388) in his last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill (16-5) pitched seven-plus innings and gave up four runs and seven hits. 
He walked two and did not strike out a batter in matching his career-high win 
total. He was 16-9 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Mel Rojas pitched two innings for his 16th save. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have my real good stuff but the key is to get guys out," Hill said. 
"I had a real good splitter though and that was it. I certainly didn't have 
very good velocity like I usually have." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 7, San Francisco 4 -- The Giants lost their sixth in a row to fall 
five games behind the Dodgers in the National League West. They have been 
outscored 57-29 during the streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Astros have won six in a row. In this game at Houston, Doug 
Drabek (12-6) gave up six hits in seven innings and also went two for three. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Jones pitched the ninth for his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Bagwell went one for four and extended his career-high hitting streak to 
17 games. Bagwell, who has already set Houston single-season records for 
homers, RBIs, and extra base hits, is 29 for 61 (.475) with 10 homers and 23 
RBIs during the streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Bonds hit his 37th homer for the Giants. Matt Williams, who hit his 
major league-leading 42nd homer on Saturday, went 0 for 4 and had his hitting 
streak ended at 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 3, Atlanta 2 -- Kevin Mitchell hit his 30th homer, one of three by 
the Reds, and Pete Schourek pitched seven strong innings at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal's victory ensured that Atlanta will be in second place in the 
National League East, trailing the Expos, on the players' Aug. 12 strike date. 
The Braves, who won at a .681 pace in the second half of the last two years, 
are 13-12 since the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 Schourek (7-2) gave up only three hits over seven innings to help the Reds 
keep sole possession of first place in the National League Central. Jeff 
Brantley gave up an RBI single in the eighth to Jeff Blauser, and gave up a 
leadoff double to Fred McGriff in the ninth before closing for his 14th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 2, New York 0 -- Ryan Bowen pitched 7 1/3 shutout innings in his first 
start in nearly three months as the Marlins beat the Mets at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we don't go on strike," said Bowen (1-5), activated from the disabled 
list late Saturday and starting for the first time since May 9. He gave up 
three hits, struck out six and walked four before running into trouble in the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen was originally sidelined with pulled muscles in his rib cage and then 
developed a sore shoulder during a rehabilitation start. His next scheduled 
start is Aug. 12, the date the players have set to begin a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised he pitched this well," Florida Manager Rene Lachemann said. 
"His problem is consistency. He's pitched some pretty ugly games." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 6, St. Louis 5 -- Jay Bell grounded a single up the middle against 
a drawn-in infield for his fifth hit and the Pirates blew a three-run lead 
before winning at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The two teams stranded 28 runners -- 16 by Pittsburgh and 12 by St. Louis -- 
on 29 hits as the two bullpens took turns giving the game away. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates, salvaging the final game of the three-game series, loaded the 
bases in the ninth with none out against Bryan Eversgerd (2-3) as Tom Foley 
doubled, Don Slaught singled and Gary Varsho was hit by a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 TV replays showed Varsho intentionally stuck out his right knee to be struck 
by the pitch, leading to a brief argument and Cardinals manager Joe Torre's 
ejection. 
</P>
<P>
 Eversgerd then struck out Carlos Garcia and ran the count to 2-2 before Bell, 
five for six with two doubles, singled into center field to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 5, Chicago 1 -- Tony Gwynn went three for five in the Padres' 
victory at Chicago, raising his average to .392. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn hit a solo homer, an RBI double and a single, posting his 52nd multi-hit 
game, tops in the National League. He flew out to right in his two other 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Livingstone went four for five to lead the Padres' 17-hit attack.

FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; GANDY ENDURES RUDE WELCOME TO NFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tackle Wayne Gandy, the Rams' No. 1 draft pick, spent much of Saturday 
watching Green Bay's Sean Jones create chaos in the Ram backfield during the 
Packers' 14-6 exhibition victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Gandy is learning you have to get the mechanics of pass protection 
down," Coach Chuck Knox said."You can't afford to be sloppy at this level, 
because these pass rushers are too big and too fast." 
</P>
<P>
 That was apparent late in the second quarter when Jones left Gandy face down 
on the turf, then forced a fumble that resulted in a touchdown. The play was 
nullified by a penalty, but it was the lowest moment of Gandy's frustrating 
day. Jones left him flat-footed on several plays. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams came out of the game in fine shape. Knox said no one was injured 
seriously enough to miss practice today.  
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who did not play against the Packers because of a sore abdominal 
muscle, is expected to begin practicing again. Only Steve Israel (quadriceps) 
and Fred Stokes (knee) will miss practice, Knox said. CHRIS FOSTER

SURFING; FOR SLATER, IT'S A CASE OF TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the final moments of the U.S. Open of Surfing on Sunday, Kelly Slater 
scored a near-perfect wave and still couldn't catch Shane Beschen, who got five 
maneuvers to one ride to win at the Huntington Beach pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he had led most of the 45-minute heat, Slater needed a 9.84 ride with 
no large waves on the horizon and two minutes to go. Skillfully controlling his 
speed, he forced a barrel ride from a wave that seemed too small to support 
one. To cap the move, he launched his board off the lip of the wave, caught air 
and pumped a fist overhead after a successful whitewater landing. 
</P>
<P>
 On the pier, in the stands and on the sand, an estimated 60,000 cheered and 
the judges awarded Slater a 9.67. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was going to be a nine-something," Beschen said. "But when I saw 
him paddling back out with a minute to go, I figured (Slater would fall 
short)." 
</P>
<P>
 In his semifinal heat, Beschen defeated Sunny Garcia on a last-minute ride. 
Slater set the pace in his semifinal, catching seven waves and riding them with 
slashing turns, tail slides and a 360-degree turn. His opponent, Michael Barry, 
caught only five waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming back in less than an hour for the finals, Slater again started quickly 
and took an early lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After falling twice, Beschen took turns with Slater on small- and medium-sized 
waves to cut down the lead. On a large left-breaking wave, Beschen made two 
sharp turns and followed them with a long floater and two more quick turns. The 
wave earned him a 9.0 and sent him ahead of Slater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to make too much out of beating Kelly, but I've been surfing 
against him since I was 10," Beschen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beschen, 23, grew up in San Clemente, but faced Slater, who lives in Cocoa 
Beach, Fla., in amateur surf contests. Slater, 22, joined the world 
championship tour three years ago and won the world title in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Beschen joined the tour two years ago but had never reached the finals of an 
event.

CITY PERSEVERES AMONG RUBBLE, LOST RUBLES; GOODWILL GAMES: GLITCHES, FINANCIAL 
LOSSES CAN'T BE IGNORED ON FINAL DAY, BUT ST. PETERSBURG SHOWS SPUNK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attempting to find a niche alongside the Olympics and other international, 
multi-sport competitions, Goodwill Games officials closed their latest effort 
here Sunday having gained only a more profound sense of the lengths they still 
must go. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwill Games' founder Ted Turner and the host city lost millions of dollars 
that they will not be able to recoup soon. The event attracted little interest 
from U.S. television viewers or potential ticket buyers here. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the more than 2,000 athletes from 50 nations who competed over a 
17-day period were similarly unenthused, and some who sought to give their all 
were sabotaged by a swimming pool without clean water, an ice rink without ice 
and organizers without much organization. Add this to the list of oxymorons: 
St. Petersburg Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 While covering the Goodwill Games, journalists from several countries who are 
veterans of multi-sport competitions discussed whether there has been one with 
more apparent flaws in recent years, and while it is impossible to make a 
judgment objectively, that the question was asked is indictment enough. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, another perspective on the third Goodwill Games. Among 
those who did not grade them solely as an athletic competition but also as a 
test of an economically and politically unsure city's ability to direct its 
resources toward a common goal, the consensus was that the first international 
multi-sport event in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union was a 
triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about the organization, the way they have overcome real problems 
here, and I have to say that these Games have been a stunning success," said 
Jack Gosnell, U.S. Consulate General in St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Woodruff, a Goodwill Games consultant from Los Angeles, said that he had 
serious doubts about whether the event would occur in St. Petersburg when he 
first visited the city in 1992. He changed his mind only nine months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you consider what they've been able to do here under difficult 
circumstances, it's amazing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost was high. St. Petersburg spent $70 million in expenses directly 
related to the Games and perhaps as much on projects designed to improve the 
city's infrastructure, which Mayor Anatoly Sobchak said was necessary to assure 
that the more than 400 historical sites will continue to be tourist 
attractions. Critics contend the money would have been spent more wisely on 
social services, and anti-Sobchak graffiti became increasingly evident as the 
Games progressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikhail Bobrov, the city's most celebrated hero from World War II and a member 
of the organizing committee, said the Games' opponents are in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the very beginning, everyone said, 'Why are you wasting energy and time?' 
" he said. "Now, they see the results. The roads have been repaired, the 
buildings polished, the bridges repaired. We even have additional buses." 
</P>
<P>
 Also refurbished were sports stadiums and arenas. Although the administration 
of some of them -- the SKA Swimming Pool and the Yubileiny Sports Palace in 
particular -- was found wanting, they will be used for future international 
competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "St. Petersburg had little experience with these kinds of events," said 
Vladimir Geshkin, editor of a national sports daily newspaper, Sport Express. 
"Most of the experience was in Moscow, which had the 1980 Summer Olympics and 
the 1986 Goodwill Games. Now, this city will know better how to handle it in 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
 No one can fault officials of the local organizing committee for their effort. 
They even made sure that it did not rain during the fortnight, paying $18,000 
to a private company that dispatched planes to seed ominous clouds with silver 
salts. As a result, the moisture within the clouds was deposited before they 
reached the city. 
</P>
<P>
 They were confronted with an expense they did not anticipate when a Moroccan, 
Hammou Boutaieb, won track and field's 10,000-meter race. When it was 
discovered that the band at Petrovsky Stadium did not know the Moroccan 
national anthem and that no Moroccan flag was immediately available, Boutaieb 
refused to participate in the medal ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 For $150, the organizers had the flag shipped to them overnight from Moscow by 
the Moroccan embassy, which also faxed them the sheet music for the national 
anthem. Band members remained awake until the early hours of the morning, 
learning the anthem so the ceremony could be rescheduled for the next 
afternoon. By then, a contrite Boutaieb had already apologized and accepted his 
medal. But it was the effort that counted. 
</P>
<P>
 There were, however, no quick fixes for the problems at the pool and the ice 
rink, which resulted in delays in swimming, speed skating and figure skating 
competitions that were unprecedented for a supposedly major international 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 One crisis followed another. On the next-to-last day of the Games, employees 
of VNIPI, the company that provided computers for judges' scoring and 
tabulating results, went on strike for an hour. They said that they had not 
been paid since March. The organizing committee's offer to pay them off with 
fresh cabbage was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 The local organizers and their partners from the Goodwill Games offices in 
Atlanta locked horns over issues ranging from methods of selling tickets and 
dispensing unfavorable news to the media to the design of the gray and white 
kitten mascot, Petya. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked who was running things at a particularly disorganized competition 
one night, one of the Atlantans, in a huff, said, "Petya." 
</P>
<P>
 But when the event ended, both sides said they had learned from each other. 
Goodwill Games President Jack Kelly said that he learned patience, and members 
of the St. Petersburg Organizing Committee said they learned about overcoming 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russians are not capricious," Bobrov said. "We're used to a system. But, all 
of a sudden, we're placed in a position where we have to innovate. We're 
creating solutions to problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the organizers had so many problems to solve, the Goodwill Games did 
not create an ideal environment for athletes. In several sports, they were not 
able to compete at their best. But many of them made the most of the 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been easy for them, but they've had a great attitude about it," 
said Frank Carroll, a figure skating coach from Lake Arrowhead. "They've been 
getting out and seeing the sights and letting things come as they may. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be good for them. They'll appreciate the ice in their own rinks 
when they get home." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwill Games officials from Atlanta will go home to survey not only the 
damage to their reputations but also their finances. It has been reported that 
they will lose $26 million, which is less than the $44 million they lost in 
1986 in Moscow but about the same as they lost four years ago in Seattle. They 
are committed to another attempt in 1998 in New York, but not even Turner can 
say whether they will try again beyond then.

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER: PILOTS' GIPSON REACHES HALL OF FAME AS 
OUTFIELDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the kind of decision made every day in cramped minor league clubhouses. 
A middle infielder, struggling on defense, was moved to the outfield. But for 
Charles Gipson, a center fielder for the Riverside Pilots, it was a switch that 
already has vaulted him from the warning track to the fast track. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Monday, Gipson traveled to Cooperstown, N.Y., to play in the Hall of Fame 
game with the Seattle Mariners against Philadelphia. Late in the game, he went 
into right field and made a game-saving catch during the Mariners' 4-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never played right field before," said Gipson, who was an infielder at 
Loara High and a center fielder at Cypress College. "When I got out there, a 
ball was hit to center and it started tailing back to me and I sort of got a 
feel of how it was hooking toward the line when hit by a left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then (Phillie second baseman) Mickey Morandini came up and hit a shot that 
was going to go out. I got a good jump, timed it perfectly, jumped up pretty 
high and went up over the fence and got the home run. Just robbed it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gipson, 21, is in only his third season of professional baseball, his first 
with the Mariners' Class-A affiliate in Riverside, but he's already developed a 
big league flair for the dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit the wall and went down and nobody really knew if I caught it or not," 
Gipson said. "I got up kind of slow and then just threw it in. There had been a 
moment of silence and then it was great to hear the crowd go, 'Ahhhhhhhh,' when 
they realized I caught it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my first time playing with the big guys. (Seattle Manager) Lou 
Piniella came up and said, "Great catch," and some of the other guys came up 
and said it was one of the best catches they had ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 It will take more than a home run that wasn't to get to the major leagues, but 
Gipson has shown that he may have the right stuff, if he can continue to refine 
his offensive skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles has really good instincts in the outfield, which wasn't really the 
case in the infield," Pilot Manager Dave Myers said. "Everything there was a 
learning process for him. In the outfield, he's better able to utilize his 
basic talents. He just wasn't a so-called natural in the infield, but in the 
outfield, everything is very smooth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defensively, he could play in the big leagues right now. Offense will tell 
the story, but if he continues to develop and work on his swing, I think he'll 
be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Gipson, who played football, basketball and baseball at Loara, has exceptional 
speed and is making good use of it as the Pilots' leadoff hitter. His batting 
average has been hovering around .290 most of the season, his on-base 
percentage is in the very impressive .400 range and he leads the team with 30 
stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to be a home-run hitter," Gipson said, "so I've got to stick to 
line drives and hard ground balls. Last year, I tried the power thing, tried to 
hit the ball out a lot, and it didn't work out too well." 
</P>
<P>
 Gipson hit .258 last season -- with zero homers -- for Seattle's Class-A team 
in Appleton, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 "In spring training this year, I worked on driving the ball more and on 
hitting the inside pitch," he said, "but it's basically just a whole bunch of 
teeny, little things, some of them I don't even know yet, and then 
incorporating them into my game. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far this season, I've been trying hard to put them in, and it's worked out 
pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 Gipson, who played defensive back in the Orange County All-Star game, always 
figured he would play football at a four-year school. After high school, he 
played football at Fullerton College. 
</P>

 "I never played Little League," he said. "I didn't start playing baseball 
until high school. It was always football for me. But the season I played at 
Fullerton College was kind of like a deciding point for me. I played well, but 
my body was so beat up after the season, I wasn't sure if I wanted to deal with 
that any more. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, I thought baseball would be my future." 
</P>
<P>
 The scouts weren't quite as convinced. Seattle drafted him on the 63rd round 
of the June 1991 draft. Needless to say, he wasn't able to buy his parents a 
new house with his signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I could do it, though, if I concentrated all my time and effort on 
baseball," he said. "There are some days, when you go 0 for 4 and strike out 
three times, when you go, 'Dog, I should have stuck with football and gone to 
college.' But those days are pretty few and far between now, especially now 
that I'm in the outfield where everything seems to just come naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is, I think I have so much room to keep improving in baseball. I'm 
still learning the game, really. I'm glad I decided to take the chance. I just 
know I can be good." 
</P>
<P>
 Piniella, the Mariners and the fans at Abner Doubleday Field last Monday are 
already convinced of his defensive prowess. And the rest of the organization is 
beginning to believe they may have come up with a 63rd-round sensation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been a very pleasant surprise," Myers said. "After seeing him play in 
the instructional league right after we drafted him, to be honest, I didn't 
think he would have this kind of success in this league. 
</P>
<P>
 "But his progress is a tribute to the hard work he's put in and his 
willingness to try things and learn. And given the way he's worked at it every 
day, I've become a believer."

SOUTHLAND-BASED FANMORE WINS ARLINGTON HANDICAP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Southland-based Fanmore, the 9-10 favorite, beat longshot Marastani by a neck 
to win the $250,000 Arlington Handicap on the turf at Arlington International 
Racecourse on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fanmore, owned by Sheik Khalid Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and ridden by Pat Day, 
was timed in 2:01 3/5 for the 1 1/4 miles.Fanmore had won one of four 
California starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took him about an eighth of a mile to get going," said Day, who won the 
Arlington Handicap in 1992 aboard Sky Classic. "(Marastani) got about a neck in 
front of us at the 3/16th pole, but my horse had a lot of run left and we won 
nicely." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the show money was bet on Star Of Cozzene, who finished fifth, making 
for some unusual payoffs. Fanmore paid $3.80, $2.80 and $6.40. Marastani 
returned $4.80 and $18.80 and Split Run paid $20.20.

DEL MAR; TRAINER CROSS HAPPY TO HAVE AVOIDED CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That white question mark on the back of jockey Corey Nakatani's fire-red silks 
prompted an emphatic answer Sunday when Approach The Bench, closing in the 
middle of the track, won the $322,250 Eddie Read Handicap by a neck over 
Fastness. 
</P>
<P>
 Approach The Bench, an Irish-bred 6-year-old whose career started in Europe, 
had made only two starts in the United States and could have been claimed for 
$125,000 from a race that he won at Hollywood Park on July 4. Approach The 
Bench's last stakes victory and his only one in 1993 came a year ago in a minor 
race in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 The favorite in the Read, Blues Traveller at 9-5, held the lead in 
mid-stretch, but Fastness passed him and appeared to be on his way to victory 
before Approach The Bench caught him in the final two strides. 
</P>
<P>
 Fastness, who recovered from knee surgery to win last month at Hollywood Park, 
held on for second place, a head in front of Johann Quatz, who closed even 
farther out from the rail than Approach The Bench. Blues Traveller, who had 
been three for three in the United States at the Read distance of 1 1/8 miles 
on grass, finished fourth, beaten by almost four lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Approach The Bench, owned by John Mulhern, was timed in 1:48 4/5 and paid 
$17.20 to win. He carried 113 pounds, lightest impost in the field of seven and 
four pounds less than the three highweights. Since the Read was first run in 
1974, only one horse has won the race carrying a lighter weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Approach The Bench's trainer, 39-year-old Richard Cross, scored his first 
major victory. The English-born Cross assembled his California stable in 1983 
after working under Luca Cumani in England and John Russell in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd lost him (for the $125,000 claim), I'd be Richard Cross rest in 
peace," Cross said of Approach The Bench. He had considered running him in 
Wednesday's $75,000 Escondido, but chose the richer race because of the strong 
way the horse finished in his last start. Sunday's victory, Approach The 
Bench's seventh in 40 starts, was worth $187,250. 
</P>

 Trainer Neil Drysdale said Eddie Delahoussaye made five riding mistakes that 
contributed to Hollywood Wildcat's loss by a head to Flawlessly in Saturday's 
$316,000 Ramona Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 The most crucial was at the head of the stretch, when Hollywood Wildcat found 
herself blocked by three horses on the inside while Flawlessly and Chris 
McCarron had an open path on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Eddie just follows McCarron at that point, then Chris doesn't know what to 
do," Drysdale said. "Instead, Chris was able to keep my horse locked in, and 
she lost her momentum by the time she got clear on the outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Delahoussaye, who has won six stakes with Hollywood Wildcat since the Eclipse 
Award-winning filly came to Drysdale from Florida last year, has had a rocky 
year that has been interrupted by a virus that caused dizziness, nasal surgery 
and then root-canal work a few days ago. But he still ranks seventh on the 
national purse list with a total of almost $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll take the blame," Delahoussaye said of the Ramona. "I was probably 
overconfident with the filly. When I had to wheel her out, that might have cost 
us the race. I did what I did for a reason, but sometimes things don't work 
out. I'm allowed to mess up every once in a while. Everyone else does." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Wildcat has three victories and two seconds in five grass races. To 
renew the rivalry with Flawlessly, the champion turf distaffer the last two 
years, Drysdale would have to follow her to Arlington International for the 
Beverly D on Aug. 27. Flawlessly won that stake a year ago. Another option for 
Drysdale would be to return Hollywood Wildcat to dirt and give her a campaign 
that might lead to Churchill Downs in November for the Breeders' Cup Distaff. 
Hollywood Wildcat won last year's Distaff at Santa Anita, clinching the title 
for 3-year-old fillies on dirt. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Flawlessly gave trainer Charlie Whittingham his first stakes victory in 
California this year. . . . After working seven furlongs Sunday in 1:25 4/5, 
Stuka is expected to run Saturday in the $1-million Pacific Classic. Other 
probables for the race are entrymates Best Pal and Dramatic Gold, Bertrando, 
Slew Of Damascus, Del Mar Dennis, Tinners Way, Silver Music and Risen Roman. . 
. . With Kent Desormeaux at Saratoga to ride Lakeway in the Alabama, Chris 
McCarron will ride Best Pal. . . . Exchange, whose last victory on dirt was in 
the Chula Vista Handicap at Del Mar last September, is 8-5 on the morning line 
with entrymate Crownette for today's Bayakoa Handicap. . . . Navarone, winner 
of the Escondido Handicap in 1992, is the 120-pound highweight for the stake on 
Wednesday. Navarone also won the Del Mar Handicap in '92. . . . Trainer Ron 
McAnally is awash in fast 2-year-olds. He won the Hollywood Juvenile with the 
colt Mr Purple; a filly, Call Now, missed the track record for 5 1/2 furlongs 
by three-fifths of a second Saturday and on Sunday a Forty Niner colt, On 
Target, won in his first start.

LOSS TO MONTREAL LEAVES THE SALSA IN SOUR MOOD; SOCCER: THE IMPACT STAGES LATE 
RALLY TO WIN, 4-3, AFTER TRAILING AT HALFTIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Paul Wright's voice barely rose above a whisper as he stared at the grass, 
trying to come up with an answer for the Salsa's second-half collapse on Sunday 
against the road-weary Montreal Impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we needed to score five goals," Wright said after the Salsa's 4-3 
loss to Montreal before 2,200 at Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The distress on Wright's face was evident, but he refused to make excuses for 
a defensive meltdown that enabled Montreal to score three goals after trailing, 
2-1, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played in the same conditions we did," Wright said referring to the hot 
and smoggy conditions. "This was the most disappointing loss we've had this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss dropped the Salsa (4-5) into fourth place in the American 
Professional Soccer League standings. They were briefly atop the standings 
after defeating first-place Seattle on July 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the Salsa has lost three of four games and lost a 3-0 victory over 
Houston when that franchise disbanded in late July. 
</P>
<P>
 The Impact (5-4) took a 1-0 lead in the sixth minute when John Limniatis stole 
a throw-in at midfield and broke toward the Salsa goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalkeeper Bob Ammann stopped the defenseman's first shot, but Limniatis 
collected Ammann's clearing attempt and shot it back into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa tied it midway through the first half on a header by Paulinho off 
Zak Ibsen's centering pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa continued to pound away at the Montreal goal during the opening half 
and finally took a 2-1 lead on Wright's penalty kick in the 33rd minute. 
</P>
<P>
 After halftime, the Salsa seemed content to sit on the one-goal lead, but 
Montreal changed that when Nick Dasovic picked up a pass on the right sideline, 
beat one defender and hooked a shot toward the near post. 
</P>
<P>
 Ammann was playing toward the middle of the goal and his diving-save attempt 
was too late as the ball glanced off his palms and into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal's Mauro Biello then entered the game for Mario Rizi and gave his team 
the lead five minutes later when his centering pass clipped the heels of 
sliding Salsa defender Jeff Agoos and rolled past Ammann in the 73rd minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, the Impact added to its lead when speedster Jean Harbor broke 
away at midfield and then sneaked the ball past Ammann for a 4-2 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Lozzano's disputed goal off a corner kick shortly before the final 
whistle cut the lead to 4-3. Montreal goalkeeper Pat Harrington was given a red 
card on the play and a one-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely wasn't a goal. I stopped the ball right on the goal line and 
then covered it up," Harrington said. "Who knows, that point could come back to 
haunt us."

DUKES' FINANCIAL STATUS UNCERTAIN AS SEASON CONCLUDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The World TeamTennis season completed its 14th season in this suburb of 
Sacramento Sunday afternoon with New Jersey defeating Idaho, 28-25, in the 
championship match before 2,212 fans and an ESPN audience. The league appears 
to be on solid ground heading into its 15th season: attendance was up 8% over 
last year, and though it might lose Jimmy Connors, it is hoping to add John 
McEnroe and Ivan Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether the Dukes' franchise is standing on the same solid ground is 
another question. Duke owner Fred Lieberman is deciding whether to sell the 
franchise. But even if he somehow keeps the Dukes, there undoubtedly will be 
some changes next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainly, the Dukes will move out of the John Wayne Tennis Club. The league was 
not happy with the Newport Beach site and neither was Lieberman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how this can go back there again," he said. "The parking 
situation is the biggest problem. My season interferes with (the Hyatt 
Newporter Hotel's) biggest season. I know people don't go to the matches 
because it's such a hassle." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ilana Kloss, the WTT's executive director, said many of the fans who 
attend matches at the John Wayne Tennis Club are not the kind the league wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people out there pulling for their team like they do in Sacramento," 
Kloss said. "You don't get that feeling at John Wayne." 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman said he has spoken to UC Irvine about playing there. But regardless 
of where they play and who owns them, Kloss said the Dukes will play in Orange 
County next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will definitely have a team in the Orange County area," Kloss said. "It's 
a big market and we want a presence there." 
</P>
<P>
 If Lieberman can not unload the Dukes, Kloss said the league will take over 
the franchise. Billie Jean King, the WTT's director and co-founder, already 
owns part of the New Jersey, San Antonio and Wichita teams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the third consecutive year, Greg Patton came up a loser in the WTT finals. 
Patton, who coached the men's team at UC Irvine for 13 years, was Newport 
Beach's coach when it lost in the finals the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not getting used to this, it's making it tougher," Patton said. "I know 
what the Buffalo Bills feel like. Obviously, I'm disappointed, but I'm just so 
happy we got here. The journey was the thing that I'll remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Idaho (10-7), a new franchise, reached the finals after losing six of its 
first eight matches -- a similar scenario to the Dukes' 1992 final run. 
</P>
<P>
 "This a little different because I don't think that (1992) team believed it 
could win," Patton said. "I really think we thought we could win this." 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey (13-3) led by one point after three sets, but the match turned when 
Martina Navratilova defeated Amy Frazier, a former Duke, 6-3, in the fourth set 
to give New Jersey a 22-18 lead entering the final set. Rick Leach and Manon 
Bollegraf forced overtime with a 6-4 victory over Navratilova and John de 
Jager, but Navratilova ended the match by holding her serve in the first game 
of overtime.

NEN REDISCOVERS CONFIDENCE IN FLORIDA; BASEBALL: TRADE ALLOWED FORMER LOS 
ALAMITOS STANDOUT TO COME IN AND REPLACE BRYAN HARVEY AS MARLINS' CLOSER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Few words would have lifted Robb Nen's spirits that summer night as he 
slouched in front of his Oklahoma City clubhouse stall, exhausted, in pain, his 
mind filled with doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence spoken by his manager definitely was not on his "A" list. They 
were among the last words he wanted to hear: "You've been traded." 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas Rangers' patience with Nen, a hard-throwing right-hander whose 
stints on the disabled list seemed to rival his appearances on the mound, ended 
July 17, 1993, when he was traded to the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a crushing blow, but Nen remained composed. Maybe the change was for 
the best, Nen thought. Perhaps better days were ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Such encouragement no longer is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 A little more than a year later, Nen is pain-free and flourishing as the 
Marlins' closer. Although Nen's breakthrough season is likely to end 
prematurely because of a players' strike, he is optimistic about his future for 
the first time in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was really good for me to get out of that environment (with the 
Rangers)," Nen said. "I just wanted to start over someplace else, and I hoped 
things would be better wherever I went." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes reality exceeds even the loftiest expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Nen has been outstanding since assuming the Marlins' stopper role in July when 
All-Star reliever Bryan Harvey underwent season-ending groin surgery. He is 5-5 
with a 3.05 earned-run average and a team-high 15 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Nen relies on a blazing fastball -- which he said has been clocked at 98 
m.p.h. -- to dispose of batters, just as he did at Los Alamitos High. He has 57 
strikeouts in 56 innings, which leads Florida's relievers and is third among 
Marlin pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Nen finds the strike zone with more frequency. He has walked only 16 
batters for a superb strikeouts-to-walks ratio of about 4 to 1 -- a definite 
plus for a closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's worked very hard on his control," said Mike Gibson, Nen's coach at Los 
Alamitos, who has sent several Griffins to the major leagues. "They obviously 
have a lot of confidence in him to have him out there in the late innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He threw past people in high school, but not always for strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 While Nen, 24, has handled his new responsibility with the demeanor of a 
bomb-squad veteran, he is somewhat surprised by the smooth transition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I would have this many saves, that I'd be doing this good," 
Nen said. "I never thought the chance for the saves would be there, but I've 
worked myself into this position, and I'm glad." 
</P>
<P>
 Quite understandable considering the uncomfortable position from which he 
came. 
</P>
<P>
 Nen's seven years in the Ranger organization were ended unceremoniously by 
three trenchant words uttered by Manager Bobby Jones in the clubhouse of the 
Oklahoma City 89ers, the organization's triple-A affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 And what did Nen have to show for the experience? Well, a lot, albeit not the 
stuff that produces fond remembrances: a sore right arm, a battered psyche and 
a detailed understanding of pro baseball's injury system. And all before 
birthday No. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough times, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Chronic pain in his right shoulder forced Nen to undergo surgery three times 
from 1990-91. Texas placed Nen on the disabled list seven times, including 
three in 1991, and he missed most of the 1990 through '93 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 A starter in the Rangers' organization, Nen pitched more than 100 innings in a 
single season only once. But he was 7-4 with a 2.41 ERA and 146 strikeouts in 
138 1/3 innings in 1989 for the Rangers' single-A team in Gastonia, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 That performance led Texas to believe Nen was a budding star, and he only cost 
the organization a 32nd-round pick in the 1987 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, however, the Rangers reached their limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking such news is part of Jones' job, though not the part he enjoys. 
Telling Nen it was time to move on was especially difficult because Jones 
played with Nen's father, Dick, in the minor leagues at Denver in 1972. Dick 
also played with the Dodgers, Washington Senators and Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a shame we had to trade him," Jones said. "We didn't see him in a 
closer role because he had such great stuff we wanted him to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the problem was he'd throw a complete game and then he'd have elbow 
problems. I have no idea why he was always hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his problems, Nen did not see the trade coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a shock," Nen said. "As much as they put into me, I didn't 
think they would trade me. But I was always hurt so much that people started 
doubting me." 
</P>
<P>
 Nen admitted he often wondered if he had a place in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough," he said. "I didn't know how long it would take to recover or 
what would happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Marlins converted Nen to a reliever shortly after his arrival in south 
Florida. Last season, Nen was 1-0 with a 7.02 ERA in 15 appearances, 14 in 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was someone else's precarious medical status that created an 
opportunity for Nen. Nen received some late-inning grooming early this season 
as Harvey -- the Angels' former relief ace -- suffered a series of nagging 
injuries that limited his use. The groin injury that ended Harvey's season 
propelled Nen to prominence. 
</P>
<P>
 Nen credits Harvey's tutelage for much of his ascent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not having (Harvey) throwing has been hard, but he's still a big part of our 
team," Nen said. "When I do some things wrong, stupid things in certain 
situations, he'll say, 'Do this, or do that.' Also, I've learned a lot of stuff 
just by watching him." 
</P>
<P>
 Relief duty suits Nen. In fact, Nen wishes he would have started in the 
bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a starter, I'd go all out all the time," Nen said. "I'd try to 
throw as hard as I could every inning, and I think that might have had 
something to do with my problems. As a reliever, I can go in for an inning or 
two and give it everything and be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones is pleased by his former pitcher's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised because the talent was always there," Jones said. "He's 
finally healthy and putting it together." 
</P>
<P>
 But it looks as if Nen's show will close just as it is getting off the ground. 
The Major League Players Assn. has set a strike date of Aug. 12. A strike could 
possibly wipe out the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of not pitching again this season disappoints Nen, but he accepts 
it. As for next season -- or whenever baseball resumes -- Nen realizes Harvey 
is one of the game's dominant relievers. If Harvey returns in good health, the 
Marlins' closer job will revert to its previous owner. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nen has youth on his side. What's more, his future, finally, is wide open. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything," Nen said, "has really worked out great." 
</P>
<P>
 Those are words Nen has longed to say for quite a while.

STREET SMART: OUTLET PARKING BASED ON TOTAL SQUARE FOOTAGE OF STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 My question concerns parking at the new Oxnard Outlet Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been to the mall several times on the weekend and, each time, it was 
clear that there is not nearly enough paved parking at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars end up having to park in very dusty, unpaved lots. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm surprised that the city would allow a developer to build so many new 
stores without requiring adequate paved parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopping at the Rose, the Wal-Mart center that opened last year just down the 
road, has a huge paved parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Why doesn't the outlet mall? 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Soto, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to your question is simple, although perhaps unsatisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Oxnard bases its parking space requirements not on the number of 
stores at any particular location, but on the total square footage of stores at 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
 For shopping centers such as the Oxnard Outlet Mall and Shopping at the Rose, 
the city requires one parking space for every 225 square feet of shopping area, 
says Linda Windsor, associate planner for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Believe it or not, the number of paved parking spaces at the outlet mall 
actually slightly exceeds the requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall, which is about 147,000 square feet, has about 675 parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 These numbers are, of course, dwarfed by the Wal-Mart center, which contains a 
mammoth 500,000 square feet of shopping area accompanied by 3,500 parking 
spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 But more parking spaces are on the way at the Oxnard outlet. As part of a plan 
to build a second phase of stores, Windsor says, the developer will also pave a 
second parking lot. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm really fed up with a glitch in the design of an intersection in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is in trying to turn left from eastbound Telegraph Road to 
southbound Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 While the far-right lane on Telegraph is set aside solely for cars turning 
right, a second lane is designated for both right-turning cars and for those 
continuing to go straight. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that although the signal is designed with a right-turn arrow, 
if you end up in the second right-turn lane behind a car going straight, you 
are stuck until the straight-ahead light turns green. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from being a major irritation, this fault in the design of the 
intersection causes unnecessary traffic backups. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd appreciate the city's attention in addressing this problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Hill, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The city is all too aware of the problems at this troublesome intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 A project scheduled to begin by the end of the year will ease the traffic 
congestion at the intersection, Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani says, although it 
is not designed to solve your particular concern. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest complaints that the city has heard about this intersection are 
that the left-turn arrow from westbound Telegraph onto Victoria is too short 
and that there are not enough lanes heading south on Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new plan, a second left-turn lane will be added on westbound 
Telegraph and another lane will be added on southbound Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Your concern about cars turning right from Telegraph onto southbound Victoria 
is harder to address, Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 After studying the problem, the city has concluded that the only way to solve 
it would be to add another lane so that two lanes would be set aside 
exclusively for cars turning right. 
</P>
<P>
 Doing so would mean cutting into property owned by surrounding businesses, and 
the city is investigating the possibility of doing just that, Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another problem occurs at the intersection when students from nearby Buena 
High School cross against the light en masse during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Lalani says he plans to make a report on the pedestrian problem to the Ventura 
City Council in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're chipping away at the problem bit by bit," he said. " We're trying to do 
everything we can to get the traffic running smoothly there." 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans recently made a change in the striping on the Moorpark Freeway that 
could be a safety hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 The change is at the northbound on-ramp to the Moorpark Freeway from the 
eastbound Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a few weeks ago, the ramp continued as two lanes all the way from the 
Ventura Freeway onto the Moorpark Freeway. Now the two lanes are merged into 
one -- right near a big curve in the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Many drivers who are used to the old way are not slowing down to merge. I've 
already seen several near-misses. 
</P>
<P>
 Why was this change made and can anything be done to clear up the confusion? 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Miller, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The striping change on the Moorpark Freeway will help more than hurt, says Bob 
Houle, traffic engineer for the state Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the change, traffic coming from Los Angeles on the Ventura Freeway was 
forced to squeeze into one lane before entering the Moorpark Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 What Caltrans has done is shift the lanes so that the heavier flow of Los 
Angeles traffic now has two lanes entering the Moorpark Freeway, while the 
lighter flow of traffic coming from Ventura has only one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the lesser of two evils," Houle said. "We'd like to have two lanes on 
both directions. Since we can't do that, we wanted to give more space to the 
direction with more traffic."

AGENCY GIVES FOSTER YOUTHS LESSONS ON SURVIVING; EDUCATION: WHEN THEY REACH 18, 
THESE YOUNGSTERS ARE ON THEIR OWN. INTERFACE CHILDREN, FAMILY SERVICES IS 
TEACHING THEM HOW TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kicked out of foster homes by law on their 18th birthdays, Ventura County's 
former foster children will soon get more help in facing instant adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, foster children were thrust out on their own at 18 with no 
training or support beyond what they had learned in a county-funded living 
skills class taught by staff at Interface Children, Family Services. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-August, though, Interface plans to convert McAvoy House, its Camarillo 
shelter for abused children, into a transitional group home to teach foster 
boys age 17 and 18 how to fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be getting older youngsters who have almost no chance of reunification 
with their families," said Terry Miller, executive director of Interface. 
"They're looking at being virtually on their own" once they leave the six-bed 
home, which will augment privately run transition homes already serving foster 
girls, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 McAvoy House is just one of a series of projects and plans that the agency 
hopes will smooth out the traditionally rough ride foster children face going 
into adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
 Others include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A fledgling, county-run scholarship program for foster children called 
Project TEACH (Training and Education for the Achievement of CHildren). 
</P>
<P>
 * First apartments for foster youths. In coming weeks, Interface hopes that 
the state Department of Social Services will choose it to run a pilot project 
offering free transitional apartments to foster youths who are about to "age 
out" of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rent subsidies. Interface has applied for federal grant money that would pay 
the security deposits and first three months of rent on first apartments for 
former foster youths age 18 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Emancipation is a sudden, merciless challenge for the two to three dozen 
foster children in Ventura County who turn 18 each year. 
</P>
<P>
 It falls hard on the barely matured backs of youths who are already fighting 
personal demons -- memories of the physical abuse, incest or drug abuse that 
ripped them from their families in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Good jobs that pay the rent await many foster youths who learn quickly how to 
play the tricky game of adulthood. But without support and encouragement, 
others fumble the heavy demands of independence and land in low-paying jobs, 
homeless shelters -- even jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster children and parents say they need all the help they can get. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a fast-paced learning process because most of these kids don't have 
the luxury of slowly weaning themselves from their parents," said Randy Ellis, 
a foster father. 
</P>
<P>
 His foster daughter, Cecilia, will be going to Cal State Northridge this fall 
on a $1,500 scholarship from Project TEACH. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia said she is glad for the help, but as for growing up on her own, "it 
sucks." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to pay for my own insurance. I have to pay for my own clothes, whereas 
I see other kids out there, and Mommy and Daddy do everything for them," said 
Cecilia, identified only by first name because she is a dependent of the 
county. "And I think, 'What did I do to deserve this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 She vowed to make the most of her scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what it's like not to have money," Cecilia said. "I'm going to make 
something of myself because I don't want to live like this ever again." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Matthews, 19, said he thought that independence would be easy once he 
was emancipated and employed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Oxnard youth ran up against the staggering cost of rent and security 
deposits for a first apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he lost his eight-month busboy gig at a local eatery last winter after 
one backbreaking solo shift left him so frustrated that he punched a restroom 
door, broke his hand and missed two days of work. 
</P>
<P>
 And his grandmother -- who raised him, but had to turn him over to foster care 
four years ago because of a heart condition -- is demanding rent now that he is 
home again. 
</P>
<P>
 His summer job search has been long, hot, hard and fruitless. And he wishes 
that he had paid more attention in the independent living skills classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was coming and I had a little bit of time to prepare, but I really 
wasn't trying to listen to what people were telling me," he said. "Before I 
knew it, I was out." 
</P>
<P>
 Living on disability benefits, his grandmother, Gennell Smith, said she and 
her husband need Chris to pull his weight. He is working hard at job-hunting, 
she said, and she is proud that he has made it this far. 
</P>
<P>
 "But one day I'll be dead and gone," Smith said. "And he'll have to get his 
own place, and he'll have to pay his light bill. Mom taught (our family) that 
from the start." 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling to fix a flat on a battered bicycle that is his only transportation 
for job interviews, Chris echoed Cecilia's sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing I've learned is to endure," he said. "You're going to be 
struggling, but that's the way it's going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Franck said she believes that foster youths should rely on their own 
planning and strength to survive like she has -- not on free apartments and 
subsidized rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't be a bad idea, don't get me wrong," she said of Interface's 
housing plans. "But that's still like welfare. There's so many problems with 
the system that they need to fix, like getting better foster parents to help 
them prepare (for adulthood). . . . If anything, they need to focus the kids 
more on the long-term, with plans for college." 
</P>
<P>
 Franck had something of a head start on self-sufficiency, having worked since 
age 12 or 13 to bolster her family's income. She was physically abused by her 
father, she said, but it was a beating by her older brother when she was 16 
that finally turned neighbors' complaints into a court order for foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a dizzying succession of nine foster homes in two years, she said -- 
including one with an alcoholic foster father -- that persuaded her to 
concentrate on her own future and graduate in 1992 from Royal High School in 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 20, Franck has a bookkeeping job and her own rented room in a Moorpark 
condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 And she has every intention of starting her college studies in child 
psychology next month on a slew of scholarships -- including $2,500 from 
Project TEACH -- at Sonoma State University in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Running her own life, Franck said, is "kind of in your face. You're either 
going to save money, get an apartment, get insurance for yourself and go on to 
college, or you're going to be working in a McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone has as much grit as Franck, though, said Richard Shaw, who helps 
oversee court-ordered placement of foster children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say it's highly unusual for somebody to be as focused as she is," said 
Shaw, administrative support coordinator at the county division of children's 
protective services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes there are kids who come out of our system who are survivors and do 
well regardless," he said, but some have been left damaged by their personal 
trauma and are not prepared to do it alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a greater chance that they would succeed with those programs," Shaw 
said of McAvoy House, Project TEACH, and the hoped-for rent subsidies and 
state-funded transition apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this little extra helping hand could really go a long way to help 
these kids start out with some feeling of success and not this (situation) 
where suddenly they're out on the street with a 'What am I gonna do now?' kind 
of feeling."

INSPIRED BY SUBURBIA; LITERARY MAGAZINE WITH ROOTS IN SIMI VALLEY IS STILL 
SURVIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jordan Jones' best friend may well be the U.S. Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly five years, Jones, a Simi Valley poet, has labored to produce 
Bakunin, a literary magazine oozing with confrontational works on topics 
including racism, homosexuality, religious intolerance and political 
persecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by Jones' late-night labor and unflagging determination, the magazine 
has evolved from a thin manuscript to a glossy-covered, 140-page volume. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the twice-yearly publication has received national acclaim, it has 
gone virtually unnoticed in the town that inspired its creation. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the 1,000-copy printing of each edition is sold through distributors 
in New York, San Francisco and Austin, Tex. The other half is shipped off as 
payment to contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 "My audience really has not been concentrated in Simi Valley," said Jones, 30. 
"Thank God for the Postal Service." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, at Book World, Simi Valley's sole independent bookstore and the only 
local outlet for the magazine, back issues gather dust. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Hocheiser, an editor at Simi Valley's other literary journal, Verve, 
said she has heard of Jones but said she was not aware of Bakunin's existence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this another local magazine?" she asked. "Is this magazine a college 
magazine? I was under the impression it was. I guess they've branched out." 
</P>
<P>
 Verve, a semi-annual publication, is geared toward a mainstream audience, 
Hocheiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones gets most of his submissions from California and New York, with a 
smattering from other states and countries as far-flung as Japan, Poland and 
Panama. For each published submission, Jones pays the contributor with two 
copies of the magazine, which is named after Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, the lack of local awareness has not bothered Jones, who uses 
his community as a springboard for ideas for the journal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in this edge city, this suburban enclave, struggling against the 
majority views -- which are at best conservative, at worst reactionary," Jones 
explained in a recent issue of the magazine. "I have felt a need to puzzle out 
the roots of my ambivalence toward my hometown." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, to build awareness in Simi Valley of Bakunin and literature in general, 
Jones has launched a monthly poetry reading at the Vampyre Lounge coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The next reading, scheduled Sept. 12 at 8:30 p.m., features Robert Peters, a 
UC Irvine professor who will perform from a one-man stage piece entitled 
"Mengele's Uterus: A Fairy Tale: The Sex Life of J. Edgar Hoover." 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Amy Uyematsu, the author of "30 Miles From J-Town," will read from 
her works about her Japanese heritage and internment camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "My idea is to help bring the city to the suburbs," Jones said. "So often 
people from the suburbs go to the city. I want to make more connections between 
the two." 
</P>
<P>
 After the civil unrest in Los Angeles that followed the first Rodney G. King 
trial, Jones devoted an entire issue to the subject. "As the only progressive 
publication in the infamous town of Simi Valley," he wrote, "we feel especially 
called upon to promote a constructive dialog on the continuing social tragedies 
that led to the violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Kate Harper, a writer and Bakunin contributor, was teaching a college English 
class in the Antelope Valley at the time. She had her students read the entire 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought Bakunin was very leftist," Harper said. "They are the young 
Republicans growing up out there. Some of them thought the Simi Valley trial 
had gone very well. But I think the magazine gave them a different way of 
looking at things." 
</P>
<P>
 Writers and artists living in and near Ventura County say the magazine is a 
welcome reminder that there is more to Simi Valley than freeways and strip 
malls. 
</P>
<P>
 J. T. Ledbetter, an English professor at Cal Lutheran University and a 
frequent Bakunin contributor, said he is not surprised that a magazine like 
Bakunin sprung from Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Creativity is a part of nature and a part of being human," Ledbetter said. 
"You can't stop it, and sometimes it will break out in the darndest places 
because we need it. Simi Valley may not know it, but Simi Valley needs 
Bakunin." 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Carolyn See views Bakunin as an outlet for the diversity and creativity 
in Simi Valley that is often ignored. Her latest novel, "Making History," 
features a Simi Valley psychic closely modeled on a person she met in the town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a theory and that is that these towns on the far side of the San 
Fernando Valley and up into the desert are really not what they seem," See 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We maybe project upon them the idea that they are full of rednecks or 
ill-educated or right-wing maniacs or upstart pillars of the church," she said. 
"But often when people move out to places like Simi Valley, it's because 
they've got a secret or their brains aren't wired the way everyone else's are." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones agrees. "Despite the demographics that place Simi Valley in a very 
conservative and right-wing mold, there are plenty of people who think 
differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley photographer Sharon Hardee is one of those people. Hardee was 
thrilled when a friend told her about Bakunin last year. Four of her 
computer-manipulated photographs appeared in last winter's issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here for years and I really didn't expect to come across anything 
like this," she said. "It was really a pleasant surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 But why does Jones remain in Simi Valley instead of seeking the company of 
other like-minded souls in Los Angeles or New York? 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a writer of place and a placed writer," he said. "Simi Valley is my 
home. I like the terrain. I like the Santa Susana hills with all the rocks. 
It's a very rooted place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the fact that even though we're in suburbia, there are still a lot of 
wild animals around. There have been owls in the tree outside for as long as I 
can remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones lives in the house where he grew up, in one of Simi Valley's older 
developments known as the Greek tract. 
</P>
<P>
 Legend has it, Jones said, that a Greek farmer who owned the property refused 
to sell unless the developers agreed to name the streets after his country's 
philosophical and mythological heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence the cluster of quiet, tree-lined drives with such names as Aristotle, 
Electra and Apollo, the mythical god of music, poetry, prophecy and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the street names and their relation to his work, Jones 
laughed. "A funny coincidence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' path to the literary world was roundabout. In college, he majored in 
chemistry, but "had a serious run-in with the brick wall that is calculus," and 
switched to the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "High technology is fascinating to me," he said, "although it's not as 
engaging as literature." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones puts his high-tech aptitude to work as a technical writer for Micom 
Communications Corp., a Simi Valley-based company whose main function, as Jones 
describes it, is building devices "that allow you to be on the phone and get a 
fax over the same line at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 While Jones acknowledged that he would most enjoy focusing on poetry and other 
creative writing full-time, he said he has gained valuable knowledge on the job 
that has helped him publish the entire magazine on his personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned a lot about page composition and layout and how much space to 
leave and various things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Bakunin has managed to survive nearly five years is remarkable, 
said Sarah Meyer, managing director of the Council of Literary Magazines and 
Presses, a national organization that publishes an annual directory of literary 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, as many as 600 literary magazines are active. But nearly 1,000 
more fluctuate in and out of publication, Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The odds are very much against long-term survival," Meyer said. "It takes a 
lot of determination to keep a magazine alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Quality of content varies widely, Meyer said. And there is no standardized 
method of comparing magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this field, you find everything from people throwing magazines together in 
their garage to the more well-established, well-regarded journals," Meyer said. 
"There really isn't any widespread mechanism to compare one literary magazine 
with another. It's not like movies or live theater, where you have reviews." 
</P>
<P>
 Norman Mallory, a poet and teacher at Ventura College who once taught Jones, 
has high praise for his former student. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jordan is one of the brightest people I've ever known. It is really 
astounding that he was able to put this together and keep it going. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to do a journal that would not just be some sort of local little 
wheel that was spinning here and making smoke. I think he has succeeded."

MEDIA CITY BUILDER RAISES $374 MILLION; FINANCE: HAAGEN CO., WHICH DEVELOPED 
MALL WITH CITY AS PARTNER, RECEIVES CASH INFUSION FROM INVESTORS. SOME WONDER 
WHEN REVENUES WILL FLOW IN BURBANK'S DIRECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Eight months after going public, the Alexander Haagen Co. says it has raised 
$374 million in much-needed capital from investors around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm developed the Burbank Media City Center shopping mall in partnership 
with the city of Burbank. Haagen used $133 million to repay debt on the center, 
which was completed in 1991, said an official with the Manhattan Beach-based 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen's company and Burbank officials declined to discuss the ongoing, 
closed-door meetings they have had about the property. 
</P>
<P>
 But one city official said the Haagen firm's ability to pay its debt is 
important to the mall's long-term financing. 
</P>
<P>
 The city leases the land to Haagen and will do so at least until the year 
2045. In exchange, the developer must turn over 50% of the net profits 
generated by the shopping center after debt service. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall has not yet yielded a profit for Burbank, however. But city officials 
are confident about eventually receiving a return on the millions of dollars 
spent to purchase the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not realized one nickel. All the money is going in (Haagen's) 
direction," said Ted McConkey, an observer of City Hall. "Where Haagen and his 
company held out the promise of profit, nothing is coming back and the city has 
never quite figured out how to get out of the mess." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials insist that Burbank's investment in the Media City Center has 
been relatively unaffected by the public financing of Haagen's company, and the 
city will still get to keep half of the net profits made. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not been a great deal of impact at all," Mayor Bill Wiggins said. "We 
are still partners in the Media City Center mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the city not seeing anything from it, my (response) is: Go down to 
the mall. I think the mall has brought in a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Little debate preceded Haagen's step toward public financing, in large part 
because city staff determined that their consent was unnecessary for the deal 
to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen placed the bulk of his firm's assets -- which includes 36 properties 
throughout Southern California -- into a real estate investment trust late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 A REIT, as it is known, works somewhat like a mutual fund. Money from a number 
of investors is pooled to buy property or make loans. Some people prefer REITS 
because they offer potentially high yields and shares can easily be sold 
through a broker. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 10 million Haagen company shares were sold within a month, according 
to a company official who declined to be identified. The largest shareholders 
are fund-management companies such as Cohen & Steers of New York and 
Boston-based Fidelity Management & Research Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's closing price for Alexander Haagen Co. shares was $17.88 on the 
American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shopping center has thrived since the formation of the REIT," said 
Assistant City Manager Steve Helvey. "To say we haven't profited is to ignore 
the sales tax and economic vitality of downtown. . . . Our view is that 
everybody got what they bargained for."

THE CAPITOL HILL FREELOADING ZONE; POLITICS: HUNGRY LEGISLATIVE STAFFERS HAVE A 
LOT ON THEIR PLATES AT LOBBYISTS' RECEPTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 For one mouthwatering moment, Kirk Cartozian thought he had arrived in 
finger-food heaven. There he was on Capitol Hill, among the hungry hordes 
attending a reception thrown by some California fresh chicken group. 
</P>
<P>
 The lobbyists wanted to show lawmakers what a fresh chicken really tastes 
like, versus the rival frozen birds. And while Cartozian is no lawmaker -- just 
a 20-year-old unpaid summer intern for Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach) -- he was 
ready to offer, free of charge, his well-honed chicken-tasting expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 And all around him, chicken to die for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tables of the best-tasting, juiciest, most succulent chicken you could 
imagine -- and every last bit of it was filet -- not a bone in sight," said the 
Long Beach resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't care about the fresh chicken debate but I was hungry. It was pure 
freeloading. I ate chicken until I couldn't touch another piece. Then I brought 
four pounds back to the office." 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever said there is no free lunch never worked on Capitol Hill, which is 
among the last truly "Eat Free" zones in America. It's the home of the gratis 
breakfast, lunch and dinner, featuring free booze by the caseload, free Swedish 
meatballs and artichoke dip, free crab cakes and carrot pasta, free shrimp 
souffle and tarragon chicken salad -- all compliments of some lobbyist group or 
another angling for the attention of influential Washington politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Each week, especially in the spring and summer, receptions hosted by obscure 
or mighty special interests fill Capitol Hill meeting rooms with lobbyists 
rubbing forks with low-level aides, high-falutin legislative staffers and 
policy-makers, even lawmakers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 On the reception circuit, the common thread often isn't an interest in any 
cause or issue. It's pure appetite. 
</P>
<P>
 Greeting all comers are the smiling lobbyists -- men and women with large name 
tags, eager to please, refill a drink, summon a new tray of food -- often in no 
rush to check a guest's credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeloading crowd knows this. Scores of Capitol Hill staffers -- an army 
of unpaid interns and underpaid clerical workers -- wander the bowels of the 
Rayburn and Cannon House office buildings, young sharks alert to the scent of a 
free feed. 
</P>
<P>
 Come evening, they go in search of receptions thrown by the Wiping Cloth 
Manufacturers Assn., Woodcutters Institute, Amusement Machine Manufacturers 
Assn. and American Council of Shopping Centers. 
</P>
<P>
 While most events are intended for lawmakers and top aides, many Capitol Hill 
offices trade reception schedules like stock tips. Bosses often send in their 
places junior staffers, who spread the word to friends in other offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick, interns say, is to arrive early. Receptions start at 5 p.m. sharp 
and the free food and booze are gone an hour later. Said Cartozian: "The idea 
is to hit two or three. The reception circuit is like bar cruising. Only it's 
free." 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Nasarenko, a junior staffer for Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson, (D-Woodland 
Hills), is a sage reception hopper who knows his favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dairy Assn. has chefs who make these great omelets to order," said the 
24-year-old Woodland Hills native. While eating, Nasarenko sometimes picks up a 
date -- a young, single "Hill rat" like himself out for a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 "My favorite was a Family Planning Assn. event," Nasarenko recalled fondly. 
"Not only did they have Virginia Gov. Chuck Robb, they had great beer. We're 
talking Heineken. No Bud. No Busch. No Miller Lite." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as lawmakers this year try to reduce the influence of lobbyists through 
bills such as the Lobbying Reform and Gift Disclosure Act, Capitol Hill 
insiders say the reception circuit will survive unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would prohibit lobbyists -- but not the specific groups they 
represent -- from sponsoring such events. While the number of receptions might 
dwindle, insiders say it wouldn't be by much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's worried about the receptions," said one House subcommittee staffer. 
"Most people see them as work rather than fun. You're subjected to these boring 
pitches. Anyway, I can't imagine any lawmaker's position being influenced by a 
couple of greasy hors d'oeuvres." 
</P>
<P>
 Some say that outlawing receptions would drain Capitol Hill of its culinary 
lifeblood. "I went to these things for years, and let me tell you, the issues 
are completely irrelevant," said one former congressional staffer. "I went. I 
ate. I had a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a sociable guy, but when I'd walk into a reception I wouldn't want to 
talk. I'd zero in on the best food and just stand there, shamelessly eating -- 
not coming up for air. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd look around and see other people doing exactly the same thing. And I'd 
say, 'Go ahead, brother. Chow down.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Um, an intern in Horn's office, said food isn't always the goal at 
receptions. She bases her attendance on the issue involved. Sometimes, it pays 
off in other ways. At one reception by a group opposing the use of animals in 
laboratory tests, she received free perfume researched through chemical, not 
animal, techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 For novices, receptions provide an entree into the bounties of Capitol Hill. 
Veterans, however -- who may have risen to salary levels where freeloading is 
less tempting -- are embarrassed that they ever frequented the circuit, saying 
they now prefer to go home, walk their dog -- even cook their own dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get real boring," said Mickey Pollock, an aide to Rep. Carlos J. 
Moorhead (R-Glendale). "You see the same people, eat the same things. After a 
while, it just becomes this routine of dressed-up finger food and small talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyway, you can only eat so many weenies on a toothpick before you either go 
out of your mind or gain 20 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Nasarenko has his own version of the pilgrim's progress. "First you hit the 
reception circuit. Then you grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to shameless reception freeloading on Capitol Hill, Russell 
Batson wrote the booklet. 
</P>
<P>
 The former congressional aide has compiled helpful hints gleaned from years of 
crashing hundreds of receptions in his 32-page "Eat Free in DC: A Guide to 
Budget-Neutral Dining." 
</P>
<P>
 He rates the best and worst Capitol Hill receptions, from the dizzying heights 
of the Louisiana Congressional Delegation party and its alligator in piquant 
sauce and giant shrimp, to the lowly hot dogs served by the American Council of 
Shopping Centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can eat like Elvis without spending a dime," Batson wrote in the popular 
booklet, which sells for $5.95. "What a country!" 
</P>
<P>
 Batson tells how to confront occasional door security. There are even grazing 
tips for the stand-up reception scene, such as the one-handed plate stack where 
you use your drink tumbler to support your plate, leaving the other hand free 
to work the fork. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pleased to see Bill Clinton using this technique," Batson wrote, "a 
testament to its efficiency and capacity to provide an uninterrupted flow of 
very large volumes of food." 
</P>
<P>
 After consuming oceans of cream sauces and dips himself, Batson says the book 
was a natural. "I got into this conversation once about whether you could eat 
free every night and decided you could -- with a little bit of ingenuity." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the food-mooching war stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "The legendary figure is Strom Thurmond," Batson said. "He's well-known for 
making a beeline to the jumbo shrimp, stuffing his pockets full." 
</P>
<P>
 Batson also has a tip on how to avoid lobbyists at receptions. "These selfish 
individuals will attempt to interrupt your feeding frenzy to discuss 
legislation," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "If approached, try 'signing,' making frequent gestures to your food and 
sweeping motions in their direction. If all else fails, remember it is their 
food; listen to their pitch, nod and say, 'Good point.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But reception freeloading has its dangers. "There have been buffet tables 
where I was afraid of losing a finger," Batson said. "So many forks, all 
working at once." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The mango chutney coating the coconut shrimp glistened greasily under the 
direct ceiling light, bending Mark Brasher's mouth into a frown of distaste. 
</P>
<P>
 Brasher, a 27-year-old legislative aide to Rep. Horn, was doing the 
shake-and-bake -- Capitol slang for shaking hands and freeloading food -- at an 
event sponsored by the Food Distribution Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the former Long Beach resident lived the reception life before 
settling into semi-retirement, choosing only the most promising affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Before him, on a table adorned with a massive flower arrangement, lay a spread 
of miniature pastry puffs with tarragon chicken salad, cherry tomatoes stuffed 
with tuna-caper mousse. There were chicken tenders with Dijonnaise sauce, 
miniature quiche tartlets and mushrooms stuffed with crab souffle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Average at best," he sniffed, moving his toothpick toward the stuffed 
mushrooms. "You'd think they'd do better. It's oily fat food. I mean, how long 
can you go on eating this?" 
</P>
<P>
 All around him, in the carpeted conference room lined by state flags in the 
basement of the Capitol, half a dozen members of Congress, staffers and a bevy 
of food distribution lobbyists were doing just fine scarfing down everything 
within their reach. 
</P>
<P>
 People push for second and third helpings. One man balances two plates, a 
wineglass and beer can, knowing he has to work fast. With the reception an hour 
old, the food and the crowd are thinning. 
</P>
<P>
 Brasher has little patience for such scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 While he stomachs the annual ice cream manufacturer's reception, considered a 
must-attend event across Capitol Hill, he draws the line at the Southern 
watermelon growers' bash, where scantily clad young beauty queens compete in a 
seed-spitting contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a humiliating spectacle," he said. "You ask yourself, 'How could they do 
that?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of this night's event is to award several congressmen pewter 
statues to signify their work on issues dear to the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Two women sneaking nibbles from their plastic plates say the tales of 
sumptuous food and wild reception parties are overblown. "People tell tall 
tales," says Charla Worsham. "Most of these things involve stale chips and 
sauce." 
</P>
<P>
 Bending low over the quiche tart tray, Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Garden Grove) 
says such receptions serve a good purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I was a congressman, I used to come here to lobby for the POW-MIA 
cause. I had five little kids all under 10 years old and I was on a budget," he 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I skipped breakfast and lunch and chowed down on The Hill at night. But 
it's where I conducted most of my business. I knew it's where I could find the 
congressmen." 
</P>
<P>
 He directs a listener to the shrimp tray, saying lobbyist receptions save 
taxpayer money. "We work our young staffers hard, late into the night, past the 
times restaurants close. So they come down here, get their energy levels up and 
come back to work." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the kind of talk lobbyists like to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of underpaid staff here for free food -- it's a fact of life," 
says Chris Galen, a food distribution spokesman, pointing to a $6,000 reception 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not much we can do. This is a goodwill reception. We want to keep our 
congressmen happy. Part of that job is keeping their staffs happy as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most fascinating spectacle amid the feeding frenzy is the 
performance put on by freeloaders trying to escape the lobbyists' sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 The message-bearers are often inescapable, and can sometimes bring a blush of 
shame to the cheek of even the most dedicated freeloader. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had this one buzz-killing experience I'll never forget," recalled one 
reception hopper. "I was at this reception for the National Head Injury 
Foundation, scarfing down good food when out comes this guy in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could tell he used to be real sharp and they wheeled him over and started 
talking policy and funding. And I said to myself, 'Oh, jeez. This is bad. I 
can't listen to this. I'm just a freeloader.' "

ENTREPRENEUR DRIVES CHANGE; ENVIRONMENT: ARTHUR SWEET'S DEVICE COMPRESSES 
HOUSEHOLD NATURAL GAS INTO A TANK IN THE TRUNK OF A CAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arthur Sweet eased his 1986 Lincoln Town Car along smog-clouded Ventura 
Boulevard and pointed at the tailpipe of the Mazda in the next lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "See that guy? He's polluting," said the 72-year-old entrepreneur. "If we 
could take cars like that car off the road and replace them with these, we 
could clean up the whole basin." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sweet's four-door beast looks like a gas guzzler, it releases only 
about 20% of the toxins spewed by most other cars on the road because it runs 
on natural gas, the same stuff used in stoves and high school biology labs. 
</P>
<P>
 This environmental good turn, Sweet hopes, will mean a greening of his wallet 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 After equipping his Lincoln with a scuba-style natural gas tank and other 
equipment in 1993, the Encino real estate developer started Goremotive 
Industries, which recently developed a device that compresses gas from ordinary 
household gas lines into a tank in the trunk of his car. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not yet on the market, Sweet's unit would compete with the 
FuelMaker, a similar Canadian-made product, and home gas converters being 
developed by other small companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet is part of a gold rush of entrepreneurs flocking to the 
clean-burning-vehicle business, each hoping to stake a claim in a developing 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 He envisions a society in which people come home from work, plug their cars 
into their gas lines and the next morning drive away with a 300-mile range 
before having to switch to conventional fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology in Sweet's Lincoln and his wife's 1990 Chrysler has been used 
mostly for the fleets of public agencies such as post offices and utilities, 
which are usually equipped with their own natural gas fueling stations, said 
Warren Mitchell, chairman of the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition and president of 
the Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
 While most prototype clean-burning cars are being developed by the Big Three 
auto makers and large consortiums of public and private organizations, Mitchell 
said, many advances in components and fueling technology have been made by tiny 
enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Their contributions could help bust open a vast market of car owners willing 
to pay thousands extra for a less-polluting drive and the convenience of 
overnight refueling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home refueling is a very good idea," Mitchell said. "People don't have to go 
to a service station, and they feel good about having a clean-burning vehicle. 
It's a wide-open market, and business people are picking a particular niche and 
getting in early." 
</P>
<P>
 Many investors, Mitchell said, feel vehicles capable of using natural gas 
could be the quickest route to fewer auto emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike electric car technology, which has stalled on the problem of battery 
capacity, converting to natural gas requires few changes to engines with 
fuel-injection systems because they can operate on natural gas as easily as 
standard fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet said he converted his Lincoln for about $4,600. And with the flick of a 
switch, he can alternate between using natural gas and standard fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 The main drawbacks are the bulky tanks that virtually eliminate trunk space, 
the hours-long fueling time and the price of extra equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 But because natural gas is easier on engines and about 30 cents cheaper than 
the equivalent gallon of fuel, Mitchell said, conversion may be cost-effective 
in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet embarked on his new business last year after reading Vice President Al 
Gore's book "Earth in the Balance," which urges people to become part of the 
solution to smog and other environmental hazards. Inspired, he named his 
company after the veep. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Goremotive was awarded its first government grant: $75,000 from the 
U.S. Department of Energy to study ways to make natural gas burn more cleanly. 
The company was one of 200 recipients chosen from 2,374 applicants, Sweet said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people getting going in this business," Sweet said. 
"Things are going to change."

WILDLIFE BIOLOGISTS ARE SHARING BEST OF 2 WORLDS; ECOLOGY: BRAZILIAN SCIENTIST 
HOPES TO TAKE HOME IDEAS FROM VOLUNTEER AND PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT SHE 
IS OBSERVING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The often dry and wind-swept landscapes of the Channel Islands seem an 
unlikely training ground for a woman charged with protecting the lush rain 
forests of southern Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 But through an exchange program hosted by wildlife biologists in Ventura, 
Maria Elisa Castellanos Sola will take home valuable tips to help her manage 
the endangered and disappearing jungles in the state of Minas Gerais. 
</P>
<P>
 The dark-haired Sola is at once excited and intensely serious as she talks 
about her plans to set up volunteer and public education programs such as the 
ones she saw in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 On Santa Cruz Island, for instance, she watched high school students work as 
volunteers in a summer program with the Nature Conservancy to repair fences, 
rid the island of non-native plants and do general maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Each evening, groups of students prepared a short presentation on the work 
they had done that day, and the issues involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "While these children are doing this hard work, they are also learning about 
the environment," Sola said. "When you have kids working with preservation, you 
teach them something they could not learn in a classroom. It was really 
beautiful to see this." 
</P>
<P>
 That combination of teaching and tapping the potentially vast network of free 
labor through volunteers will be incorporated in a similar program in Brazil, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my plan -- to have a program like this, this year," Sola said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sola is one of two scientists from Latin America chosen to come to the county 
this year as part of a program aimed at exchanging information and experiences, 
learning from American mistakes and profiting from successes. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-week course, known as the Exchange Program for Latin American 
Protected Area Managers, was conceived by Marc Weitzel, a Ventura-based U. S. 
Fish and Wildlife biologist whose duties include leading the California condor 
recovery team. The exchange program is funded by Fish and Wildlife's Office of 
International Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the 2-year-old program will also send U. S. scientists to Latin 
America to learn from that region's experiences as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to think of protecting natural resources in a global context," 
Weitzel said. "Everything we do is interrelated." 
</P>
<P>
 The air and water that is cleansed and purified by the rain forests of Brazil 
is important to the entire region, he said. "One could look at the entire 
Western Hemisphere as a single ecosystem." 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, migratory birds, which spend many months of the year in Ventura 
County, spend their winters in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Natural resources do not respect political boundaries," he said. To protect 
endangered species in California, their habitats in Latin America must also be 
preserved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sola's stint in the United States began in Ventura County, where it ends this 
week. She visited the Hopper Mountain Wildlife Refuge, where biologists lived 
during the first months that the endangered California condors were 
reintroduced to the wild in the nearby Sespe Condor Sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 Sola also spent a few days with the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary 
staff, visiting Santa Cruz Island. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she found that Brazil and the Channel Islands have similar problems 
related to ranching. In both places, introducing domestically bred animals for 
human consumption destroys the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 On the islands, grazing animals destroy native grasses and shrubs; in Brazil, 
the ranchers cut down the forest to make way for pastures for grazing or for 
coal mining. 
</P>
<P>
 The farmers in Brazil contract to work for large companies that own the land, 
Sola said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very poor people who go inside the forest to cut for the industry," 
she said. "They do not know what they are allowed to do and the industry does 
not tell them." 
</P>
<P>
 It is her task to educate them and help them understand the law and why it is 
important to protect the waterways and hillsides, Sola said. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the island, the problems are not what the farmer does not know," she said. 
"It is more of a management problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranching is still allowed on Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa islands until the 
property can be acquired by the National Park Service or until current leases 
run out. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange program has also taken Sola to Salton Sea, northeast of San 
Diego; the Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve; Stillwater 
National Wildlife Reserve in Fallon, Nev.; Sequoia and Kings Canyon national 
parks, and the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge in Newark. 
</P>
<P>
 That preserve, one of the largest of its kind completely surrounded by 
urbanized area, has an active cadre of 120 volunteers and two centers that host 
thousands of schoolchildren every year for educational tours, workshops and day 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
 The center also has a program that teaches teachers how to teach conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 That's important in an area where it is conservatively estimated that 85% of 
the marshes have been filled in for development, said John Steiner, chief of 
public use for the refuge. That's why the refuge concentrates a good deal of 
attention on public education, especially for children. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a great time and fall asleep exhausted on the bus on the way home, 
and they've learned something they will never forget," Steiner said of the 
children. "Our goal is that by the time the children are able to vote, that 
they will know what they will be losing and understand the importance of a salt 
marsh." 
</P>
<P>
 Sola lauded the Bay Area program as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "They try to give the children a whole vision about the environment at all 
levels, nature and culture," she said. "They learn to appreciate their place in 
time over the millennia." 
</P>
<P>
 Sola said she will use at home what she learned about the use of volunteers as 
well as the educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the flow of information has not been one-way, Weitzel and Sola said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Minas Gerais, where the environmental laws are considered more advanced 
than in the rest of Brazil, landowners must set aside 20% of their property to 
remain wild. That segment is chosen by the government so that the state will 
always have contiguous wild areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, all of the watershed is protected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rivers and lakes are owned by the federation," she said. She also gave 
slide presentations on the programs her institute operates. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sola said she takes home a wealth of ideas that she is eager to put into 
place. She looks to the strong models she has seen here as a means to marry the 
people with the conservation goals of her agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real origin of our problems is that we did not consider ourselves and our 
culture as part of the environment," she said. "We have tended to separate the 
two." 
</P>
<P>
 Her intention is to use what she learned to help people "better understand 
where we are in the planet." 
</P>
<P>
 And by so doing, she said, she intends to help preserve it.

A SIGN OF THE TIMES; ONCE-QUAINT OXNARD COMMUNITY STRIVES TO WEATHER TRANSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was once the heart of one of the most idyllic, picturesque neighborhoods in 
Ventura County -- a sycamore-lined strip of spacious bungalows where Oxnard's 
original merchants, builders, financiers and professionals settled during the 
turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 For the old-timers who have chosen to remain and the baby boomers who have 
sentimentally bought into the community en masse, throwing thousands of dollars 
into the homes in repairs, it will always be that place. 
</P>
<P>
 But everywhere around the large, lazy porches and exposed eaves of the 
neighborhood known as F Street, with its quaint hitching posts and remodeled 
carriage houses, change is present and refuses to be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti now mars the decaying sides of some of the Craftsman bungalows. The 
streets are unusually crowded for single-family homes, with some people parking 
on lawns. Neighborhood leaders say property owners are renting out garages 
without toilets to migrant farm workers, and they point to instances of people 
found defecating outdoors as proof. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime in the area is increasing. Oxnard police received 2,010 calls for 
service in 1993 -- up 1,407 from 1988. Burglaries are commonplace, and "For 
Sale" signs are a permanent sight. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the neighborhood of about 2,500 residents is in the midst of a 
transition, a clash between nostalgia and reality, history and the present. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's all kinds of funky, little ugly places where low-income farm-worker 
folks are living, and they don't have the same type of neighborhood ethic as 
suburban middle-class people," said Linda Brown, former chairwoman of Oxnard's 
Wilson Neighborhood Council, which includes the F Street neighborhood. "They're 
not going to be living here a few months from now, so they don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 To the hard-working Latino immigrants who are a growing part of the 
neighborhood, located between 1st and 5th streets west of the Oxnard police 
station, the area's historical character does not hold the same attraction it 
has for wealthier, more assimilated residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they contrast the more universal charms of the neighborhood -- 
comfort, affordability and safety -- to other parts of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the calmest areas," said Esteban Morales, 35, a strawberry picker 
who shares a small bungalow on 1st Street with his two brothers and their 
families. "And there aren't many safe places to live in this city that I can 
afford." 
</P>
<P>
 Creation of the first neighborhood in Oxnard, like the city itself, was 
contemporaneous with erection of the American Beet Sugar Factory south of the 
Santa Clara River by the Oxnard brothers in 1897. 
</P>
<P>
 As word of the mammoth enterprise spread throughout Southern California, 
optimistic laborers and wily prospectors flocked to the area, and a boom town 
replete with saloons, hotels and restaurants was propped up almost overnight. 
Entire buildings from nearby Port Hueneme, the area's previous boom town, were 
moved to the new center of activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that Oxnard was booming, people wanted to go where the action was," 
architectural historian Judith Triem said. "Port Hueneme became a little ghost 
town." 
</P>
<P>
 With the five-story factory as an anchor, the founders knew that the town's 
growth would not be fleeting, and they sought to build themselves homes worthy 
of anything that the future might hold for Oxnard, as the town was named in 
1898. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oxnard is a town that was built in a hurry," said Madeline Miedema, a local 
historian who moved to Oxnard in 1918. "But F Street was built for permanence, 
for substantial people." 
</P>
<P>
 Residences were built first on C, D and E streets for some of the city's most 
prominent boosters, including Murray S. Wineman, Dr. Harry N. Staire and Leon 
Lehmann, who owned the Lehmann Brothers Department Store in downtown Oxnard. 
Achille Levy, founder of Bank of A. Levy, moved to D Street from Port Hueneme 
in 1912, funding numerous enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was F Street that became THE place to live in Oxnard, and the center of 
the neighborhood. The agriculturists, engineers and managers of the sugar beet 
factory settled there, along with the original downtown doctors, store owners 
and businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the street was not elitist, historians say. Some smaller homes, for people 
of more moderate means, were also built. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't just WASPs; there were Jewish people and Catholics," Triem said. 
"It was an interesting cultural mix, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 As the years progressed, many of the original settlers moved away to Camarillo 
and other areas, and the neighborhood became decidedly middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 But the legacy of Oxnard's early years was still present in the homes, and 
their extraordinary quality was noticed by a new generation of family-minded 
professionals and entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days, houses were built to last," said Isabel McMahon, who moved 
into the neighborhood with her husband, William, 30 years ago. "Now they're 
built to sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents raised large families in the spacious homes, in what old-timers 
describe as a golden era when local kids plotted mischief like Tom Sawyer and 
Huck Finn did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before they put the drainage system in, the street used to flood, and our 
children used to go up and down the street in a raft," said Charlotte White, 
63. "They had a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Lincoln, a former surgeon, moved his family to F Street in 1955. He 
remembers how Bill Paulman, a former football kicker for Oxnard High who went 
on to star at Stanford, used to carelessly boot the ball from yard to yard as a 
kid. No one minded, Lincoln said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the graffiti on Lincoln's garage, which he recently had painted over, and 
the three batteries stolen from his car in the past three years, remind him 
that times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a nice, quiet street with beautiful sycamore trees," said Lincoln, now 
74 and living alone. "Individual-type houses, not a tract. Back then, the 
houses didn't have these additions, people living in garages. . . . Not many 
people know each other at all now." 
</P>
<P>
 White has lived on F Street for 33 years, and her 69-year-old husband, 
Wendell, has lived in the neighborhood his entire life. Her mother and father 
and one of her sons all live within a few blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't have to lock your door on this street," said White, whose house 
was robbed twice in the past 10 years. "I wouldn't think of going out here 
after dark now." 
</P>
<P>
 While she acknowledges that "it's a different world" and business people have 
to be wary, she regrets the way the neighborhood's old penny store, the Towne 
and Country Market, is being run. Its current owners, the Kim family, aren't 
friendly enough to neighborhood children, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want you to come in unless you're buying something," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a charge the Kim family denies. A Korean couple who bought the market 
10 years ago, the Kims have been robbed several times. But B. S. Kim praises 
the efforts of his neighbors in setting up a new Neighborhood Watch that has 
been helpful in cutting down crime in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they see anyone around the business at night, they call police," Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has no problems with the children of the neighborhood, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let kids in. They're customers, too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Gunn, chairwoman of the Wilson neighborhood council, is one of a group 
of residents who have begun combing the community's streets and alleyways with 
walkie-talkies and spotlights, looking to curb crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guys go out until 2 in the morning painting over graffiti just so the kids 
don't get the satisfaction of seeing their tags when they wake up," Gunn said. 
"I think it's working." 
</P>
<P>
 But the neighborhood's more deep-rooted problems will be hard to eliminate, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over on E Street, a family was using the alley for a bathroom," Gunn said. "I 
spotted a guy with my flashlight during one of my walks. We figured they were 
living out of a garage and, sure enough, they were living out of a garage on F 
Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Gunn and other Neighborhood Watch leaders have begun a new joint project with 
Oxnard's code enforcement division to make better use of the city's limited 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new "empowerment agreement," residents who spot what they believe to 
be code violations in the neighborhood can post warnings to the suspected 
offenders and fill out detailed complaint forms for code enforcement inspectors 
to use. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard code enforcement official Richard K. McIntosh said crowding problems in 
the F Street neighborhood are typical of Oxnard as a whole -- the 
neighborhood's older residents just never thought that they would have to 
confront them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some folks that say: 'I bought into this single-family neighborhood 
40 years ago. Now you're telling me it's legal for 12 to 15 people to live back 
there?' They're absolutely livid," McIntosh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sympathetic with their situation, but this is happening all over Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 The home that Achille Levy built for himself on D Street in 1912, an imposing, 
two-story shingle-style Craftsman home, has been converted into an apartment 
building. Wilfredo Romero, the apartment manager, had no idea that Levy once 
owned the decaying home, which now has "For Rent" signs stapled onto the 
exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are just looking for a place to live, period," said Romero, who lives 
in one of the apartments with his wife, two daughters, mother and brothers. 
"It's not because of the area's history that they land here." 
</P>
<P>
 Farm worker Roberto Baeza, who lives in the Levy house, said many immigrants 
have problems finding a place to live in Oxnard because they are undocumented 
and have large families. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to keep everything the same, keep Mexican immigrants and their 
families out," Baeza said. "But we have to live somewhere. The problem is that 
there is not enough housing that we can afford." 
</P>
<P>
 The community's newest arrivals say they are unfairly accused of bringing 
gangs, crime and other problems to the area -- ills from which they also 
suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 "People break our windows and flatten our tires too," said Levy house resident 
Antonio Gomez, 28, gesturing across the street toward the Oxnard police 
station. "What security?" 
</P>
<P>
 But some neighbors said the new immigrants simply do not look after the 
neighborhood the way those with a lifetime investment do. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just don't have the same feeling for the neighborhood that I have," 
Linda Brown said. "I hear a lot of people say, 'It's the Mexicans,' but it's 
not that at all. It takes a while for people to assimilate and become part of 
the program." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who said she has to pick up trash from her yard virtually every day, 
said that after strawberry season, the surrounding alleys are littered with 
mattresses and furniture -- signs that there are more migrant workers living in 
the neighborhood than many realize. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many people in a building means that people end up parking on their 
lawns, which is ugly," Brown said. "The city has been relaxed about code 
enforcement, and what it means is that we've had to suffer for the degradation 
of downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 After watching a couple ditch a mattress in a nearby alley, Brown knocked on 
the door of their apartment and confronted them. Embarrassed, they went back 
and disposed of the mattress properly, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the neighborhood's new baby-boomer contingent, which began moving into the 
neighborhood about 15 years ago, F Street's quaint flavor is something that 
money can't buy. But as some have learned the hard way, a lot of cash is needed 
to maintain that timeless feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Priscilla Zarate, who works at Oxnard College, and her husband, Daniel, a 
research chemist for the Navy, moved to F Street in 1984. She treasures the 
quiet feel of the neighborhood and thinks that it is an ideal place to raise 
her two young boys. 
</P>
<P>
 But living in the house can be taxing -- literally, Zarate said. They bought 
their home, a single-story Colonial Revival bungalow built for dentist F. C. 
Lee in 1921, for $237,000. After spending $30,000 to remodel the home, it 
recently was valued at $185,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when we first moved (to Oxnard in 1978) where it was 
impossible to find a home here," said Zarate, 36. "We would drive down this 
street and not see a single 'For Sale' sign. Now there are many homes for 
sale." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants the burden of a big lot anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Caroline Guillen has lived in the neighborhood for 25 years, moving into a 
house on G Street, one of the community's best-kept areas, in 1989. A real 
estate agent, she has sold four homes in the neighborhood in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen houses go up and houses go down, but I really think this is the 
jewel of Oxnard," said Guillen, 48, who raised three children in the 
neighborhood. "It seems like we're an island. It seems like this street and 
these houses have a character of their own." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the changes on the nearby streets have affected Guillen. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, I feel it's perfectly fine," Guillen said. "Another, I feel like 
it's time to move out." 
</P>
<P>
 After evaluating homes in the neighborhood for three years, Roger and Peggy 
Kroner moved to D Street in 1989, into a large, pristine bungalow with Colonial 
Revival features built in 1903. Like Guillen, the Kroners placed imitation 
hitching posts in front of their home to further the old-fashioned feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Kroners settled in the neighborhood, the friendly old ladies who 
lived in the nearby houses have passed away or moved, and new people are 
constantly moving in and out. Parking has become a problem, there is a lack of 
neighborliness and the fine old houses are falling into decay. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Kroners are optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hope that someday they'll get cleaned up," Roger Kroner said. "Maybe it 
won't happen, but we like to believe that it will."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; FIRE EXPLORER POST TO EDUCATE YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard Fire Department is sponsoring Ventura County's first fire explorer 
post to educate youths about a career in firefighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The post, which is being set up under the auspices of the Boy Scouts of 
America, will train youths in all areas of fire service.Fire officials hope 
that the program will teach youths teamwork and perseverance in addition to 
firefighting skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a firefighter is more than just going out on rescues," said Kevin 
Schroepfer, the explorer post adviser. "You have to learn to get along with 
other crew members. We can set an example for them to get along with other 
people in society." 
</P>
<P>
 The program will provide youths with an introduction to a career in 
firefighting. "If they decide it is a career that they want to pursue this will 
give them a good head start," Schroepfer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department hopes to attract 15 or more youths for the program. The 
explorers will meet twice a month for four hours on a Saturday and once on a 
weeknight. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will be participating in drills, certainly not at the same intensity of 
the Fire Department," Schroepfer said. "The ultimate goal is to have these kids 
ride along with the engine companies and see what they do. They are not going 
to be placed in any hazardous situations." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department will hold an open house at 6:30 p.m. Aug. 24 for young 
people ages 15 to 19 who are interested in the program. The meeting will be 
held at fire station No. 1, 491 S. K St., Oxnard. TRACY WILSON

<P>
 Ventura County coroner's officials have identified the Nyeland Acres man who 
was stabbed to death during an argument with his roommate. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Jesus Arredondo-Sanchez, 31, an employee at Vic's Novelty store in 
Oxnard, died at St. John's Regional Medical Center a short time after the 10:15 
p.m. incident Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Arredondo-Sanchez's roommate, Miguel Garabaldi, 38, following 
the stabbing. Garabaldi had first fled the scene but returned later to turn 
himself in. 
</P>
<P>
 He is scheduled to be arraigned in Ventura County Municipal Court on Tuesday 
on a homicide charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the two men were drinking beer and watching television 
Friday night when they apparently began arguing. Garabaldi picked up a kitchen 
knife and stabbed Arredondo-Sanchez once in the stomach, police said. JEFF

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Ana man was in critical condition Sunday at St. John's Regional 
Medical Center after being hit by a truck as he stood outside his disabled 
vehicle along Oxnard Boulevard, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Buxton, 62, was outside his Toyota Landcruiser on Oxnard Boulevard just 
north of Orchard Place on Saturday evening when a small truck driven by David 
Christopher Estey, 27, of Thousand Oaks slammed into Buxton and his vehicle, 
Oxnard police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buxton, a minister, was thrown 90 feet and landed on the sidewalk with severe 
internal injuries, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Estey lost control of his car after the impact and ran over 
the sidewalk before coming to rest in a drainage ditch. 
</P>
<P>
 Estey, who was not injured, was arrested on suspicion of felony drunken 
driving. He was released after posting a $5,000 bond and is scheduled to be 
arraigned Aug. 19 in Ventura County Municipal Court. JEFF McDONALD

RIVAL GANGS BRAWL IN VENTURA PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two rival street gangs clashed Sunday night in a convenience store parking lot 
in Ventura's Montalvo area, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of Ventura police officers and Ventura County sheriff's deputies 
responded to the store in the 6300 block of Bristol Road around 8 p.m. after 
receiving several 911 emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers arrived, they encountered some 25 to 30 suspected gang members 
involved in a brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers quickly stopped the fight, but because none of those fighting would 
press charges, no arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ventura police spokesman said those who were fighting were detained, 
interviewed, photographed and released at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people involved in the melee apparently were injured, but refused medical 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a toy handgun was recovered but that no weapons were discovered. 
No officers were injured during the incident. J. E. MITCHELL

5 PARTY-GOERS INJURED IN GANG SHOOTOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five people were injured during a weekend shootout between rival gangs, police 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two parties at houses in the 9500 block of Amboy Avenue got out of control at 
about 10:35 p.m. Saturday when party-goers at one house threw bottles into the 
yard of the house next door, said Officer Don Cox of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Party-goers at the second house, Cox said, retaliated by shooting into the 
crowd of about 200 people in the yard of the neighboring house. Five youths 
between the ages of 16 and 20 were hit, Cox said, although no one suffered 
life-threatening injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities did not release the names and ages of the victims, who included 
both males and females. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are continuing to search for the attackers, Cox said.

CITYWALK RETURNS TO NORMAL AFTER MELEE; LEISURE: OFFICIALS SAY ATTENDANCE HAS 
NOT BEEN AFFECTED BY GANG FIGHT THAT RESULTED IN EIGHT ARRESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just 36 hours after a gang brawl erupted on its fantasy streetscape, Universal 
CityWalk was calm Sunday, as children frolicked in a fountain, people munched 
away in outdoor cafes and couples strolled hand-in-hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The only sign that there had been fighting two nights earlier at the simulated 
urban promenade adjacent to Universal Studios were television news crews that 
had gathered to see what effect the scuffle might have on attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer was none, according to security officials. 
</P>
<P>
 CityWalk officials on Saturday had said they would increase security at the 
year-old tourist attraction of upscale shops, restaurants and an 18-screen 
movie theater. But Thomas W. Gilmore, vice president and general manager of 
CityWalk, said on Sunday that normal security staffing was in place Saturday 
night and Sunday, both days without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an isolated incident that security contained very quickly," Gilmore 
said of the fight that took place about 11:30 p.m. Friday in front of the 
theater complex. Sheriff deputies arrested eight people, including two 
juveniles, on charges ranging from misdemeanor battery to assault with a deadly 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a place where people can come together from throughout the city 
and have a good time and not be hassled," Gilmore said. "We will not tolerate 
any problems here. We are constantly talking with the Sheriff's Department on 
how to prevent problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those preventive tactics is enforcement of the county's 10 p.m. curfew 
for minors and the implementation of a code of conduct last fall, which asks 
visitors to refrain from obscene language, ethnic slurs, boisterous activity 
and wearing attire "in a manner likely to provoke a disturbance." Gilmore 
denied that the last provision was aimed specifically at gang members, saying 
it applied to all visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the definition of unacceptable dress, according to Gilmore, is 
wearing baseball caps backward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would ask anyone wearing a cap backwards, regardless of age, to turn their 
caps around," he said. "If people don't comply with the code, we could ask them 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to create a police state, but we will pursue all means 
necessary to ensure safety for everyone. We have a responsibility to all those 
who come here to have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, however, several people, mostly teen-agers and children, were 
wearing caps backward without being stopped by security officials. One 
teen-ager even stopped a security guard to ask for directions without being 
reprimanded for his improper headgear. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Deputy John Hilliard said enforcement of the conduct code is left to 
private security guards since a violation is not a crime. Security guard Mike 
Pete said the code is enforced "just if they get out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Bauer, 24, of Northridge, was walking out of the Upper Deck Authenticated 
Sports Memorabilia store wearing his cap backward. He was surprised to hear 
that he was in violation of the conduct code. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been told to put my shirt back on, but I have never been told to turn my 
cap around," Bauer said. "I can understand them asking me to put my shirt back 
on, but not being allowed to wear my cap backwards is going a little far. It 
doesn't mean nothing."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; LITTLE LEAGUE STARS DEFEAT HAWAII 
TEAM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Little League all-star team took a big step Sunday toward 
reaching the World Series by defeating the team from Pearl City, Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 The team of 13-year-olds plays again Tuesday and is two wins away from a World 
Series berth, team manager Ed Kitchen said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the furthest we've ever gone," he said after his team beat the 
Hawaiians, 4-1, in a seven-inning playoff in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting pitcher Kevin Howard of Thousand Oaks worked five innings, striking 
out eight batters and walking three. He allowed one earned run and went 2-for-3 
at the plate, driving in one run. 
</P>
<P>
 Wes Munyon, also of Thousand Oaks, started off the game with a solo home run 
in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The team from Thousand Oaks never looked back, scattering five hits over seven 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Center fielder Fran Adams hit a double and scored a run on Howard's base hit, 
while first baseman Jon Shepard went 1-for-1 with a walk and a sacrifice, 
Kitchen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best team I've ever been around as far as heart," he said. "They 
just don't want to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Kitchen said the Thousand Oaks all-stars will play a team from either Las 
Vegas or Stockton on Tuesday. If they win, they go to the regional final 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 If they win Thursday, they will travel to Taylor, Mich., for the Little League 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got as good a chance as anybody," Kitchen said. "This is the same group 
that beat the (eventual) World Series champions last year, so they've got a 
hungry edge. They want to go all the way." JEFF McDONALD

 Ventura County firefighters extinguished a garage fire in Oak View early 
Sunday after neighbors reported seeing smoke coming from the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Three dozen firefighters responded to 74 Calle Cinco de Mayo about 9:40 a.m. 
Sunday, putting out the blaze within 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never got to the house," said Tracy Valencia, a county Fire Department 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials discovered ammunition inside the garage, but investigators were 
unable to immediately determine whether it played a part in starting the fire, 
Valencia said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the blaze, and no damage estimate was available, 
officials said. JEFF McDONALD

<P>
 A Simi Valley defense contractor has received an $11-million contract to 
fine-tune artillery detection equipment designed during the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittaker Electronic Systems, which employs about 350 workers, will begin work 
on the contract immediately, company spokesman Jack Cannady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the two-year contract, Whittaker will design three miniature versions of 
an electronic device called the Shortstop Electronic Detection System. 
</P>
<P>
 The device, which operates on radio frequencies, seeks out incoming artillery 
and detonates it midair before it reaches a target. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has no plans to hire additional workers to work on the project, 
Cannady said. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; AGENCY TO OPEN NEW BLOOD DONOR CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to increase blood donations countywide, United Blood Services plans to 
open a new donor center at 2411 Sycamore Drive in Simi Valley this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility will open Wednesday with a ribbon-cutting celebration from 4:30 
to 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will replace an existing facility that was closed earlier this year 
after suffering damage in the Northridge earthquake, United Blood Services 
spokeswoman Lauren Mouris said. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization now hopes to boost its blood donations by establishing a 
larger and more centrally located donor center. "It is a base we have not 
tapped," she said of the Simi Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
 United Blood Services anticipates that businesses in eastern Ventura County 
and the San Fernando Valley will use the center for company blood drives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Businesses will be able to run promotions," Mouris said. "We're going to 
encourage people to donate more often." 
</P>
<P>
 United Blood Services is Ventura County's sole blood provider. The nonprofit 
organization has donor centers in Ventura and Thousand Oaks and visits 
Camarillo, Moorpark, Ojai, Oxnard, Fillmore, Point Mugu and Port Hueneme 
regularly with its bloodmobile. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mouris said most of the donations are through donor centers. United Blood 
Services collects about 110 pints of blood per day in the county, about 80 of 
which are donated at the centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley center's hours will be 3 to 7:30 p.m. Mondays through 
Thursdays, and appointments are encouraged by calling 654-8104. TRACY WILSON

CITY GETS $4.6-MILLION QUAKE GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has received a federal grant of more than $4.6 million to help with 
earthquake recovery and wants to know how to spend it. 
</P>
<P>
 Public meetings have been scheduled for 5 p.m. today at Canyon Country Park 
and 2 p.m. Tuesday in City Hall for Santa Clarita residents to offer 
suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant is the fourth largest made by the U. S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development to municipalities hammered by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Emergency Supplemental Community Development Block Grant can be 
used for construction projects involving roads, housing and community programs. 
It is designed to pay for quake-related projects not covered by other 
government programs, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the 
Small Business Administration. 
</P>

ANN CONWAY: HELPING MDA, HOPE HITS CLOSE TO HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Mommy, how close are they to a cure? Show me with your fingers! Show me with 
your fingers!" 
</P>
<P>
 It's a question little Scotty Brown loves to ask his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "This close! This close!" Joann Brown answers, cupping her right hand and 
holding her thumb and index finger an inch apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Scotty, 7, and his brother, Jeffrey, 9, both have Duchenne muscular dystrophy, 
a fatal disease that causes progressive weakening of the muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 Joann has finally gotten to the point where she can smile when she talks about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly believe a cure is right around the corner," she said in her Mission 
Viejo home. "I have only two children, and both have been struck by this deadly 
disease. So all of my efforts -- I don't work -- go toward helping to raise 
research money to find a cure." 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 19, Joann, her husband, Mark, and their two boys will attend the 
"Fantasy by the Sea" benefit on behalf of the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. of 
Orange County at the Waterfront Hilton in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I help support the MDA because it is the backbone of the cure movement," 
Joann said. "It's where all of the hope is." 
</P>
<P>
 The grief and despair she experienced when the boys were first diagnosed with 
Duchenne MD has passed, she says. "But every time their bodies change, I don't 
sleep at night. I think: 'How am I going to cope with this? How am I going to 
have two kids in wheelchairs?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff is totally dependent now. He can't go to the bathroom alone, or brush 
his teeth. He can still feed himself. But he doesn't have the strength to lift 
things. If a glass is too heavy, I give him a straw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scotty has been so lively, people wonder if he actually has muscular 
dystrophy. But this past year, you know he has it. He can hardly get off the 
floor . . . it's deja vu , you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 Duchenne MD affects one out of every 3,500 males. It is caused by a defect in 
the gene that makes dystrophin, a protein that prevents muscle tissue from 
breaking down. Duchenne MD causes progressive weakening, leading to paralysis 
and death from heart or respiratory failure, usually by the time a patient is 
in his mid-20s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am hoping the day will soon come when they will be able to inject (into my 
children) a gene that can make dystrophin," Joann said. 
</P>
<P>
 (Last year, research scientists injected a dystrophin gene into mice destined 
to develop a Duchenne-like MD and found that all signs of the dystrophy 
disappeared. The experiment at the University of Michigan was considered 
promising. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Jim Brown, MDA director of public affairs: "Both the prevalence and 
severity of Duchenne muscular dystrophy give cause for real concern. Any family 
that suspects the illness can call our toll-free line ((800) 572-1717) to get 
information and assistance free of charge.") 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as a member of the planning committee for the "Fantasy by the Sea" 
event, Joann will continue to work on behalf of the MDA, securing auction items 
such as this year's "Wolf" movie posters signed by her old beach pal, actress 
Michelle Pfeiffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the days. When Mark and Joann were in their teens, they used to hit 
the sand at 17th Street in Huntington Beach with Pfeiffer, who was a beauty 
even then. 
</P>
<P>
 "We watched her go on to modeling, beauty contests and acting," Joann said. 
"And about two years ago, through the MDA, a girlfriend and I contacted 
Michelle -- her sixth-grade class wrote her a letter -- and invited her to 
support MDA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Later, I wrote her. I didn't think she would remember me. But she wrote me 
back, told me, of course she remembered me. I should frame it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pfeiffer's name is on the party invitation as an honorary committee member. "A 
name like Michelle's gets people to pay attention," Joann said. "People think, 
'Wow! Here's a hotshot, a worldwide celebrity, and she even takes time to care 
about a local MD event.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It's pals like Pfeiffer, a supportive husband like Mark and groups such as MDA 
that keep Joann going. "The boys are happy," she said. "They are fine. They 
were born on this street. Their friends have seen Jeff go from walking to a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids come knocking at the door, begging them to play. Parents pick up Jeff 
and put them in their pool, take him inside their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is good here. The boys are supported. Of course, they're different. Flat 
out, they're different. There's no way possible they will be the same as other 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as long as we can make them feel accepted and loved and do as many normal 
things as possible, we will be fine. I have dedicated my life to taking care of 
them."

THEY SAY LOVE CONQUERS ALL -- WILL IT NOW?; THEY'RE MARRIED. BUT SHE'S STILL IN 
HIGH SCHOOL AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH ISN'T HAPPY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stage Left features Gloria Allred, the media-savvy attorney who took her 
young, pro bono clients all the way to the high court of national television. 
</P>
<P>
 Stage Right belongs to Father Gregory Coiro, the sober, robed spokesman who 
rushed to television, radio and print to defend the Roman Catholic Archdiocese 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the star couple themselves: 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer, 17, and Caesar Espinoza, 25, share a full-size bed, a kitten named 
Psycho Sam and a Sin City marriage certificate. Because of Jennifer's Las Vegas 
marriage April 2, the archdiocese decided it will no longer share a high school 
education with her. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether the would-be senior has a right to get married outside the 
church without being banished by her Catholic school -- Alemany High in Mission 
Hills. Or, as the church sees it, whether the largest archdiocese in the nation 
has the right to establish and enforce guidelines for religious education. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of who's right could have far-reaching implications. Due process, 
freedom of association, cries one camp. Freedom of religion, yells the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an informal agreement between Allred and Coiro, the school will welcome 
Jennifer back if the couple marries in a Catholic church. The church doesn't 
normally marry those under 19, so a priest must decide if Jennifer is ready. If 
she's not, she's back on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 As Jennifer's senior year approaches, her hope is fading. She faces several 
more consultations with a priest before a decision is made. Alemany's school 
year begins Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's starting to get frustrating," Jennifer says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer and Caesar aren't exactly birds of a feather. She likes rap. He likes 
rock. She's into the Chicago Bulls. He obsesses over professional wrestling. 
(He has a shirt he proudly swears was ripped by Hulk Hogan). 
</P>
<P>
 She's fair and round and talks cute through a tight-lipped smile. He's dark 
and skinny and speaks faster than his lips seem able to handle. Around 
strangers they don't kiss or hug, and rarely touch. 
</P>
<P>
 But they're both Catholic. She's a fan of Mass. He's a former altar boy and an 
Alemany grad. She calls him "the one I love." He says he'll do anything and go 
anywhere for her. "If she wants to move to Iowa, then I'm a farmer," says 
Caesar, a bank employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer was scorekeeper and Caesar a coach for a Kiwanis youth-baseball 
league in Sunland when they met in May, 1993. He wooed her with "corny lines," 
Jennifer recalls. "He used to say to his cousin, 'Isn't it a shame we only get 
to see her twice a week.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer's parents, Mary and Joe Levis, fumed when they found out that a 
24-year-old was after their daughter, barely 16 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We confronted him and said knock this off," says Joe Levis, her stepfather, 
an electrical-supply shop owner. The blossoming romance -- which included long 
telephone calls and late-night dates -- helped sour Jennifer's home life in 
Lake View Terrace, her parents say. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Levis says she gave in and told Jennifer that she could move out "if you 
come back with a marriage license." She later gave consent for the under-age 
marriage. "It was a long, hard struggle with the girl, and that was a way out 
of it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 ("I give Caesar and Jennifer full support," says Leo Espinoza, Caesar's dad.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer and Caesar say they tried to contact a few Catholic churches early 
this year but were shut out because of Jennifer's age. They say that's what led 
them to go the civil ceremony route that now puts Jennifer's education on hold. 
"It seems like a real Catch-22," Allred says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents say Jennifer never intended to get a Catholic wedding. Jennifer 
didn't want to wait through the months it usually takes to get church approval 
for an under-age wedding, the Levises say. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents have a tendency . . . not to tell the truth," counters Jennifer. 
</P>
<P>
 Coiro says area priests were never contacted by Jennifer and Caesar. 
"Something," he says, "doesn't add up." 
</P>
<P>
 After the April wedding, Jennifer moved into Caesar's Van Nuys apartment. 
Jennifer told a few friends about it, and the school administration found out. 
Alemany officials weren't sure what to do, so the archdiocese checked it out. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling came in May: Archdiocese schools must exclude Catholic students who 
get married outside the church. "It's totally ludicrous to teach the sanctimony 
of the sacrament of matrimony and then have a Catholic young person thumbing 
her nose at the sacrament," says Coiro, a big, ruddy-faced man with a serious 
gaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who get married inside the system can be kicked out, according to 
archdiocese rules. The schools shouldn't have to deal with students who aren't 
under the control of their parents, Coiro says. 
</P>
<P>
 The administration told Jennifer she could finish her junior year, take the 
necessary senior courses elsewhere and return to graduate with her class next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer refused, opting instead to get an attorney. "I want to be able to say 
I fought for something," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys' referrals led to Allred, who took the case before the media. Within 
weeks, Jennifer's story was on the nationally syndicated "Sally Jessy Raphael" 
TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 Allred's battle centers around Alemany's student handbook. In it are rules 
banning drugs, theft, arson, extortion, weapons-wielding, gang activity and 
graffiti. But nowhere does it say you can't have a wedding -- sacramental or 
shotgun. "Jennifer should at least have notice of the rule," Allred says. 
</P>
<P>
 Allred maintains that all she wants is to get Jennifer back in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing, experts say, because she might not have a lot of luck if she 
decides to head to court. "Generally," says Loyola Law School professor Kurt 
Lash, "private schools can control conditions of membership." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have," Coiro argues, "is an intrusion into the affairs of the 
Catholic Church." 
</P>
<P>
 He says the student handbook defers all power to a higher source -- the 
archdiocese "administrative handbook," where there are indeed rules governing 
student marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's more to the story than handbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Allred is quick to point out that Alemany has open arms for unwed mothers. "It 
seems unfair and ironic that the school would allow unwed mothers to continue 
attending classes there but not a dedicated student who enters into a civil 
marriage and who is not pregnant," she says, noting that Jennifer is a B 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 "We endorse a girl's decision to have a baby rather than going to the nearest 
Planned Parenthood so her baby could be murdered," Coiro counters. 
</P>
<P>
 The sideshow nature of the debate peaked during the "Sally Jessy Raphael" 
broadcast June 23. Jennifer and Caesar sat quietly some of the time as insults 
were hurled across the stage. A suited audience member called Allred "a media 
exhibitionist." An anti-abortion activist compared Jennifer's attitude to 
eating a ham sandwich in a Jewish school and demanding to get away with it. 
Even Coiro, usually above the fray, called Allred, "not a very good attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 During another on-air clash, Allred and Coiro struck a deal: "The 
administration at Alemany decided that if the church blessed the marriage, 
Jennifer would be allowed to continue at Alemany," Coiro says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some archdiocese high schools, meanwhile, are considering whether to address 
marriage in their student handbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer and Caesar live in one of those stucco apartment buildings with the 
perpetual for-rent sign and developer's flags that constantly whip in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Caesar works weekdays and Jennifer labors weekends as a hostess at a Denny's. 
They spend evenings planted in a spongy green couch playing video games, 
betting quarters on cards or watching "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" on a 
25-inch TV. 
</P>
<P>
 As they wait for a priest to come judge their lives, neither seems 
particularly enthusiastic about the telling weeks ahead. If the priest says 
yes, Jennifer can attend class while premarital counseling forges ahead. And 
the press will likely be there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The publicity gets in the way," Jennifer says. "But without it, we wouldn't 
have gotten as far as we have." 
</P>
<P>
 She's hung up on school because "you can do everything senior year," she says, 
citing the prom, grad night and casual-dress days. The campus seems to support 
her. ("Let her come back," one Alemany staff member says.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer does have a Plan B, however: to attend a community college, pass a 
high school equivalency test, and forgo the school's offer to have her come 
graduate with her class. "I would rather save the embarrassment," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no talk of kids yet. She wants to go on to college. Loyola Marymount 
University, a Catholic school, is her top choice. 
</P>
<P>
 And then? 
</P>
<P>
 "Be a rich lawyer," she says. "To see Gloria do it makes me want to do it 
more."

BEHIND THE MADNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Theo Wilson, Theo Wilson, celebrated national trials reporter for the New 
York Daily News, ignored Charlie Manson's threats to her and other newswomen in 
courtroom. Her upcoming book recounts the Manson and other trials she covered. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The murders of Sharon Tate, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, and four others, which 
occurred 25 years ago this month, remain among the goriest of multiple 
homicides. As Charlie Manson himself predicted, to the world he has remained a 
monster. 
</P>
<P>
 Theo Wilson, the celebrated national trials reporter for the New York Daily 
News, covered the 10-month trial from April, 1970, to February, 1971. Wilson 
and reporters from all over the world sat through day after day of 
stomach-churning and increasingly bizarre testimony. Sometimes the only way to 
relieve the pressure was to engage in a little black humor. Reporters didn't 
write about it at the time because they would not have wanted anybody to think 
they were uncaring. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, now living in the Hollywood Hills, has covered the trials of Dr. Sam 
Sheppard in the 1950s to Claus von Bulow and John DeLorean in the 1980s. She 
recounts these and other famous trials in her upcoming book, "Hot Copy," for 
Thunder's Mouth Press of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason why the Charles Manson trial was totally different from any 
other I ever covered was because it was the only one where every body went a 
little bonkers -- judge, jury, reporters, lawyers, deputies and spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 The four defendants were that way already, only more so. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie was the weird end product of our prison system, having been 
institutionalized since he was 8 years old, and the three Manson Family "girls" 
were as nutty as street drugs and garbage food could make them. 
</P>
<P>
 But why did the rest of us go a little mischuga ? Maybe the length of this 
trial and its total unpredictability did it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Ten months in that gloomy old Hall of Justice in Downtown Los Angeles 
listening to testimony that went from horrifying to ludicrous. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony itself punctuated with flare-ups from the defendants, 
supplemented by outbursts from the audience. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Threats of self-immolation and other destruction on the sidewalks around the 
Hall of Justice where the Manson Family members still at large held their daily 
vigil, the girls' shaven heads turning burnt orange from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Ron Hughes disappearing, his drowned body discovered the very 
day, many months later, that the defendants received sentences of death from 
the jurors. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses on the stand with names like "Lotsapoppa" and "Snake" and "Ouish" 
and other witnesses describing themselves as "an emissary from God" or a "horse 
manure shoveler. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors, ranging in age from 25 to 74, locked up so long in hotel rooms 
that one of them threatened to tie sheets together and escape out of a window. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Sylmar earthquake hitting the Los Angeles area a few hours before the 
women defendants, defying their lawyers, took the stand and described in 
horrible detail how they butchered their victims, in an effort to save Manson 
from a guilty verdict. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who covered the Manson trial became like wartime buddies, friends 
forever who went through the battles and survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Names that mean nothing now to anybody else, like "Elmer" and "Herman's Kids" 
and "Julie Shapiro," send us into joyous recall. "Elmer" was the pet marijuana 
plant that was nurtured at Spahn's Ranch, the Family's country residence in 
Chatsworth. "Herman's Kids" was the name the jurors gave themselves in honor of 
their foreman, Herman Tubick, a retired mortician. 
</P>
<P>
 As for "Julie Shapiro," she was the beauteous spectator who came to Los 
Angeles from Chicago and became a faithful attendant at the trial. Julie first 
attracted attention when she came to court in a see-through blouse with nothing 
under it but lots and lots of Julie. 
</P>
<P>
 The court did not look kindly on this distraction -- the court was notably 
humorless, high-strung and touchy as all get out -- and some hapless deputy was 
told to give Julie the word that she was not to come to the trial bra-less 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie obeyed the judicial edict and came properly attired after that. She 
didn't cause any more trouble until many months later, when she took issue with 
the prosecutor during his closing arguments and from her seat in the spectator 
section angrily called him a liar. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles H. Older told his deputies to arrest her, book 
her and hold her for a contempt of court hearing when the day's session ended. 
As Julie was being hustled out, obviously startled that she had created such an 
uproar, she plaintively asked her reporter friends: "What's the matter? Why 
can't I stay here? I'm wearing a brassiere." 
</P>
<P>
 During the contempt hearing, we learned that Julie was studying witchcraft 
here under Morlock the Warlock. Those of us who had deadlines ran to the 
telephones with this wonderful little story about what I called the "witchlet." 
The editors loved it. The news copy desk borrowed my "witchlet" description for 
the headline, and it was displayed nicely for our delighted East Coast readers, 
who by this time were convinced that what was happening at the trial of Manson 
and his three helpmates -- Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van 
Houten -- represented the '60s, the druggies, the dropouts, the flower children 
and the whole West Coast at its zaniest. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Julie Shapiro, there was another disruptive spectator we all remember, 
a talented artist who had been doing sketches inside the courtroom for 
magazines (no cameras allowed in those days) and who freaked out one day. 
</P>
<P>
 This was toward the end of the trial, in the third day of an excruciatingly 
boring summation by Manson's defense attorney, Irving Kanarek. By then, the 
deputies who secured the courtroom weren't as skittish as they had been at the 
outset of the trial. They also were soporific from the less than dazzling 
oratory. When the artist opened the doors and marched into the trial room 
holding a Bible and chanting, "I am the Whore of Babylon! I have come to defend 
my brother . . . " she practically got down to the well of the courtroom before 
the deputies roused themselves and ran over to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arrest that woman!" our judge hollered, his cheeks flushed. He was the only 
judge I knew who took these things personally. 
</P>
<P>
 Now early in the trial, disruptions like this were big news, but we had had 
months of weird behavior to write about, especially with the defendants 
breaking into song, leaping at the judge and smacking out at the prosecutor, so 
we were a little jaded. Where once we would have dashed out after the artist, 
now we began bickering: "You go get the background on her. No, you go. No, you 
go."  
</P>
<P>
 As we were hissing and muttering, one of the deputies who had schlepped the 
artist out of the courtroom returned to his seat near ours. "Got any 
information on that lady?" somebody whispered to him. He shook his head. Then, 
with a perfectly straight face told us: "We just ran a check with the Babylon 
P.D. and they don't have a thing on her." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the many months of the testimony, you could always depend on something 
to happen that would respark national interest in the trial. You never knew 
when it would happen or where it would come from. A good example was Richard 
Nixon's unexpected involvement in the case, when our then-President, in the 
course of a press conference in Denver, noted that while in California he had 
been inundated with Manson trial coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Front page every day in the papers," Nixon told political reporters. " . . . 
Here is a man who was guilty, directly or indirectly, of eight murders without 
reason. . . ." And so on in this manner for a minute or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Healy, the New York Daily News reporter traveling with the President, 
realized instantly that a terrible presidential boo-boo had been made and 
notified our news desk in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily News sent an urgent message on my telex in the courthouse pressroom. 
I always filed at lunchtime, which was deadline for me because of the 
three-hour time difference between Los Angeles and New York. No one else was 
around. As soon as the lawyers came back, I assured the desk, I would get 
reaction from them. 
</P>
<P>
 As luck would have it, the first lawyer who got off the elevator on the eighth 
floor of the courthouse was Ron Hughes, the 250-pound, golden-bearded, 
prematurely bald flower child of a defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Ron, who lived in somebody's basement and had to borrow a jacket when he 
went into the judge's chambers, was always in hot water with the judge. His 
wreck of a car kept breaking down, making him late for the sessions, and he 
wasn't given to lawyer-like demeanor in the courtroom. Judge Older had put him 
in jail for contempt for once telling the prosecutor he was "full of s---" 
during an argument at the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron!" I yelled to him. "Quick. I'm on deadline. President Nixon just made a 
speech and he called Charlie guilty. We need a statement from you." I read him 
the Nixon quotes. "Come on, Ron. What's your reaction?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, f--- him!" said Ron. "That's my comment. F--- him!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh for God's sake, Ron!" I said. "I can't send that. Now come on, aren't you 
going to consider asking for a mistrial? Aren't you dismayed that the President 
of the United States, a lawyer himself, would violate a defendant's rights and 
call him guilty while he still is on trial? Aren't you angry that the President 
would jeopardize a lengthy and expensive trial with such a thoughtless remark? 
Isn't that what you want to say?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, yeah," Ron cried, all fired up by my remarks. "And f--- him, too!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We were glad that Ron Hughes was still alive when we threw the trial party 
that was, like the Manson trial itself, unlike anything else. The invitations 
to the "Helter Skelter Party" were illustrated with a sketch of Manson by a 
courtroom artist. The venue was listed as the "bottomless pit," Charlie's 
proposed desert hiding place when the race war he expected broke out. The date 
("we have no calendars") and the time ("night is day and day is night and I am 
you and you are me") were both memorable quotes from the Manson Family. 
</P>
<P>
 The party was held in a suite at the Hilton in Downtown Los Angeles, which was 
decorated with such things as a hotel plant that resembled "Elmer" and a toy 
replica of Spahn's Ranch, where Charlie and his group lived. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the theme, we were all dressed like hippies and had "X" marks 
on our foreheads just like the defendants and the Family followers. The Hilton 
house detective became extremely nervous as he saw us going through the hotel. 
As we were setting up the party, he came roaring into the suite and warned us 
"hippies" he was keeping an eye on us. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief prosecutor and the defense attorneys engaged in a few acrimonious 
exchanges during the party. But, like all trial parties, it was fun. And, like 
all trial parties, it was strictly off the record. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After being at the trial for months, I couldn't take seriously the myths about 
Charlie Manson and his scary eyes and sexual prowess. Once, during a recess 
when the judge was off the bench and the jury was out of the room, Charlie 
stared at the four women reporters chatting together and called out something 
about our "karma coming down" on us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh shut up, Charlie!" I snapped at him. What we didn't know until later was 
that a young man sitting behind us, a new reporter on his first day of the 
trial, ran to his phone to report to his wire service that Manson had 
threatened women reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 We found out about it later when our editors asked us why we had neglected to 
mention in our reports the frightening threats. We had to explain that it was 
just old Charlie yakking, to forget it, there was no story. Thank God the kid 
ran out before he heard me tell the evil defendant to "shut up" or he would 
have put that on the wire, too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My room at the Hilton was tiny, with a walk-in closet as its only asset. But 
it soon became the after-hours press headquarters for both the local and 
out-of-town reporters, where we could meet after everybody had filed their 
stories, have drinks and plan where to go out for dinner. The hotel added a 
small bar to my room, and after awhile I had so much stuff in Room 905 that it 
was a true home away from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Within walking distance was a small market where I was able to buy fruit, 
cheese and crackers to set out for the gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on in the trial, as I walked to the market, I passed a vagrant sitting 
in a little open area where there was one bench, one tree and a lot of pigeons. 
He was your typical Skid Row denizen: the tattered coat held together with a 
safety pin, the unshaven chin, the watery eyes, the broken-down shoes, the 
straggly hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Since street people somehow get attracted to me, I wasn't surprised when this 
one nodded to me, got up and walked into the grocery store the same time I did. 
Once inside, he gallantly got a shopping cart for me and pushed it wherever I 
went.  
</P>
<P>
 He never said a word. Neither did I. As we walked past the wines, he reached 
over and put into the basket a small bottle of the cheapest wine on the shelf. 
He looked at me for a reaction and I just walked on, finishing the shopping 
</P>
<P>
 At the checkout counter, he left the cart and waited for me as I paid. I had 
the wine put into a small paper bag and, after we left the store, I handed it 
to him. Still neither of us spoke. He went his way and I walked back to the 
hotel. From then on, every time I went to the market, which was about once or 
twice a week, the guy was there and we repeated the whole silent episode. 
</P>
<P>
 One day he wasn't there. I looked up and down the street, but my poor smelly 
wreck of an unkempt, unwashed "private bum" -- as the other reporters referred 
to him -- was not in sight. I went into the grocery and got my goodies. As I 
pushed the cart to the checkout counter, the clerk there looked up, glanced 
around, noticed that my usual escort was missing and asked me: "Where's your 
husband today?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I never remember when anything happened, but the date of the big earthquake is 
unforgettable. It was Feb. 9, 1971. I went to bed the night before and the next 
thing I remember was seeing wild lightning-like flashes outside my window and 
thinking, "My God, the astronauts have fallen on the hotel!" (The Apollo 14 
mission was under way at the time.) 
</P>
<P>
 Then I heard a grinding within the walls and my big bedside lamp started to 
fall on me. As I sat up and grabbed it, I saw all my clothes in my closet 
suddenly sway up, up, up until the hems were almost vertical to the ground and 
then, just as slowly, the dresses swung back to the other side. It was 6 a.m. 
Just as I thought the room would crack apart, it stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 I reached over and put on the all-news radio station. Nothing. I tried to 
telephone. Nothing. By this time there were only a few aftershocks and I went 
for a glass of water. Dark brown water poured out of the faucets. But the 
lights stayed on. The hotel was standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I was able to telephone New York and get dressed to go to the Hall of 
Justice for the trial. In the old court building were huge cracks, plaster on 
the floor, people in little knots.  
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Hall of Justice, Manson's girls, X-marks on their foreheads, were 
proudly telling anyone who would listen: 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie predicted this earthquake. He told us about this two days ago." 
</P>
<P>
 That very morning, the women defendants, one by one, confessed to the murders 
on the witness stand. It was just another bizarre turn in the Manson trial.

JACK SMITH: 60 YEARS LATER, THE OLD SCHOOL TIES STILL BIND

<P>
 The reunion of the Belmont High School classes of Winter and Summer 1934 was 
an unqualified success. 
</P>
<P>
 We had about 100 guests in our house -- classmates of mine and their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 We had hired a valet parking service, figuring our hill would be too steep for 
our visitors, and my wife had rented four sets of tables and chairs to be sure 
that people would have a place to sit down. As usual at large parties, most 
people congregated in the living areas of the house, around the punch bowl, so 
to speak, ignoring the outside tables. 
</P>
<P>
 The party consisted mostly of nostalgic conversation, whoops of recognition, 
hugs and a few tears. 
</P>
<P>
 We even sang the old school alma mater: 
</P>
<P>
 There's a school of beauty rare  
</P>
<P>
 On top of old Crown Hill,  
</P>
<P>
 We're never shy, it's Belmont High. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I were astonished that so many people came, that so many of my 
classmates were still alive, still active, still enthusiastic -- some of them 
still beautiful. There were a few signs of frailty. One walker, several canes, 
including mine. But most of the guests were on their feet and bouncy. 
</P>
<P>
 I won't mention any names. I would have to leave some out, and nobody should 
be left out. 
</P>
<P>
 As I sat in my chair greeting old friends, inevitably I thought of those old 
days. They were hard Depression years. I started at Belmont as a sophomore, 
having done my freshman year at Whittier High School. I lived with my mother 
and father in the Prince Rupert apartments at the foot of the hill, near the 
Mayfair Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 I was a good student. I got straight A's in Latin and English, although I 
wasn't so good in geometry and science. We had a senile geometry teacher who 
especially disliked me. He always punctuated his rambling dissertations with 
the word portion , whose meaning in his context no one ever understood. He 
would often stare at me and then throw a piece of chalk at me. 
</P>
<P>
 My journalism teacher, as I have said here, knew nothing about journalism, and 
we made her life miserable. Nevertheless, that's where I got my start, being 
editor of the Belmont Sentinel. 
</P>
<P>
 Our principal, Mr. Benshimol, was a stern but compassionate man. He tried to 
make gentlemen of us boys. He decreed that we must wear neckties every day. I 
both obeyed and protested this rule by coming to school in a bright red satin 
shirt with a bright orange necktie. 
</P>
<P>
 In my senior year I was center on the lightweight (Class B) basketball team. I 
was high point man for the year with a total of 48 points in six games. 
(Michael Jordan used to make 48 points in one game.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning my family was prosperous. My father was in the investment 
business. He drove a Graham-Paige, which I often borrowed to take girls to the 
dances. It was an impressive chariot. 
</P>
<P>
 Later my father bought me a 1929 Ford roadster. That day I became a man. As 
the Depression deepened, my father's business went downhill. Finally it 
collapsed entirely and he skipped, leaving my mother and me destitute. I had to 
sell the Ford. We moved in with my sister, who lived in Long Beach. She had a 
lovely contralto voice and had a sustaining program on KFOX, making $25 a week. 
We lived on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1933 earthquake wrecked Long Beach Poly High, and I dropped out of school 
until the next semester, when we moved back to L.A. and I went back to Belmont. 
My grades were a shambles. I had been an A student in Latin. I flunked. My 
Latin teacher cried. 
</P>
<P>
 I continued to get A's in English, and my English teacher, a Miss Keyes, told 
me: "Boy, you can write." I think those words of encouragement steered me into 
my career. 
</P>
<P>
 In time my father came back to rejoin society and re-established himself in 
real estate in Bakersfield. He wanted to put me through college. My career at 
Bakersfield College was spotty. I did become editor of the college newspaper, 
the Renegade Rip, which further defined my future. I dropped out of college to 
work as a sportswriter on the Bakersfield Californian and am still trying to 
write. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking through my Belmont yearbook during the party, I couldn't help noticing 
that all the girls, as well as the teachers, wore dresses considerably below 
the knee -- in fact, just above the ankles. Those skirts were uniformly 
unattractive. At the same time, other pictures showed the same girls wearing 
shorts on the basketball court, their long legs flashing quite unshielded. I 
didn't understand it then, and I don't understand it now. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 2 o'clock on Sunday, the day after the party, a classmate of mine 
appeared at our doorway with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you know where Jack Smith lives?" his wife asked. 
</P>
<P>
 After 60 years, they were 24 hours late.

 In a recent Times poll, 8% of H. Ross Perot's supporters said they have had an 
encounter or experience with "a being from another planet." Of that group, 
reports comedy writer Tony Peyser, 91% said the alien creature was "short, had 
big ears and a grating Texas accent." 
</P>

 A Conway, Ark., woman pleaded guilty last week to putting laxatives in icing 
for a cake she sold in a yogurt store. Although 17 people became ill, not one

they haven't worn in years."

 I'm not trying to stereotype any genders here, but most of the men I know are 
more intimate with their cars than I will ever be. They seem to understand what 
makes them go. I just know to step away when the fire trucks arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Most men know the name of every part of a car and its function. I just know 
how to set the trip meter before I take off to San Francisco and how many Tony 
Bennett cassettes I can stow in the glove box. 
</P>
<P>
 Men read the owner's manual. I listen really carefully as the salesperson goes 
over everything before she hands over the keys. 
</P>
<P>
 Men love to receive car-related gifts. I cried when presented with new tires 
on my birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Men like driving a sports car because of the way it accelerates down the open 
highway. My boyfriend loves the speed of my convertible MR2, but I mostly enjoy 
the cruise control . . . and the 50,000-mile warranty. 
</P>
<P>
 Men baby their cars in a manner that makes some women in their lives envious. 
The same man who thought nothing of handing me the dog's ratty bed mat to dry 
off from the pool insists on using a clean terry towel to clean his dipstick. 
</P>
<P>
 Men fill up with gas before the gauge hits the quarter-tank mark. I fill up 
when my tank is as dry as Death Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 A man will get into my car and before we're in second gear he'll ask: "What's 
that noise?" Hmm. Could it be the loose quarters rattling around in the 
ashtray? That bottle of Merlot in the trunk? A litter of stray kitties born 
under the passenger seat? What noise, exactly ? 
</P>
<P>
 A man will open the hood of my car and like a heat-seeking missile go 
instantly to a buried area in the dark and say, "Here's the problem." I could 
stare into that abyss all day and be able to tell you only that they used a lot 
of black. 
</P>
<P>
 The men I know avoid problems with their cars by doing something called 
"regular maintenance." I'm an organized, responsible woman who knows to toss 
away a tube of mascara after 21 applications to prevent bacteria build-up, but 
I drove my last car for 21,000 miles without an oil change. Coroners refer to 
acts like this as "delayed homicides." 
</P>
<P>
 My treatment of cars has at least been consistent. When I was 16 and newly 
licensed, my dad let me drive the family's disposal car: a 10-year-old blue VW 
bug that I believe came from the factory with dents in its fenders. Dad seemed 
to use paste and Ace bandages to patch up the wobbly thing. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a good weekend mechanic, except he took too much time to put everything 
back together, so, of course, I seldom brought needed repairs to his attention. 
For six months I didn't have a working battery but rather than tell Dad, I 
found it easier just to park on top of a small hill and push start the Bug a la 
Fred Flintstone. But after I spent one long, rainy winter without brake lights, 
he impounded the car long enough to fix everything. It was a sad spring. 
</P>
<P>
 I have never pampered a car because I expect only one thing from it: to get me 
to where I want to go. In exchange, I give it endless amounts of gasoline. It's 
a fair deal. 
</P>
<P>
 I pay such little attention to cars that when they "act up" (a euphemism I use 
as if they are balking children rather than hulking bulks of bolts) it usually 
means one thing: I can't afford to go to Hawaii after all. 
</P>
<P>
 When something doesn't seem right -- and it gets my attention -- it's usually 
when the car comes to an abrupt stop on the top of Mt. Washington or it limps 
along for weeks with something equivalent to a thorn in its paw. Either way, I 
generally misdiagnose the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 I drove around for days in a car I thought was in need of an alignment. I 
reached this conclusion because years before I had a car aligned and it no 
longer listed to one side like the S.S. Minnow, as this one was now doing. I 
vowed to make an appointment with the mechanic but I never got around to it, 
what with all that leisure-time driving I was doing between Santa Barbara and 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later I was taking my friend Patrick to lunch and as he strolled 
toward the passenger door, his eyes dropped to the front right tire and he 
quickly -- and correctly -- assessed the situation: "You know, your tire's 
almost flat." 
</P>
<P>
 A flabby tire? Snap: That's easy to fix. All it takes is air. I drove to the 
nearest gas station and as the attendant was plumping up the tire, he offered 
this advice: "Every morning I walk around my car and check that everything's 
fine." That sounded solid to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great," I said, as I jumped into the driver's seat with my foot positioned to 
stomp on the gas pedal. "I'll be back through again in the morning."

COMMITMENTS; NEW RULES, NEW ATTITUDES?; FEAR OF AIDS AND STDS MAY HAVE CHANGED 
THE WAY WE THINK AND TALK ABOUT SEX. BUT WE STILL HAVE SOME BAD HABITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA HEIMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sex in the '90s is certainly not simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that sex has ever been simple. But combine the fear of AIDS with the 
epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and the changing cultural 
roles of men and women, and you end up with a confused and weary society of 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
 What, exactly, are contemporary attitudes about sex and dating? One study 
reports that the AIDS epidemic has had a chilling effect on the sex lives of 
singles. But companion surveys report that promiscuity is as popular as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is certain, based on interviews with singles and relationship 
experts: Attitudes toward sex and relationships have become more conservative. 
Equally certain is that this change in mores doesn't always translate into a 
change in behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in my early 20s in the late '70s," said Rebecca, a 36-year-old single 
attorney in Ventura. "That was the time of disco and the Village People and 
one-night stands. That's what everyone did and they didn't think twice about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca said that for the last five years, she has thought much harder before 
getting involved with a man. "The last three years, the warnings about getting 
AIDS have been deafening," she said. "My friends and I all talk about needing 
to be careful." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Rebecca admitted that within the last six months she had unprotected 
sex with someone she didn't know well and hasn't dated since. "I did it because 
I guess I just wanted an attachment, and I had sex, because that's what he 
wanted. Passion or need or loneliness motivate us to do stupid things in the 
face of all the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Andy, a 38-year-old screenwriter, said he is more concerned about protecting 
himself against AIDS and STDs than he was in the past, but he also said that he 
has had unprotected sex within the last six months outside a monogamous 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see her as a promiscuous woman, so I didn't really worry about it," 
he said. But Andy, who lives in Los Angeles, said dating has changed a lot 
since the days of the "three-date rule." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, I would have expected to sleep with a woman by the third date, 
if not before," he said. "Now, I wouldn't expect it, and in fact, I would worry 
if she did sleep with me on the first date." 
</P>
<P>
 Andy said that although he's looking toward marriage, he would have sex with a 
woman he didn't know or like much, if he was attracted to her. But he would 
wear a condom. "Men are still men," he said. "They basically want to sleep with 
every woman they see." 
</P>
<P>
 Sound crass? Psychologists say that despite the conservative trend in sexual 
activity and warnings about the dangers of unprotected sex, people continue to 
operate emotionally in the same way they always have. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why, psychologists say, many heterosexuals who are well-educated 
about AIDS still think they are immune to it. "In some ways, the heterosexual 
community doesn't believe it is affected by AIDS," said Wanda von Kleist, a 
Chicago psychologist who counsels many singles. "There is a lot of denial, 
because they have not had as many deaths as the gay men's community. In the 
heterosexual community, the majority of people do not use condoms or safer sex 
because they do not believe they will get it." 
</P>
<P>
 What has changed in the past few years, thanks to the AIDS epidemic, is 
women's ability to say no, Von Kleist said. "It's more socially acceptable for 
a woman to say upfront that she doesn't want to have sex," she said. "For a 
long time, women felt like if they said no, something was wrong with them. I 
think now women have an opportunity to say what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Debra, a 33-year-old actress who lives in Hollywood, said she insists that a 
man wear a condom and get not one but two AIDS tests. She said she has sex less 
often now, partly out of fear and partly out of her own changing attitude.  
</P>
<P>
 "I do feel freer to say no now, and I'm more likely to than I would have in 
the past," she said. "And when it comes to AIDS, I take it very seriously -- 
I've had a good friend die from it. Men tend to think I'm accusing them when I 
tell them to get an AIDS test -- but most men are more careful with pregnancy 
than they are with AIDS. Because they're at less risk to getting AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 The more conservative swing in sexual behavior has also affected the way men 
and women relate to one another. In the '60s and '70s, sex was used so freely 
and casually that many people never really got intimate, psychologists say -- 
people substituted sex for intimacy. Men and women are now forced to deal with 
each other in a different way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both sexes are definitely more cautious about having sex," said Stanley 
Teitelbaum, a New York psychologist who specializes in sex and relationships. 
"For a long time, many people used sex as a way to relate, instead of relating 
and then having sex. So people who had problems relating used sex to cover up 
those difficulties. They can't do that so freely and readily anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 But the most blatant changes in attitudes about sex and dating can be seen in 
the gay men's community. Michael Koth, a 38-year-old professional trainer, 
remembers the days when everyone in the gay community was "footloose and fancy 
free" when it came to sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could go in any alley in certain neighborhoods and cruise certain areas 
and see all kinds of sex," said Koth, who has delivered 172 eulogies for 
friends who have died of AIDS. "Everyone went to sex clubs and bath houses 
every night. It was just so much a part of how everyone lived." 
</P>
<P>
 Koth, who lives in West Hollywood, said he and his friends practice safe sex 
and are now much more aware of their sexual behavior. He added that AIDS has 
forced many in the gay community to seek deeper relationships rather than 
relating through promiscuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, there are people who don't take AIDS seriously. "There is a 
whole new phase of young people who seemingly don't care, who think that 
they're invincible," said Koth, who tended bar in gay and straight clubs across 
the country in the late '70s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a new wave of sex clubs popping up around L.A. and New York, he 
said. Although management supplies condoms and posts safe-sex rules on the 
walls, there is no way of really monitoring and enforcing people's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more discreet than it used to be," he said. "But I'm sure people are 
still practicing unsafe sex." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the high-risk groups for contracting HIV are teen-agers, who, 
psychologists say, are scared but also maintain a high level of denial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more they find out about STDs and AIDS, the more their heads are saying 
that they need to be more conservative," said Lorraine Sterman, a Los Angeles 
psychologist who counsels adolescents. "But their bodies are no different than 
teens' bodies have always been -- raging with hormones. It's a very, very 
ambivalent situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Sterman said the major problem is "teen-age omnipotence." 
</P>
<P>
 "Teens think they are omnipotent, and they think, 'It won't happen to me,' " 
she said. "In the past, the worst that could happen was that they got pregnant 
-- now they can die. And it's such an overwhelming thought, they tend not to 
think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan, a 17-year-old high school senior at a Catholic school in Orange County, 
said many of her friends are sexually active, but that they are more afraid of 
pregnancy than of AIDS and STDs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of my girlfriends are on the pill. But people are not concerned about 
AIDS -- it's not a part of our lives here," said Susan, who added that although 
her friends know they need to use protection, they often don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of my friends will get drunk, and then their judgment is not great," 
Susan said. "One girl in our school got pregnant, and it was a very big deal. A 
lot of kids are embarrassed to buy protection, so they use the withdrawal 
method, which is stupid. But a lot of people don't think anything can happen to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the problems and the very real fears facing this generation, there are 
many valuable lessons available for those who choose to learn them, 
psychologist Teitelbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more important in the '90s than ever before to develop those qualities 
in yourself that give you good judgment, to use your perception, to know what 
the other person is about," he said. "You need to know who you are getting 
involved with, to tune in rather than tune out. If people are more forthright, 
and put their needs and concerns on the table, that can be a positive step 
toward building healthy relationships."DATING (SOCIAL)

T.S.O.L. VETS TO COME OUT AND PLAY AGAIN; MUSIC: FRONTING A NEW BAND CALLED THE 
JOYKILLERS, O.C.-BASED JACK GRISHAM AND RON EMORY WILL APPEAR TONIGHT IN 
HOLLYWOOD. 
</P>

<P>
 "Hey, hey, hey, come out and play," goes the refrain of the Offspring hit that 
is the most widely heard punk rock song ever to come out of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Grisham and Ron Emory, whose old band, T.S.O.L., is cited as an influence 
by the Offspring, have decided to heed that catchy piece of advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Grisham and guitarist Emory will come out and play their first concert 
in more than 1 1/2 years tonight at Dragonfly in Hollywood, fronting a new 
band, the Joykillers. 
</P>
<P>
 The two got their toes wet with a cameo appearance at the Offspring's concert 
July 27 at the Hollywood Palladium. At that show, Grisham and Emory joined the 
Offspring for a rendition of a 1982-vintage T.S.O.L. song, "Code Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little nervous, but the minute I hit the stage it was like an old 
friend. It felt like it's where I should be," Grisham said last week. Until the 
Palladium appearance, he had not performed live since New Year's Eve, 1992, 
when his former band, Tender Fury, opened a show for Social Distortion at the 
Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Emory had dropped out of rock 'n' roll about 18 months ago after stints with 
the bands Lunch Box, the D.I.'s and Suicide Door. He last played with Grisham 
in a 1989-91 series of periodic reunion shows by the original T.S.O.L. (True 
Sounds of Liberty). During the past 1 1/2 years, he said, he worked odd jobs 
and devoted most of his time to his son, who is now 3. Then Grisham called two 
months ago with an invitation to join the Joykillers. The band also includes 
piano player Ronnie King, who was in Tender Fury, bassist Billy Persons, 
formerly of the Weirdos and Gun Club, and drummer Chris Lagerborg, an ex-member 
of the Cadillac Tramps. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably the best thing I've had going, without a doubt," said Emory, 
who lives near Grisham in Huntington Beach. "I'm just into playing. It's a good 
release of energy and feelings, and I can't wait to get in and record." 
</P>
<P>
 Grisham, 33, is one of the most charismatic performers to have emerged from 
the Orange County punk boom of the early 1980s. During the late '80s and early 
'90s he was a fixture on the local club scene with Tender Fury. But he decided 
18 months ago to take a different tack: he would concentrate on writing and 
recording new songs, in hopes of landing his first major label deal after nine 
releases on small independent labels such as Posh Boy, Frontier and Triple X. 
</P>
<P>
 Grisham says he cranked out at least 200 songs during his self-imposed exile 
from the stage, and wound up completely disgusted by the business gamesmanship 
involved in chasing a big-label contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "After two years working on that stuff, I couldn't write a word without 
thinking, 'Who's going to judge what I'm writing?' " Grisham said. The problem, 
he said, was that the label scouts who showed interest wanted him to stick to 
one kind of music, while he wanted to play a wide-ranging mixture of styles, 
from "stuff Garth Brooks could cover to stuff that couldn't be played at 2 a.m. 
on KPFK" because it was too extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 Grisham recalled one private audition for a scout: "We played a whole spectrum 
of stuff, from ballads to kill-or-be-killed, and the guy said, 'I love it, I 
was totally interested through the whole set.' The same guy, a month later, 
picked one of the songs and said, 'I need 10 more just like this.' The thing he 
liked about us first is the thing he wanted to destroy in the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Grisham said he even consulted a fortune teller a month ago, who advised him, 
"You're fighting for your life, cut all these people loose, they're sucking you 
dry." "So we told all the labels to go to hell," Grisham said. "We're just 
going to have a good time. I told my manager, 'I don't want to talk to 
businessmen any more. I've got nothing in common with them.' I can't deal with 
those people because I get too emotionally involved in what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Grisham said that his plans now call for extensive touring, something he has 
been famously loathe to do in the past. His last tour was in 1983, the year he 
left T.S.O.L. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'Jack won't leave the house,' " he acknowledged, but he says his 
aim now is to play his way across the country and perform in Europe too. 
Grisham says he has had preliminary talks with the Offspring's record company, 
the red-hot punk label Epitaph, about a possible new recording. "If it's easy 
and no hassle, we'll make a record. But we're going to tour anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 As yet, no dates have been booked. Grisham's manager, Mike Renault, hopes that 
touring by the Joykillers will prove to record labels that there is a sizable 
audience for his music. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tougher in the marketplace for somebody to go out on tour and survive 
without the support of a record company," Renault said. "But there's been a 
resurgence of the music he was first creating (with T.S.O.L.). So it makes 
sense for Jack to go out and do it now. This sort of thing with the Offspring, 
and this whole resurgence of a style Jack was into, brings the attention so we 
can get the guy going again. The fan base is likely to be looking for the punk 
roots of Jack Grisham. I think they may find something different. I don't think 
they'll see the punk he was, but hopefully they'll see what he's grown into and 
take a shot at that." 
</P>
<P>
 Grisham says he is putting his ballads aside for now, and plans a live set 
that will include a handful of T.S.O.L. songs along with hard-edged new 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just for fun, like when T.S.O.L. started," he said. "It was, 'Let's just 
cause trouble and have fun.' That's what it's back to now, although some of the 
causing trouble is out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Joykillers play tonight at 10 at Dragonfly, 6510 Santa Monica Blvd., 
Hollywood. $6. (213) 466-6111.

A 'CLEAR' TRIUMPH AT BOX OFFICE; MOVIES: THE HARRISON FORD THRILLER SEIZES THE 
NO. 1 SPOT WITH ESTIMATED TICKET RECEIPTS OF MORE THAN $20 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Harrison Ford, who has ignited the box office to the tune of $4 billion in 
tickets sold worldwide for such films as "Indiana Jones" and last summer's 
mega-hit "The Fugitive," apparently has done it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford's latest film, "Clear and Present Danger," collected an estimated $20.5 
million over the weekend, making it the No. 1 film for the 
Friday-through-Sunday period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paramount Pictures release, based on Tom Clancy's best-selling novel about 
drug trafficking in the United States, came into the marketplace with high 
expectations that it would be the summer season's last major hit film. It was 
expected to help the theatrical film business comfortably move through the 
typically sluggish late-summer dog days and maintain the moviegoing momentum 
that began with "Maverick" and continued with "The Flintstones," "Speed," "The 
Lion King," "Forrest Gump" and "The Mask." 
</P>
<P>
 All that, and more came to pass: 
</P>
<P>
 * The arrival of "Clear and Present Danger" helped produce what preliminary 
estimates indicated Sunday was the film industry's fifth consecutive weekend of 
$100-million-plus business, an unprecedented achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 * The figures from the just-ended weekend should push summer 1994 ahead of the 
record summer of 1993, which had included the megahit "Jurassic Park." The 
year-to-date total kept by Beverly Hills-based Exhibitor Relations Co. is 1% 
ahead of the total at this point in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry London, president of Paramount worldwide distribution, said he continues 
"to be amazed how the movie business continues to expand and accommodate 
multiple hits." 
</P>
<P>
 London said that with two well-attended nights of "Clear and Present Danger" 
previews prior to Friday's official opening, the box-office total for the film 
reached $29 million in five days. "What's impressive to me," said London, is 
that the film is achieving this level of ticket sales despite a running time of 
well over two hours, which limits showings at many theaters to four daily 
instead of the usual five. 
</P>
<P>
 In second place at the box office, in its second week of release, was the Jim 
Carrey special effects-laden comedy, "The Mask," which took in $15.5 million 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount's hit "Forrest Gump," starring Tom Hanks, was in third place, having 
made $165 million in 33 days of release. Over the weekend, "Gump" garnered 
$14.5 million. Between the Ford and the Hanks movies, Paramount's share of the 
market hit 35%. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount Pictures Chairman Sherry Lansing took expected pride in the fact 
that two of the year's biggest films are from her studio. On Sunday, she said: 
"What's encouraging is that quality and commercial movies are going together." 
</P>
<P>
 Universal Pictures' release of "The Little Rascals" pulled a strong $10 
million. The studio said the film was aided by a fondness among the public for 
the film's characters seen in early TV and in weekly movie theater serials. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other releases in the Top 10, "True Lies" added $9.2 million to bring 
its total to $100.8 million and a fifth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth through 10th-place movies were: "The Client," $7.1 million.; "The 
Lion King," $6.9 million; "It Could Happen to You," $5 million; "Angels in the 
Outfield," $2.8 million, and "Speed," $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20th Century Fox release of a rock 'n' roll comedy, "Airheads," ran well 
behind the superstar movies, grossing $1.8 million in national release to land 
in 11th place. 
</P>
<P>
 Final weekend tallies will be released today.

WHOOPI: BRUISED BUT UNBOWED; GOLDBERG HAS NEW MOVIE, 'CORRINA, CORRINA,' AND 
NEW MAN IN HER LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WINER-BERNHEIMER, NEWSDAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is -- after all these years -- still a look. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoopi Goldberg, who wore a velvet Herrera gown and an Armani tux to host the 
Oscars, has decided to meet the press for her new film, "Corrina, Corrina," 
which opens Friday, in black patent-leather Mary Janes, white knee socks and a 
plaid cotton schoolgirl dress. Big plastic earrings -- cascading bunches of red 
peppers -- are peeking out from her dreadlocks, her eyebrows are shaved, and 
she wears thin gold bands on her thumbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, this was not a look to get a woman ushered past the lobby of a 
Beverly Hills hotel. As the most powerful black female in Hollywood, however, 
Goldberg clearly enjoys nudging the assumptions. What's more, as an African 
American and a female in America, she also knows not to take anything for 
granted. "Movie stardom is tough," she says without bitterness. "It's a fluke. 
Listen, I'm a fluke." 
</P>
<P>
 It is days after her Emmy nomination for the Oscar show; "vindicating" is her 
word for it. "I took a lot of grief for that show," says Goldberg, who 
gracefully made both gender and racial history as solo host that night. "For 
some reason, people assumed I was going to be tactless. . . . The way they 
talked about it, I guess they thought I was going to pick my nose and eat it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "So it was very nice that somebody said, 'You know what? Whoopi did a good 
job. She came into a tough gig and stood up to the fire.' And, you know, I want 
those pats on the back. I want to know that I'm doing a good job. I've taken 
all the heat I'm going to take for the next couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg is still standing, but she's far too frank to pretend she wasn't 
battered by the year of headlines. She means, first, the heat about Ted Danson, 
her former lover, who wore blackface at her Friar's Club roast. This is a 
subject her handlers have demanded not be mentioned, but which she brings up 
herself with the candor for which she deserves to be famous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people jumped us because we were an interracial couple. They 
jumped us for all the other reasons. It was the big, rich, very sexy man from 
'Cheers' and Whoopi, who was, like, considered asexual for, you know, the first 
nine years in Hollywood. . . . you would have thought I'd never had a 
boyfriend." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the heat about her Jewish-American-Princess Fried Chicken 
recipe in a fund-raising book, which some found anti-Semitic, and the 
cancellation of her TV talk show, which some found sycophantic. "Star Trek: The 
Next Generation," on which she had a regular role as Guinan, the psychic 
bartender, was canceled. "Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit" vanished without a 
prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the original "Sister Act" has grossed $300 million worldwide to 
date -- a stunning fact, even to her. And though she had gone dangerously 
public with her displeasure with Disney afterward, she negotiated $7 
million-plus for the sequel. And she had dinner at the White House in June. And 
she's in the new "Star Trek" movie, and that's her voice as head hyena in the 
king of the summer movies, "The Lion King." She has a Herb Ross film, "Boys on 
the Side," coming out, movies with Kathleen Turner and Gerard Depardieu coming 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 And she's engaged -- another topic we've been warned in advance not to bring 
up -- to Lyle Trachtenberg, a union organizer she reportedly met when he 
visited the "Corrina, Corrina" set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," she says, happily displaying a handsome ring dotted with tiny stones. 
"He designed this himself. And he's a union man, so you know it was real 
money." And, despite what the fan mags may say, the betrothed -- who has been 
married twice, is a grandmother of Amarah Skye, age 4, and owns homes in 
Connecticut and L.A. -- is not "registered." "Come on," she says, shaking her 
head and grinning. "Like what I really need is another picture frame." 
</P>
<P>
 Now there is "Corrina, Corrina," a sort of "I'll Fly Away" with romance, a 
semi-autobiographical story written and directed by former Mabou Mines actress 
Jessie Nelson. Goldberg plays a music-school graduate in the '50s who takes a 
job as housekeeper and nanny for a Jewish jingle writer and widower (Ray 
Liotta) and his small daughter (Tina Majorino). The script was brought to her 
attention four years ago. "I stayed with it," says Goldberg, who asked only 
that Nelson give Corrina a college degree. "I liked Jessie. I thought it was an 
interesting story. And I wanted a job. You know, I wanted to get this made so I 
could work." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Outsiders may be surprised that Goldberg worries about getting movies. Even 
after her career was re-energized with her Oscar for "Ghost," the highest 
grossing picture of 1990, she claims roles do not roll in. "The amount of money 
you make does not have anything to do with what you are able to get done here," 
she says, sighing with a mixture of resignation and wickedness. "Unless you 
stand up in the bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Challenged about her uneven movie choices, she once told Time magazine, "Do 
you think I sit around and say, 'Here are the great scripts and here are the 
crappy scripts. I'll do the crappy ones!'?" 
</P>
<P>
 She still feels that way. Even after her remarkable movie debut, and Oscar 
nomination, in "The Color Purple" in 1985, she had to fight to be considered 
for roles intended for very different actors. "Jumpin Jack Flash" (1986) was 
meant for Shelley Long, "Burglar" ('87) for Bruce Willis, "Sister Act" ('92) 
for Bette Midler, "Made in America" ('93) for Jessica Lange. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg, who vowed early in her career not to play maids -- then played them 
in "Clara's Heart" ('88) and "The Long Walk Home" ('90) -- finds herself 
defending another one. "I say pay homage to these women who cleaned other 
people's houses to put their children through college and make them professors 
and the great men and women they became.  
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow we believe there's some gene inside of black women that says, 'I 
can't wait to grow up to be a maid,' " she says with a rueful laugh. "You never 
see what happens to Beulah after she peels the grape for Mae West. We don't 
know that Beulah is a real estate maven who put her daughter through med 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are movies she'd like to get made, though she's fully aware of the 
hit-and-miss realities of all careers, even those of her white male buddies 
Robin Williams and Billy Crystal. "This is a world where you can make 'Boxing 
Helena,' but you can't make a movie about the Tuskegee Airmen (a select group 
of heroic black airmen who trained at the Tuskegee Army Air Base in Alabama and 
who fought during World War II). . . . I've made movies that have made $100 
million, but I guess it's going to take another couple of years of doing that 
before it becomes real. And," she adds daintily, "I'm not in that Julia age." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, for all Goldberg's candor, there is more than a little mystery about 
her age. She says she is 38, but she was reported to be 35 in 1984, when she 
made her debut on Broadway with a one-woman show. Mike Nichols billed her as 
"one part Elaine May, one part Groucho, one part Ruth Draper, one part Richard 
Pryor and five parts never before seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols is her hero. "Mike babysat me and made everybody come and told me I 
was great. And then he handed me to Steven (Spielberg, director of "Purple"). 
They told me how people will tell you how much they love what you're doing, 
then try to make you do something different. They told me, 'Stick to your guns 
because, generally, you'll find that you're right.' And that's allowed me to 
keep my hair as it is and keep my nose flat and my behind large." 
</P>
<P>
 She does not call herself African American. "I don't hear people calling 
themselves Russian Americans. Everybody calls themselves American. My family 
and their grandparents and their grandparents built this country. This is mine. 
Four generations, five generations. I have a huge root that goes to the core. 
I've been to Africa. Completely different culture. This is my culture. And if I 
am only to be identified by what you see, which part of me are you seeing? The 
Chinese in me?" she asks, gesturing toward her eyes. "The black?" Her hands go 
to her nose. "The Indian?" She touches her smile.  
</P>
<P>
 When she grew up, she says, "I didn't see any women who looked like me in the 
movies. I don't want there to be a time when there isn't a face like mine 
available. I took my granddaughter to see 'Lion King' -- I'm trying to impress 
her big time. 
</P>
<P>
 "You watch all these little kids, little Asian kids, little Spanish kids and 
they don't see themselves. Jasmine was the darkest thing Disney did, but she 
wasn't dark enough. Kids are much hipper than we were -- they know something's 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 So, even when the roles are not great, "you do the best you can with what you 
have. You take out your little hammer and chisel," and "in 40 years, when 
they're doing the Whoopi retrospective, and I come tottering out on stage on 
somebody's arm, maybe some of these movies that have taken such awful hits will 
be seen as classics for their period." Meanwhile, she jokes, "if somebody 
offers me $30 million to do 'Ghost II,' well, 'I'm not beyond shopping."

THE WORLD ACCORDING TO STEINBERG; COMEDY: JOHNNY CARSON'S RETIREMENT 
TEMPORARILY PUT AN END TO HIS NOVEL REFLECTIONS, BUT HE RETURNS TO PERFORMING 
LIVE AT THE MOONLIGHT TANGO CAFE, BEGINNING TUESDAY.

 OD'd on O.J.? 
</P>
<P>
 Are we terminally frazzled by electronic overload? 
</P>
<P>
 Will Yiddish ever become Canada's official language? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, any hope for the last ended with the death of Yasha Steinberg, a 
Romanian rabbi who emigrated to Winnipeg, Canada, where he and his wife, Ruth, 
begat three children, Fishy, Tammy and David. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three, David, who went to Chicago at age 15 as a yeshiva student, 
proved the most troublesome -- so much so that when he left home again to visit 
Israel at 18, Yasha said, "I kiss the train that take you away." And when David 
returned to Chicago one more time in the early '60s, it was to join up with the 
Second City troupe, where he later begat the phrase that swept the nation, 
"Boogah, boogah." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, in theater and movies, television shows and commercials, 
Steinberg the Younger has demonstrated one of our more agile comedic minds, and 
in his appearances on "The Tonight Show," he has been one of our most engaging 
raconteurs. 
</P>
<P>
 The retirement of Johnny Carson temporarily put an end to Steinberg's novel 
reflections (his first album was called "David Steinberg Disguised as a Normal 
Person"). Now he's back extemporizing live in a series of stand-up performances 
at the Moonlight Tango cafe, beginning Tuesday, where indeed he'll discuss O.J. 
Simpson, the media, and other matters pressing on our mental state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carson and I were an interesting tennis match," Steinberg recalls. "We 
clicked from the start. Carson appreciated word-play and the use of imagery in 
stories. He made it so that I could come on any time I wanted, but I'd limit my 
appearances to eight or 10 a year. The show was the one constant in my 
professional life. When Johnny retired, I realized I'd lost an outlet for how I 
think comedically, not as a director or actor. I'd lost my Op-Ed page." 
</P>
<P>
 At 52, Steinberg has retained most of his whippet-like youthfulness (a 
rigorous basketball game Saturday mornings at his outdoor court helps keep him 
fit). He looks the ideal dinner party host: brilliant smile, neat frame, a 
buoyancy of demeanor that could float over the heaviest swells of emotional 
turmoil. But there's something in the corner of the eye that suggests the born 
prankster's anarchic glee. 
</P>
<P>
 If Steinberg seems a bit of a Zelig-like figure, someone whose image carries a 
pleasurable chime of recognition, but not quite in any specific connection, 
it's because his career has taken radically different turns. And it has been 10 
years, "The Tonight Show" notwithstanding, since he felt any need to be in 
front of a camera or an audience. "That's how it's broken down," he says. 
"Acting for 10 years, stand-up for 10 years, then directing." 
</P>
<P>
 After his tenure with Second City, his acting career began with a replacement 
role in Off Broadway's "The Mad Show," then Jules Feiffer's "Little Murders" on 
Broadway, followed by "Carry Me Back to Morningside Heights," where he was 
directed by Sidney Poitier. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he says, "I never got much pleasure from acting, which I find inhibiting, 
especially after being at Second City, where you worked out anything that came 
to mind. I've never been career-oriented. I've never had a goal, except just to 
do what you do, express yourself. When you talk to Bill Murray or Martin Short, 
I think they feel the same way." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg's stand-up career, which evolved out of a series of biblical 
sermons, was at first problematic. "It was terrifying," Steinberg recalls. 
"There's nothing more awful than an audience disliking a comic. It's not a 
song, it's not a part, it's you ! 'Go away,' they're saying. 'It's not 
working.' But the rule of thumb in club life is, if a waitress will sleep with 
you, you'll stay a month." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently Steinberg found someone sympathetic among the help at New York's 
Bitter End, where he hung on until New York Times reviewer Dan Sullivan (who 
later worked as Los Angeles Times drama critic) showed up one night and 
proclaimed Steinberg "the most original comedian in years." 
</P>
<P>
 "The next day the line was around the block," Steinberg says. "I had no idea 
of the power of a single review. That one literally made my career." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg's introduction to movies came nearly a decade later, when Susan 
Sarandon advised him to join the cast of "Something Short of Paradise" to learn 
about movie-making. Critic Leonard Maltin cites Steinberg's role in it as 
"obnoxious." 
</P>
<P>
 By this time Steinberg had already amassed considerable TV experience, as a 
writer-performer on "The Smothers Brothers Show" (his "sermons" were among the 
reasons the show was knocked off the air), and host of "The David Steinberg 
Show" in Canada, which introduced Joe Flaherty, Dave Thomas, Martin Short, 
Andrea Martin and John Candy, who made up the unforgettable "SCTV" troupe. He 
directed Candy, Flaherty and Eugene Levy in the cult movie favorite, "Going 
Berserk." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg has directed in television for the past 10 years in shows such as 
"Seinfeld," "Newhart," "Golden Girls," "Evening Shade" and "Mad About You." He 
was executive producer of "Designing Women" and has won several major awards 
directing commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 He confesses that Maltin's "obnoxious" tag characterized his general demeanor 
at the time, but that he changed. His wife of 22 years (former TV producer Judy 
Steinberg) and two young daughters made him realize that the fundamental 
question isn't about success and self-aggrandizement. "It's 'are you relating?' 
There's no preparation for being a parent. The purpose of kids is to destroy 
the illusion that you're in charge of your life." 
</P>
<P>
 In stand-up, Steinberg hopes to rediscover "the part of myself I've mislaid in 
the past few years," and to read our cultural weather. "To me, the O.J. case 
represents the end of the cult of fame. No one's life is very good right now. 
People seem to need a vicarious identification with someone else's perfect 
life. Now we know there's no such thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * David Steinberg will share billing with Jack Sheldon and his orchestra at 
the Moonlight Tango Cafe, 13730 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks, (818) 788-2000, 
Tuesdays, with one show at 8:30 p.m. (The band plays two shows.) $13 .

JOSEPHINE BAKER FILM OPENS FULLERTON SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Muckenthaler Cultural Center opens its outdoor "Celestial Cinema" series 
tonight with "Zou Zou," the 1934 French film starring Josephine Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 When "Zou Zou" came out, St. Louis-born Baker was already a huge celebrity in 
France, her adopted country.She was a song-and-dance phenom with an appeal both 
exotic and common. By making the most of her talents, and through savvy 
image-making, Baker was the queen of the demimonde. 
</P>
<P>
 He handlers wanted a larger arena for Baker besides the Paris nightclubs and 
theater stages where she regularly performed. The movies made sense, and 
screenwriter Carlo Rim was asked to come up with a story. French matinee idol 
Jean Gabin was also brought aboard as Baker's co-star. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Zou Zou," Baker plays an orphan who grew up in a circus. She's in love 
with Gabin, but he's knocked out by her friend. Things get better for Zou Zou, 
though, once she becomes a sensation after stepping into a Busby Berkeley-like 
musical review when the star can't go on. 
</P>
<P>
 The series continues Aug. 15 with "Double Suicide," filmmaker Masahiro 
Shinoda's 1969 adaptation of a traditional 17th-Century Japanese puppet play. 
In this example of the Japanese New Wave of the '60s and '70s, a bankrupt 
businessman and a prostitute immerse themselves in a doomed affair. 
</P>
<P>
 The program ends Aug. 22 with "Juliet of the Spirits," Federico Fellini's 
first color movie. It's also one of the first to indulge Fellini's passion for 
surreal, often hypnotic imagery. The film, which centers on the fantasies and 
fears of a wife who believes her husband is cheating on her, stars Giulietta 
Masina, Fellini's wife and his favorite leading lady. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zou Zou" starring Josephine Baker screens tonight at 8 in the Muckenthaler 
Cultural Center's amphitheater, 1201 W. Malvern Ave., Fullerton. $2 and $3. 
(714) 738-6595.

COUNTERPUNCH: UPS AND DOWNS OF THE LATEST SCHWARZENEGGER FILM; HASTA LA VISTA, 
FAIRNESS: MEDIA'S LINE ON ARABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALAM AL-MARAYATI and DON BUSTANY, Salam Al-Marayati is director of the 
Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los Angeles and Don Bustany is president of 
the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee/LA. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bashing Arabs and Muslims is the Hollywood wave of the past, the present, and 
who knows how far into the future. The image -- the false image -- held by most 
Americans is a result of selective reporting by the news media (because bad 
news is what sells), which is then exploited by the entertainment media 
(because movies need villains). That's how we, and our kids, learn what Arabs 
and Muslims look like and how they behave. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer-director James Cameron, a gifted filmmaker, took that ready-made image, 
a $100-million budget from 20th Century Fox, action hero Arnold Schwarzenegger, 
an excellent supporting cast, and the U.S. Marines and gave us "True Lies," a 
monster hit movie ("The Secret Life of 'True Lies,' " Calendar, July 14). You'd 
think that, with Cameron's talent and available resources, he'd be able to 
create a hit that didn't defame and dehumanize an entire culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, sure, there are some bad Arabs (both Muslim and Christian) and some bad 
Muslims (both Arab and non-Arab) -- about the same percentage as we have bad 
Americans. But the vast majority are just like the rest of us: They get up in 
the morning, work hard, feed the family, pay the taxes, go to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 It took decades for black Americans to get partial relief, but Latinos and 
Asians are still up there on Hollywood's dart board right alongside us Arabs 
and Muslims. Now the film critics are beginning to take notice.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both Kenneth Turan of this paper and Janet Maslin of the New York Times 
clucked their tongues at the stereotypical Arab in "True Lies." Could some of 
it have been malicious? When Schwarzenegger's character speaks Arabic, we see 
English subtitles. But when the Arab characters are speaking Arabic, all we get 
is an auditory cloud of alien gibberish. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic Hollywood story form doesn't change; only the names and the colors 
of the characters do. If Schwarzenegger's character wore jeans instead of a 
tux, carried a six-gun instead of a Berreta, rode a Palomino instead of a 
Harrier jet, and killed redskins wearing feathers instead of brownskins wearing 
beards, we'd have a classic (and racist) Cowboy and Indian movie.  
</P>
<P>
 In World War II movies, Hollywood made the Germans and Japanese at least as 
nasty as it has made Muslims and Arabs. But we were in big-time wars then with 
Germany and Japan. No Arab or Muslim country has ever launched a war against 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of Fox's "bowing to pressure" from Muslim and Arab groups to place a 
disclaimer on the film are a joke and an insult. Instead of putting it at the 
beginning of the film where it might have done some good, the studio put it at 
the very end of a very long list of closing credits -- right after the Humane 
Society. Makes sense. After stereotyping and dehumanizing 1 billion people, 
where else would you put them except after the animals? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The other large racial/ethnic groups have already taken their lumps in 
Hollywood -- Native Americans, African Americans, Asians and Asian Americans, 
Mexicans and Mexican Americans. Red, black, yellow and brown. Now Arabs and 
Muslims are Hollywood's main punching bags. It's an echo of the Nazi propaganda 
-- less lethal, we hope -- that dehumanized Jews in the 1930s and made the 
Holocaust possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood is a potent force. It drove a stake through the heart of anti-Jewish 
bigotry with "Gentleman's Agreement." It won the case for due process with "The 
Hanging Tree." "Philadelphia" heightened our sensitivities toward those with 
AIDS. It gave us more honest perspectives than Washington gave us on the 
Vietnam War with "Born on the Fourth of July," "Platoon" and "Deer Hunter." 
</P>
<P>
 If it wanted to, Hollywood could fix a lot of things. So it's particularly sad 
when talented, creative people choose to hurt rather than to heal. For now, 
hasta la vista, Fairness.

COUNTERPUNCH: UPS AND DOWNS OF THE LATEST SCHWARZENEGGER FILM; CURTIS' TRUE 
ROLE IN 'LIES': EMPOWERMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS EBY, Writer Douglas Eby specializes in articles about women in 
entertainment fields. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Times movie critic Kenneth Turan concludes that "True Lies" exhibits "a strain 
of crudeness and mean-spirited humiliation, especially toward women," and he 
uses as a prime example the scene of Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), who is acting 
the part of an undercover prostitute, stripping and dancing around in "skimpy 
underwear." Turan calls this "painful humiliation" ("The Secret Life of 'True 
Lies,' " Calendar, July 14). However, Curtis considers this "the best role I've 
ever had" and says of the very same scene, "I had the best time. How often do 
you get to do that?" ("Nothing but the Truth From Jamie Lee Curtis," by Linda 
Winer-Bernheimer, Calendar, July 15) 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis creates a strong and credible portrayal of this "plain and mousy" 
housewife who has been drawn into what she wants to believe is an important 
spy-catching scenario, and reveals a buried or unexercised aspect of her 
character's personality and sexuality. Certainly, this is a comedy and a 
fantasy -- no more real than any film is or can be. That Curtis "awkwardly 
prances around," as Turan describes it, is more believable for the role than to 
have her suddenly transformed into a sexually sophisticated Madonna character. 
That would have exceeded this film's playfully wide bounds of unreality. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As another example of "mean-spiritedness," Turan cites the "mortifying" 
treatment given the "weasely used-car salesman (Bill Paxton) in the most 
personal ways." But this character, along with several terrorists, is a prime 
example in the film of the contemptuously demeaning attitudes and humiliating 
treatment of women, also in the "most personal ways." Should such characters be 
well-treated and respected? 
</P>
<P>
 One aspect of this "bit of diversionary fluff" (Turan's term for the underwear 
scene) that directly impacts on the film's portrayal of women is the fact that 
Curtis was cast as the bored and repressed housewife. Curtis is known from a 
variety of roles to be anything but repressed, known rather for parts calling 
for strength and courage, even fierceness, which she again so well expresses 
here -- in a mock interrogation, her fighting the terrorists rather than 
playing victim, and in punching her husband for his years of mendacity. 
</P>
<P>
 A movie that can depict a woman making use of her anger to help transform 
herself and doing what she can to defend herself in a violent situation rather 
than waiting for rescue, even if done in a comic mode, is surely saying 
something positive. To be overly concerned with the political correctness of a 
major film role for a woman, to lose sight of what it does offer that is valid 
and valuable toward improving real-life attitudes about women, risks our having 
even fewer such roles.

O.C. SHORT OF FOSTER HOMES FOR LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A surge in the number of Latino children entering Orange County's foster care 
system has resulted in a critical shortage of Latino foster homes, according to 
social services officials. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, already traumatized children are held in emergency group homes 
twice as long as white children. Then many find themselves in foster homes a 
county away from their parents and siblings, thrust into an environment where 
everything from the language to the food is foreign. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the population of Latino children in foster care has grown 
more rapidly than anywhere else in the state. But to a lesser degree, the same 
phenomenon has occurred in Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego and other counties 
that have experienced sizable growth in their Latino communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, one fourth of the more than 86,000 children in foster care are 
Latino. But children's advocates say the number of Latino foster parents has 
not kept pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't kept up with the changing demographics," said Larry Leaman, 
executive director of the Orange County Social Services Agency, which oversees 
foster care placements. "Now we have to play a catch-up game." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to tap the Latino community, the agency has asked the Board of 
Supervisors for permission to hire three more senior social workers, at least 
one of whom will be a Spanish-speaking Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services 
plans to launch the Community-Based Placement Project in January in the Pacoima 
area. Its goal is to attract more Latino as well as African-American foster 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires social workers to make every effort to place children with 
foster parents of the same race or ethnic group. They must demonstrate that 
they have tried every available avenue before the Latino children can be placed 
in homes with non-Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, the children live at temporary shelters, which, some social 
services officials lament, have become more like holding facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Orange County study by the Social Services Agency found that nonwhite 
foster children were twice as likely as whites to spend 60 days or more at the 
Orangewood Children's Home, Orange County's shelter for children who have been 
removed from their homes because of abuse or neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers are not encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 Just 12% of all foster homes have at least one parent who speaks Spanish, 
according to social services officials. Many of the children themselves are 
bilingual, but their parents, who came to the United States as adults, speak 
only Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the child's natural parents don't speak a word of English," said 
Barbara Labitzke, foster home development coordinator for the county of Orange. 
"If you place the child in a home where not a word of Spanish is spoken, the 
parents feel threatened by the foster parents. Here is this other person who 
doesn't even speak their language." 
</P>
<P>
 That becomes important, Labitzke said, because it is hoped that the natural 
parents will visit the child and work toward a reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 Labitzke says cultural compatibility is also key in helping troubled children 
regain some semblance of normalcy in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a child who has been removed from their home because of abuse, 
molestation and all those things that bring kids into foster care," Labitzke 
said. "If they are plucked from their home and placed somewhere where the 
smells coming from the kitchen are not familiar . . . (and) the language is not 
the same, it's very traumatic." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, social services officials in Orange County and elsewhere in the state 
have had limited success recruiting Latino foster parents, largely because few 
of the recruiters and social workers can speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the Orange County Social Services Agency has speakers who address 
community groups about foster parenting, its only Spanish-speaker recently 
moved to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "How are you going to reach people if the recruiters, the licensing people and 
the social workers -- none of them speak Spanish," said Richard Trujillo, 
manager for the California Department of Social Services foster care 
recruitment program. "Even if you have Spanish-speaking recruiters, if you 
don't have Spanish-speaking support staff, the Latino foster parents are going 
to drop out." Many counties are turning to outside, private agencies to help 
find temporary homes for Latino children. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Zacuto, executive director of the Beta Foster Care Agency in Laguna 
Niguel, says the obstacles are complex. 
</P>
<P>
 For one, he said, many of the children have siblings who also are in foster 
care. By law, siblings must be housed together or as near to each other as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be difficult to find parents willing to accept more than one child. And 
some of those who are willing can't meet strict licensing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the so-called "bedroom rule" allows no more than two children per 
bedroom, thus excluding larger families that might otherwise provide loving, 
nurturing homes, Zacuto said. 
</P>
<P>
 With nowhere else to go, many children end up in emergency shelters or in 
placements out of county, far from their natural parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Perez, 34, and her husband, David, are one of the rare exceptions. They 
are foster parents to a 10-month old girl, her 22-month old half-brother and 
another 3-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of the problem is that there has been a lot of bad publicity" 
about incorrigible children, said Perez, a law student. "I think if people 
understood more about how the system works, it wouldn't be a big issue for 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County -- home to nearly half of the state's 86,000 foster 
children, social services officials are attempting to address this problem with 
the Community-Based Placement Project -- a partnership between the Department 
of Children's Services, California Department of Social Services, Youth Law 
Center and the Irvine Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to reach prospective Latino and African-American foster parents 
through targeted mailings, boys and girls clubs, schools, churches and other 
community-based organizations, said Victoria Pipkin, a spokeswoman for the 
county Department of Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing is to place children in foster homes in their community," 
Pipkin said. "It offers a measure of stability so you don't totally uproot the 
child." Orangewood Admissions 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of Latino admissions to Orangewood Children's Home more than 
doubled from 1986 to 1992, the most recent year for which information is 
available: 04,14,06,06,06 1986 1988 1992 White 69% 60% 50% Latino 15% 28% 36% 
Black 8% 7% 6% Asian, other 8% 5% 8% * The Orange County Social Services Agency

REFORMER WOULD IRON OUT TAX WRINKLES; REVENUE: O.C. MAN WANTS TO REPLACE 
COMPLEX STATE SYSTEM WITH A FLAT 2 1/2% LEVY ON ALL INCOME.

 Like many Americans, Roland Boucher has long been irked and befuddled by the 
weblike complexity of the California income tax code. But while the rest of us 
merely groan and mail off our returns every April 15, this Orange County 
retiree wants to change the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with two other, like-minded reformers, Boucher is trying to inspire what 
could become California's next great tax revolt. Drawn together by Ross Perot's 
unsuccessful presidential quest, the three have recruited an army of 1,500 
volunteers to help qualify a proposition for the 1996 statewide ballot that 
would dramatically simplify the tax code. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling themselves United Californians for Tax Reform and operating out of a 
cramped office near Orange County's John Wayne Airport, the reformers propose 
that the state adopt a "flat tax" at 2 1/2% of a worker's annual income. That's 
the equivalent of one hour's wages each week (the group's motto: "An hour a 
week is all Sacramento gets to keep") and is a fraction of current state income 
tax rates, which rise as high as 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is hardly alone in it's dogged pursuit of the perfect flat tax. The 
concept has been embraced by politicians as disparate as Edmund G. (Jerry) 
Brown Jr. and Bruce Herschensohn. In Washington, Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.) and 
several other congressmen are pushing various versions of a federal flat tax 
these days. Closer to home, Reagan-era economist Arthur Laffer has been busy 
drafting a flat tax initiative of his own for the 1996 statewide ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 In each case, simplicity is a paramount part of the sales pitch. United 
Californians for Tax Reform boasts that its flat tax proposal is so 
uncomplicated that returns would be filed on postcard-sized forms, not the 
current maze of returns, rate schedules and indecipherable instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's great populist appeal in the idea of a simplified tax form," 
said Steve Hayward, research director at Pacific Research Institute, a 
conservative think tank in San Francisco. "This could become one of the 
political ideas of the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
 While the stated purpose is not to cut taxes, boosters suggest that a 
streamlined tax code would give the economy a boost. The cost of tax preparers, 
accountants and attorneys would be a thing of the past. Investors, meanwhile, 
could focus on economic considerations rather than the art of avoiding taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of a flat tax has been embraced by many conservatives, but most 
Democrats remain unconvinced. Opponents argue that flat taxes favor the rich, 
who stand to gain with lowered rates. Moreover, critics suggest that the flat 
tax would limit government's ability to handle the inevitable emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a can of worms," said state Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael), chairman 
of the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee. "They're saying we know 
everything that's going to happen, every cost to the state, and that's not the 
case. What about the Medfly, the occasional riot, earthquakes? Throw in the 
cost of a deep freeze or two. Have they figured that into the equation?" 
</P>
<P>
 Greene also worries that trying to revamp the state tax system via the 
initiative process is an exercise fraught with peril. Instead of going through 
"the crucible" of countless legislative hearings before experts on the subject, 
he said, the initiatives are the product of only a few minds -- and once in 
place, they are harder to correct. "The odds are," Greene said, "they got it 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Boucher and others, however, figure they're on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
 A review by the state Legislative Analyst concluded that the proposal put 
forth by United Californians for Tax Reform could cost $179 million each year 
in lost revenue. But the group insists that sort of revenue loss -- roughly 1% 
of the more than $16 billion in income taxes now collected by the state -- 
would hardly bankrupt California. 
</P>
<P>
 To help ease the transition from the status quo, an additional 2 1/2% tax 
would be assessed for the first five years on all individual annual income 
exceeding $52,000. Moreover, the group argues that a simplified tax system 
would spur enough economic growth to offset any shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Boucher contends that the flat tax also would help squelch the endless 
political shenanigans in Sacramento, where lawmakers swayed by special interest 
campaign contributions have created a tax code with more loopholes than Swiss 
cheese. Moreover, a single tax for all would provide less incentive for 
individual taxpayers to cheat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made a nightmare out of this thing over a 70-year period and it's time 
to fix it," declared Boucher, a former aerospace manager who became frustrated 
with the Byzantine state and federal tax system after he launched his own 
business in the 1970s selling radio-controlled toy cars. "Every person making 
an equal income ought to pay equal taxes. That means no deductions, credits, 
exemptions. Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 He and his cohorts -- Paul Arndt, who worked with Boucher at Hughes Aircraft 
and is now retired in Leisure World, and real estate manager Charles Alvord -- 
hope they can spark a revolution that will spread across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But, so far, they're having a rough time just in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the big corps of volunteers and a snappy phone number, (800) 540-FLAT, 
United Californians for Tax Reform has collected only 50,000 signatures for the 
measure, far short of the 376,000 they'll need by the end of September to 
qualify for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the group is short on cash, and no politicians have come forward to 
offer money or help. They also haven't even been able to get an endorsement or 
much assistance from United We Stand, the grass-roots group formed by Perot 
followers after the 1992 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been ignored," lamented Boucher. "We have no prior political history. 
Everyone is saying, 'Who the hell are you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Even some sympathetic politicians are staying away. Assemblyman Curt Pringle 
(R-Garden Grove) supports the concept of flat taxes, but doesn't like the 
group's insistence on absolutely no deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some deductions that are vital to maintain for the economic and 
public good," Pringle said. "The two I'm concerned about are charitable and 
mortgage deductions. It's the right thing to encourage people to give to 
charity. And it's the American dream to own a home. We should encourage that in 
tax policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they don't make this year's deadline for gathering signatures, Boucher 
and the rest have time on their side before 1996 and have vowed to take up the 
cause again next year. 
</P>
<P>
 If they make the ballot, the plan would likely end up in direct competition 
with an alternative flat-tax proposal being sculpted by Laffer, the economist 
who helped inspire Reaganomics with his "Laffer Curve" and other principles. 
</P>
<P>
 Laffer's idea, which is similar to the proposal pushed by former California 
Gov. Brown during the 1992 presidential race, is to eliminate all taxes -- 
everything from sales and property taxes to levies on business and income -- 
and replace them with a flat tax that would be the same for individuals and 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is still being tinkered with, but the idea is to ensure that 
taxes collected by state and local government remain at 10.71% of the personal 
income of California residents. Laffer's plan also allows a few exemptions -- 
donations to charities, mortgage interest or rent payments, social security and 
disability income. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a tax cut," Laffer said. "This is just readjusting taxes to make 
them efficient, so people don't spend all their time on accountants or 
lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Orange County group is struggling to collect signatures, Laffer has 
joined forces with an old hand at state ballot measures -- People's Advocate 
Inc., the direct mail group created by the late Paul Gann, co-author of 
Proposition 13. Laffer said more than $400,000 has been raised toward the 
signature-gathering effort, which has yet to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Boucher, for one, is quick to criticize Laffer's proposal. He worries that it 
would give lawmakers in Sacramento too much power to determine how much revenue 
is returned to cities and counties. He doesn't like its deductions. And he 
hates the nature of its support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I notice it's being backed by people with money in their pockets," he said. 
"They're not the average Joe. That makes me wonder about it." Flat-Lining the 
Tax Code 
</P>
<P>
 The flat-tax proposal would change how state income taxes are paid and the 
amounts collected. Main provisions of the flat tax proposal and scenarios for 
three income levels: 
</P>
<P>
 Provisions 
</P>
<P>
 * Replaces present rate, which ranges up to 11%, with a uniform 2.5% rate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Applies to all personal income. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allows no deductions, no exemptions and no tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deducts state income taxes from wages, as Social Security is now deducted. 
</P>
<P>
 * Replaces present form with a postcard-size form with just 10 lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * Indexes capital gains held more than three years against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Applies a 2.5% surcharge on yearly income exceeding $52,000 for first five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allows extension of surcharge only by two-thirds vote of Legislature, 
without modification, and in five-year increments. 
</P>
<P>
 Three hypothetical examples of how the flat-tax proposal would pencil out for 
various income levels: 04,28,09,09,10 INCOME 1. Wages $25,000 $60,000 $125,000 
2. Interest/dividends 0 5,000 10,000 3. Sale of capital assets 0 0 5,000 4. 
Other 0 0 5,000 5. Total $25,000 $65,000 $145,000 TAXES 6. Baseline tax $625 
$1,625 $3,625 7. Surcharge 0 325 2,325 8. Total tax 625 1,950 5,950 9. Tax 
withheld (from W-2) 625 1,700 4,950 10. Tax due $0 $250 $1,000 Source: United

WELCOME TO THE POTATO STATE -- NOW GO HOME; IDAHO: CALIFORNIANS FLEEING 
BIG-CITY PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN MET WITH RESENTMENT BY THEIR NEW NEIGHBORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Each year, the winds of August bring a smoky controversy to this bustling 
Northwest city, pitting a stubborn stock of locals against a quirky new breed 
of resident: The ex-Californian. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when farmers set fire to 40,000 acres of bluegrass in a time-tested 
technique to add nitrogen to the soil and increase crop yields. Throughout 
August -- prime tourist season in rural northern Idaho -- the skies above 
Kootenai County blacken with billowing plumes of soot, a surefire signal of the 
Potato State's biggest rhubarb. 
</P>
<P>
 Like thousands of other environmentally conscious California transplants, John 
Mann watches the streaks of smoke trail low over Coeur d'Alene Lake and its 
international-resort hotel, over blue-collar housing tracts sprouting from 
once-virgin forest land and massive, newly built mansions that locals refer to 
as "California dance halls." 
</P>
<P>
 And he fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You show me somebody who doesn't complain about the smoke and I'll show you 
an idiot," says the former Thousand Oaks resident, frowning in distaste. "But 
these farmers are given free rein -- just because this is the way they've 
always done things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't get it. This would never happen in California." 
</P>
<P>
 The bluegrass burn-off is just one volley in a cultural clash being waged in 
this tradition-bound town of 28,000 residents less than 100 miles south of the 
Canadian border. Californians, weary of the crime, earthquakes and overcrowding 
back home, have come here by the carload, bringing with them fat home equities 
and what the locals regard as curious big-city attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians are moving northward in search of a rural solace many believe can 
no longer be found in the country's most populous state. Between 1991 and 1993, 
a reported 28,202 Californians moved to Idaho, making up nearly 27% of the 
state's 98,446 new residents. In the same period, 5,315 of those California 
transplants moved to Kootenai County, nearly 40% of its newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 California provides more than twice as many emigres to Idaho as second-place 
Washington state. And even many of the latter, according to Idaho state 
transportation officials who tally newcomer origins through auto license plate 
transfers, are once-removed Californians who moved on after finding the growing 
congestion of Seattle and Puget Sound too much like home. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers are fueled in part by a growing number of San Fernando Valley 
residents weary of the noise and drive-by shootings as well as what they call 
the outrageous price of doing business in places like Van Nuys, Chatsworth and 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mann left Thousand Oaks and a career as a stockbroker because he hate 
L.A. traffic and cultural tensions. "I'm no racist, but I just got tired of 
being a minority in Los Angeles, tired of explaining English to 7-Eleven clerks 
and counting their change for them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'd go orbital, absolutely berserk, if I had to sit in traffic. I'd 
hyperventilate, pound on the wheel. Once I chased a guy, doing 105 m.p.h. on 
the Simi Valley Freeway, because I was sick of him cruising my neighborhood at 
11 p.m. with his boom box blaring." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by such suburban pioneers, the centuries-long westward migration to 
the Pacific has taken a decided turn to the north as tens of thousands of 
Californians follow The Dream to states such as Idaho, Washington, Oregon and 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 For most Southern Californians, this new life has been a bit of northern 
exposure -- searching for their own private Idaho, a niche among the 
strait-laced and sometimes cranky native population who wear the term local 
like some Great Northwest badge of honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Lund, a 40ish ex-model from the City of Industry, had such a hard time 
adjusting to Idaho men that she founded a dating club for California 
transplants, attracting dozens of lonely hearts, frozen out of or self-exiled 
from the Idaho singles scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Idaho," Lund sums it up, "can be a very lonely place." 
</P>
<P>
 The name Coeur d'Alene was coined centuries ago by Native American hunters, 
angered by French traders they thought were low-balling fur prices. They called 
them small-hearted men. Hence, the story goes, Coeur d'Alene means, roughly, 
"heart the size of an alene, " a small leather-piercing tool the Native 
Americans used. 
</P>
<P>
 Today in Coeur d'Alene, many locals are lashing back at what they regard as a 
new small-hearted invasion, of big-city "kooks" whose very appearance and every 
action affronts their traditional values. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a stereotype of Californians here," said David Bond, a reporter for 
the Coeur d'Alene Press. "They roller-blade around town in neon, 
glow-in-the-dark clothes. They put fences around their land and call the Forest 
Service all winter long, complaining that locals are killing the deer." 
</P>
<P>
 Californians, locals say, just can't comprehend the folksy style of the 
Handle, the thin, wooded finger of northern Idaho dividing Montana and 
Washington state, where deals are sealed with a handshake, where you can ride a 
horse for two days straight without crossing an asphalt road, where its plumb 
impossible to find a mechanic or carpenter on the first day of hunting season. 
</P>
<P>
 And everybody understands -- except the Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Coeur d'Alene native Ted Anderson is fed up with watching his hometown turned 
into a "little Los Angeles." He tells of Californians suing the city, local 
residents and one another, including one Los Angeles family who had the gall to 
fence off access to a popular local watering hole and forbid people to swim 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a funny bunch," said the 86-year-old retired sign painter. "They 
hated the place they came from so much, they headed for the hills. Now they 
want to make the hills just like California." 
</P>
<P>
 Locals like Anderson say Coeur d'Alene is changing faster than the weather on 
a fall Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the summer air is filled with police sirens and the detested blare 
of car alarms. Locals complain that there are racial problems in their school 
system (although it is still more than 98% white) and grumble that kids in 
"gang-style" backward baseball caps and baggy shorts are popping up in the 
traditional local high school sea of cowboy boots and Wrangler jeans. 
Teen-agers are bringing guns to class, no longer seeing them as tools -- as 
their fathers and grandfathers did -- but as weapons, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 In Idaho, moose, deer and osprey still line the roadsides like 7-Elevens "back 
there" in California. Locals around Hayden Lake pump unfiltered water into 
their houses. People pay for their gas after they've pumped it -- with a 
personal check, no less. It's a place where Democrat Bill Clinton finished 
third in the last presidential election, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if the average salary is $19,000 a year, that there are more 
minimum-wage jobs than pine cones scattered across the forest floor. This is a 
proud, right-to-work state where leaving car and house doors unlocked doesn't 
spell disaster, where teen-agers are watched by stern-faced cops issuing 
tickets for offenses such as underage smoking and spitting on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood banker, waitress and police officer will wave to you in the 
street, call you by your first name and even ask about the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is endangered, the locals will tell you, by the flood of 
Californians, with their rude driving habits and standoffish demeanor. The 
resentment surfaces in jokes told at bars, notes left on car windshields or 
epithets tossed at passing sports cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the resentment is based on dollars and cents. Armed with huge equities 
siphoned from the Los Angeles real-estate boom of recent decades, 
ex-Californians have invested heavily in Kootenai County property, raising 
housing prices to where many blue-collar Coeur d'Alene residents now cannot 
afford to buy a home. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kootenai County alone, there are 700 realtors, mostly to serve the 
California market. Indeed, locals point out, 1% of the population has a real 
estate license. Just five years ago, $100,000 homes were an extravagance. Now 
homes regularly sell for half a million dollars. Rents in many cases have 
doubled since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody can afford to buy a house in this town," Bond said. "There was a day 
when you could live here in poverty with a reasonable amount of dignity. Those 
days are gone." 
</P>
<P>
 It grates on locals that on some stretches of Route 95, the main north-south 
thoroughfare through town, there are bothersome traffic lights every half-mile 
now, where Jaguars and Mercedes-Benzes sometimes outnumber John Deere tractors. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, folks learned last year that an Irvine real estate 
broker was actually teaching people how to leave California in a three-hour UC 
Riverside seminar entitled "How to Move to the Pacific Northwest." 
</P>
<P>
 Even more irksome than newcomers, however, are those who presume that five 
years in Idaho makes them a native -- with the right to slam the door on 
everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 The local no-growth committee, locals point out, is composed primarily of 
ex-Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 One Coeur d'Alene resident advertised a 10-page anti-Californian pamphlet for 
$4.95, entitled "North Idaho: The Case Against the Californians." The author 
had moved here from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Debi Mann, who came here from Thousand Oaks four years ago, admits she wants 
to close the door on future transplants. "We thought we found our own 
Shangri-La and no one else knew about it. Now it's all being ruined. What I say 
to these newcomers is, 'Go find your own Nirvana. You're tainting my dream.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I resent being called a Californian," said her husband, John. "It's 
discriminatory. Anyway, so what if I'm a Californian? It's just a way these 
locals use to single me out as a person who's opposed to the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
 Other ex-Californians have found it easier to just stick to themselves. And 
when one family moved back to San Diego last year, they put the 
California-bashing to work for them. They threw a "Send Us Back to California" 
yard sale. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some locals who feel Californians are good for Idaho, bringing a 
newfound cultural diversity -- authentic Mexican restaurants, coffee shops, 
micro-breweries. 
</P>
<P>
 And best of all, they say, new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This town was still debating women's suffrage in 1978," says reporter Bond, a 
bearded former Seattle rock critic adorned with a French beret and Looney Toon 
tie. "For many locals, gourmet food meant deep-fried something. Nobody drank 
wine without a metal cap. The new blood has changed that." 
</P>
<P>
 But progress has come at a price, say Bond and others, who complain that some 
Californians brought along the racial tensions they complained about in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, African Americans were a rarity -- 13 in the county in 1970, 
growing to 68 in 1980 and 139 in 1990 out of a population of 80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I arrived from Santa Barbara in 1978, people stared," said 43-year-old 
mechanic Phil Wilson. "They would stop me to ask if I were black. Some had 
never seen a black person before. They didn't want me to work on their cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Coeur d'Alene has a white-supremacy group -- its leader and many members 
are ex-Californians -- as well as hundreds of Southern California 
law-enforcement retirees, each seeking a perceived sense of racial purity, Bond 
and others say. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Wilson, a former Oceanside policeman who now runs a Coeur d'Alene radiator 
shop, founded a social group for California law-enforcement transplants who 
moved north for the wide open spaces -- as well as racial motives -- he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do I say this tactfully?" he said. "In Southern California, 80% of the 
calls you get as a policeman are from Hispanics and blacks. You just get tired 
of it. You want to get away." 
</P>
<P>
 Bond regards these as Californians Idaho can do without. "Believe it or not, 
California has provided us with some real narrow thinkers," he said. "We may be 
rednecks up here, but we're not bigots. There's a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Lund, the former model, describes the joy of life in the Northwest -- crisp 
mornings, watching the tips of trees stab the descending sun at dusk. Then 
there's the frustration of trying to find good company here, she says -- 
trouble that started as soon as she arrived in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was lonely," she said. "Men were afraid of me because I was a city girl. 
They didn't have a clue. One wanted to race me to the top of a hill to see if I 
could keep up, gauge what kind of woman I was. I thought he wanted to inspect 
my teeth, too." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, she placed a newspaper ad: "Single ex-Californians group forming. 
Will meet Tuesday night. Call Barbara for details." 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen transplants showed up, each with horror tales of encounters with 
locals, who fought back with anonymous prank calls, she says. At the group's 
meetings in a local saloon, locals would rubberneck from the bar, laughing, 
pointing at the silly Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was this air of hostility," Lund said, "like someone was going to lob a 
Molotov cocktail into our group." 
</P>
<P>
 While the club has led her to some nice California men, she dreads the coming 
of winter. "It gets dark at 4 p.m., with snow piled past the window tops. It 
just makes you want to cozy up to the fire with somebody special. That is, if 
you can find them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Potter, a former AT & T executive and ex-resident of La Canada Flintridge, 
is now president of Jobs Plus, a nonprofit agency whose goal is to bring 
good-paying manufacturing jobs to an Idaho economy depressed by slowdowns in 
the mining and logging industries. At age 66, he's been called the grand poobah 
of Coeur d'Alene, a soft-spoken Idaho ambassador who schmoozes prospective 
transplants with country-club golf rounds and cocktails by the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 But he tries not to portray a move to Idaho as the stairway to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a financial and cultural gamble," he says. "People shouldn't come here 
expecting to make a killing with some downtown frozen yogurt shop. Because they 
won't." 
</P>
<P>
 In five years, Potter has recruited 37 companies to Kootenai County, 33 of 
those from Southern California -- including several small firms from the San 
Fernando Valley, such as U. S. Products from Agoura and the Wilkinson Co. of 
Westlake Village. In all, he has created 2,000 new jobs for local residents as 
well as relocating a handful of workers from places like Anaheim, Reseda and 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his converts are Ron Prior and Susan Harris, who relocated their North 
Hollywood wheelchair manufacturing firm to Coeur d'Alene. They prefer the 
Northwest's cooler climate. It's the residents who are too chilly for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the cop who they say pulled them over because of their California license 
plates. Or the teen-ager who heckled Susan in a supermarket. "I told him to 
back off," she recalled, "that we had brought a factory and jobs to this place. 
He just shriveled up."

 Susan Harris, a part-time belly-dance instructor, said life in Idaho has shown

 "No hot tub here," Nick Teets says. "We left those trappings behind. We're 
Idahoans now."
