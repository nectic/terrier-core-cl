IRVING'S BACK; THIS TIME OUT, 'GARP'S' CREATOR TAKES THE FEVERISH SPRAWL OF HIS 
STORY-TELLING TO EVEN BROADER CANVAS: INDIA, AND THE CIRCUS.; A SON OF THE

 No, there aren't any bears or wrestlers in John Irving's eighth novel, but 
even without those signature marks of his early work, his fans will feel at 
home here. His countryless characters don't, though. This book has orphans and 
doctors and writers, a whole circus full of animals, irony and sexual ambiguity 
galore. It has humor. It has violence. It has Irving's usual crowded, 
Dickensian canvas and, if not World War II itself, the moral equivalent. 
</P>
<P>
 For Irving is a moralist. This is clear now, though it wasn't always. Perhaps 
the times were to blame. When he first came on the scene, most other young 
writers, even the angry ones, were celebrating what had been considered deviant 
behavior. Irving, with his strongly original voice, his love of the grotesque 
and a sexual frankness equal to any, could easily be mistaken for just another 
celebrant. 
</P>
<P>
 His debut, "Setting Free the Bears" (1969), begins with two Viennese students 
roaring off into the countryside on their motorcycles. They could be the madcap 
heroes of a Jack Kerouac or a Tom Robbins story -- with one difference: This is 
Europe, not America. About halfway through, something much darker and heavier 
seeps into the novel. It's Austria's Nazi past; it's the three-way fratricide 
in neighboring Yugoslavia that set the stage for that former country's current 
bloodletting. 
</P>
<P>
 World War II casts a lighter shadow over Irving's second novel, "The 
Water-Method Man" (1972), but it returns with a vengeance in "The 158-Pound 
Marriage" (1974). In retrospect, this seems the thinnest and meanest of his 
books. Its wife-swapping American academics lack seriousness, and Irving lets 
his contempt for them show. The hack-novelist narrator significantly 
misunderstands his wife, an Austrian who, as a girl in 1945, hid from the 
invading Red Army in the hollowed-out carcass of a cow; his fiction even fails 
-- a low blow -- to make much money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The World According to Garp" (1978) was Irving's breakthrough novel. One 
reason is that it features his first truly admirable hero. T. S. Garp, gifted 
writer, obsessively loving father, advocate of the strenuously responsible 
life, earns a respect from his creator that balances Irving's disdain for some 
of the other characters. This is essential. A Solzhenitsyn can rail all he 
likes at Soviet tyranny, but a moralist in a free country can't get by on 
disdain alone; he needs a vision of goodness if he isn't to sound like a 
party-pooper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Garp" also was the novel in which Irving let himself go. It's bigger, zanier, 
more complex and more daring than its predecessors. Twenty years ago, while he 
was writing it, I attended some workshop classes Irving taught at the 
University of Iowa. I remember him saying how much he preferred the energy and 
comic expansiveness of Dickens to the modern ideal of the tight, pared-down, 
"well-made" novel. To the credo "less is more," Irving replied: "More is more." 
</P>
<P>
 From "The Hotel New Hampshire" (1981) on, Irving has given us more. But the 
problem of morality remained. He couldn't write every novel about someone as 
close to him as Garp -- yet he couldn't stop expressing his dislike of the 
lazy, the slipshod, the cowardly, the negligent, the inauthentic, the cruel. 
Irving is no conservative: He opposed the Vietnam War, supports gays and 
abortion rights, and if he sometimes baits feminists -- such as the Ellen 
Jamesians of "Garp" -- he takes them seriously. His is a thoughtful and 
individual code -- but it's a stern one. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickens was a moralist too, of course, but his geniality offset the fury of 
his attacks on society. Irving is not genial. "The Cider House Rules" (1985) 
not only imitates the form of a Victorian novel, it may be the most Victorian 
novel of our times. The dire consequences of making whoopee are shown in such 
depressing detail that after you read it you vow never to fondle another human 
being -- illicitly, at least -- ever again. It was a prophetic book, in a way: 
a novel for the age of AIDS, though AIDS doesn't appear in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Irving's second breakthrough was "A Prayer for Owen Meany" (1989). Owen is a 
Christ figure; Irving offers us Christianity not as dogma but as possibility -- 
as a conduit for goodness, a peg for morality to hang its hat on, a way to find 
meaning in a mysterious and violent world. It also helps explain Irving's 
treatment of violence, which has puzzled and disturbed some readers -- not so 
much the amount of violence as the random way it strikes characters of all ages 
and social conditions. Like World War II, it represents the underlying 
seriousness of life that can't be evaded by moving to a different ZIP code; 
it's God's own arbitrary lightning. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Son of the Circus" widens this religious bridgehead and gives Irving's 
talents new room to maneuver. Why go to all the trouble of setting a 633-page 
novel in India? Because India, with its opulence and poverty, its child 
laborers and prostitutes, its caste system, its leftover flourishes of the 
British Raj, is the most Victorian of modern countries. Its teeming background 
makes Irving's convoluted plot seem natural; its obdurate foreignness let him 
research all the facts he wanted without risk of slipping into ordinary 
realism. Dickens' stories, according to his contemporary John Ruskin, take 
place in "a circle of staged fire"; Irving, too, gives us worlds that are 
strictly his own. 
</P>
<P>
 The hero, Dr. Farrokh Daruwalla, is a 59-year-old neurosurgeon who was born in 
India, has a Viennese wife and lives in Canada. He returns periodically to 
Bombay to take blood samples from dwarf circus clowns -- ostensibly for a 
genetic study of dwarfism, but in fact because Indian circuses and Bombay's 
elite Duckworth Club are the only places on Earth where he feels at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Then an elderly golfer is murdered at the Duckworth Club. A note found on his 
body threatens Daruwalla's adopted son, John, a Hindi movie star notorious for 
playing a sneering policeman, Inspector Dhar. The Dhar films -- for which 
Daruwalla secretly writes the screenplays -- have offended many people in 
Bombay, but it soon becomes clear that the murderer is a serial killer, the 
bodies of whose first two victims Daruwalla examined in Goa some 20 years 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, John's twin brother, Martin Mills, arrives in Bombay as a Catholic 
missionary. Separated at birth by their American actress mother -- the old 
Irving spleen returns whenever he writes about Hollywood types -- they are 
unaware of each other's existence. Like John Wheelwright, the narrator of "Owen 
Meany," he is a virgin; he is a holy fool, always bleeding from some mishap or 
other, who believes in doing good and won't let the immensity of India's 
problems stand in his way. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a lot going on in Irving's expertly dovetailed and foreshadowed 
story. There is the effort by Daruwalla, John and a real police inspector, 
Patel, to trap the killer; there is Daruwalla's search for a home, for a faith 
-- his Anglicanism is wavering -- and for an artistic vocation; the twins' 
encounter with each other and with the truth about their parents; and nearly 
everybody's fumbling over sexual identity (the possible choices in India are 
more numerous than here, it appears);; and there is an attempt to do some 
specific good by getting two children -- a lame beggar and a prostitute -- jobs 
in a circus. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Son of the Circus" offers a satisfying mix of evil and goodness pursued in 
different ways -- Daruwalla quietly, Mills spectacularly, Patel coolly, 
professionally. It debunks both easy hope and easy cynicism. Unlike most 
popular novelists, Irving knows how much -- and how little -- to make of a 
serial killer. "There would never be a satisfactory motive for such hatred," 
Patel thinks. "(The killer's) real crime was that he didn't have sufficient 
justification for his actions. Something about (him) would remain uncaptured." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, this is a three-ringer of a novel: lions, chimps, elephants, vultures, 
acrobats, dwarfs, transsexuals, "eunuch-transvestites"; slapstick, smoke and 
sequins; miracles real and bogus; art intertwining with life; AIDS, drug 
dealing and mutilation; heartache and heroism; enough faith for the lame boy to 
try "skywalking" upside down across a tent roof 80 feet above ground. It's no 
wonder Irving chose to write about circuses, because they turn out to be the 
perfect metaphor for his books: Under the Big Top, more always is more.

AN INSIDER'S EAR; GREG SARRIS CAPTURES THE COMPLEXITY OF BOTH HIS FICTIONAL AND

<P>
 Anthropologists generally agree that before the arrival of Europeans, 
California, as now, was the most heavily populated area of America north of the 
Rio Grande. There was no single dominant Native American nation -- no League of 
the Iroquois or Huron Confederacy -- but rather a mosaic of distinct and 
coexistent small cultures, each with its own language and tradition, religion 
and cosmology. From the Yurok in the north, whose social and economic systems 
were intricately entwined, to the tiny bands of kin-based bands in the south, 
indigenous California societies were as diverse as they were numerous, as 
creatively adaptive to their particular environments as they were artistically 
and philosophically experimental. Viewed collectively, they constitute a 
marvelous microcosm for the wide range of human possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last four centuries their numbers have been decimated. Tens of 
thousands perished from the Old World diseases contracted at Spanish missions; 
countless others, especially those unfortunate enough to live near the gold 
fields, were hunted down for sport. A few men and women became famous, like 
Ishi, for being the last representatives of their cultures, but a great portion 
of those who managed to survive became virtually invisible, dwarfed by booming 
Anglo cities, relegated to the role of migrant farm laborers in huge 
agribusinesses. Dwelling as they do on small, remote reservations and 
rancherias, outside access to their contemporary stories has been limited to 
the stuff of dry doctoral dissertations and scholarly articles. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 In among the most dramatic one-two literary genre punches in recent memory 
(Toni Morrison's simultaneous 1992 publication of "Jazz" and "Playing in the 
Dark" comes to mind), Greg Sarris, a professor of English at UCLA and himself a 
mixture of California ethnicities (Filipino, Jewish, Miwok), has written a 
dazzling pair of books, one superb fiction, the other a mesmerizing interplay 
of biography and autobiography. Read individually, each is a spotlight trained 
on the complexity, sadness, humor and strength of modern Pomo people; read in 
tandem, they vault Sarris' subjects -- and the author himself -- into 
brilliant, enduring relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grand Avenue" is a thematically linked collection of 10 stories, each one 
complete and startling in itself, that moves back and forward in time as it 
gives eloquent and searing voice to the interacting Pomo, Portuguese, and 
African American communities of Santa Rosa in Northern California. In a vivid 
blend of street-smart toughness and traditional spirituality, we hear the 
varying perspectives of men and women, old and young, on the ways that poverty 
disrupts relationships, does violence to every social institution, forges an 
anger that, unchecked, can erode even the impulse of kindness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grand Avenue" is a gritty, power-filled book, unsparing and unapologetic. 
Sarris has too much respect for his characters to feel sorry for them, but is 
too sympathetic to the grim and inexorable realities of their situations to be 
dispassionate. It is a book to read once for story, a second time to better 
understand how the pieces perfectly fit together and illuminate each other, a 
third time for the sheer pleasure of fine writing. "Grand Avenue" is not only 
one of the very best works of fiction by and about Native Americans, it's one 
of the most important imaginative books of the year, period. 
</P>
<P>
 Listen, for instance, to a young girl just moved to unexpected violence 
describe the staged scene when the police respond to a report of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at Justine. She was lifting a neat piece of chocolate cake to her 
mouth with a plastic fork. Her I'd have to reckon with on account I upset her 
show. I looked at mom and the boys. They was eating cake, too. Auntie was still 
talking, painting that picture of us not capable of nothing. I seen the cops 
looking at the table while she talked. I seen what they seen, what Auntie was 
saying. But I seen more. I seen everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Or a mother, dealing with the fact of her daughter's terminal diagnosis: "I 
took myself to the library, read books, learned so much about the disease I 
came to speak its language, which is a hollow tongue of numbers and strange 
words. That's why Doctor Kriesel goes on with me about counts and cells. But I 
moved beyond her. I read about Laetrile, coffee enemas, diets of brown rice and 
sprouts, support groups. None of which I had time or money for. Visualization 
seemed the ticket. It's free for the effort. Picture the body healthy. See 
flowers and things. Green is a good color." 
</P>
<P>
 Where, we wonder, does Sarris find this acute insider's ear, so precise in its 
cadence? The answer -- that he is a master listener -- is amply provided in his 
simultaneously published, equally amazing nonfiction work. Ostensibly the "as 
told to" biography of the eponymous late, world-renowned Pomo basket weaver, 
"Mabel McKay" is an honest, heartfelt testament comparable in its authenticity 
and grace to such standard texts as Paul Radin's "Crashing Thunder" and, 
especially, to Nancy Lurie's "Mountain Wolf Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Mabel McKay is a character in every sense of the term: wise, iconoclastic, 
demanding, a self-conscious author to the story of her own life. Born in a Pomo 
community and raised by her very traditional grandmother, she held a variety of 
jobs, from Charleston dancer in a carnival to university lecturer on native 
California crafts. Through it all, however, she was primarily shaped and 
informed by the Dream -- her vocation as a medicine woman and healer. 
</P>
<P>
 She chose astutely in selecting Greg Sarris as her chronicler, picking him out 
first as a confused young boy in Santa Rosa and then maintaining close contact 
as he went to university and became an academic. One has the sense that she 
kept him grounded, taught him sense while he learned facts, and indeed Sarris 
takes the great risk of relating his own unfolding journey in counterpart to 
recounting Mabel's -- a decision that enriches and personalizes the whole. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mabel McKay is undeniably an individual like no other, her experience is 
emblematic of the transition of her own and similar tribes. She bridges chasms 
of paradox and technology, of intuitive and science-based methods of 
understanding, with the easy aplomb of a person secure in her own identity and 
capable of absorbing without being absorbed by the disparate events of her 
experience. She is confident, funny, domineering and indelible, an 
internationally acclaimed designer of exquisite feather baskets who still 
toiled almost every day in a cannery. She is a worker of miracles who is 
practical enough to prescribe calamine lotion for poison ivy. She's the 
irreverent, revered elder, the preserver and expander of culture, the heart and 
the soul of the modern Native American dynamic. 
</P>
<P>
 To say that Greg Sarris does Mabel McKay justice is to say a great deal. He 
renders her story with respect and candor in a novelist's prose. She comes to 
life in all her complexity, a woman as compelling and full-bodied as any of the 
fictional creations of "Grand Avenue" -- a book, I'd bet, she'd display on her 
kitchen table, to brag about.

RICHARD EDER: A SUMMER OF TRANSFORMATIONS; SHELTER: BY JAYNE ANNE PHILLIPS 
(HOUGHTON MIFFLIN/SEYMOUR LAWRENCE: $21.95; 279 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The forest is all around us and we're like a country inside it," Alma Swenson 
writes home from her Girl Guides summer in the West Virginia mountains. Her 
older sister, Lenny, tells herself: "Nothing from home belonged here; home 
would take it all away." 
</P>
<P>
 Camp Shelter is, among other things, a camp. It has ramshackle wooden cabins 
and canvas tents, morning river-fogs and stupefying noonday heat, mosquitoes 
and no-see-ums, campfires, hikes, swimming in a muddy pond, lectures from the 
director about the Communist threat and the importance of table conversation, 
and reassuringly glutinous meals. It is a place of homesickness and 
emancipation from home; of docile little girls with nighttime fears, and itchy 
adolescents whose fears are indistinguishable from their inchoate desires. 
</P>
<P>
 Jayne Anne Phillips's powerful novel, set in the early 1960s, gets these 
things absolutely right, in a prose so pungent and particular that a reader 
feels the heat, fogs and insect-bites, as well as a summer camp's mix of 
sensory fullness and lonely voids. It wins our presence -- it all but makes us 
a vulnerable 12 years old -- and it needs to, because it will ask a great deal 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, Phillips's theme is the transition between childhood and 
adolescence. She writes it as a legendary quest; a passage of exploits through 
dragons, demons and dangerous enchantments, both within and without. Camp is 
J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth: the place of questing. It is where children, 
like Arthurian knights, leave the protection and constraint of what is crowded 
and familiar to embark on what is solitary and strange. 
</P>
<P>
 The questing children in "Shelter," who range from 12 to 16, are beset by 
out-sized forces in the persons of two deranged men; one a devil and the other 
a kind of angel. The children's involvement in the pair's deadly struggle wins 
for them a quest's transformation. It is a somber ordeal but -- unlike the 
muffled traumas of childhood -- an active one. By the end of the book they will 
begin to be free, in different ways, from their subjection to the dreams and 
nightmares they have brought, dangerously bottled up, from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shelter" moves, sometimes bewilderingly, between a lyrically perceptive 
psychological realism and a gothic primal savagery. It is set out as individual 
voices that converge. There are Lenny and her best friend, Cap, seniors in 
their mid-teens and lodged in a tent at the top of the hill. The camp is a 
visible progression: the older the campers, the higher up they are, the 
farthest from camp control and protection, and the greater the rigors they put 
up with. Here as elsewhere, Phillips sets up a powerful symbolism that works so 
well that we sense but barely see it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenny, the central figure and the one who will be at greatest risk, is quick, 
nervy and eager -- still unconsciously -- for life. She will get a preliminary 
taste of it in a midnight encounter at the pond with a young lifeguard, an 
erotic passage that is both encouraged and cut short by Cap, who uses Lenny as 
a surrogate for her own hesitant urges. The relationship between the two girls, 
a partly sensual comradeship before the mysteries that lie ahead, is drawn 
subtly and fiercely. 
</P>
<P>
 The other pair of campers is Alma, Lenny's younger sister, and her best 
friend, Delia. At 12, a girl is still easily a hero -- a general, a president, 
a great medical pioneer -- and Alma has a heroic mission. It is to protect 
Delia, heavily traumatized by the recent drowning of her father. The death is 
ambiguous -- he drove off a bridge -- and it leads back to the shadows that all 
four girls will, in the course of the book, struggle away from. 
</P>
<P>
 Cap bears the dry solitude of a rich child whose parents live apart and in 
mutual contempt. Alma's and Lenny's mother was having an affair with Delia's 
father, and she used and abused Alma as her confidante. Lenny is shadowed by 
ambiguous images of a different kind of abuse by her father. The ambiguity, 
though it is a refusal to simplify and though it contributes to the 
hallucinatory force of Lenny's quest, has its drawbacks. An author doing 
something as difficult as Phillips does, and mostly brilliantly, balances depth 
against movement. The deep folds of Lenny's consciousness lead to moments of 
stasis -- dispelled in the book's choking climax -- and puzzlement for the 
reader. 
</P>
<P>
 Into the camp setting, so poignantly rendered on its underside and so 
beautifully drawn in its lively externals -- Mrs. Thompson-Warner, camp 
director and vigilant sentinel against communism and low manners, is the 
cartoon bubble that an intense book needs for oxygen relief -- the dragons 
enter. They exude the flames of the darkest and most contorted characters of 
William Faulkner or Flannery O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
 One is Carmody, a violent, vacant degenerate who has come out of jail to prey 
upon his sturdy wife, the camp cook. She takes his abuse as if it were simply 
another cross; she is a woman both religious and open, with a bent for 
lightness and the provision of comfort. For the campers this translates as 
prodigiously comforting meals; for her elfin 10-year-old, Buddy, it is an 
instilled openness to the magical possibilities of the woods and fields he 
roams, Puck-like. A tutelary figure, whose significance grows steadily, he is 
untouched by the loathsome sexual acts his father requires him to perform. He 
may, however, perish from them. 
</P>
<P>
 But a primal drama requires an angel as well as a devil. It is risky enough 
for Phillips to introduce such a drama into the lives of her campers, and 
astonishing that she succeeds in getting it to work convincingly upon them. 
Even riskier is the angelic figure she chooses. 
</P>
<P>
 Parson, a former cell-mate of Carmody's who follows him to Camp Shelter, is a 
man possessed. He sees ghosts, preaches visions, does snake magic and fights 
titanic battles against the Devil and those he believes the Devil owns. His 
internal monologues are violent memories and mystical diatribes and, as he 
spies on the campers, Phillips leads us to believe he is another monster. When 
he encounters Lenny alone, and we hear of her lying motionless on the ground 
afterward, we are certain it is another horror. Instead -- Phillips's 
purposeful but difficult ambiguity is in play -- it is some kind of redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in a mode that blurs the hallucinatory with the supernatural, Parson 
has come to prevent horrors. He will end up saving Buddy from Carmody and 
empowering the campers to fight Carmody for Lenny. It would not be right to 
reveal the details of the battles; they manage to be both mythical and 
endearingly natural. After the final battle, Lenny, Cap, Alma and Delia and the 
other campers who help them, will be transformed by what they have been 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 Transformation, for Phillips, is the terror, magic and ordeal of what happens 
year by year as we grow out of childhood. She has set her remarkable novel at 
the mysterious crossroads where old safety, with its unexplained shadows, 
becomes more lethal than new danger, with its fearsome ventures.

 "What does it mean to read the Bible as a contemporary woman?" The question, 
put to 28 Jewish and Christian women writers, has borne fruit in a sparkling 
collection of literary essays on the Bible, the first ever to be written 
exclusively by women. Focusing on the Hebrew Bible (Tanach for Jewish readers, 
Old Testament for Christians), the book's approach is moderately feminist and 
resolutely anti-dogmatic; co-editors Christina Buchmann and Celina Spiegel 
confess that "it is only recently that many of us have come to find the Bible 
interesting , no longer experiencing its claims to authority as so overwhelming 
as to demand mere assent and respectful attention." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bible is more than just interesting, however, for the 28 contributors to 
this book, among whom are such distinguished writers as Cynthia Ozick, Louise 
Erdrich and Ursula Le Guin. These women writers find the Bible, if not 
overwhelming in its authority, thoroughly captivating in its appeal to our 
imagination and our moral sense. 
</P>
<P>
 So it should be. Throughout the centuries, women in predominantly Jewish and 
Christian societies have found themselves in the Bible as in no other book -- 
it has been the chief literary vehicle not only for their subordination to men 
but also for their self-discovery and flourishing as women. It is impossible to 
overestimate the influence of the Bible on our cultural heritage and our 
multiple identities. Women or men, we must come to terms with the Bible, if we 
wish to understand ourselves. For many of us, this requires a work of critical 
reclamation, beyond simply brushing the cobwebs off the old book. 
</P>
<P>
 This work of reclamation is attempted by the present volume. Though not 
comprehensive, it succeeds brilliantly in representing the full spectrum of 
feminist and feminine ways to read the Bible. The sense of outrage at 
injustices done to women in the name of the Bible is softened -- without being 
silenced -- by the presence of voices that remain loyal to biblical traditions. 
In contrast to many recent works of feminist theology, "Out of the Garden" is 
not sicklied over by resentment at male privilege; as a result, it exudes 
confidence and respect for women's experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Eve, it is often said, has gotten a bad rap. Created as an afterthought, she 
found herself blamed for all the afflictions that followed upon the first 
couple's exile from the Garden. Yet Barbara Grizzuti Harrison points out that 
it was Eve's disobedience (her "happy fault," as the Christian liturgy for the 
Easter Vigil puts it) that gave us our world, and implanted in us the restless 
yearning for heaven from which all creativity flows. 
</P>
<P>
 Lot's wife has been similarly maligned. For her vain, typically female, 
curiosity she was turned into a pillar of salt. Rebecca Goldstein takes a 
second look, drawing upon Talmudic midrashim lovingly collected for her by her 
own father, to create a portrait of Lot's wife as a figure of maternal 
solicitude, willing to share the plight of the daughters she had left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rabbinic tradition of midrashic storytelling is happily exploited by 
several entries, occasionally with humorous results. Norma Rosen, who 
understands midrash as "unbridled and unintimidated imagination," offers an 
example worthy of Harlequin Romances, in her midrash on Rebekah. The young 
bride discovers that she has married into a dysfunctional family. Husband Isaac 
is impotent because of a post-traumatic stress disorder that dates back to the 
time when he was nearly sacrificed by his theopathic father; he suffers 
recurrent nightmares of Abraham coming after him with a knife. Desperate to 
overcome the curse of barrenness, Rebekah arranges for a tryst with "brawny 
Ishmael." Just in time, Isaac recovers his manhood, and Rebekah finally gets to 
be the mother of Jacob (Israel) and Esau (who is brawny like Ishmael). 
</P>
<P>
 Yet perhaps these gothic palpitations are not so far off the mark; the Bible 
is full of stories of sexual intrigue, murderous sibling rivalry, and sudden 
reversals of fortune. How odd, that the designs of Providence should so often 
be advanced by scheming subterfuge and trickster-like hoax. Jacob deceives his 
father in order to steal the inheritance from firstborn son Esau; in turn, 
Jacob's father-in-law tricks the young upstart into taking his firstborn 
daughter Leah as the unwanted prize for seven years' toil. From such strange 
twists and turns of fortune, Israel's destiny is forged. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, several authors point out, it is the male hero whose metamorphoses 
are of chief concern to biblical authors; female characters -- even strong ones 
such as Rebekah, Rachel, Hannah and Esther -- serve primarily as the foil for 
their men. Comparative literature scholar Ilana Pardes notes, "With the 
exception of Eve, we have no scene that depicts the birth of the heroine, let 
alone rebirth. The biblical woman appears on stage only when she is 
marriageable, and her stay there is determined, generally speaking, by the 
impact of her maternal position on the status of her (favorite) son." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the prophetic tradition keeps these biblical women before our 
eyes as witnesses for all who are dispossessed. Rachel weeps for her children, 
as long as any children need to be wept for. As Pardes puts it, "In Jeremiah's 
famous prophecy Rachel is allowed to transcend time. Her voice rises from the 
dead to cry on behalf of the exiled." 
</P>
<P>
 The volume offers several examples of feminist didactic preaching, exegesis 
and allegory, of uneven quality. Biblical scholar Phyllis Trible skillfully 
retells the Elijah and Jezebel story from a Phoenician's perspective, to show 
that these two fiery prophets of competing Gods are mirror images of each 
other. Indeed, they need each other. Poet Alicia Ostriker's entry, "The Nursing 
Father," drawn from her longer work "The Nakedness of the Fathers," blends 
midrash with personal confession in order to discover in the Exodus narrative a 
mythic charter for women's emancipation; this would make wonderful material for 
a Passover celebration. For Patricia Williams, the book of Exodus mirrors her 
experience as a single, black, 40-plus adoptive mother; out of this experience, 
illuminated by the Bible, comes her moving plea for a communal moral awakening 
that would make abortion not illegal but unnecessary. June Jordan finds in the 
story of Ruth and Naomi a precedent for the community of women friends who 
supported her through her ordeal with breast cancer. Several essays champion 
the cause of neglected anti-heroines, like Vashti in the book of Esther or 
Hagar in Genesis. 
</P>
<P>
 British novelist Fay Weldon makes the story of Samson and Delilah the occasion 
for the one vulgar essay in the book -- a wildly exaggerated diatribe against 
the Bible, Christianity and, in passing, Islam, all of which she construes as 
viciously and systematically anti-woman. To balance the record, in the book's 
best essay, Cynthia Ozick characterizes the religion of ancient Israel as the 
matrix for the idea of "personhood" on which feminism itself depends. The 
feminist spirituality movement overlooks this, in its eagerness to celebrate 
the memory of archaic goddess-centered traditions in which, it is imagined, 
women flourished. Yet, as Ozick points out, it was ancient Judaism -- with its 
astonishing teaching that human beings are created in the divine image and 
likeness -- that first gave women a basis for claiming the freedom and dignity 
that feminism rightfully demands for them. The story of Hannah illustrates 
this: she offers her own prayers in Temple, thus marking the radical shift from 
religion centered on the public sacrificial cult to religion centered on more 
intimate ways of relating to God; moreover, her husband encourages her to 
believe in her own worth, rather than despair because of barrenness. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this principle of a woman's intrinsic worth before God any less valid 
because a man voices it? Ozick, a "classical" feminist, calls for Jewish 
feminists to feed their moral imagination on the sacral humanism of the Torah, 
rather than the ideological humanisms (many of them virulently anti-Semitic) of 
the Enlightenment. Similarly, Kathleen Norris finds in the Benedictine 
tradition of living out of the Psalms, abundant resources for the genuine 
fulfillment of women; and Louise Erdrich discerns a delicate yet resilient 
filament of hope in the resigned wisdom of Ecclesiastes. 
</P>
<P>
 These are essays of considerable literary erudition and sophistication that 
re-conceive what it means to read the Bible as a woman, either by using 
feminist categories in uncommon ways or, in a few cases, by not using them at 
all. Novelist Deidre Levinson is much too interested by Saul, the 
scapegoat-king, to strain for feminist lessons. Elizabeth Swados restages the 
book of Job as a musical clown show; Job's wife gets to hit him over the head 
with a bowling pin, but otherwise her role is not significantly enhanced. The 
effect of including such essays alongside others explicitly feminist is 
refreshingly de-ghettoizing. 
</P>
<P>
 The anthology closes with an impish allegory by Ursula Le Guin, in which Eve 
gets to unname the animals. If this is Eve's proper task, then "Out of the 
Garden" performs it well, dislodging dull stereotypes to enable both women and 
men readers to see the Bible with fresh eyes.

CHILD CARE

 It is heartening to know that the idea of children as property is alive and 
well and supported by no less an august body than the ACLU ("In the Name of the 
Children," by Barry Siegel, Aug. 7). 
</P>
<P>
 The women who decide to have their children while continuing to abuse drugs 
have a constitutional right to bear their stillborn or damaged babies. They 
also have an inalienable right to have society pay for their freedom to 
exercise "control of the body and autonomy in the reproductive process." We, on 
the other hand, apparently have no right to carry out our concerns for the 
quality of life that these babies face.

 I was greatly disturbed by Siegel's "In the Name of the Children." I firmly 
believe that urine drug screening should only be completed after a specific 
consent has been obtained, as this information is probably not necessary in 
planning the care of the antepartum/postpartum patient. At the same time, 
alcohol and nicotine pose a more widespread (although less fascinating) problem 
in the obstetric population, yet tests for these substances are not routinely 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 The job of physicians and nurses is to treat the patient in a holistic manner. 
This means treating the baby and the mother. To prevent a mother from seeing 
her newborn is unconscionable. To facilitate the removal of a postpartum 
patient from a hospital for incarceration in jail is nothing short of 
malpractice.

 I applaud nurse Shirley Brown and prosecutor Charles Condon's efforts to 
protect the lives of newborn crack babies. It doesn't take a sociologist to 
figure out that child abuse starts early and is often at the hands of 
drug-addicted parents. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Lynn Paltrow, she and other ACLU attorneys are contributing to the 
demise of America. Paltrow appears to be telling the addict that drug behavior 
is tolerable. And women like Theresa Joseph, Ellen Knight and Patricia Williams 
should be governmentally sterilized. It doesn't take a genius IQ to figure out 
that if you're poor and on drugs, having a baby might not be a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 I was exposed to an alcoholic environment as a child; I grew up in urban black 
America and yet I do not feel that Knight and Williams were singled out. 
Rather, they should be grateful that someone is trying to snatch them from drug 
addiction. If the insults they endured help them turn their lives around, then 
they were well served.

 "In the Name of the Children" lists "spontaneous abortions, pre-term 
deliveries, stillbirths and underdeveloped newborns with jumpy nervous systems" 
as being the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure. We work in the genetics 
department of a large medical center and know that the list is, in fact, much 
more extensive and that it includes congenital malformations, seizures, painful 
withdrawals, mental retardation, learning disabilities and lifelong 
debilitations. Perhaps if Paltrow knew about these effects her heart would go 
out to the innocent victims her clients have damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 The rights of women to make decisions regarding their bodies should be 
protected. However, when a decision is made to carry a fetus to term, the 
mother must assume responsibility for the fetus. If we will not prosecute these 
women, perhaps we can offer their children a longer statute of limitations that 
would enable them as adults to prosecute for their lifelong debilitations, just 
as some children have prosecuted their parents for incest.

 Shame on the city of Charleston for arresting the drug-using mothers right 
after childbirth, putting the babies at a greater risk emotionally by not 
giving them a chance to bond. When I gave birth four years ago in New York, the 
mothers of crack babies visited and fed them, while being required to undergo 
treatment before taking them home. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurse Brown's efforts are noble. However, I would be scared to seek prenatal 
care if it were under threat of going to jail if I didn't. What these women 
really need is prenatal care and treatment made readily available in the first 
trimester, without threats.

<P>
 These women produced drug-addicted children at public expense and now they 
want $3 million from the public? To frame this as a reproductive rights issue 
is a red herring. They chose to carry their babies to term. Now do we taxpayers 
have a choice not to pay for their babies' drug treatments, for the special 
education and potential lifetimes of unemployment?

 I, like writer Leonce Gaiter, have a pond ("On Plastic Pond," Style, July 31). 
But I've had mine -- a disgusting oil slick that smells like a sewage-treatment 
plant -- more than four years now and still cannot keep it clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years I have been told many things by the "experts": I had too many 
fish in the pond. I scooped them out and transported them to the cemetery's 
pond, where I hope they're having a happy life. Then I was told the pond got 
too much sun, so I hung tarps over it. Now I have nice blue tarps flapping in 
the breeze. I removed the plants and treated the water with Algi-Gon. I hung 
buckets filled with cotton under the water to act as a homemade filter. Every 
two days I scooped out the slimy green cotton. Then I broke down and bought the 
expensive air filter. Do you think that did the trick? 
</P>
<P>
 One year I changed the water every month for four months. All for the pleasant 
sound of trickling water and the sight of happy goldfish. Just like Gaiter. 
Only I have the suspicion that he filled in his pond weeks ago and wrote a 
fantasy article. My husband's ready to divorce me because I refuse to give up. 
I hate that pond!

 In "The Moral Animal," Robert Wright is concerned with the nature of human 
nature. How do we shape our own lives; in fact, do we shape them at all, or are 
we driven by biological imperatives? Evolutionary psychologists consider our 
"mental organs" and their various behaviors to be products of natural selection 
-- that is, to have evolved along lines that maximize survival. Charles Darwin 
himself foresaw this application of his theory: at the close of "Origin of 
Species," which otherwise steers clear of speculations about humanity, he 
predicted that the study of psychology would eventually "be based on a new 
foundation." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, a senior editor at the New Republic, is the quintessential intelligent 
layman -- a gifted writer with a keen interest in and understanding of the 
scientific enterprise. His 1988 book, "Three Scientists and Their Gods," 
explored the revolutions wrought by sociobiology and information theory; here 
he examines, and embraces, the "new Darwinian paradigm," a worldview in which 
the gene is the prime mover. 
</P>
<P>
 The paradigm is Darwinian because its firm foundation is the theory of natural 
selection; it is new because when Darwin formulated his theory nothing whatever 
was known about the gene. It is new, too, in that its subscribers look at 
evolution from the point of view of the survival of genes rather than of 
species. In the "ancestral environment," those animals who were successful at 
the daily grind -- who successfully selected mates, say, and reared their young 
successfully -- perforce passed their genes along, and the failures did not; we 
are, in effect, mere vessels for genes. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Darwinism should not be confused with the coldblooded doctrine of 
social Darwinism, which held that the ruling class deserved to rule and the 
world's downtrodden were downtrodden because they were innately "unfit"; this 
is a democratic world view, in which we are all equally at the mercy of our 
genes. In stressing their paramountcy in the creation of the human psyche, 
Wright dispels an older paradigm, which held that our natures are chiefly 
formed by cultural and environmental influences. He supports his points with 
episodes from the life of Darwin himself, a sweet-natured Victorian who 
embodied qualities -- scrupulousness, generosity, humility -- that are thought 
to separate us from "the brutes." 
</P>
<P>
 His presentation is lucid and compelling, and only occasionally does the case 
for the genetic origin of human nature look like a stretch (as when he writes, 
"You could say that low self-esteem evolved as a way to reconcile people to 
subordinate status when reconciliation is in their genetic interest.") 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of the book is the contention that the conscience, the seat of our 
moral sense, evolved as a survival mechanism. When, for example, we feel guilt 
because we have harmed a sibling, it is because we have thereby imperiled the 
proliferation of our genes. When we feel guilt because we have harmed someone 
outside the family circle, it is because we have potentially damaged our own 
(survival-enhancing) status. Wright notes that some neo-Darwinians see the 
conscience "as the administrator of a savings account in which moral reputation 
is stored," and he entertainingly illustrates this by describing Darwin's moral 
struggle when he discovered that he might be beaten to the punch in describing 
the theory of natural selection. 
</P>
<P>
 The young unknown British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace had sent Darwin a 
paper outlining the theory in terms nearly identical to his own. This was the 
summer of 1858, and Darwin, partly because he was reluctant to offend Victorian 
sensibilities, had kept his theory quiet for two decades. And here was 
Wallace's obviously publishable paper. What to do? Guilelessly -- or at least 
with unconscious guile -- Darwin appealed to his friend Charles Lyell, the 
celebrated geologist and fellow member of the Royal Society, in a letter that 
Wright interprets in brackets: 
</P>
<P>
 "I should be extremely glad now to publish a sketch of my general views in 
about a dozen pages or so; but I cannot persuade myself that I can do so 
honorably. (Maybe you can persuade me.) Wallace says nothing about publication, 
and I enclose his letter. But as I had not intended to publish any sketch, can 
I do so honorably, because Wallace has sent me an outline of his doctrine? (Say 
yes. Say yes.) . . . Do you not think his having sent me this sketch ties my 
hands? (Say no. Say no.)" 
</P>
<P>
 Abdicating his own moral responsibility, Darwin allowed his good friends Lyell 
and J. D. Hooker, both of them scientific giants of the day, to handle the 
question of theory authorship. Without consulting Wallace, who was splashing 
around in the Malay archipelago at the time, Hooker and Lyell decided to 
introduce Wallace's paper at an important scientific meeting, along with an 
earlier sketch of the theory by Darwin and an extensive 1844 draft that Darwin 
had let Hooker see. These would, of course, establish Darwin's priority. 
Wallace, for his part, was thrilled when he heard of the attention he was 
getting. From the Tropics he wrote to his mother: 
</P>
<P>
 "I sent Mr. Darwin an essay on a subject on which he is now writing a great 
work. He showed it to Dr. Hooker and Sir Charles Lyell, who thought so highly 
of it that they immediately read it before the Linnean Society. This assures me 
the acquaintance and assistance of these eminent men on my return home." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright calls this letter "one of the most poignant passages in the history of 
science," in light of the fact that Wallace "had just been taken to the 
cleaners," and remarks that "ever since, observers have been calling the 
episode yet another example of (Darwin's) superhuman decency." In Wright's 
view, it is a much better example of the self-interested "savviness" of the 
human conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be interesting to know whether Wright suffered any pangs before the 
publication of "The Moral Animal" similar to Darwin's trepidation before the 
publication of "Origin of Species." The ideas in this thought-provoking and 
impolitic book are not likely to be any more popular with many of his 
contemporaries than Darwin's were with the Victorians. Wright points out that 
the neo-Darwinian view of human nature is even more cynical and reductive than 
that of Sigmund Freud, who believed that each of us has a potentially heroic 
ego, intermittently suborned by the subconscious mind. Evolutionary psychology 
not only does away with the Freudian excuse of civilization and its discontents 
but also denies us the hope of ever wrenching free of the history of the body. 
In the new Darwinian paradigm, the concept of truth itself is meaningless, for 
"we believe the things -- about morality, personal worth, even objective truth 
-- that lead to behaviors that get our genes into the next generation." 
</P>
<P>
 As though to lighten this bleak view of humanity, Wright suggests that once we 
recognize "the moral biases built into us by natural selection" we can correct 
them: "Go above and beyond the call of a smoothly functioning conscience; help 
those who aren't likely to help you in return, and do so when nobody's 
watching. This is one way to be a truly moral animal." 
</P>
<P>
 But is such independent behavior likely to last? Wright also concludes that 
free will is "an illusion, brought to us by evolution." Whether it is 
environment or heredity that makes us do what we do, he says, the compulsion is 
effected biochemically. We need to believe ourselves capable of free will, 
however, and so we do -- since belief in any sort of determinism, "by eroding 
blame, threatens society's moral fiber." This part of Wright's argument is the 
most troubling, and it is also the weakest: Qualifications mount, and you get 
the sense that Wright's heart is not really in it. And indeed, in an appendix 
entitled "Frequently Asked Questions," in which such apparently non-Darwinian 
behaviors as suicide, laughter and homosexuality are discussed, Wright notes 
(about people who decide not to have children, thus thwarting the propagational 
imperative) that "we can choose to short-circuit the ultimate goals that 
natural selection 'intended' us to pursue." 
</P>
<P>
 There are instances of the action of conscience that the new Darwinian 
paradigm does not cover. While natural selection does appear to have given us 
the equipment, it was fashioned, as Wright emphasizes, in the "ancestral 
environment," not in the present one. Our mental organs may be the creation of 
our genes, but our thoughts are still our own.

DISNEY TAKES 'ALADDIN' ON ANOTHER MAGIC RIDE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 First "Aladdin" wowed 'em at the box office. Then those fesity residents of 
Agrabah flew straight to video with the sequel "Return to Jafar." Now Aladdin, 
Jasmine, Iago et al are ridin' their magic carpet onto the small screen with 
"Disney's Aladdin: The Series," airing on both KCAL and CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 (Sixty-five shows are slated for KCAL's weekday lineup in the 4:30 p.m. time 
slot. Thirteen different shows will be broadcast on CBS' Saturday mornings 
beginning Sept. 17.) 
</P>
<P>
 Taking over voice duties for movie Genie Robin Williams is prolific actor Dan 
Castellaneta (Homer Simpson). Returning from the movie and video as the 
"selfish and self-serving" parrot Iago is Gilbert Gottfried ("Beverly Hills Cop 
2"). Series regulars Scott Weinger ("Full House") plays Aladdin, with Linda 
Larkin voicing Jasmine. 
</P>
<P>
 Castellaneta says he was influenced by Williams' "high energy and fast 
talking" from the movie, but "Genie also morphs into other things and does 
other voices. I'd be lying to say that I didn't get some of the patterns down, 
but I'm not good at doing Robin Williams' voice, so it started with him, but 
something else came out." 
</P>
<P>
 The TV series will serve up some other familiar voices as well: Jason 
Alexander ("Seinfeld"), James Avery ("Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"), Jonathan 
Brandis ("seaQuest DSV"), Bebe Neuwirth ("Cheers"), Michael Jeter ("Evening 
Shade"), Carol Kane ("Addams Family Values"), Keith David ("Platoon"), Tim 
Curry ("Rocky Horror Picture Show"), Nancy Cartwright ("The Simpsons"), Matt 
Frewer ("Doctor, Doctor"), Ron Perlman (TV's "Beauty and the Beast"), Malcolm 
McDowell ("A Clockwork Orange"), Rene Aberjonois ("Star Trek: Deep Space 
Nine"), rapper/actor Ton Loc ("Posse") and "Just Say Julie" Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Castellaneta likes "that this is a fantasy-adventure show, not one of the many 
karate 'kilbot' animated shows." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Gottfried, he's confident he may have a part in the show's possible 
success: "Everything that was fun in the movie is in the series. It's got 
adventure and romance and comedy . . . and most importantly, an obnoxious 
parrot!" N.F. MENDOZA

 NOT ALL OF US ARE SAINTS: A Doctor's Journey with the Poor by David Hilfiker 
M.D. (Hill & Wang: $23; 232 pp.) "I came to the inner city (to practice 
medicine) in part because I believed that poverty in our country was more a 
matter of injustice than personal characteristics or bad luck, . . . I came, in 
other words, with hope: If poverty were the result of oppression, then even a 
small group of affluent people could make a difference." This belief brought 
Dr. David Hilfiker from a small family practice clinic in rural Minnesota to 
the ghettos of Washington, where he worked and eventually lived in Christ 
House, a medical recovery shelter for homeless men. "Not All of Us Are Saints" 
is an account not only of his experience but also a plea for greater 
understanding of the complex problems facing poor and homeless Americans. 
Hilfiker's writing is amazingly honest. He never flinches from unearthing his 
own motivations even when the result is less than flattering. One patient in 
particular, a mentally deficient alcoholic man with severe health problems, 
provokes Hilfiker to examine prejudices -- both his own and society's. "When a 
middle-class black person or a white person of any class comes into the office, 
I pay more attention. I pay a different kind of attention. Perhaps it is simply 
that in these other patients I can see myself or someone closer to me." This is 
a difficult thing for many people to admit, let alone someone who is committed 
to helping low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
 Where "Not All of Us Are Saints" falters a bit is in scenes with dialogue and 
description. Hilfiker's strength clearly lies in his passionate exploration of 
our culture and of his own heart, since too often the writing becomes stilted 
when actual people are involved. This doesn't, however, detract much from what 
is ultimately a brave and caring look at some of the terrible problems in 
health care today.

 THE WORLD OF DONALD EVANS by Willy Eisenhart (Abbeville Press: $19.95 ; 176 
pp.) First published in 1980 and long out of print, this unique book is as 
delicate and delightful as its cult reputation would have you believe.Evans, 
who died in an Amsterdam fire at age 31, was an American artist who used 
watercolors to create thousands of individual stamps for dozens of imaginary 
countries. Putting it that plainly, however, does no justice to the magical 
places and images Evans created. Barcentrum, named for a friendly Amsterdam 
cafe, featured his favorite drinks, while the Amis and Amants (Friends and 
Lovers) archipelago had islands "stretching from the little Premiers Amours 
(Puppy Love) toward distant L'Amour Perdu (Lost Love)." Both witty and 
delicate, Evans' stamps made playful use of the artist's philatelic knowledge: 
When the state of Mangiare was taken over by enemy forces, the invaders' stamps 
used a traditional overprint with a wacky name, "Zone Antipaste." Painted with 
a marvelous specificity, Evans' stamps create a calm and tranquil world we 
would give anything to visit, or even live in. "Stamps are terrifically rich," 
is how Evans explained his passion. Especially when someone of imagination and 
invention is doing the designing. Kenneth Turan

 BUNNY, BUNNY: Gilda Radner, A Sort of Love Story by Alan Zweibel (Villard: 
$14.95; 208 pp.) Writer Alan Zweibel and comic actress Gilda Radner were best 
friends for more than a decade before Radner died of cancer in 1989.Three years 
later, Zweibel, still trying to come to terms with his grief, wrote "Bunny, 
Bunny," a witty, moving tribute to his old friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with their first words to each other on the set of "Saturday Night 
Live" in 1975, "Bunny Bunny" chronicles a complex and loving relationship that 
almost, but never quite, turned into romance. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the trip to the Bahamas where, in a particularly funny scene, Radner 
calls hotel security because Zweibel is pounding on her door in the middle of 
the night trying to retrieve his gambling winnings that he has earlier made her 
promise to hold for him at all costs. In another section Radner calls Zweibel 
to come backstage two minutes before she is to go on for her one-woman show. 
"'I'm happy for you,"' she says. "'I was peering out at you guys and noticed 
that Robin (Zweibel's girlfriend) never looked prettier and that you never 
looked whiter and I just knew you were engaged." 
</P>
<P>
 Zweibel's ambitious format -- the book is written entirely in dialogue -- has 
its strengths and weaknesses. Radner's wonderful sense of humor, kindness and 
intelligence shines through on every page without ever being weighed down by 
the sentimentality that sometimes comes with description. Also, the unadorned, 
short lines of speech give the whole piece a poetic simplicity that adds 
emotional impact. However, there are many instances in which people say 
unrealistic things to explain the action around them. It's stilted. This seems 
forgivable though in an otherwise engaging book.

 THE ANCESTOR GAME by Alex Miller (Graywolf: $24; 302 pp.) Some novels are like 
palm trees: They rise straight up in one clear direction and have a big pay-off 
at the top.Alex Miller's "The Ancestor Game," is like an ancient banyan tree 
with limbs shooting out sideways from unexpected places. Each of these limbs 
then forms new growth, so that the overall effect is oddly shaped, and 
enigmatic. Winner of Australia's top literary prize, The Miles Franklin Award 
for Fiction, "The Ancestor Game" covers the history of three main characters, 
Steven, Lang Tzu, and Gertrude. Moving, often without warning, across time and 
continents, the three intertwined lives are illuminated through the generations 
of people preceding them. What exactly makes an identity, a homeland, and an 
artist seems to be the questions Miller is exploring. The novel, at its best, 
is unusual and oddly compelling. Here is a description of someone bowing: "He 
did not kowtow in the servile oriental manner, which must imply submission, but 
inclined his torso stiffly from the waist in meagerest salutation . . . to 
imply an elusive but incontestable cultural superiority. It was a good bow from 
such a short man and did all he required of it. It was a bow that offered 
nothing." In spite of many fascinating ideas and images, "The Ancestor Game" 
may be, for many people, a frustrating novel. Since there is no central 
through-line, the book certainly qualifies as a non-traditional narrative, yet 
often, Miller's writing lacks the muscle needed to carry a reader forward 
without story. This is only an intermittent problem, but still, it detracts 
from what might otherwise be a thoroughly engaging book.

 THE GEOGRAPHICAL CURE by Michael Parker (Scribners: $20; 287 pp.) Whether it 
is the son of a bail bondsman, a frustrated Marxist, or two runaway teen-agers, 
all the characters in Michael Parker's collection of stories are offbeat and 
very real.Set mostly in the South, these are emotionally isolated people 
struggling in different ways to make sense of the strange events that dictate 
their lives. The strongest work here is "Golden Hour," a sad, funny and 
beautifully written novella narrated by three radically different people. One 
of the best qualities of this piece is the way truly bizarre things keep 
happening -- yet the plot never feels self-conscious like so much "quirky" 
writing. Instead, the events come so naturally from the character's needs and 
relationships that it seems impossible for anything else to have transpired. 
Here is Nancy McFadden, a lonely school administrator, right before she commits 
an extreme act: "I will not die here, a tiny voice whispered. I listened as it 
repeated itself again and again until it became the very rhythm of one foot in 
front of the other, a way out." Every story in "The Geographical Cure" has its 
own vibrant heartbeat. This is a writer to watch.

 MISSISSIPPI MUD: Southern Justice and the Dixie Mafia by Edward Humes (Simon & 
Schuster: $23; 368 pp.) Murder, conspiracy, and an extremely lucrative 
personal-ad scam are the subjects of "Mississippi Mud," Edward Humes' 
fast-paced account of the 1987 double homicide of Biloxi mayoral candidate 
Margaret Sherry and her husband, Vince, a prominent lawyer.The book focuses on 
the Sherrys' oldest daughter, Lynn, who became obsessed with finding out who 
murdered her parents -- obsessed to the point of jeopardizing her own life, and 
the emotional health of her kids. Her struggle reads like a cross between a 
suspense novel and an ethnographic study of Biloxi's underworld. Humes writes 
with a staunch no-nonsense style that is, perhaps, a bit more complex than that 
of many true crime books, but stops short of the subtlety and depth that 
propels a work to rise above its genre. Lynn's character is painted in primary 
colors -- angry, grieving, determined. It's impossible not to imagine the 
mini-series. The most interesting person captured here is Kirksey Nix, a 
brilliant, amoral and darkly charismatic prison inmate whose exact role in the 
killings is never completely clear. Nix ran a successful business preying on 
lonely homosexual men who answered personal ads; he had specially coded 
computers, labyrinthine systems of cash delivery and a small army of employees 
both inside and outside of the prison. In spite of solid writing, "Mississippi 
Mud" is an engrossing, unremarkable book.

ON THE TOWN: TROUBLE IN PARADISE; ANGELENOS ON HOLIDAY FIND GETTING AWAY FROM 
IT ALL IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE 
</P>

 Sensitive and socially responsible, David and Sheila exchanged vows in the 
late '80s and, 18 months later, announced plans to divorce Los Angeles. The 
birth of their first child forced them to re-evaluate long-held concerns about 
the environment, the economy and ethnic tensions. L.A. had become too much like 
David's native New York City. When Sheila scored a job in Eugene, Ore., the 
deal was done. We wished them luck and, secretly, speculated about our own 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
 We kept in touch. But David had become so abrasively cheery that I could 
barely stomach our occasional phone chats. He and Sheila shared household and 
parenting duties while David completed his degree, something he couldn't afford 
to do when "back in ol' L.A." When I retorted, "Seen one tree, seen 'em all," 
Davide challenged me and dared us to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 On that virgin trip, David's praise proved gospel. Eugene was the deep ecology 
heartland where the organically grown and the bioengineered thrive. David and 
Sheila rubbed it in a little, extolling the squeaky-clean air, the laid-back 
traffic, the real farmers' market. Their four-bedroom hillside home had a pool, 
sauna, Jacuzzi, fireplace, two skylights and his-and-hers carport. The monthly 
note was half the rent on their two-bedroom Santa Monica apartment. No screens 
or curtains obscured tree-enshrined windows. And no one locked their doors, 
house or car, day or night. No burglars, no gangs, no street violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The region teemed with easy-livin' ex-Californians, mainly retirees. But we 
couldn't distinguish them from the natives. After 10 blissed-out days, we drove 
back to L.A., struggling to hold on to the spirit of Eugene. It dissipated by 
the time we hit Ventura and descended into the hell zone at rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, four summers later, craving to repeat our Eden-like experience, I 
phoned David. He was delighted to have us. We arrived the week of July 4th -- 
husband, son and a cooler full of sandwiches. What we didn't know was that Ol' 
Man Trouble was ahoof in tie-dye heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Having gotten his degree, David had found good-paying jobs in Eugene 
non-existent and was considering moving back to L.A. Sheila's love affair with 
her job had soured with the denial of a much-needed raise. The pair still kept 
doors and windows unlocked despite three visits from prowlers with expensive 
tastes. While the air remained squeaky-clean, local law enforcement had 
developed an uncanny appetite for issuing traffic citations. Others also 
complained. A black journalist told me "the Ku Klux Klan rules south of the 
Columbia River" and that racial incidents were hushed up. One Berkeley escapee, 
an American of Norwegian descent, bristled when describing xenophobic regional 
politics and carped about "the disparity in cultural diversity" and schools 
"straight out of Mayberry, U.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Ex-Angelenos were everywhere. After complimenting a chef, we learned he'd 
relocated from West L.A. An arts fair potter had just closed his Beverly Hills 
studio. And so it went. The Bach festival was sold out and we'd seen all the 
current film releases before leaving L.A., so there wasn't much doing except 
relaxing poolside, reading and talking. The hottest topic was the O.J. Simpson 
murder case. Eerily, Eugene seemed more an annex of L.A. than a getaway from 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a cloud-flecked sky, we joined hundreds of fun-seekers at the 25th 
annual Oregon Country Fair, "the Northwest's largest event," according to 
David. Entering an idyllic grove, we were transported to a '60s Dionysian 
love-in. Bare-breasted dryads, behorned satyrs, harlequins and hedonistic 
revelers paraded through the booths and performance stages. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, we couldn't recapture the stress-free Eugene of our past. The 
tensions we had fled reverberated around us. The festiveness seem forced, a 
throwback to a peace-love era untarnished by the specter of HIV. The resonant 
crises in Bosnia, Haiti and Rwanda rendered the food flavorless. That afternoon 
we cut our trip short, bid David and Sheila adieu and returned to the urban 
nightmare we hadn't left nearly far enough behind.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; DR. WILL'S CURE FOR TV ILLS: FIND 
THE GOOD STUFF, WATCH CLOSELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He may wear Orville Redenbacher's trademark bow tie and spectacles, but all 
Dr. Will Miller advocates is closer scrutiny of shows aimed at youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I encourage the audience, and parents, to look at the messages of programs," 
says Nick at Nite's resident commentator at large. 
</P>
<P>
 A comedian and psychotherapist with master's degrees in clinical social work, 
education and divinity, Dr. Will does for Nick at Nite what Russell Baker and 
Alistair Cooke before him did for PBS' "Masterpiece Theatre" -- puts shows in 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes with unexpected observations. " 'Gilligan's Island' is about 
rage," he proclaims. "Here is a young man who through his ineptitude . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Well, what about "The Dick Van Dyke Show"? "Who put the ottoman in Rob's path 
on 'Dick Van Dyke'? Was it perhaps Laura or Richie, angry that Rob is more 
bound to work than he is at home? Or did Rob set it there himself, out of 
guilt?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Will may lace his views with humor, but he's quite serious: "I want people 
to look at the meaning of television shows," he says from a Los Angeles hotel, 
where he's at work on his new NBC talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who want quality shows for their kids should find those that avoid 
"gratuitous violence. You look for good messages congruent with what you want 
to infiltrate into your family." 
</P>
<P>
 And while precocious on-screen kids may be proliferating, he doesn't see that 
as any kind of step forward: "The very unhelpful trend seems to be for children 
to be smarter than their parents. It's annoying and not helpful to portray 
parents as dumb. The basic problem is, it's not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Television, he believes, should teach kids the core values: "authority, 
kindness and safety issues, such as not talking to strangers and inappropriate 
contact." 
</P>
<P>
 Those safety concerns have led some shows, he says, to "overplay the 'be 
careful of authority' message." This good-hearted but misguided message, he 
adds, makes kids feel unsafe. "Kids should be taught to be careful, but they 
should believe that isn't the norm." 
</P>
<P>
 What everyone should avoid, he points out, are any kind of extremes. "Good 
programming," says Dr. Will, "is somewhere in the middle." And where do parents 
find some of that? 
</P>
<P>
 "Shining Time Station" (PBS): "They've got great characters. There are also 
wonderful lessons, like don't make problems worse by bickering, don't take 
short cuts to winning. What impresses me most are the wonderfully told 
stories." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Adventures of Pete & Pete" (Nickelodeon): "Here's an example of a show 
that's wonderfully produced and entertaining. What's positive is, despite the 
tendency to make the parents dumb, in the end, Mom and Dad do know best. The 
show does what kids do naturally. It's multicultural and not self-consciously 
so." 
</P>
<P>
 "Steven Spielberg's Animaniacs" (Fox): "This show has a lot of crossover and 
adult references and wonderful animation. It's got a great fast pace kids can 
really get into. I just wish that they were more accurate in their historical 
portrayals." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sesame Street" (PBS): "Always a great show. I think they do a really good job 
of mixing fantasy with reality, which is where kids are at that age." 
</P>
<P>
 For older kids, being glued to MTV, he says, is normal. "At 12 and 13, they 
want to watch adult programming -- and will." 
</P>
<P>
 But parents, he emphasizes, must "increasingly control the volume of viewing 
that kids do. Television doesn't have to be and shouldn't be a baby-sitter by 
default. Parents need to watch programming very intentionally -- and intervene 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Will's last word: "There's really very little on TV aimed at kids that's 
doing damage, and if there is, it's because parents refuse to become involved 
in their kids' lives and in their viewing. That's the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Will can be seen between programming on "Nick at Nite" on Nickelodeon. His 
talk show, "The Other Side With Dr. Will Miller" will premiere in mid-October 
on NBC.

<P>
 Erase your memory. 
</P>
<P>
 On prime time this fall, your favorite character could have a new job. Mom may 
look a lot different. Or that bouncing baby will have bloomed into a 5-year-old 
sassy kid. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the summer, producers of returning shows have added new characters, 
gotten rid of old ones or recast leads that just didn't work out (or left in a 
contract dispute). It's all in the name of keeping their series fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 Programmers were still juggling their lineups late last month. ABC moved "Home 
Improvement" to Tuesdays at 9 p.m. after NBC moved "Frasier" to that time slot. 
ABC's "Roseanne" will move to "Home Improvement's" old slot, Wednesdays at 9 
p.m. And more time changes could be on the way as the season prepares to 
launch. 
</P>
<P>
 A peek at this fall's newly changed -- and possibly improved -- returning 
shows: ABC 
</P>
<P>
 Boy Meets World: Cory (Ben Savage) starts high school, where he will have a 
young and worldly homeroom and English teacher (Anthony Tyler Quinn). Fridays 
at 8:30 p.m. Premieres Sept. 23.  
</P>
<P>
 The Commish: Tony Scali (Michael Chiklis), wounded at the end of last season, 
faces spending the rest of his life in a wheelchair. Saturdays at 10 p.m. 
Premieres Sept. 24 . 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen: The show gets a new day, new title and new comic foil. Joely Fisher 
plays Paige Clark, Ellen's best friend. "I'm a planner and a schemer," Fisher 
says. Why add to an already large cast? "We needed another strong comic 
presence," says executive producer David Rosenthal. Fisher's take on how she 
will play off star Ellen DeGeneres: "One of my friends has already called me 
Rhoda." Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. Premieres Sept. 21.  
</P>
<P>
 Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Expect more suspense and an 
emphasis on guest villains, a la TV's "Batman." Justin Whalin replaces Michael 
Landes as Jimmy Olsen, and society columnist "Cat" Grant (Tracy Scoggins) is 
gone. John Shea will appear as Lex Luthor in guest shots only. Sundays at 8 
p.m. Premieres Sept. 18.  
</P>
<P>
 NYPD Blue: Last year's breakout star, David Caruso, will leave the series 
after the first four episodes to pursue a film career. Jimmy Smits ("L.A. Law") 
fills the void. Tuesdays at 10 p.m. Premieres Oct. 11 . 
</P>
<P>
 Thunder Alley: She'll still raise the three little tykes and spar with her dad 
(Ed Asner), but Mom's taken on a whole new look: Robin Riker ("Shaky Ground") 
replaces Diane Venora as opinionated Bobbi Turner. Producers wanted a "strong 
comedic actress" who's done a sitcom before. "I never saw Diane's performance, 
but chose to keep it that way," Riker says. Watching a predecessor "can be a 
help and can be curse." Also new: a teen-ager who hangs around Gil Jones' auto 
garage. Wednesdays at 8 p.m. (New time). Premieres Sept. 14 at 8:30 p.m., moves 
to regular slot a week later. CBS 
</P>
<P>
 Dave's World: Dave (Harry Anderson) now works out of a home office, with Mia 
(J.C. Wendel) as his assistant. Mondays at 8:30 p.m. Premieres Sept. 12.  
</P>
<P>
 Hearts Afire: Yes, this show was once a comedy about Washington politics. Now 
a bundle of joy is on the way: Georgie Anne (Markie Post) has her baby, but 
she's not your typical mother. Also, Billy Bob Thornton moves out of their 
house and gets his own place. Saturdays at 9:30 p.m. (New day and time). 
Premieres Sept. 24.  
</P>
<P>
 Northern Exposure: Rob Morrow, who stars as Dr. Joel Fleischman, is signed for 
the entire year, but there were doubts whether he'd stay for the entire season. 
Like Caruso, he has his sights on a film career. Mondays at 10 p.m. Premieres 
Sept. 19.  
</P>
<P>
 Rescue 911: The show takes a cue from Irwin Allen and features more 
adventurous stories, such as a shark bite, a runaway car and a train wreck. 
Tuesdays at 8 p.m. Premieres Sept. 20. FOX 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills, 90210: With Shannen Doherty gone, they need someone to stir 
things up: Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, late of "Saved by the Bell: The College 
Years," as a "beautiful, smart and complex" Walsh family friend who ends up 
living with them. (See With an Eye On ... Page 84.) Jamie Walters ("The 
Heights") joins as blue-collar worker Ray Pruit, Wednesdays at 8 p.m. Premieres 
Wednesday . 
</P>
<P>
 Martin: Martin (Martin Lawrence) gets a new time -- and a new job -- as the 
host of a TV talk show, where he works under a demanding new boss (Angelina 
Estrada). A sign the characters are getting older: The cast will be hanging out 
at a yuppie bar, and Martin will tie the knot with Gina by season's end. 
Thursdays at 8 p.m. (New day). Already premiered.  
</P>
<P>
 Melrose Place: Super-model Kathy Ireland visits in four episodes as a woman 
Jake (Grant Show) rescues from an abusive husband. "She's a very troubled 
woman," says Ireland. Executive producer Darren Star is not sure if Ireland 
will become a regular, but thinks audiences will be tantalized by Ireland. "We 
tend to think of her as the 'Bond girl' of Melrose Place," he says. Jason Beghe 
comes back as Matt's romantic interest and Jane will get a new boyfriend 
(Andrew Williams). Mondays at 8 p.m. (New day and time). Premieres Sept. 12. 
NBC 
</P>
<P>
 Blossom: Finola Hughes becomes a regular as Nick's (Ted Wass) new love 
interest, with Courtney Chase as her daughter Kennedy. Joey (Joey Lawrence) 
will be off and about playing minor league baseball, but don't worry. Producers 
promise he'll be in every episode. Mondays at 8:30 p.m. Premieres Sept. 26.  
</P>
<P>
 The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air: Last year, Philip (James Avery) and Vivian 
(Daphne Maxwell Reid) had a baby. Now he's a 5-year-old (Ross Bagley), ready to 
blurt out wisecracks. Mondays at 8 p.m. Premieres Sept. 19.  
</P>
<P>
 The John Larroquette Show: Alison La Placa ("Tom") joins as nurse Catherine 
Merrick, who captures John Hemingway's attention when he moves in across the 
hall from her apartment. Bill Morey, who plays Oscar the bum, becomes a 
regular. Tuesdays at 9:30 p.m. (New time). Premieres Sept. 20.

 Homicide: Life on the Street: Isabella Hoffman joins as Lt. Megan Russert, the 
first female appointed as shift commander. Jon Polito has left the show.

charming "but unapologetic," says executive producer Dick Wolf. Wednesdays at

</P>
<P>
 seaQuest DSV: Less science, more sci-fi. Some story lines: ESP, genetic 
engineering and time travel. "If people want to learn about seaweed -- God 
bless them -- let them watch the Discovery Channel," executive producer Patrick 
Hasburgh says of last season's shows. Gone is Stephanie Beacham. New cast 
members include Peter DeLuise as Dagwood, the ship's janitor who comes from a 
genetically engineered race known as "Daggers," and Rosalind Allen as a 
biophysicist with ESP. Sundays at 8 p.m. Premieres Sept. 18.

here yet. Get off the island,' " says Mark Reisman, executive producer with 
Howard Gewirtz. Tuesdays at 8 p.m. (New day and time). Premieres Sept. 20.  
</P>

WHAT WAS IRVING THINKING?; 'MULTICULTURAL' DOESN'T BEGIN TO DESCRIBE THE 
RAMBUNCTIOUS ALL-INCLUSIVENESS OF THIS FICTIONAL UNIVERSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHERINE DUNN, Katherine Dunne's most recent book Geek Love, was published 
by Alfred A. Knopf. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While other bookish types dither and debate whether anyone who doesn't belong 
to a particular minority should be allowed to write about them, that New 
England pale-face, novelist John Irving, has taken a stand. His barricade and 
demonstration is "A Son of the Circus," a cheerfully apocalyptic mystery 
starring a dislocated native of India. 
</P>
<P>
 Irving was packing away bales of research materials from the new novel when I 
got him on the phone to ask how he dared fly in the face of these sensitive 
doctrines. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of a racial exclusivity of topics, he said, "is just another name for 
racism. . . . It's a myth that because it's your experience you can't get it 
wrong. I find personal experience and memory are not necessarily a fiction 
writer's friends. You can make lots of mistakes and have many . . . 
misperceptions about what has been your own experience. The most outrageous of 
those being that since it was your experience it must be universal." 
</P>
<P>
 The novel was appropriately launched by the American bicentennial extravaganza 
around the Statue of Liberty. Struck by the irony of celebrating a nation of 
immigrants while hundreds of refugee Haitians sat in American concentration 
camps waiting to be sent back, Irving got to thinking about the difficulties 
facing racially distinct immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a cab ride through Toronto on a snowy winter night put the novelist at a 
critical street corner just as a well-dressed Indian pedestrian paused to wait 
for the light. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found myself thinking that there was no fathoming the life . . . that 
brought him here," recalls Irving. "That the richness, the foreignness of that 
life would forever be concealed from those people with whom he now shared a 
country. . . . Then I realized that without any ill intent I was sort of 
staring at this guy and that he was aware of it. . . . And he looked at me with 
some anxiety, reproach, a kind of 'Why is this man staring at me?' and in his 
look I saw his familiarity with racial wariness." 
</P>
<P>
 The light changed, the cab moved on, and Irving went home to begin his new 
novel at its ending, with the well-dressed brown-skinned man standing on a 
snowy street corner in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-year effort to fathom just such a rich and foreign life by dint of 
research and imagination was aided, as Irving eagerly acknowledges, by a safety 
net of criticism from Indian friends who sent him back to revising repeatedly. 
The result: "A Son of the Circus," is a huge and exuberant juggling act in 
which comedy and tragedy, the ludicrous and the profound, are playfully and 
inextricably tangled. Set mainly in India, the novels' exotic cast includes 
dwarfs, circus acts, prostitutes, transsexuals, movie stars, beggars and the 
lushly moneyed elite of Bombay. The plump ring master and mental juggler who 
connects the multifarious characters and incidents is the aging Circus' Son 
himself, Dr. Farrokh Daruwalla. His is the curiously gifted mind that reveals 
the novel. His non-sectarian decency is its propulsive force. No good deed goes 
unpunished, and Daruwalla's random kindness produces random results in the 
novels' synchronous three-ring subplots. 
</P>
<P>
 The good doctor is Indian born, Austrian educated and a successful orthopedic 
surgeon in his adopted Canada. The story evolves during one of Dr. Daruwalla's 
regular but reluctant visits to his hometown of Bombay. He and his beloved 
Austrian wife appear comfortable wherever they are, but the doctor's migrations 
have stamped him permanently with the eyes of the bemused observer in a strange 
land. He is an amazed and ambivalent tourist even in Bombay. 
</P>
<P>
 With the mystery driving the narrative, Irving takes us on flashback detours 
from lush comforts of a private country club to the netherworlds of Bombays 
brothels, the wildly popular Hindi cinema scene, the Crippled Children's 
Hospital where Daruwalla works during his visits, and the Indian circuses where 
he feels oddly at home with dwarf subjects of his genetic researches. 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication of "A Son of the Circus" reads, "For Salman," to honor a long 
friendship with the Indian author Salman Rushdie, and because, Irving says, "I 
first went to Bombay, which is his town, when I read (Rushdie's novel) 
'Midnight's Children.' " The shadow of Rushdie, himself an immigrant before he 
became a fugitive from the terrorism of Khomeini, touches "The Son of the 
Circus," as a final example of Irving's preferred definition of what a novel 
should be; "the biggest and most subtle example of the inter-relatedness of all 
things."

 Mission of the Shark (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a fine 1991 TV movie account of 
a near-forgotten naval disaster, the sinking of the U.S. cruiser Indianapolis 
at the end of World War II. The disaster left hundreds of men bobbing in 
shark-infested waters for five days; Stacy Keach and Richard Thomas star. 
</P>
<P>
 As true-life TV movies go, Confessions: Two Faces of Evil (NBC Sunday at 9 
p.m.), directed by Gil Cates, hits unusually close to home. It's about how two 
young men, played by Jason Bateman and James Wilder, confess to a murder that 
only one them could have committed. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead (KTTV Monday at 8 p.m.) is a feebly 
written and stridently directed teen-age comedy about five California kids left 
alone when their mom vacations in Australia and their babysitter dies. 
</P>
<P>
 Black Widow: The Blanche Taylor Moore Story (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.), a mediocre 
1993 TV movie, does manage to offer sordid fun with Elizabeth Montgomery 
playing a real-life serial poisoner. 
</P>
<P>
 Point Break (KTTV Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a beautiful but dumb 1991 thriller 
starring Keanu Reeves as an ex-Ohio State quarterback-turned-FBI agent who goes 
underground to infiltrate the surfer subculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Heights (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), in which Michael Keaton plays the 
renter from hell to yuppie San Francisco landlords Melanie Griffith and Matthew 
Modine, ought to have been more pulpy fun than it is; however, Keaton does give 
the 1990 film a core of genuine horror. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine a video game that becomes the real thing. The Last Starfighter (KCOP 
Friday at 8 p.m.) starts out promising but dissipates fast. Lance Guest and 
Robert Preston, in his last feature role, star. 
</P>
<P>
 Pale Rider (NBC Friday at 8:30 p.m.) is Clint Eastwood's 1985 variation on 
"Shane," marred by the queasy and unlikely development that has a pretty 
teen-age idolater trying to seduce him. 
</P>
<P>
 Break of Dawn (KCET Friday at 9 p.m.) is an awkward yet moving 1988 biography 
of singer Pedro Gonzalez (Oscar Chavez), an influential local radio pioneer 
exploited by politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 David Cronenberg's dazzling, unsettling 1986 remake of The Fly (KTTV Saturday 
at 6 p.m.) is as much a romantic tragedy as a dark-humored horror picture; with 
Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be confused with the sinister 1992 Drew Barrymore film of the same 
name, this Poison Ivy (ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a standard 1985 TV movie 
summer camp romp with Michael J. Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddball Hall (KCOP Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a complicated, unfunny 1990 TV movie 
comedy, despite the presence of Don Ameche and Burgess Meredith.

'QUEEN' FOR A SEASON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I was glad to see a question about George Nader in Sunday's TV Times (Aug. 
21). I always felt he was underrated, but I must take exception to your 
statement, "Nader was the first 'Ellery Queen' in 1958."I am old enough to 
remember "Ellery Queen" with Lee Bowman (his best part, in my opinion) coming 
on live television as a summer replacement and later becoming a regular TV 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 John McCarthy, Culver City 
</P>
<P>
 Editor's Note: George Nader, in fact, played the third network "Ellery Queen" 
and the fourth overall. Richard Hart was first (Dumont, 1950-51); Lee Bowman, 
second (ABC, 1951-52); Hugh Marlowe, third (Syndicated, 1954); Nader, fourth 
(NBC, 1958-59); Lee Philips, fifth (NBC, 1959); and Jim Hutton, sixth (NBC, 
1975-76).

 KARMA COLA: Marketing the Mystic East by Gita Mehta (Vintage: $10; 193 pp.) . 
Citing the admonition in "The Upanishads," "sacred knowledge in the hands of 
fools destroys," Gita Mehta takes a sardonic look at the Indian hucksters who 
turn ancient spiritual traditions into feel-good consumer products for Western 
consumers: Nirvana as Happy Meal. Mehta is equally critical of the "gurus" who 
milk their followers for money, sex and adoration, and the gullible Occidentals 
who expect instant relief from beliefs predicated on rigorous self-denial. This 
intercultural commerce is both comic and tragic, leading Mehta to conclude, "if 
ever the karma was right for the gods to warn Here comes the Judge, it would 
seem to be now."

 ATLANTIC CITY: 125 Years of Ocean Madness by Vicki Gold Levi & Lee Eisenberg 
(10 Speed Press: $18.95; 214 pp.) . Before Las Vegas arose and Donald Trump 
achieved new heights (or depths) of vulgarity, Atlantic City offered 
vacationing Americans amusements, publicity stunts and pageants. Established in 
the 1850s as a resort for Philadelphians, Atlantic City quickly became a place 
for fads. In 1915, James Huneker wrote, "Atlantic City is not a treat for the 
introspective . . . it is hard, glittering, unspeakably cacophonous, and it 
never sleeps at all." Levi and Eisenberg chronicle some noteworthy events in 
the city's colorful past.

 RECKONING THE EARTH: Some Lessons From the Land by Sandra Murphy, illustrated 
John MacDonald (Northland Publishing: $12.95; 119 pp., paperback original). 
Long Branch Farm is a working agricultural installation designed as a showplace 
for children from nearby Cincinnati. Volunteer Sandra Murphy recalls how kids 
and their parents react to her talks about crop rotation, composting and farm 
animals, as well as the hands-on experiences of digging potatoes and making 
felt from raw wool. Her unpretentious essays leave the impression that she 
would make an engaging guide, providing the tour didn't involve too much time 
shoveling horse manure into the compost bins.

 THE BASS SAXOPHONE by Josef Skvorecky, translated from the Czech (Ecco Press: 
$12; 209 pp.) . The two novellas in this volume are less compelling than the 
author's recollections of playing American jazz in a Czech village, despite the 
condemnations of the Nazis and Soviets. In "Emoke," Skvorecky uses long, 
rolling sentences to etch the bleak passions of the colorless world of the old 
Communist regime. The narrator of "The Bass Saxophone" risks his life to play 
in a nightmarish jazz concert given by a ragtag circus band for the Nazi 
invaders who banned the music as decadent.

 THE NEW PENGUIN DICTIONARY OF QUOTATIONS edited by J. M. & M. J. Cohen 
(Penguin: $14; 726 pp.) This reference volume has been expanded to include more 
citations from 20th-Century figures. Although the editors note, "it is not 
always those who are most read or respected who have left the greatest number 
of sayings in the popular memory" their choices reflect an Anglophile bias: 
Mishima, Genet, Steinbeck and Mann are omitted, while 178 entries are included 
for Alexander Pope. Comments on the human condition ("A single sentence will 
suffice for modern man: he fornicated and read the papers" -- Camus) are 
juxtaposed with H. H. Munro's "The cook was a good cook, as cooks go; and as 
cooks go, she went."

 THE ELEPHANT VANISHES by Haruki Murakami translated from the Japanese by 
Alfred Birnbaum & Jay Rubin (Vintage: $12; 327 pp.). The characters in these 
odd stories find themselves caught between conflicting cultures as they attempt 
to graft Western tastes and mores onto Japanese traditions.The cultural 
equivalent of 19th-Century "half-caste" pariahs, they pursue a neurotic 
existence in contemporary Tokyo. The husband and wife in "The Second Bakery 
Attack" give new meaning to the slogan "Big Mac Attack" when they play Bonnie 
and Clyde at MacDonald's, but they can't escape the Japanese aversion to 
violence, even during a robbery. The narrator of "Sleep," looks back on her 
easy, meaningless existence and realizes "my footprints were being blown away 
before I even had a chance to turn and look at them." Fans of Murakami's "A 
Wild Sheep Chase" will enjoy this outre admixture of East and West.

 INSIDE SANTA RITA: Prison Memoir of a War Protester by Joan Baez Sr. (John 
Daniel & Co.: $10.; 89 pp., paperback original). The mother of the folk singer 
became involved in her daughter's anti-war activities in 1967, which lead to 
her incarceration in the Santa Rita Rehabilitation Center. Baez's interactions 
with the regular inmates -- women whose pasts involved drugs, poverty, violence 
and crime -- strengthened her commitment to social activism. Her emphasis on 
political morality seems sadly dated in a time when political action has become 
synonymous with lobbying and influence peddling.

 THE LONE RANGER AND TONTO FISTFIGHT IN HEAVEN by Sherman Alexie 
(HarperPerennial: $12; 223 pp.). Sherman Alexie's gritty stories depict the 
struggle to escape the debilitating cycle of despair, poverty, alcoholism and 
prejudice on the Spokane Indian Reservation: "Our whole lives have to do with 
survival."The narrator of "Every Little Hurricane" compares the alcohol-induced 
strife within his family to bad weather, and seeks shelter from both. The most 
telling description of contemporary Native American life appears in "This Is 
What It Means To Say Phoenix, Arizona": "Victor and Thomas made it back to the 
reservation just as the sun was rising. It was the beginning of a new day on 
earth, but the same old (stuff) on the reservation." Darkly funny yet often 
tragic, these stories reveal a very promising talent.

A NOVEL ON A MISSION; HAPPY BIRTHDAY JESUS, BY RONALD L. RUIZ (ARTE PUBLICO 
PRESS: $19.95; 314 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gerald Nicosia, Gerald Nicosia is the author of Memory Babe: A Critical 
Biography of Jack Kerouac, recently issued in a new edition by the University 
of California Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ronald L. Ruiz's first novel, "Happy Birthday Jesus," falls into a genre that 
has produced some of the most compelling fiction of the past two centuries: the 
novel that humanizes a criminal and lets us walk in his shoes. Norman Mailer's 
"The Executioner's Song," Nelson Algren's "The Man With the Golden Arm," 
Theodore Dreiser's "An American Tragedy" and (unquestionably the all-time 
champion of the genre) Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment" all make a case that 
"there but for the grace of God" go we, the readers, back to our safe, 
law-abiding lives -- after we put the book down -- but with our own humanity 
forever enlarged by the vision of what we too might have become had life been a 
little less benevolent to us. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of any book in this genre depends upon one big factor: whether the 
protagonist, the criminal, becomes a credible human being, or whether he 
remains a puppet of the author's propaganda; and propaganda, no matter how 
well-meaning, does not a great novel make. 
</P>
<P>
 From the very beginning, Ruiz's Jesus Olivas is a tough character to swallow. 
Never mind his biblical name (Christ faced his own judgment on the Mount of 
Olives), this virtually illiterate "monster," as he is called on the book 
jacket, who has brutally raped the only woman who ever loved him, a prostitute 
named Chole, and maimed the village priest, the closest thing to a father he 
ever had, appeals to us with a poetic sensibility that might well suit a 
university-degreed poet. He routinely whips off observations such as "Fog 
covered that great valley; soft, thick clouds of whiteness gleaming in the sun, 
giving no sign of the dreariness below"; or: "the weak winter afternoon faded." 
</P>
<P>
 There are lots more things to dislike about this novel. The Illinois printer 
who had originally contracted to typeset the book refused to finish the job, 
saying he found "the sexual graphic language" unusually offensive. Indeed 
"Happy Birthday Jesus" contains some of the most distressing and gruesomely 
ugly sex scenes this side of your nearest S&M porn rack. As Chole tells Jesus, 
offering him a hard-earned chocolate cake for his 18th birthday, just before he 
smashes it in her face and tries to choke her: "There are so few things to 
enjoy." And that line is really the key to this novel, the thing that makes it 
a gripping work of fiction despite a wealth of flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of Ruiz's story is what it means to grow up permanently on the 
outside of all human community, even family. Jesus has no family. His father a 
pimp who hit the road even before his mother died in childbirth, he is raised 
by a grandmother, 'Ama, a totally self-centered and loveless woman, a self-made 
martyr whose sole passion is to get herself declared a saint by the Catholic 
Church. Like many another religious zealot, 'Ama will crush any obstacle that 
gets in her path, including her grandson. Seeing his boyish needs, especially 
his incorrigible masturbation, as roadblocks to her own canonization, 'Ama 
relentlessly tortures him not only into submission but also into a virtually 
autistic existence, where he fears to speak to anyone lest he incur further 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 'Ama's bizarre rituals anticipate the sort of sexual abuse and degradation 
Jesus will encounter in the California state penal system. The novel resonates 
with such parallels, and its most fundamental motif is the racism that pervades 
every aspect of Jesus' life. Born a Mexican-American, he is forced to fight 
both whites and blacks from the first moment he enters a schoolyard; and even 
his fellow Latinos later exercise their own form of discrimination against him, 
telling him that his raggedy fruit-picking clothing and "dopey" behavior make 
him "a disgrace to the Mexican race." 
</P>
<P>
 At times Jesus seems to become a mere polemical instrument for the author, a 
former prosecutor for the Alameda County district attorney's office and now a 
defense attorney for several Mexican-Americans on Death Row, especially when he 
is harping on the inequities and racial bias of our criminal justice system; 
but the scenes in the book depicting Jesus' experience of racism -- and his 
acceptance of it as a preordained way of life -- ring absolutely true and take 
on an engaging life of their own. When Jesus as a child feels "dirty and 
dark"going into one of the downtown white-owned stores, where the salesladies 
ask him what he wants as soon as he walks in the door, we blush with 
embarrassment for him. 
</P>
<P>
 In those scenes when Jesus is most beaten down, when he has given up 
completely on family, school, church and even God as having anything good or 
gentle to offer him, "Happy Birthday Jesus" comes most alive as a work of 
fiction. It then thrusts us vividly into the consciousness of those members of 
our society who may become the ruin of all of us, simply because we have never 
dared to look them in the eye and communicate with them as equals. 
</P>
<P>
 In Richard Wright's "Native Son," a novel to which "Happy Birthday Jesus" has 
already been compared, the black man Bigger Thomas is sentenced to death for 
the murder of both a white woman and a black woman, but his real crime -- in 
the eyes of the white court -- has been mingling socially and sexually with 
people outside his own race. Bigger Thomas, illiterate and antisocial as Jesus 
Olivas, had the gumption to reach out for a better life. As Wright described 
him, "he felt the need for a whole life and acted out of that need." But Jesus 
Olivas' claim to originality as a character is that he has given up on the 
possibility of reaching beyond the stunted grasp he was presented with at 
birth. He has given hopelessness a new name. And even when he finally strikes 
back at the end, burning his boyhood church and murdering a priest, it is a 
gesture of supreme futility. The real priest he wanted to kill has long since 
gone, and for this pointless violence he will sacrifice the freedom and chance 
for a new life that a do-gooding attorney has won for him. 
</P>
<P>
 The grim message of "Happy Birthday Jesus" is that one can survive, but only 
to endure more of the same; and its unasked question is how that vicious circle 
can ever be interrupted. It is a question that most urgently needs asking, and 
Ruiz's novel has earned an important place in our literature for the courage to 
shock us from our complacency, just as the horrors Jesus experiences finally 
force him to act -- if only to his own self-destruction.

RETRO; SHEW STOPPERS; BROADWAY SPARKLES ON A VIDEO OF 'ED SULLIVAN SHOW' TUNES 
</P>

<P>
 The long-running CBS musical variety series "The Ed Sullivan Show" (originally 
called "Toast of the Town") was more than Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Topo 
Gigio, Senor Wences, acrobats, spinning plates, dog acts, comics and actors 
reading excerpts from the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 The series, which aired from 1948 to 1971, was the first to bring the best of 
Broadway theater to network television. And the new Walt Disney Home Video, 
"The Best of the Broadway Musicals" ($20), features 12 really big shew-stopping 
Broadway musical numbers that were performed live on "Ed Sullivan" back in the 
'50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 The lineup features: 
</P>
<P>
 "There's No Business Like Show Business" from "Annie Get Your Gun," performed 
by Ethel Merman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oklahoma!" from "Oklahoma!," performed by John Raitt (who also narrates the 
video), Celeste Holm, Florence Henderson, Barbara Cook and Richard Collet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I Can't Say No" from "Oklahoma!," performed by Holm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I Enjoy Being a Girl" from "Flower Drum Song," performed by Pat Suzuki. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" from "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," performed 
by Carol Channing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wouldn't It Be Loverly" from "My Fair Lady," performed by Julie Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight" from "West Side Story," performed by Carol Lawrence and Larry Kert. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Do the Simple Folk Do" from "Camelot," performed by Julie Andrews and 
Richard Burton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who Can I Turn To?" from "The Roar of the Greasepaint -- The Smell of the 
Crowd," performed by Anthony Newley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a Brass Band" from "Sweet Charity," performed by Gwen Verdon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Impossible Dream" from "The Man of La Mancha," performed by Richard 
Kiley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the Parade Passes By" from "Hello, Dolly!," performed by Pearl Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really tried to take the best musical from each year and try to represent 
all the biggest stars of Broadway," says Greg Vines, the video's producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to do a nice mix," adds Andrew Solt, the executive producer, 
director and writer of "The Best of the Broadway Musicals." Solt also owns "The 
Ed Sullivan Show" library. 
</P>
<P>
 The segments featured on the video were culled from more than 1,000 hours of 
Sullivan shows. Out of those 1,000 hours, Vines says, "We have compiled about 
20 or 25 hours worth of just Broadway numbers. That's not always the original 
cast doing them, but with the original cast we probably have anywhere from six 
or eight hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Also included are tributes to composers Lerner and Loewe and Irving Berlin. 
"Harold Arlen was on the show," Solt says. "Cole Porter appeared in 1952. It 
was one of his few TV appearances." 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan, Solt says, did a big service for the Broadway theater. "He was 
getting people to see the shows. When (people) from middle America came to 
town, they would buy tickets to the shows. Broadway producers realized this was 
good for business and they were more than willing to bring their stars and 
their musical numbers on the show. It was good for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The Broadway theater, Solt adds, also impressed Sullivan. "He was impressed 
with people with real talent and, being a New Yorker, I think Broadway was of 
interest to him. What really turned him on was Broadway and the big singers of 
his era. He would go to nightclubs and hang out until 3 or 4 in the morning, 
then go home and have a lamb chop at noon. He had a very interesting 
lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 During the run of the series, Sullivan also wrote his popular syndicated 
column "Little Old New York." "He kept his column, which was a power base for 
him while he did his show, because he always knew if people turned him down 
time and time again to be on the Sullivan show," Solt says, "eventually their 
names would be in the column in a negative way." 
</P>
<P>
 Solt and Vines say it was quite easy to obtain clearances from music 
publishers and the talent to use their clips. "When we went to Julie Andrews," 
Solt relates, "and gave her a copy of the tape and said, 'Here are six songs 
from 'My Fair Lady,' she was beside herself. She didn't get the movie role and 
here was the only living proof of her in this role, which made her career. 
There was no other filmic representation of it. It was great that this stuff 
exists."

CUDDLY KILLERS; THE AUTHOR OF 'THE SECRET LIFE OF DOGS' TURNS HER ATTENTION TO 
THE FELINES; THE TRIBE OF TIGER: CATS AND THEIR CULTURE, BY ELIZABETH MARSHALL 
THOMAS (SIMON & SCHUSTER: $20; 240 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Anne Tobias, When Anne Tobias is not distracted by the predatory adventures 
of her three cats, she writes about dancing in New York City. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Observation is a useful tool . . . for all the cats," writes Elizabeth 
Marshall Thomas, an avid observer herself. For decades she has been watching 
wild cats and captive cats, the tabby no less than the lion. Following hard on 
the heels of her fascinating canine expose, "The Hidden Life of Dogs," Thomas's 
latest book, "The Tribe of Tiger," describes what the felines have allowed her 
to see of their haunts and their habits, despite the fact that "to be unseen 
and undetectable is a state that seems to suit the cat family." 
</P>
<P>
 As keenly as the author has used her eyes, she uses her heart, expanding sight 
into a lucid insight that guides us deep into cat country -- a hair's breadth 
from the warm crouching beast. 
</P>
<P>
 Common knowledge has long held cats to be inscrutable. Tell a dog what to do, 
and he'll most usually do it. But don't bother even asking a cat, who is busy 
with an inexplicable, independent agenda. Thomas, however, has found the key to 
the delightful puzzle: The feline raison d'etre is the pursuit of prey. 
</P>
<P>
 "The story of cats is a story of meat," she explains, and goes on to note that 
"hunting preoccupies a cat almost from birth." The 35 species of cat, which 
range most corners of the earth, have evolved into precise, efficient killers. 
Some are stealth hunters, others are group hunters, and still others, like the 
lightning-quick cheetah, are coursers, who run down their prey. Don't look 
askance at pudgy Mittens, drowsing in the noontime sun on your living-room rug. 
One of Thomas's own house cats, Rajah, neatly slaughtered a loaf of Italian 
bread, first clutching the sides with razor-sharp claws and then finishing it 
off by biting deeply into what would have been the neck if only the bread had 
been built more like the mouse or wildebeest of the cat's active imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed all cats, big and small, are excellently outfitted for killing. A short 
list of features includes sensitive, mobile whiskers; long eyeteeth for 
latching onto prey and triangular cheek teeth for tearing flesh; claws; acute 
eyesight; a complex sense of smell; and scent glands used to leave friendly 
messages for family members or to warn strangers away from protected territory. 
All this is housed in a body of superb strength. 
</P>
<P>
 While predation certainly defines feline biology, it may also explain feline 
emotions. "Many expressions of a cat's feelings," Thomas states, "seem deeply 
related to the capture of live prey. An excited, happy, or much relieved cat 
may ambush and pounce upon whatever triggers its pleasure -- something worth 
considering before getting a large cat all worked up." And no one can mistake 
the actions of a cat at play, mimicking methods of pursuit and attack just for 
the heck of it. (As I am writing this, sturdy Alonzo, white whiskers blazing 
above his classic tuxedo markings, has decided to pass the time by doing in a 
pair of defenseless sunglasses.) 
</P>
<P>
 A perusal of "The Tribe of Tiger" will teach you all this and more: how cats 
communicate with one another, how they establish territories and social groups, 
why they fight, and how they love. Thomas supports her material with relevant 
literature, yet throughout her book she speaks less in the voice of the 
scientist than in that of the storyteller. We hear of the lioness, shot 
unnecessarily, whose companion sat with her as she died, "turning her fur the 
wrong way" with a gentle grooming tongue. And unforgettable Ruby, the 
domesticated puma, capable of "singing the murderous song of a cat's dark 
feelings, a contralto solo of envy and displeasure." 
</P>
<P>
 Simple and non-judgmental, Thomas's musical prose tells tale after tale of the 
cat, revealing these creatures in all their integrity, in all their danger, in 
all their splendor. The latter two sections of the book turn from paean to 
lament: Once upon a time humans and cats could live and hunt side by side. They 
kept a truce based on mutual needs and mutual respect. Since then, we have let 
down our end of the bargain -- eroding balanced habitats, trafficking in hides 
and bones, butchering big cats for money and sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are surely the primary agent of death for all members of the cat tribe," 
says Thomas. "For many if not most cat species, our depredations must surpass 
accidents, disease, and even starvation by a considerable margin." The damage 
having been done over decades, now we are scrambling to redress our sins. Funds 
are raised for managed game parks, captive breeding programs, study after study 
on species slowly succumbing to extinction. What have we done to that "deep and 
perfect wilderness," where humans existed peaceably with the cats? Eden, once 
lost, is irrecoverable. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Tribe of Tiger" Thomas openly mourns for the world's wild cats, as 
only someone who has lived among them can mourn. Most readers, having 
encountered lions and tigers only through the bars of a zoo enclosure, will be 
limited to comprehending the dilemma by means of intellectual empathy. Yet 
those of us who have invited some of the smaller cats into our homes may come 
close to touching the depths of Thomas's feelings. In the recording, "Songs of 
the Cat," Garrison Keillor bids good-bye to his feline companion like this: "He 
was good company, / And we miss his gift / Of cat affection while he lived, / 
The sweet nature / Of that shy creature / Who gave the pleasure of himself."

PALM LATITUDES: THE WORD; WHITE COLLAR BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Andrew Asch 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most 'zines are offbeat forums for disaffected youth, not high-paid 
white-collar types. But hard times can make disaffected youth of us all -- "Out 
of the Blue" is a new 'zine for laid-off IBM workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "IBM had a specific policy of avoiding layoffs for years," says Alexander 
Auerbach, publisher of the Sherman Oaks-based 'zine. "People assumed that when 
they had a job with IBM they would retire with IBM." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in the past six years, IBM, dubbed "Big Blue" back in the days when it 
dominated the computer industry, eliminated 150,000 jobs worldwide and 1,000 
jobs in the Los Angeles Basin. Workers who once thought that they would be part 
of the IBM family forever now felt cut adrift. 
</P>
<P>
 "People identified themselves with IBM. Once their job is gone, so is their 
social support and a significant part of their identity," says Auerbach, a 
financial public-relations consultant and former Los Angeles Times reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, to help former IBMers make the transition into the real world, 
Auerbach started "Out of the Blue" with Rick Weiner, a former IBM 
communications manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a 'zine for college kids, it gives tips on surviving in the world and 
provides a forum for frank discussion. Articles focus on finding new jobs ("The 
100-Day Job Search" "Job-Hunting Expenses: What Can You Deduct?"), life after 
IBM and updates on the doings at the traditionally hermetic Big Blue. And on 
the last page is The Jobs Board, which lists openings across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly enough, "Out of the Blue" has good relations with IBM. "They've 
put up no roadblocks for us," says Auerbach. "Out of the Blue" even has a few 
subscriptions from IBM offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they're doing a little research on the outside world. Andrew Asch

OUT AND ABOUT; AT THE BOOKWORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Friday, August 5 is a busy day in the basement studios of KCRW at Santa Monica 
College, where Michael Silverblatt produces and hosts the Bookworm show. 
</P>
<P>
 First in the recording studio is best-selling author Erica Jong, on tour to 
promote her memoir, "Fear of Fifty" (HarperCollins, 1994). Jong, poised and 
urbane, is delighted to have a conversation and not the usual 3 1/2 minute 
talk-show segment. Silverblatt, famously erudite, speaks slowly, with great 
deliberation. Their exchange is a fluent academic jousting, each offering 
insights into Jong's work while staying atop a torrent of allusions to Lessing, 
Nabakov, Henry Miller, Anais Nin, Whitman, Burgess. "This is fun," Jong 
exclaims. "You're so well read!" 
</P>
<P>
 As Jong leaves, she meets the Bookworm's next guest, Benjamin Weissman, in the 
hall. "Look," whispers someone in the control room. "The Zipless F--- meets 
Kafka." 
</P>
<P>
 Nervous and alert, Weissman, a Los Angeles native, has recently published his 
first book, a highly praised book of short fiction, "Dear Dead Person" (High 
Risk/Serpents Tail). The atmosphere in the recording booth becomes intense, 
almost hypnotic: In speech as in his writing, Weissman puts a lot of pressure 
on his language. Silverblatt and Weissman, old acquaintances, quickly find 
their own literary meeting ground: writers Thomas Bernhard ("His meanness is so 
profound and funny," says Weissman) and Robert Walser ("A melancholy and teeny 
writer," says Silverblatt). 
</P>
<P>
 "See?" Silverblatt says afterward. "You can be as esoteric as you want on this 
show. There is a literary culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Both shows will air in October, when the Bookworm starts national syndication. 
"I'm being encouraged to go on with stars," says Silverblatt, "but I'm not 
going to give up my underground, wild newcomers." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, August 25 at Occidental College, Maxine Hong Kingston, author of 
"Woman Warrior" speaks at Orientation. As if to model the kind of clear 
thinking and social conscience a good liberal arts education can foster, she 
talks about her personal concerns with peace, community and the creative 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 She reads from a work-in-progress, "The 5th Book of Peace." The first chapter 
is a harrowing account of the Berkeley fire in which she lost both her home and 
the first draft of the book -- "The Fourth Book of Peace."(There were 3 
previous "Books of Peace" in China, all burned in cultural revolutions.)  
</P>
<P>
 She interrupts her reading to discuss possible revisions. In one paragraph, 
she wonders if she should say the killing in the Persian Gulf war was evil or 
wrong . And, if she has written that the fire was sent to show her something, 
she must be able to say who sent it. If she says God sent the fire, does she 
really believe that? "All of this I have to get straight with before I write 
the second draft." 
</P>
<P>
 After the fire, Hong Kingston decided she would no longer write in solitude 
and isolation, but "in peace and community." She formed a workshop with war 
veterans. "We work together, write, read, and meditate." When she first heard 
the veterans' stories, she came away in physical distress and a kind of 
"spiritual agony." "But I know, just by listening, I alleviate their pain." 
What inspires her to keep listening and to make art from what she hears is an 
ancient image of pain transformed: the Hindu god Shiva, who drinks in the 
poison of the world, turns blue and dances and does not die.

PALM LATITUDES: CLOSE-UP; LORD OF THE FLIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 When his father died, 10-year-old Bill Blackstone sought solace by going 
fishing on the Santa Clara River. It was there that he met Charlie Funk, who, 
with a quick lesson in tying flies, hatched the career of one of the world's 
best fly-tyers.For the next decade, the boy "pestered this man, this new father 
figure" about the finer points of winding feathers, furs and hackle around 
hooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 61 and living in Orange, Blacksone's flies sell for as much as $300. The 
retired mechanical contractor makes more than 275 stunningly realistic fake 
bugs a year and donates most of them to the Federation of Fly Fishers. The 
group auctions them and donates the money to various river conservation groups. 
 
</P>
<P>
 These days, his flies aren't just effective, they're ecological. He recycles 
manila folders, produce bags, wool yarn, vinyl and other materials to fashion 
lifelike dragonflies, crane flies, katydids, grasshoppers and his signature 
fly, the $300 black stonefly. "I started using synthetics in disgust at how 
expensive materials were," Blackstone says. "It stopped my heart. I decided I 
could, gosh, almost use the trash on the floor. I'm building beetles using 
artificial fingernails," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best in the world," says Pete Parker, a director of the annual 
International Sportsmen's Exhibition. Blackstone's greatest compliment, says 
Parker, comes "when people reach for a fly swatter." R. Daniel Foster

OVERSTATED DICHOTOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wendy Doniger's review of John Boswell's "Same Sex Unions in Premodern Europe" 
(July 31) captures the arguments and even the feel of the book. But she 
overstates a small part that goes to the core of Boswell's case. She says: "For 
the early church created a violent dichotomy between heterosexual marriage, in 
which sexuality was tolerated for the sake of children, and the priesthood, in 
which asceticism was idealized and sexuality entirely rejected." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, first millennium Christianity did not make such a "violent dichotomy" 
between sex and church, and that is one of Boswell's most important lines of 
evidence for same-sex unions. While early Christian thinkers considered 
celibacy and abstinence the highest state of spiritual devotion not only for 
those who practiced asceticism but for people getting married, in actual 
practice, early Christianity was ambivalent, contradictory and unsettled about 
sex and relationships throughout the first millennium. 
</P>
<P>
 * Local priests were allowed to marry. Not until the second half of the 
millennium, were bishops not allowed to marry. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marriage was considered a state function. The Christian "blessing" of even a 
heterosexual marriage was not performed regularly but done as a favor. 
</P>
<P>
 * In this context, the Church performed "blessings" on any number of 
relationships: marriage, same-sex relationships, households, business 
partnerships, adoptions, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 * Priests, however, were forbidden to have same-sex relationships "blessed" 
(an indication that same-sex blessings may have involved sexual relationships). 
</P>
<P>
 Boswell argues that in a context of such sexual pluralism within Christianity 
and the culture at large, same-sex unions appear plausible. The "violent 
dichotomy" between the Church and sexuality occurred in the second millennium 
when Christianity institutionalized heterosexual marriage as a sacrament, 
prohibited sexuality among clergy, marginalized blessing ceremonies and 
campaigned against women and homosexuality. 
</P>

<P>
 John Boswell's consistent use of the terms Christian and Christianity where he 
really means Catholic or religious is misleading. It is a documented fact that 
the origins of the Catholic faith include the incorporation of rituals and 
practices common to the pagan religions of the time. This would explain why 
Boswell's research discovered what seemed to be acceptance of homosexual 
relationships and the encouragement of chastity within marriage. Both behaviors 
find their roots in pagan worship and neither can be supported by Scripture. 
The Bible is very clear in placing sexuality within the confines of a 
heterosexual marriage. "Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed 
kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually impure" 
(Hebrews 13:4 NIV). Serious study into early church history will reveal that a 
body of true Christians existed in the shadow of the Catholic church whose 
activities were characterized by a close adherence to undefiled Biblical 
teachings. Boswell's "Christians" were most likely not true Christians by 
definition, since they obviously did not understand nor follow the teachings of 
the New Testament.

BREAKING THE SILENCE; THE SILENT ANGEL, BY HEINRICH BO LL . TRANSLATED FROM THE 
GERMAN BY BREON MITCHELL (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: $19.95; 182 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ursula Hegi, Ursula Hegi is the author of Stones from the River and Floating 
in My Mother's Palm. She is working on a book of interviews with Americans born 
in Germany between 1939 and 1949. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I was growing up as a girl in the silence of postwar Germany, Heinrich 
Boll wrote about what other adults wouldn't speak about. From him -- not from 
my family or teachers -- I began to learn about German soldiers, about war 
widows and war orphans, about the impact of the war on the survivors. It was a 
time when most Germans were using their energies to forget the war, to push 
forward into a clean and tidy future by rebuilding bombed out buildings, by 
creating a history for their children that would make it impossible for them to 
ask questions about the war. I took Boll's books with me to Catholic boarding 
school as an adolescent, packed them into my suitcase when I immigrated to 
America as an 18-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 When Boll died in 1985 -- a Nobel laureate and internationally acclaimed 
author -- the manuscript of his first novel, "Der Engel Schwieg" ("The Silent 
Angel") had lain unpublished for 34 years. It would remain unpublished for 
another seven years, before it would be presented to German readers and become 
a major success. 
</P>
<P>
 This stark and brilliant novel of a German soldier's return from the war, came 
to publishers in 1950, when it simply did not fit into the German practice of 
silence. Boll, who had only published one novella so far, promised in his 
letter of submission: "Nothing is told about the war itself, and hardly 
anything is said about the postwar period. . . . The novel simply portrays the 
people of the time and their hunger . . . a generation that knows that there is 
no home for them on this earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Boll's protagonist, the soldier Hans Schnitzler, never reveals what he did in 
the war. Hans simply does not think about the war. And yet, he is surrounded by 
the evidence of war, by the untold horrors that manifest themselves in the 
destroyed landscape, in the gray-faced survivors who move through their days 
like shadow phantoms, in the heavy and sour and cold air, and in the desperate 
drive of hunger. 
</P>
<P>
 The first bread Hans eats upon his return from the war is given to him in a 
hospital by a nun. It is stale; yet, to him it tastes sweet. "While he ate with 
his right hand he held the loaf fast in his left, as if someone might come and 
try to take it from him, and he saw his hand lying on the bread, thin and 
dirty, with a deep scratch that was soiled and scabbed." 
</P>
<P>
 The day of receiving his orders for military training is far more vivid in 
Hans' mind than the war. "That first tormented afternoon seemed to him worse 
than the entire war." Boll's portrayal of Hans Schnitzler's mother evokes the 
sorrow of every woman who has ever lost a child to war. Hans remembers his 
mother's sob when he received the registered postcard with his orders that 
summon him to Adenbruck, a "long, dry sob . . . a sob that contained 
everything, all the horror not one of them could have known about then." 
</P>
<P>
 Though his body tries to survive in a country that has suddenly been thrown 
into peace, his soul mourns his survival. He envies the dead, because to go on 
living is so much worse. "Your husband stole my death," he tells a woman whose 
husband saved him by trading uniforms with him before Hans could be shot as a 
deserted by the Germans. "I couldn't have that quick, clean death; he had to 
take it for himself. . . . He'd made a good bargain." 
</P>
<P>
 Hans is not the only one who would have chosen death over life. He meets 
Regina Unger, a war widow, who too was left behind in life when her infant son 
was killed by a German machine gun. In their encounter, Boll creates a brittle, 
intense love between two people who are bewildered that they still are capable 
of love. Love is not part of wanting for them because their wanting has been 
focused on death and food and warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 Breon Mitchell's translation from German into English is strong and accurate. 
Mitchell, who also translated Kafka's "The Trial," stays as close as possible 
to the pattern of Boll's language, preserving the original austerity of the 
novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Though "The Silent Angel" was initially rejected for publication, the material 
stayed alive for Boll, who worked themes and details from the manuscript into 
some of his future works. Given Boll's letter to his publisher, it might be 
intriguing to speculate if indeed it is his character, Hans Schnitzler, who has 
blocked his memories of the war, or if this became an authorial decision in 
order to find a readership. After all, Boll was desperately poor and worried 
because he could not support his family with his writing. "My wife can't take 
any more, I can't take any more," he wrote to his friend, Paul Schaaf. "I've 
simply undertaken something impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, considering the impressive body of Boll's later work and his 
unwavering commitment to explore the consequences of the war, it seems to me 
that despite his letter to his publisher, Boll knew that "The Silent Angel" was 
about the war, that he intended it to be about the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the war is there. 
</P>
<P>
 In every description. 
</P>
<P>
 In every gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 In every silence.

ALIEN NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Susan Dewan's review of "Abduction" by John Mack accepts the notions that 
so-called "UFO abductees" bring back wisdom from kindly aliens, concerned for 
Earth's welfare. She says this near-universal message is "much more important 
than the endless debate over whether UFOs are real. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, no "abductee" has ever announced any news that was simultaneously true 
and unambiguous, and that Earthly science did not already know. Shouldn't 
helpful aliens tell us about dangers that aren't already subject to Angst in 
our own, human media? Why no offers of new, cleaner technologies? These 
abductees only relate vague platitudes about kindness and sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 If aliens are so darn anxious that we're spoiling the planet, why not simply 
break into the airwaves and talk to us directly? They'd be TV sensations. We'd 
all pay close heed. In contrast, we hear vague rumors of kidnapings, 
wires-stuck-in-brains and weird impregnations, hardly the acts of honest, 
caring visitors. But "abductees" (and writers preying on these confused folk) 
never seem to notice this, or get angry at such purported behaviors. 
</P>
<P>
 Given horrific tales of criminality from above, one might imagine some support 
for the U.S. Air Force! Instead the government is unquestioningly portrayed as 
conspiratorially vile, an interesting reflection on the times, and a sad 
comment on the once highly-regarded John Mack. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Dewan's brusque dismissal of the bright, inquisitive and courageous 
young scientists involved in SETI (the Search for Extraterrestrial 
Intelligence) does both them and her an injustice. The topic is real and 
profoundly fascinating, worthy of attention by adults. Alas, it has been 
poisoned by the sort of uncritical, exploitative, sensationalizing volume Susan 
Dewan so gushingly praised. 
</P>
<P>
 DAVID BRIN, ENCINITAS 
</P>
<P>
 I can only assume you ran Susan Dewan's review of "Abduction" (Aug. 7) for 
laughs! Without even mentioning whether the book is a psychological evaluation 
of alleged UFO abductees or an assessment of their credibility, the reviewer 
wanders off into a wilderness of New Wave ideas, astonished by the revelations 
from other worlds (channeled through the abductees, of course) that we 
Earthlings are running amok. 
</P>
<P>
 To top it off, the reviewer casts aspersions at the SETI program (Search for 
Extraterrestrial Intelligence), while showing her complete ignorance of it. 
First, it is not government supported, as she contends, apparently having 
missed the news of its cancellation. Second, it does not seek extraterrestrial 
intelligence by "sending radio waves into space" as she writes, but by 
receiving them. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, she apparently does not realize that the only way to communicate 
through the vacuum of space (until we master gravity waves -- if they exist) is 
by electromagnetic waves. This truth begs a key question, which is ignored: If 
beings from other worlds are around, why aren't the airways full of their 
electromagnetic messages? 
</P>
<P>
 The picture accompanying the review (of a hubcap flying by some bushes) from 
Air Force archives provides the final guffaw. Did we forget that the USAF 
followed UFOs for years without finding any credible evidence of visitors from 
outer space?

GRIDIRON JOHN; TO MAKE CERTAIN NO ONE WILL LAUGH AT FOOTBALL ON FOX, RUPERT 
MURDOCH HIRED JOHN MADDEN. BUT CAN A 58-YEAR-OLD, LOUDMOUTHED EX-JOCK FIND 
HAPPINESS IN THE LAND OF BART SIMPSON? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN MITCHELL, Los Angeles writer Sean Mitchell's last piece for this 
magazine was on Nashville's country-music boom. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten weeks before today's season opener, on a hot Los Angeles afternoon, the 
lobby of the Century Plaza hotel is humming with people who look like they've 
arrived at more than a convention. Here they come, striding purposefully in 
dark- suited teams of three or four, a blur of teeth and cuff links, slim 
briefcases and heels, the men and women who own, manage or sell time for the 
stations of the no-longer-upstart Fox network. At this summer's affiliates 
meeting, there is excitement and tension in the air, and not just at the 
prospect of next season's episodes of "Melrose Place" or the thought of what an 
earthquake might feel like. This is more about what the NFL is going to feel 
like on each of these fine Rupert Murdoch-fed stations.  
</P>
<P>
 Don't you know it's going to feel good? At least for a while. At first, the 
presence of the National Football League on Fox on Sunday is going to feel 
wonderfully strange and, well, newsworthy , or a helluva lot more newsworthy 
than "Models Inc." or even "The Simpsons." If you're one of those in attendance 
at the Century Plaza, chances are that for seven months you've been looking in 
the mirror every morning and repeating the mantra: "NFL. NFL. NFL." Maybe you 
pinched yourself to make sure you weren't dreaming and then shouted, "Playing 
with the big boys now, you damn betcha!" 
</P>
<P>
 If, on the other hand, you are not an employee of Fox or one of its stations 
and are old enough to remember the Korean War, it's quite possible you assume 
the NFL was in part created by and for CBS and that Fox is television's version 
of the Mustang Ranch, and you therefore view this whole deal as the newest 
proof that everything is worse than it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Even for the believers, there is, of course, the matter of whether this will 
work in the numbers department or end up as the biggest cost overrun since the 
B-1 bomber. Last year, Murdoch, desperate to get a major sports franchise for 
his overmatched network, outbid CBS by roughly $400 million, paying $1.58 
billion for the four-year rights to the NFL's big-dog NFC division (Cowboys, 
49ers, Giants) and dunning the affiliates $30 million a year to help defray the 
cost.  
</P>
<P>
 The estimates by some market analysts that losses could amount to as much as 
half a billion over four years are cause for a few skipped heartbeats in the 
privacy of the rooms upstairs. But if any of the affiliates are nervous on this 
day, all they have to do to fortify themselves is take a good, long look at the 
comforting figure of John Madden, who is on the premises most assuredly for 
that very purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach! There he is! The beloved pitchman and CBS telestrator commentator, 
big-footed American hero of the interstate, the blue-collar pope of 
professional football himself has come along in Murdoch's bargain as the 
ultimate insurance that no one will be able to laugh at football on Fox with 
John Madden calling the plays.  
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted John, we needed John," says a Fox executive. "Back in January, the 
press was asking, 'Will we see Al Bundy in the booth? Will we see Bart Simpson? 
Is this the end of Western civilization as we know it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Madden gifted the affiliates with a luncheon pep talk, but 
now he is camped in an upstairs lounge, nursing a diet Coke and recalling the 
dark December day when the unthinkable happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a Friday afternoon. And I was going to Detroit to do the 49ers," says 
Madden, who is conspicuous in these surroundings not just because of his 250 
pounds but because he's dressed in a droopy blue warmup suit with a lavender 
baseball cap pulled down on his head. "And I was on my bus, and I got a call 
and someone told me that Fox might get football. And I assumed that Fox would 
get football, but that they would get a part of it. Like when ESPN came in with 
a Sunday night game, and TNT came in with a Sunday night game. The NFL would 
give 'em a little piece. And then they said CBS was going to get out of it, and 
I said, 'Nah, never happen.' I laughed it off." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, after all, had been broadcasting the NFL for 38 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I got another call in the bus, telling me that Fox got it. I still didn't 
believe it. I got into Detroit, got to the hotel, and all the production people 
were there, and Pat, and we're sittin' around, and the word started comin' in 
and we got the official announcement that Fox had the NFC and we didn't have 
anything. None of us saw it comin'. No one. I told (former player and 
commentator) Matt Millen, who called me in Detroit, it was like an old drill we 
used to use in football called 'bull in the ring.' You put one guy in the ring, 
and then you number all the players around the ring, 1 through 10." Madden is 
pointing now, just like on television, and his mouth is picking up steam. 
"Coach calls out '2', and the guy (2) comes running out, and you have to hit 
him. Then he calls '5,' and he comes running out, and you'd have to turn and 
hit him, you know?" "I told Matt, that was like playin' 'bull in the ring,' and 
the coach calls '2' and 10 comes!"  
</P>
<P>
 Boom.  
</P>
<P>
 Is this a match? John Madden and Fox? 
</P>
<P>
 A FEW WEEKS LATER, MADDEN IS BACK IN LOS ANGELES. HE IS WEARING A coat and tie 
this time, seated on a stage in a ballroom at the Universal City Hilton, where 
Fox is introducing its 1994 lineup to the nation's television critics. Onstage 
with him, sitting in a row between some faux Roman columns, are Fox Sports 
President David Hill; Ed Goren, Fox Sports executive producer for the NFL 
broadcasts; Tracy Dolgin, executive vice president of marketing, and 
second-string play-by-play man Dick Stockton. There is a big-screen TV 
overhead, which has just exploded in a reel of loud, frantic Fox football 
commercials, in which Green Bay Packer defensive end Reggie White is seen 
crushing quarterbacks in a series of quick cuts, followed by Madden hurtling 
down the highway in his bus to a tune modeled after Chuck Berry's "Johnny B. 
Goode."  
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the reel, Hill walks to a podium, looks out to his audience and 
proudly utters three words: "Rock and roll."  
</P>
<P>
 Dolgin steps up, and with a pointer and some video charts as a visual aid, 
promises the critics "the biggest media blitz in sports history" to get America 
ready for the NFL on Fox. He also vows that Fox will "grow the NFL audience." 
Then Goren takes over and gets his biggest response from the critics when he 
reveals Fox's plan to air regular "anti-violence" messages from leading NFL 
players. Many of the critics break into laughter. The irony evidently is lost 
on Goren.  
</P>
<P>
 As is his manner on occasion, Madden deflects a pointed question about 
violence in the game and returns to a less dangerous part of the field, 
choosing to decry the league salary cap and its effect on player movement. "I 
have trouble seeing Joe Montana in a Kansas City uniform," he says about the 
former 49er quarterback. "And Reggie White should always be a Philadelphia 
Eagle."  
</P>
<P>
 No doubt there are those who feel the same way about John Madden no longer 
wearing a CBS blazer.  
</P>
<P>
 "You've got new and different, and you've got the same," Madden said earlier, 
pondering the change this season for him and his 14-year sidekick, former New 
York Giants end and place-kicker Pat Summerall. "Every time you think you got 
the same, you look and say, 'Ooohh, it's new and different.' And every time you 
think it's new and different, you say, 'Now, look, it's the same.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Madden perhaps can be expected to accentuate the positive since Fox is paying 
him about $8 million a year (three times his CBS salary) to do what he has 
always done, that is, to be himself: the average guy ascended to a throne of 
wisdom. And he wasn't going to be able to be himself on CBS anymore unless he 
wanted to start narrating golf or the Winter Olympics. Which wouldn't have been 
the real John Madden, he says. Anyway, with the heartache of leaving CBS behind 
him -- Summerall compared it to a death in the family -- Madden is now making 
more than any player in the league, an achievement that can be seen as a mark 
of television's final takeover of the NFL.  
</P>
<P>
 As the former coach of the "renegade" Oakland Raiders, an infrequent (as in 
never) flier and all-around Earthman, Madden is what passes for unorthodox in 
the culture of the NFL and so matches up somewhat with Fox's perception of 
itself as an outlaw network. But he is also 58, a fierce traditionalist about 
an increasingly glitzoid game, and he does not eat breakfast to the sound of 
Guns N' Roses. He's a no-nonsense guy going to a network that to many has so 
far been little but nonsense. Take a glance at some of the MTV-inspired 
promotional spots for Fox football and try to imagine Madden designing them, 
not to mention diagramming them.  
</P>
<P>
 Or take Fox's assembly-line slogan: "Same Game. . . .New Attitude." Not the 
sort of hype you expect from the lips of the truth-telling coach -- not 
counting, of course, when he's in front of a camera hawking some product. There 
would appear to be some potential for cultural dissonance between man and 
network.  
</P>
<P>
 Here's how the Fox press guide describes the improvements planned for the Fox 
broadcasts: "12 manned cameras, two of which are dedicated for super slow 
motion replays, and eight tape machines, with two designated for super slow 
motion replays. By comparison, a typical lead regular season NFC broadcast last 
year had eight cameras and no more than six tape machines. The mobile 
production truck from which (producer and director) will work is the Super 
Shooter 12, housing a state-of-the-art Grass Valley 3000-3 switching system and 
the Abekas A-51 digital effects unit." In addition, they'll be broadcasting in 
Dolby Surround Sound with four parabolic microphones picking up the raw sounds 
of combat at the line of scrimmage.  
</P>
<P>
 Here's the way Madden describes these improvements: "We have a new truck, and 
I think we're gonna have some more cameras."  
</P>
<P>
 Of the many un-Madden innovations in the NFL over the years (artificial turf, 
TV timeouts, coaches calling the plays) Madden reserves a special distaste for 
the "luxury boxes," the corporate penthouses that now ring the NFL's newer 
stadiums. "I just cringe when I go by and see them," he says. Fox's one-hour 
pregame show will include a feature called "SkyBox," in which a glamorous woman 
reporter, Lonnie Lardner, will chat with Hollywood celebrities about the game 
in a simulated luxury box. The names "Jack" and "Spike" are mentioned.  
</P>
<P>
 Madden distances himself from all this, saying simply, "The difference is 
going to be in the pregame show, showing more players, more faces. Getting to 
know the player better. The different stuff will happen before the kickoff. 
Then when you get to the game, once they kick it off, you cover that. You cover 
the game. We're not getting five downs or anything. It's going to be the same 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 And he will still be John Madden. He will still travel between game cities on 
his customized Greyhound bus, as he has done since abandoning Amtrak in 1986 
and jetliners before that. He is getting a new bus this season that is five 
feet longer than the old one. "I have everything I need. It's got four 
television sets, all with VCRs. I watch game tapes more than anything. It's got 
telephones and faxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, Madden travels alone, except for two drivers. His wife of 34 
years, Virginia, a retired schoolteacher and former bar owner, rarely joins 
him. (His son Joe, 28, oversees Madden's production company; son Mike, 31, is 
in real estate development.)  
</P>
<P>
 As he's explaining all this, a smiling man with a camera, who happens to be 
vice president of sales for a Fox affiliate on the East Coast, butts in and 
wants his picture taken with the new voice of the NFL on Fox. Madden has no 
choice but to comply, yet he is clearly not pleased, especially when the fellow 
asks Madden to call him for dinner when he's next in town for a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not my favorite thing to do," the former coach says when the guy is 
gone. "That's not my favorite thing. I'm not very good at that."

 AFTER MURDOCH SHOT THE LIGHTS OUT AT CBS SPORTS LAST DECEMBER, Madden almost 
went to ABC to join "Monday Night Football." He also considered an offer from 
NBC, which is still going to carry the NFL's AFC games (Raiders, Oilers, 
Broncos). In the end, he went to the highest bidder; it wasn't just the money, 
it was the chance to be the marquee player in a whole new sports department 
that only has one sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a television guy or some other sports. I'm just football, NFL 
football. And that's all Fox is."  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the hub of Madden's broadcast team has simply moved intact to Fox in 
a forced migration from CBS. In addition to Summerall, he'll have the same 
producer, director and stage manager, plus some of the same cameramen and audio 
people. Goren, his executive producer, is also a CBS man. 
</P>
<P>
 As Summerall says, "I won't be saying, 'Stay tuned for "60 Minutes" and 
"Murder, She Wrote." ' That much will be different." 
</P>
<P>
 No, he'll be telling viewers to stay tuned for the animated comedy "The 
Simpsons," which Fox is moving to Sunday night to take advantage of the NFL 
lead-in. Maybe this will not be so odd. To some, Madden himself is a cartoon 
character, the excitable guy who, in the '70s, used to race up and down the 
sidelines as the pink-faced coach of the Raiders, squeezed into polyester pants 
and a golf shirt, flinging his arms skyward in protest or celebration. Then he 
literally busted through walls and other barriers into all those Miller Lite 
commercials in the '80s, leading choruses of "Tastes Great! -- Less Filling!" 
He's done so many commercials -- for Ace Hardware, Krylon spray paint, diet 
Coke, Tinactin foot powder -- he finally built his own $750,000 Jumbo Studios 
near Danville, his Northern California home, where he can tape them without 
having to leave town. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in ad-crazy America, the commercials have done nothing to dent his 
"credibility" as a football analyst and, anyway, he will always have his 
bucketful of Emmys and coaching record with the Raiders to fill out his resume. 
It is a great record -- 103 wins, 32 losses, including a Super Bowl victory in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
 So many of the men who get paid to narrate football games, be they career 
broadcasters like NBC's Dick Enberg or ex-athletes like ABC's Frank Gifford, 
are almost interchangeable in their earnest attempts to seem respectable, to 
offend no one. Madden, on the other hand, while he has not courted controversy, 
has remained the NFL's star commentator by refusing to polish his jock talk. On 
the air he prefers to rip and snort his way to gridiron insight as though still 
in the locker room, strangling sentences in mid-thought because of his urgent 
need to get on to the next one.  
</P>
<P>
 This is what is known as being yourself, but in his view, being yourself can 
be, well, a difficult thing. "I mean, bein' yourself is never one thing," he 
says. "You have a lot of different selves. Which John Madden? There's a very 
serious John Madden, there's a light John Madden, there's a coach John Madden. 
That's the thing. It's not as simple as bein' yourself. I think that bein' 
yourself has to go deeply. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to commercial, and you're bein' yourself, it's all good 
stuff, but you're off the air. You say, 'I'm going to be myself,' and some 
guy's sayin', you know, 'Seven, six, five, four . . . two, one. . . .' Now I'm 
really myself! Well, hell, you're . . . it's a difficult thing. Which self? And 
then bein' a self within a framework of short spurts of time and not bein' able 
to think about what you're gonna do but react and bein' ready for everything 
because you don't know what's gonna happen. Some people don't have enough 
confidence to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Boom. 
</P>
<P>
 Madden's penchant for candor has led him to criticize aspects of the current 
game, from the epidemic of bad tackling and showboating to the corrosive effect 
of big money. "It's going to be hard to build up (fan) loyalties with free 
agency and all the movement (of players)," he reasons. "The owners can send a 
player off, and a player can leave on his own, but the fan has to stay there 
and take it. That's the reality of it, it's not going to change. But I don't 
think it's good."  
</P>
<P>
 Money is hurting the game in other ways, he believes. "See what happened, when 
they started raising ticket prices and gettin' luxury boxes and stuff, you 
started eliminating kids from going to the games. That's bothered me for a long 
time. Ever see a crowd at a Super Bowl? Count the kids at a Super Bowl. Count 
the football fans at a Super Bowl! Those things bother me."  
</P>
<P>
 Now, here's an unfit-for-Fox thought: The money that has flooded into the NFL 
during the past 25 years, bringing glitz and cowgirl cheerleaders and changing 
the game and leading to player movement and higher ticket prices and keeping 
the kids out of the stadiums, has come, as it has in baseball, largely from 
television -- that is, from the billions NFL teams make from the sale of 
broadcast rights. Television, which made John Madden into the wealthy American 
folk hero that he is, has also been responsible for tainting the game he loves. 
Has he ever stopped for a moment to mull this over?  
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't miss a beat in not answering the question. "The next generation, 
growing up with computers and video games," he says, "to get those kids, you're 
going to have to let 'em play along on television," with the kids interactively 
calling their own shots. "Murdoch is committed to this. That's how we're going 
to get the kids. You can't get 'em back in the ballparks."  
</P>
<P>
 WITH ONE WEEK TO GO BEFORE THE FIRST FOX NFL GAME, A PRESEASON match between 
the San Francisco 49ers and the Denver Broncos, the heat is on at Fox Sports 
headquarters on the KTTV lot in Hollywood. The whole idea of the NFL on Fox is 
such a novelty to the press that TV sports critics from around the country are 
closing in from every side. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting being a bug under a microscope," says David Hill. Hill, a 
hearty Australian who reminds you a little of Robin Leach and pronounces the 
name of the game futbull, has spent the last six years in London producing 
cricket and soccer matches with great success for Murdoch's Sky Sports. He has 
been busy today cleaning up some graphics problems, color keys and studio 
lighting requirements.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the last frontier of reality in television," the new Fox Sports 
president says fervently about the appeal of TV sports. "As sitcoms and other 
programs become more interchangeable, in sports you still have an uncertain 
outcome. It's not necessarily the guy in the white hat that gets to kiss the 
horse at the end. It's undeniably real." 
</P>
<P>
 What's also undeniably real is that despite some flashy high-profile shows, 
Fox has suffered a two-year decline in its ratings overall, attracting 7.2% of 
the nation's 94 million TV households last season, down from 7.7% in 1992-93. 
It needs the NFL, even at an initial loss, as an engine to propel its other 
programming and its 180-odd stations toward critical mass and top advertising 
dollars. The acquisition of the NFC games already has helped the network add 12 
stations in important markets and has convinced Madison Avenue that this year 
will be better. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Fox got the NFL deal," says Paul Schulman, a Manhattan-based buyer of 
network time for major advertisers, "it was credibility to the highest degree. 
People who in the past perceived Fox as the up-and-coming network changed their 
thinking to say, 'We now have four networks.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a TV sports franchise is no guarantee of success. CBS claims it was 
losing money under its NFL contract and most definitely lost money when it paid 
$1.6 billion for the rights to major-league baseball. And CBS was not trying to 
establish a network at the time.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think you'll see the Fox numbers come across pretty strongly," Schulman 
says. "I don't know if they will match identically the numbers that CBS got a 
year ago when they averaged a 13 rating, but I think Fox will be darn close. 
And remember, it's Year 1, and Fox is growing." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the first network sports department to be based in Los Angeles, and as 
Hill hustled to create it from scratch in six months, he was struck by the 
suitability of his new home. "I'm seeing an inter-pollination between a 
straight-down-the-middle sports production guy and a cameraman or paint-box 
operator or whatever who's just come off doing 'seaQuest' or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox is not alone in trying to put a hip-hop step in TV sports. Check out the 
music-video-like promos for "Monday Night Football" this season, or give your 
eyes and ears a 10-minute workout in front of the heavy-metal assault and 
graphic distraction of ESPN2, the new cable sports channel presumably designed 
for the sensory impaired.  
</P>
<P>
 Hill has assured the NFL that Fox will not trivialize the game while enlisting 
more advertiser-attractive young people to watch it. "The NFL has not had 
promotion in prime time," he explains. "We said to the NFL, 'Look, what we'll 
do is that, because we have a lot of young kids watching, we will promote it 
differently.' So that's where the tag 'Same Game, New Attitude' came from. So 
that's been the whole thrust of what we've been about: getting kids who if no 
one told them it was exciting. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 While he does not have an office here, Madden's presence is heavy in the air 
at Fox Sports, his name invoked with the gravity that would be accorded 
royalty. Ed Goren stretches the Madden mythology beyond the realms of devotion. 
'He'll tell you that all he cares about is football. But he's -- I don't know 
if he's a Will Rogers -- he's a great observer of people," says Goren. He turns 
around in his seat and points to a watercolor print of an adobe house in the 
desert. "If I brought 10 people in to look at that painting, 10 people would 
see the obvious in it, whatever the obvious is in that painting. John would see 
the obvious and then beyond. That's what makes him so unique." 
</P>
<P>
 John Madden, art critic! Who would have known? It brings to mind the 
possibility of a Fox spinoff modeled after the late John Candy's impersonation 
of Madden in a TV sketch in which the coach rambled through the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art in New York furiously tracing explanatory diagrams over the 
surface of Rembrandts and Da Vincis, just as he diagrams plays on television. 
"I Know What I Like: John Madden and the Art of the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 ON FRIDAY, AUG. 12, ORIGINATING from Candlestick Park in San Francisco, the 
NFL on Fox indeed comes to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Game time for this meaningless warm-up contest between the 49ers and the 
Broncos is 5 p.m., to fit into prime time in the East and Midwest. By 2 p.m., 
the silver-and-white Madden Cruiser is already parked next to the stadium. At 
2:40 p.m., the door of the bus swings open, and Madden, wearing tan slacks, a 
blue blazer and a tie, descends. Accompanied by his agent, a Fox publicist and 
stadium security personnel, he is ushered through a gantlet of snapping cameras 
to Gate D and up to the booth where Summerall will join him. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3:55, two black Lincoln Towncars edge their way through a small crowd on 
the stadium's perimeter drive and stop outside the Fox press shed. The doors 
open, and out of the second car steps Rupert Murdoch, with his wife, Anna, 
followed by Chase Carey, chairman and CEO of Fox Television Group. Murdoch, 
wearing a gray pinstriped suit, cranes his head to take in Candlestick, as if 
he's thinking, "So I own this now too."  
</P>
<P>
 Considering the enormous sum he has spent for the rights to the NFC and the 
projected losses over four years based on that sum, a reporter asks, by what 
means would he measure his football venture a success? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's already paid off," he says, claiming that the network as a whole is $150 
million ahead in total advertising sales from this same time last year. "And 
our stations have increased in value $400 to $500 million from before we had 
football." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Nelson, a Wall Street broadcast analyst for Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., 
is more skeptical. "I don't have access to all the numbers, but in my view, his 
acquisition of the NFL rights was more of a defensive act than an offensive 
one. They had hit the wall in their ratings prime time. A guy like Murdoch 
figures if you're not attacking, you're retreating, and he figures with his 
other endeavors, he could afford to take the risk of a 
$100-milllion-to-$200-million loss. He's going to make statements forever that 
they've made it back in such and such, but who can measure?" 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the press trailer, Murdoch takes a few more questions about what 
football means to Fox, offers a quip about Madden's salary, and then the baron 
of Fox is gone, presumably on his way to a very good seat.  
</P>
<P>
 Time for the show. On TV screens, a montage of helmeted NFL warriors along 
with electric guitars and the voice of Madden rise through an echo chamber as 
if out of a primeval gridiron mist: "It doesn't get any better than this" marks 
the beginning of the Fox era in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 After the kickoff, the first thing that looks different is a little graphic 
strip in the upper left of the screen bearing the game clock and the score. It 
will stay there throughout the broadcast, recalling the same device used in the 
World Cup soccer matches. On the air, Madden points it out, commenting: "You 
can go away and come back, like if someone's cooking dinner or somethin', and 
you'll always know what the score is. Or you could use the clock to cook the 
roast by." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers score quickly, after quarterback Steve Young completes his first 
seven passes, prompting Madden to say, "If you had to start a team today with 
one guy, I don't know that Steve Young wouldn't be the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 The much discussed line-of-scrimmage audio is noticeable, but mainly it seems 
to intensify the sound of the referees' whistles and the jagged crowd roar 
while picking up the occasional "get 'em" from a defensive player. The game is 
simply louder on the screen. Also noticable is the recurring Fox graphic, a 
cubic logo that shouts "Fox/ NFL" as it washes the screen between slow-motion 
replays and live action. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of the first quarter, when 49er defensive end Richard Dent pops 
somebody pretty good, Madden says "boom." The moment does not go unnoticed by 
the history-conscious Fox publicity personnel. "Let the record show that the 
first Fox 'boom' from Madden came at 5:35 p.m. Pacific Time," one of them sings 
out happily.  
</P>
<P>
 It becomes apparent that one thing has not changed, and that is the way Madden 
makes his way effortlessly through a game, displaying a scholar's knowledge of 
both teams, their histories and tendencies. "The San Francisco running game," 
he says matter-of-factly, "is not a beautiful thing." Could Frank Gifford say 
something that true and simple?  
</P>
<P>
 The coach reveals an immediate affinity for rookie 360-pound Bronco offensive 
tackle Kevin Farkas but also has the thought, which he shares with viewers: 
"How would you like to be the bench, and here comes Farkas?"  
</P>
<P>
 Boom. 
</P>
<P>
 Between plays, a Fox camera brings in a beautiful close-up of the moon, and 
Madden expresses his wonder by saying, "Do you believe the cow ever jumped over 
that thing?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the trailer, Vince Wladika, head of Fox Sports media relations, is 
ecstatic. "I can't believe I work for this guy! Is he great!" 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers win the game without much opposition from the Broncos, the final 
score 20-3. It is all over at 7:55. 
</P>
<P>
 For David Hill and company, champagne is probably on ice somewhere in the 
immediate vicinity. There have been no major glitches -- at least none apparent 
to viewers. Fox has broadcast an NFL game, and the NFL does not seem 
substantially altered by the experience. On the other hand, maybe the shock 
will not fully register on the NFL's aging television constituency all at once. 
Maybe it will take until opening day and beyond for fans to realize that this 
was a little like what Madden said about the "bull in the ring" drill. Seemed 
like coach was always calling out CBS, ABC or even NBC, but damned if it isn't 
Fox coming at you now.

By Edna O'Brien, Novelist and short story writer Edna O'Brien, whose work 
appears frequently in New Yorker, lives in Ireland. Her most recent novel is

 "Just you wait, Henry Higgins, just you wait," Eliza Doolittle says, advancing 
the threat of equality, or maybe even superiority, over her cranky mentor, 
Professor Higgins. Everyone I know is waiting, and almost everyone I know would 
like to rebut it, since it is slightly demeaning, reeks of helplessness and 
shows we are not fully in command ourselves. Of course, we are not. In his book 
on Jean Genet, Sartre says, "To Be is to belong to someone." He was speaking in 
particular about Genet the orphan child, who felt he had never belonged and 
therefore never was. Orphans or not, the pain and seeming endlessness of 
waiting begins at the cradle, goes through many permutations, assumes various 
disguises but is as native to us as our breathing. Some do it discreetly, some 
do it actively, some keep so abreast of things that their determination not to 
wait is in itself a kind of latent waiting. One thing is sure, nobody is proud 
of it except perhaps Job. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the angry waiting, the plaintive waiting, the almost cheerful waiting 
in which we believe for certain that the phone call or the revelation will 
occur presently. All these states, of course, overlap and can bafflingly 
succeed and re-succeed each other in a matter of minutes. For sheer brutality, 
the telephone waiting, in my opinion, takes precedence insofar as it can (and 
does) ring at any moment. I think with no small degree of apprehension of the 
promised future when, thanks to the optic fiber in our computers, we will be 
able to see and, worse, be seen by the recalcitrant caller, and imagine how 
hard it will be to explain away the puffy eyes, the umbrage, the piled-up 
dishes, in short, the depression and inertia that attends waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there anything good about it? Well, there are some fine moments of 
literature founded on excruciation. There is, toward the end of "Godot," that 
wonderful exchange between the two characters: 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't come?" "No." "And now it's too late." "Yes, now it's night." 
</P>
<P>
 And there are hordes of fictional heroines -- I am thinking at this moment of 
those of Patrick White and Karen Blixen in outbacks waiting for the arrival of 
the promised one, and there is a scene in Zola's "Nana" that to my mind 
surpasses all others in its depiction of that malady. A philandering count who 
suspects his wife of adultery stations himself outside the paramour's window at 
2 in the morning to watch the room, a room he has once visited so he knows 
every detail: furniture, hangings, the water jug and so on. With what tension 
Zola depicts it -- the man waiting for a shadow to appear keeps thinking of the 
couple in bed, determining that at the first sight of a clue he will ring the 
bell, go upstairs despite the concierge's protest, break down the door and 
strangle them. Then, in his musing, he sees a silhouette spring to life in the 
dimly lit room and wonders if it is his wife's neck or a slightly thicker neck 
but cannot tell. Darkness again. Two o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock, and guess 
what happens. In the end he grows weary and decides to go home and sleep for a 
while and, in fact, misses the moment of verification that he had so achingly 
and so ardently longed for. We mortals weary of our vigils, unlike the animals 
who wait in the most concentrated and flexed way until the prey is caught. They 
seem unperturbed, possibly because they know they are going to succeed, and 
therein lies the secret of the sickness or the non-sickness of waiting -- the 
wait that is founded on hope and the wait that is founded on despair. 
</P>
<P>
 Do women wait more than men? I think women wait for men more than men wait for 
women and this despite the sisterly enjoinders that suppose that you can 
suppress instinct with statement. You cannot. We learn a few things as we go 
along, but we do not learn to love, to hate or to quarrel very differently. Men 
wait, too: They wait for the promotion, they wait for the kill, they wait for 
the prize, and one has only to watch the antics in Parliament or in the Senate 
to see with what libido each is waiting for his moment to rise and strike a 
blow that will vanquish his opponent. Very often this seems to me more 
impassioned than the very principle about which they are debating. Men wait for 
women, too, once they have decided this one is the one, but they wait more 
busily, and so the little atoms of dread are likely to be diffused and tossed 
up and down like a tennis ball or shuttlecock. Activity always leavens waiting, 
but now, of course, with a beeper connecting us to our own abodes, we can in 
some restaurant or gymnasium, as longing strikes, call our own number to 
discover whether or not our prayer has been answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Prayer itself is a form of waiting but fortified with a glimmer of faith -- or 
do I mean hope? For those who pray or chant with great perseverance, there is 
the suggestion that their waiting has been converted into purposefulness. Of 
course, we do not just wait for love; we wait for money, we wait for the 
weather to get warmer, colder, we wait for the plumber to come and fix the 
washing machine (he doesn't), we wait for a friend to give us the name of 
another plumber (she doesn't), we wait for our hair to grow, we wait for our 
children outside school, we wait for their exam results, we wait for the letter 
that is going to reveal the secret Grail, we wait for Sunday, when we sleep in 
or have the extra piece of toast, we wait for the crocuses to come up, then the 
daffodils, we wait for the estranged friend to ring or write and say, "I have 
forgiven you," we wait for our parents to love us even though they may be long 
since dead, we wait for the result of this or that medical test, we wait for 
the pain in the shoulder to ease, we wait for that sense of excitement that has 
gone underground but is not quite quenched, we wait for the novel that 
enthralls the way it happened when we first read "Jane Eyre" or "War and 
Peace," we wait for the invitation to the country, and often when we are there, 
we wait for the bus or the car that will ferry us home to the city and our 
props, our own chairs, our own bed, our own habits. We wait for the parties we 
once gave and that somehow had a luster that parties we now give completely 
lack. We wait (at least I do) for new potatoes, failing to concede that there 
are new potatoes all the time, but the ones I am waiting for were the ones dug 
on the 29th of June in Ireland that tasted (or was it imagination?) like no 
others. We wait to go to sleep and maybe fog ourselves with pills or soothing 
tapes to lull us thither. We wait for dreams, then we wait to be hauled out of 
our dreams and wait for dawn, the postman, tea, coffee, the first ring of the 
telephone, the advancing day. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting in a theater bar in a London interval to secure a drink is galling, 
convinced as I am that the ladies behind the counter are congenital 
teetotalers. Waiting in the post office in any city large or small sends me 
into a tizz. Waiting in one's place in the hairdresser's is another scenario 
devised to oust any semblance of grace or good manners, and hairdressers, if 
they are good at all, tend to cultivate suspense. How many times has one not 
sat on a stool along with other enraged victims fuming while the stylist 
lingered over a long head of hair as if he had just proposed to it? 
</P>
<P>
 While indoors, waiting has a touch of masochism, outdoors it takes on a 
martial turn. Out in the street we join the army of waiting people, to cross 
the road or not to cross the road, to catch the bus, to skewer some 
obstreperous mortal with the ferrule of an umbrella! Waiting for a taxi shows 
us in splendid pugilistic style. In New York one evening late, I waited and 
waited -- it was that fallow hour between 5 and 6 -- and eventually sighted a 
free taxi and hopped in only to find three gentlemen had got in by the other 
door, claiming they were first, refusing to get out, giving me, as it seemed, 
threatening Gallic looks -- they were Spanish -- while a driver with a vexing 
combination of ennui and insolence asked where it was we wished him to go. I 
refused to leave the taxi, they refused, and as we set out for a 
destinationless spot, it occurred to me that this somewhat risk to my person 
was preferable to having to get out onto the street and wait again. 
</P>
<P>
 Logic and waiting, at least to our Western sensibilities, are not great 
bedfellows. It ended happily; they dropped me on East 64th Street, refused 
money and even suggested a drink later on. 
</P>
<P>
 To wait for a taxi is one thing, but to wait for a friend is quite another, 
and as we know, there are those friends who are always late, because they 
cannot help it, or because they are so busy, or because time is not a factor 
that matters to them. One wonders what does matter. I used to endure it, but I 
no longer can. Ten minutes and I feel the implosion, 20 minutes and it's an 
explosion. One thinks of things that one could do. Knitting. Crocheting. One 
can neither knit nor crochet in the street. Tai chi. Except that I have not 
learned tai chi. Memorizing a poem or passage from Shakespeare. Except that I 
have not brought Shakespeare with me. No. The exasperation mounts, and by the 
time the friend arrives, the lurking umbrage for each and every wrong is 
unleashed and a happy evening endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be my race or my trade or it may be my childhood, but I seem to think 
that writers are worse at waiting than other breeds. As an aside, I think that 
fishermen are best. You see them on riverbanks, perched on their little stools, 
rod and line apparently motionless in the water, and they have the 
contemplativeness of cows chewing the cud. Not so writers, who, from their 
diaries, their confessions, their essays about their crack-ups, have less 
aptitude for it than others, which seems a contradiction since to write and 
rewrite requires infinite patience. I think it may be that unlike actors, brain 
surgeons or animal tamers, writers never really feel that they matter. The book 
is finished, it is sent away, the publication day is nine months hence, and on 
publication day one may or one may not receive a telegram or a bunch of 
flowers. Reviews trickle in but there is no palpable connection between the 
doer and the doing. The writer in that sense is a kind of perpetual exile from 
himself or herself. 
</P>
<P>
 To train myself in the art of waiting, I sometimes think of insufferable 
situations -- I think of people in prison having to fill up the hours, I think 
of people in hospitals or in asylums. I think of the Portuguese nun writing her 
dirges or that other nun, Heloise, who, after her lover, Peter Abelard, was 
castrated, went to a convent where, indeed, she still hoped that he might come 
for her, and I think of the last Empress of China as described by Sterling 
Seagrave in "Dragon Lady," this woman who had been chosen as a concubine at a 
very young age, left a widow, still at a very young age, spending the rest of 
her life inside the walls of the Forbidden City, her day starting with her 
toilet and then being dressed, flowers put in her hair, her breakfast of 
porridge and lotus leaves, gift baskets arriving, bolts of silks sent by 
courtiers, playing with her dogs, twisting blades of grass into the shapes of 
rabbits or birds, tending her flowers, a eunuch reading perhaps a piece of 
history or lore to her, playing a board game or painting onto silk, meals, the 
tiny dishes on little saucers that she mostly declined, and thinking of it I 
thank my stars that I was born in the West of Ireland in relative hardship and 
not in Imperial China. 
</P>
<P>
 This brings me to either the value or the futility of waiting, and I think one 
must distinguish between the two. The telephone waiting, the waiting for the 
miracle -- these seem in their way to be both crushing and ridiculous, because 
we all know that things do not happen when we wait too keenly. They happen when 
we least expect it. There is, however, a fertile kind of waiting that was 
brought to my attention by a piece written by Vaclav Havel that was called 
"Planting Watering and Waiting." He spoke of his own impatience while he was 
president of Czechoslovakia. He had wanted to achieve something visible and 
tangible, and it was hard for him to resign himself to the idea that politics, 
like history, is an emerging process. He was succumbing to a kind of 
impatience, thinking that he alone could find a solution to the problem. He 
thought he could but saw with enforced patience that the world and history are 
ruled by a time of their own, as are our lives, in which we can creatively 
intervene but never achieve complete control. He ended his piece with the 
beautiful image of planting something, of putting the seed in, of watering the 
earth and of giving the plant the time that is essential to it. One cannot fool 
a plant any more than one can fool history, was how he put it. I suppose the 
same is true for ourselves. One cannot force the hearts or minds of other 
people, or get them to do what we want them to do at the precise moment we want 
it. We can only wait and, perhaps like the Portuguese nun, convert our 
tribulation into lambent prose.

THE ONE-MAN ACADIAN LIBERATION FRONT; WHEN THE BRITISH EXPELLED THE ACADIANS 
FROM NOVA SCOTIA, THEY DIDN'T COUNT ON WALTER PERRIN. TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY 
YEARS LATER, THIS CAJUN LAWYER WANTS JUSTICE.

<P>
 Frowning mightily, Warren Perrin gazes around his garden. Clearly, something 
is amiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it the azaleas?" asks a visitor. "Do they look a little wilted?" 
</P>
<P>
 No, it isn't the azaleas. And it isn't the rhododendrons. Or the fishpond. Or 
the sandlot. 
</P>
<P>
 Then what is it? 
</P>
<P>
 "This," says Perrin, pointing at what should be a lawn. "I don't know why, but 
I can't grow grass." 
</P>
<P>
 His lawn has been resodded three times now, and a lesser person would have 
called it quits. Not Perrin. He has every intention of trying again. 
</P>
<P>
 A successful lawyer in Lafayette, La., Perrin loves a contest. Though small 
and hampered by bad vision, he tried out for and eventually captained a 
weightlifting squad that placed first in the nation four years in a row when he 
attended the University of Southwestern Louisiana in the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1972, just months out of law school, he took on Texaco. His more 
experienced colleagues said he couldn't win, but the rookie proved them wrong, 
forcing the oil giant to raise significantly the royalties it pays his parents 
to operate a natural gas recycling plant on a portion of their land. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Perrin has thrown down another gauntlet, challenging an 
institution more formidable than Texaco: the British government. His complaint 
this time has nothing to do with royalties, but with an event he calls "one of 
history's great wrongs" -- the peacetime expulsion of his Acadian ancestors 
from Nova Scotia in 1755. Some of these exiles -- a precise number has not been 
determined -- settled in Louisiana where, over time, the name "Acadian" evolved 
into "Cajun." 
</P>
<P>
 Perrin is seeking neither monetary damages nor the restoration of ancestral 
lands. He doesn't want an apology either because, he says, the government 
didn't order the expulsion; it was an action taken by a rogue officer, a man he 
calls "one of the Ollie Norths of this world." What he does want is: (1) that 
the British government admit that the Acadians were done an injustice; (2) that 
it order an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the expulsion; and (3) 
that the expulsion order be officially revoked. Until it is, he says, he and 
people like him remain exiles and, technically at least, risk arrest when they 
visit Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
 He lays such store by these demands that four years ago, he incorporated them 
into a petition and sent them to Buckingham Palace and 10 Downing Street. Oh, 
and there was something else: Perrin advised both Queen Elizabeth II and 
then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that unless he heard from them within 30 
days, he would file a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The next four weeks were long ones. If the British ignored him, he'd look 
ridiculous. "I'd be seen as a kook or a joke and be printed up in the offbeat 
column of the newspaper." And then, just a day before his deadline, the British 
Embassy in Washington called. Take no action, he was instructed. Someone will 
contact you within 24 hours. It was all very cloak-and-dagger -- only missing 
was a password -- but Perrin was ecstatic. He was contacted a day later by a 
lawyer retained by the British consulate general in Houston. And the two have 
been exchanging letters and phone calls ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 He holds up the file containing their correspondence. It's hefty. But beyond 
this tantalizing glimpse, he declines to describe their exchanges in any 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to keep that quiet," he says. "We agreed to negotiate in private and 
in good faith. Failing that, all bets are off." But he did divulge this: The 
British have made "some interesting offers." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he's confident that his three demands will be met sometime soon? Perrin 
invokes his favorite word. "Absolutely," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But the British are not so sanguine. "I don't think the government feels 
there's any particular point in having an official investigation or anything 
like that," says Helen Mann, Britain's vice consul in Houston. "And I don't see 
how you could possibly describe a contemporary Cajun as living in exile. To say 
that a Cajun who travels to Nova Scotia is breaking the law is a real stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 BEFORE I MET PERRIN, I'D HEARD OF THE TEXACO CASE AND HIS WEIGHTLIFTNG 
prowess. In the mental picture I had formed of him, he resembled Falstaff -- 
loud, impetuous, flamboyant. And big, of course, "a huge hill of flesh." But 
he's not like that at all. Slight and solemn and self-effacing, he's defiantly 
undramatic. Dressed in gray and as thin as a broomstick, he looks penitential. 
</P>
<P>
 He offers to take me to Erath, a little town 15 miles from Lafayette, where he 
has a branch office and runs a small museum. Our route takes us through fields 
of sugar cane and soybean. Perrin looks around appreciatively. "The land here 
is completely flat," he says. I am reminded suddenly of John Gay, the English 
poet who hated hills because they offended his sense of order. 
</P>
<P>
 Perrin's life has changed dramatically in the last five years. And all because 
of a question posed by one of his sons. "Why were the Cajuns thrown out of Nova 
Scotia?" the boy wanted to know. "What did we do wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
 "And I wasn't able to tell him," says Perrin. "Like most Cajuns at the time, I 
knew very little about our history." And so he began to read. And the more he 
read, the more livid he became. In 1755, Acadians numbering in the thousands 
were deported -- some to Europe, some to the West Indies, and some to the 
British colonies of Virginia, Massachusetts, Maryland and the Carolinas. The 
expulsions weren't just immoral, he says, they were illegal. Only a governor 
could order a deportation and, in 1755, Nova Scotia's governor was ill in 
London. By presuming to act on his behalf, Charles Lawrence, then a mere 
lieutenant governor, was exceeding his authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Why expel the Acadians at all? Two reasons, says Carl Brasseaux, a professor 
of Cajun history at the University of Southwestern Louisiana. At a time when 
Britain and France both sought control of North America, the French-speaking 
Roman Catholics were thought to pose a security threat. And then there was the 
matter of their lands. "Beginning in 1754," says Brasseaux, "Gentlemen's 
Quarterly in London ran a number of articles saying that probably the best 
farmland on the northeast Atlantic coast was in Nova Scotia, and since it was 
occupied by Papists, the time had come to turn it over to Protestants." 
</P>
<P>
 The diaspora decimated Nova Scotia's 15,000 Acadians. "It was genocide; a 
holocaust," says Brasseaux. By shipping the Acadians to places like Virginia 
and Massachusetts, "the overt intention was to force their absorption by the 
Anglo population," he says. But thousands died of exposure, malnutrition and 
disease. "Initially, the deaths were an offshoot of this (assimilation) policy. 
But over time, the policy changed. The goal now was not just to destroy the 
culture, but the people as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Brasseaux commends Perrin's efforts, but wonders if he isn't being too 
conciliatory. "I wouldn't be surprised if more militant voices emerge," he says 
-- a reference to a small but increasingly vocal group of lawyers in Louisiana 
and New Brunswick. "It may be that the British government is blowing a golden 
opportunity to extricate itself from this situation with minimal damage." 
</P>
<P>
 But Perrin has no intention of changing course. "I get letters probably once a 
month from somebody saying, you're not being aggressive enough; you need to 
file a lawsuit; you need to sue for $1 billion. Well, I accept no money from 
anybody, so it's still my petition. I prefer being conciliatory. Back a cat 
into a corner, and it's going to scratch your eyes out. But pet him, and you've 
made a friend." 
</P>
<P>
 TWO OF PERRIN'S CLIENTS ARE WAITING when we reach his office: a man struck by 
a car and another, a long-distance trucker, injured in a collision. I ask the 
trucker if he missed being able to work. "God, yes," he says. "Every time I see 
a rig, my heart aches." 
</P>
<P>
 Perrin specializes in personal-injury cases "to help the people I grew up 
with. My relatives and the people I know are working people -- people who get 
hurt offshore, hurt in accidents. I opened this office to represent them." 
</P>
<P>
 People drop by all afternoon, many of them just to chat. Since filing his 
petition, Perrin has become something of a celebrity. And not just in 
Louisiana. In New Brunswick, home to most of Canada's Acadians, he's seen as a 
hero. "The papers up there interview me all the time," he says. His fame has 
even spread to France where, in April, 1993, he was invited to address a 
human-rights conference in Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 His law office shares a one-story former bank building with the museum he 
founded five years ago. He did so, he says, "to try to excite the kids in the 
community about their heritage." A modest collection, most of the exhibits were 
contributed by townspeople: cooking pots, branding irons, letters, maps, quilts 
and numerous editions of "Evangeline," the Longfellow poem inspired by the 
Acadian exile. 
</P>
<P>
 There are photographs, too. By far the most startling is one of Perrin 
standing cheek by jowl with the achy-breaky-heart man, Billy Ray Cyrus. "It was 
taken at the Grammys a few years back," he says. "I went out there with D.L. 
Menard." Menard is known as the Hank Williams of Cajun music, and I mention 
admiring him a lot. "Heck, he lives just down the road," he says. "Come on. 
I'll take you to meet him." 
</P>
<P>
 Menard, all sprawling nose and jutting ears, is standing on the porch when we 
reach his run-down bungalow. "Come on in," he calls. "I've just made a fresh 
pot of coffee." Though it's mid-afternoon, the kitchen is in semi-darkness, 
everything painted a chestnut brown. "Have you seen this?" asks the 61-year-old 
performer. "It's a Hank Williams flask. Wind it up and it plays 'Your Cheatin' 
Heart.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Hank would have loved that," says Menard's wife, Louella. Then she returns to 
lecturing one of her grandchildren: "When I was your age, we got one pair of 
shoes a year. We had to learn to make them last." 
</P>
<P>
 She was 13 when she and her husband married. "How old were you?" she asks him. 
"Pushing 20," he says, sounding as if she had been his last chance. 
</P>
<P>
 The talk turns to lineage -- a Cajun obsession -- and Perrin tells them that 
his mother is expecting her first great-grandchild later that day. "It's good 
for her," he says. "My dad died in December. She needs this in her life." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time all day, Perrin looks relaxed, animated, telling us how his 
dad had served in the Pacific in World War II. "Who was your granddaddy?" 
Louella wants to know. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, the question delights him. He is among his own kind: the 
people he grew up with,the people he most admires. No trace of solemnity now. 
Warren Perrin is happy. 
</P>
<P>
 THREE WEEKS LATER, PERRIN drives me to St. Martinville, 15 miles from 
Lafayette, to see the Evangeline oak. Under this tree, the sundered lovers on 
whom Longfellow based his poem were supposedly reunited. "I would stress 
supposedly, " says Perrin, anxious, I think, that he not seem credulous. "It's 
all supposition." 
</P>
<P>
 In the poem, Evangeline, exhausted by her years of searching, becomes a nun. 
One day, treating victims of a pestilence, she recognizes a dying man as her 
former lover. When he expires, she dies of grief, and the two are buried 
together, finally united. 
</P>
<P>
 The oak is a massive thing covered in moss and extending in all directions. 
Under its branches sit four old men, their faces as gnarled as the tree that 
gives them shade. A few feet away flows Bayou Teche, its red-brown waters the 
color of an aging gumbo. The Evangeline oak is dying -- a situation viewed in 
St. Martinville with some dismay. Even if its claim to fame is spurious, this 
tree is a tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had Longfellow not written Evangeline in 1847, the expulsion would have 
become a footnote in history," says Perrin. "By touching the world's heart, he 
kept our story alive." 
</P>
<P>
 He looks tired; he is just back from a holiday in Mexico in the course of 
which a car bomb exploded in front of his hotel. But for all his fatigue, he 
remains optimistic that Britain in time will yield. "I believe that absolutely. 
If I didn't, I'd be fishing." 
</P>
<P>
 He describes himself as "obnoxiously positive" and says it serves him well. 
But at times, he reminds one of the young women in 19th-Century novels who 
delude themselves that a glance from a man could only mean he intends marriage. 
When, for example, English historian Robert Lewis came to Lafayette last April 
to attend a conference about the expulsion, Perrin decided that he had been 
sent there by the Foreign Office "to feel us out, to see what kind of people we 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an astounding development," he says. "His name was never publicly 
mentioned as being there officially. It was totally low key. (But) I know the 
British paid his expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 But contacted at the University of Birmingham, Lewis says he represented no 
one at the conference. "I was in no official capacity whatsoever." And he 
denies receiving any public money. "The university gave me 180 pounds, and I 
had a small grant to do research in Washington. I received no money from the 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis subsequently wrote to Perrin asking that he not tell people he was some 
kind of government official. Perrin promised that any future reference he might 
make to the historian would describe him only as an "interested observer." 
</P>
<P>
 Driving back to Lafayette, Perrin reaches into his box of cassettes. "What do 
you want to hear?" he says. "Cajun or Wagner?" To the rhythms of Beau Soleil, 
he explains the way exploring his history has changed him. "Discovering how the 
Acadians suffered has helped me to understand the sufferings of others," he 
says. "African Americans, for example. I recently hired a young black lawyer. 
Five years ago, I wouldn't have done that." 
</P>
<P>
 He calls his wife on the car phone to tell her he is bringing home a guest for 
dinner. "Is there anything I should pick up?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Get a box of yellow-cake mix," she says. "I'll make an apple crumble." 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe a lot to my wife," he says later. "When I get too involved, she kind of 
shakes me and says, 'Hey, there's more to life than this petition.' If it 
weren't for her, this would be a full-time obsession." 
</P>
<P>
 Does he ever fear he'll fail? "Absolutely not," he says. "I really don't. 
Failure is relative. You can always salvage something." 
</P>
<P>
 And if the British government sticks to its guns? What can be salvaged from 
that? There is a long pause. "I'll pursue this for life if I have to. But if I 
don't get an acknowledgment? Then at least I will have tried. A life placed at 
the service of a cause is a good life. It's a good way to be remembered." 
</P>
<P>
 He falls silent. And then, just for a moment, this "obnoxiously positive" man 
loses some of his confidence. "I always thought it would take five years. I 
think now it's going to take longer. I hate to set timetables, but if there's 
no breakthrough in, say, three months, six months, a year -- then I'll go ahead 
and file a lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, a court would have to weigh the merits of Perrin's claim that 
the exile was carried out in violation of English and international law of the 
time. But which court? Perrin's complaint involves three sovereign nations -- 
the United States, Great Britain and Canada. "Jurisdiction is a problem," he 
concedes. "No matter where I file, the British are going to say I'm in the 
wrong court. The case could end up in the European Court of Human Rights." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Perrin reaches home, his native optimism has again taken charge. 
He changes into jeans and a T-shirt. Opening a bottle of Medoc, he glances out 
at his garden. "That grass," he says, shaking his head. "First thing tomorrow, 
I'll order sod."

<TEXT>
<P>
 To fully appreciate a house designed by Mexico City architect Ricardo 
Legorreta, it's best to see it on a clear summer day with a blazing sun and a 
breeze rattling the palm fronds. Against the sky, his simple forms stand out 
like monuments, their colorful walls extending into the landscape, carving the 
space into inviting courtyards and pavilions, suggesting a model for 
indoor/outdoor life in a temperate climate. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, Legorreta is probably best known in Los Angeles for his bold, 
brightly walled revamp of Downtown's Pershing Square. But he has also designed 
three private houses on the Westside. This one, finished two years ago in 
Brentwood, combines his trademark simplicity with an elegant landscape that 
adds a series of fresh-air wings to the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The building itself -- which flows into its surroundings, its interior stone 
floors reappearing as terrace paving, its stucco walls embracing the garden -- 
sets the tone for the outdoors. Legorreta designed part of the landscape: the 
central courtyard and an L-shaped swimming pool with a sheltered spa and 
spilling fountains. The rest, created by L.A. landscape designer Mia Lehrer and 
Laguna Beach landscape architect Scott Sebastian, is laid out in rooms, each 
intended to be seen from indoor spaces, as if, says Lehrer, "the windows were 
pictures in a gallery." 
</P>
<P>
 From the living room, the view begins with a single date palm and extends 
across the court to the pool, a simple lawn and a grove of king palms. The 
kitchen overlooks a mixed forest of bamboo, while the windows of the master 
bath frame a splashy cutting border full of ground morning glory, blue 
hibiscus, Mexican bush sage, bird of paradise and assorted herbs. Other areas, 
such as a paddle tennis court and a children's play yard, are screened from 
view -- with more bamboo and thick plantings of pelargoniums. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as carefully blocked from sight is the slightest glimpse of the outside 
world. As in traditional Mexican gardens, the plein-air space is walled and 
private, with tall trees looming at its edges and a hint of jungle in its 
encroaching overgrowth. Within a few years, says Sebastian, "the place will 
have the feel of a hacienda in the Yucatan, with the old palms and the vines 
crawling over everything." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Lehrer points out, in acknowledgment of the local context, 
there's an urban feel to the courtyard with its many doors and balconies and 
its single, shadow-casting palm. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, she says, the aim of the design team was to fill the lot with 
intimate, usable spaces that correspond with the purity of the house. The 
designers ruled out foundation shrubs so that the walls meet the ground 
cleanly. They also limited their plant palette and massed the plants in keeping 
with the building's volumes. In terms of color, they meted it out, as Legorreta 
does, mitigating shades of green with the occasional spray of red bougainvillea 
and yellow hibiscus. 
</P>
<P>
 Such restraint, combined with elements of the unexpected, creates a powerful 
sense of place -- a timeless refuge rooted in the tropics but right at home in 
an arid city. SUSAN HEEGER

 Appreciating the imperfect, impermanent or incomplete isn't the way of the 
West. Yet such qualities, known collectively as wabi-sabi , have been 
celebrated by the Japanese for centuries . In his new book, " Wabi-Sabi : For 
Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers" (Stone Bridge Press), 
writer-architect-photographer Leonard Koren explores the traditional Japanese 
aesthetic through close-ups of the commonplace. "Things wabi-sabi often appear 
odd, misshapen, awkward or what many people would consider ugly," he writes. 
"They record the sun, wind, rain, heat and cold in a language of discoloration, 
rust, tarnish, stain, warping, shrinking, shriveling and cracking. Their nicks, 
chips, bruises, scars, dents, peeling and other forms of attrition are a 
testament to histories of use and misuse." Wabi-sabi -- a way of looking at the 
world to challenge the eye of the beholder.

BREAD AND BETTER; FROM AIR-DRIED DUCK TO BLTS, 5-YEAR-OLD CAMPANILE SHOWS NO 
SIGNS OF MIDLIFE CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's Sunday morning at the Hollywood Farmers Market, and if you want the 
sweetest strawberries or the tastiest tomatoes, there's no time to dawdle. 
Competition for the best produce is fierce. By noon, the crowd is six deep at 
my favorite tomato stand, and the heavy, vine-ripened fruits are just about 
gone. As I stop by to pick up my booty, a voice behind me calls, "Do you have 
the bag for Campanile?" They do. A big one. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, when I lunch at Campanile, the California-Mediterranean 
restaurant on La Brea Avenue, I have one of those juicy tomatoes. It is sliced 
thick, layered with applewood-smoked bacon and crunchy iceberg lettuce and 
sandwiched between a yeasty, marvelously textured "country white" bread smeared 
with homemade mayonnaise. The rustic loaf comes from La Brea Bakery next door. 
Every element in this sandwich is first rate, and it all adds up to a terrific 
BLT. 
</P>
<P>
 Since they opened Campanile in 1989, chef-owners Mark Peel and Nancy Silverton 
have searched out the very best raw materials. Prosciutto and melon here means 
wedges of glorious Chino Ranch melon dripping with juice and hand-cut slices of 
rustic prosciutto. The antipasto plate one day includes a heavenly 
down-to-earth salad of mixed beans, ranging from cream and pale green to 
mottled burgundy. I am lucky enough another night to snatch the last of the 
brassy golden zucchinis, their blossoms stuffed with fresh ricotta and 
julienned prosciutto and basil. In winter, Peel serves air-dried duck in a dark 
blood-orange sauce, playing the sharp, sweet-scented citrus against the rich 
duck flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 While most 5-year-old restaurants are heading for a midlife crisis, Campanile 
is actually getting better -- more enticing menus, more confident cooking -- 
which is saying a lot for a kitchen that turns out breakfast daily and dinner 
six days a week and somehow fits in lunch Monday through Friday. This is also 
one restaurant where a meal still builds from start to finish instead of 
fizzling at the main courses or the desserts. This captivating, highly personal 
food is very close in spirit to great home cooking: nourishing, comforting, 
completely delicious. Take soup. Who pays much attention to soup anymore? It's 
one of my favorite things here. I recently savored every spoonful of marvelous 
roasted parsnip soup.  
</P>
<P>
 The small menu, which changes daily for dinner and weekly for lunch, closely 
follows the seasons. If live soft-shell crabs or fresh sardines, say, are 
available, Peel will devise just the dish to show off these finds to best 
advantage. One night he wraps firm-textured wild bass in fig leaves before 
grilling the fish and then topping it with olives and a squeeze of lemon. Order 
a dish of vegetables for the table, and out comes a platter piled with whole 
onions roasted in their skins, new potatoes crinkled from the oven, grilled 
eggplant and zucchini and garlicky Blue Lake beans. He knows enough to let the 
vegetables speak for themselves. When Silverton found some Persian mulberries, 
in season for only six weeks each year, she chose to serve the sweet berries 
plain, topped only with a little cream.  
</P>
<P>
 The two were quite young when they first started cooking together; they were 
brash enough to take on Maxwell's Plum in Manhattan in the mid-'80s. Now 
they've got three kids of their own and a restaurant that has grown up 
alongside them. Campanile is very European in the sense that it is a hands-on 
family affair. A former student of agricultural economics who cooked at Chez 
Panisse in Berkeley and Spago, Peel, with sous-chef Tina Wilson, is in the 
kitchen while his wife concentrates on breads (assisted by plant manager George 
Erasmus) and pastries (with pastry chef Jon Davis). Silverton's thyme-scented 
rolls, big loaves studded with wine-dark olives, or Provencal fougasse formed 
into lacy ladders are the first pleasures of dining in their restaurant.  
</P>
<P>
 Campanile is set in a 1920s building topped with Moorish arches and a graceful 
eponymous bell tower. It is especially lovely at breakfast or lunch, when light 
streams in the high-ceilinged atrium with its Spanish tile fountain and potted 
olive trees. In the main dining room, diners are wedged elbow to elbow between 
the open kitchen and a wall decorated in abstract bas-relief. The back room, 
where tables are more widely spaced, feels a bit forlorn at night in the gloomy 
lighting. The service is friendly, knowledgeable and exemplary. Water glasses 
are filled and wine replenished without your ever having to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 When European friends are in town, I never hesitate to take them to Campanile. 
Much of the restaurant's menu is familiar to foreign visitors, but it's 
different enough from Italian or French food to thrill them. They love the 
soups. And they eat a ridiculous amount of bread. The rustic boneless prime rib 
is a variation on bistecca fiorentina , charred, sliced thick, smeared with 
tapenade ; the juicy, flavorful beans are flageolets or cannellini. Flattened 
grilled chicken, the pollo al mattone of the Tuscan countryside, comes with a 
bracing parsley salad spiked with garlic.  
</P>
<P>
 Although La Brea Bakery is one of the premier bread bakeries in the country, 
Nancy Silverton is first and foremost an extraordinary pastry chef. Never too 
sweet, her desserts are definitely worth a detour. Consider her sedate-sounding 
sourdough chocolate cake quivering in a pool of coffee sauce while a ball of 
"iced" cream melts into the soft, warm round. Or her tender, yeasty brioche 
tart piled with sauteed nectarines, peaches and apricots. She recently baked a 
lemon meringue tart and served it with a prickly vanilla-scented Champagne 
vinegar sauce. Who would think you could pair vinegar with lemon and pull it 
off? But she does it. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant has a wonderful, fairly priced wine list, filled with 
hard-to-find wines from small, quality producers, not only from France, Italy, 
California and Germany but also from wine buyer (and co-owner) Manfred Krankl's 
native Austria. The 13-page list is put together with passion and intelligence. 
Among my picks: the '92 Scheurebe spatlese, $33, from Germany's Muller-Catoir, 
a stunning match with an appetizer of cold cedar-smoked sturgeon with poached 
egg and frisee. For reds, he has Domenico Clerico's '90 Arte, $48, a 
Nebbiolo-Barbera blend; a rare '90 Syrah from the Chianti producer Fontodi, 
$57; the inky '90 Cornas from Auguste Clape in the Rhone, $45, and an '89 
Moraga, a distinguished Bordeaux blend from grapes grown right here in Bel-Air, 
$68. 
</P>
<P>
 At Campanile, Mark Peel and Nancy Silverton have put a lot of thought into 
even the smallest details. Lemonade is fresh-squeezed, for example; hot 
chocolate comes with a homemade marshmallow floating on top. Small wonder that 
eating at this warmhearted restaurant induces such a feeling of well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 Campanile, 624 S. La Brea Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 938-1447. Closed Saturday 
at lunch and Sunday at lunch and dinner. Dinner for two, food only, $57-$88. 
Valet and street parking. Smoking allowed in the atrium. Corkage, $12.

 Scripps College in Claremont has opened the Millard Sheets Art Center, a new 
fine-arts complex that boasts a museum-quality gallery and state-of-the-art 
studios for photography, computer art and the traditional disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility's public centerpiece is the Ruth Chandler Williamson Gallery, a 
4,000-square-foot exhibition space directed by Mary MacNaughton. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition program will focus on the college's art holdings, MacNaughton 
says. "Like any university gallery, our collections are eclectic rather than 
comprehensive, so we will look at them thematically." 
</P>
<P>
 The opening event, "Earthly Delights," through Oct. 9, examines landscapes in 
terms of settings and seasons. MacNaughton has selected late 19th- and early 
20th-Century American paintings, including cityscapes by Reginald Marsh and 
Maurice Prendergast and rural scenes by Childe Hassam, George Inness and 
Millard Sheets, who in the 1930s and 1940s led the college's art department. 
Concurrently, co-curator Bruce Coats has chosen Japanese prints and Chinese 
scrolls by artists whose landscapes were influenced by Western art. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallery hours: Wednesday-Sunday, 1-5 p.m. Information: (909) 621-8000, Ext.

 VALLEY BOY: When artist Jeffrey Vallance leaves the San Fernando Valley and 
travels to the South Pacific or sets out in search of Bigfoot, "he crosses no 
evolutionary fault lines between advanced and primitive cultures," writes 
critic Dave Hickey in the introduction to a new paperback book of Vallance's 
writings. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he delves into history, he traverses no barrier between the enlightened 
present and the superstitious past. These distinctions do not exist in the 
world of Jeffrey Vallance; for him, it is the Valley all the way around, and he 
is its Herodotus, its Schliemann, its Candide, and its Von Helsing." 
</P>
<P>
 "The World of Jeffrey Vallance: Collected Writings 1978-1994" is the second 
book to be published by Art issues. Press. The text recounts everything from 
Vallance's burial of a frozen chicken purchased at Ralphs to the artist's 
improbable meetings with the king of Tonga, the president of Iceland and 
Monsignor Sepe of the Vatican -- all in a style that merges childlike innocence 
with deadpan humor and journalistic objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We publish books of writings that explore art in relationship to cultural 
power," says Gary Kornblau, editor of the Hollywood-based press. "Also we 
maintain a strong perspective from Los Angeles. We look for people tied to the 
L.A. area, but we want them to have a cosmopolitan and international flavor to 
their work. Jeffrey Vallance's writing does both of those things."

 FAMILY TIES: Joachim Pissarro, a great-grandson of Impressionist painter 
Camille Pissarro and former director of the Museum of the Fondation de 
l'Hermitage in Lausanne, Switzerland, has been named chief curator of the 
Kimbell Art Museum in Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Pissarro, a 35-year-old graduate of Paris' Sorbonne and London's Courtauld 
Institute of Art, is a scholar of French Impressionism and modern art. Among 
his exhibition credits is "Cezanne and Pissarro: An Impressionist 
Collaboration," which is scheduled to appear in 1995 at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art.

POP MUSIC CHARTS: 'OUTLAW' COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Showing that being politically incorrect can sell records, country singer Tim 
McGraw, whose hit single "Indian Outlaw" angered Native Americans, has ridden 
the PI wave to stardom. Hands down, he's country's big new star of '94. His 
album, "Not a Moment Too Soon," which features the single, tops both The Times' 
Southern California country chart and the national country chart. But the album 
is more than a country hit: On the national pop chart for 23 weeks, it's been a 
fixture in the Top 20 and has sold more than 2 million copies. TOP 10 ALBUMS

POP EYE: THE SUNDAY SHOWDOWN: SUMMER'S WINNERS, LOSERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So which bands won at the Woodstock mud fights? 
</P>
<P>
 Is there no place on the charts for a nice rap act like Arrested Development? 
</P>
<P>
 If Meat Loaf can come back strong after all these years, why couldn't another 
relic -- Boston? 
</P>
<P>
 Pop Eye will aim for answers in the Sunday Showdown, a periodic feature that 
will turn to retailers, radio executives and other industry insiders to help 
pinpoint the ups and downs of pop fortunes. This edition looks at this summer: 
The Winners 
</P>
<P>
 * Woodstock mud -- Of the dozens of acts that played the Woodstock '94 
festival last month, the two that emerged with the biggest commercial momentum 
were the two that got down and dirty, literally: Nine Inch Nails and Green Day. 
 
</P>
<P>
 NIN's mud-covered leader Trent Reznor and mud-slinging Green Day certainly 
made for the most compelling media illustrations of bands that were seizing -- 
and defining -- the Woodstock moment for the '90s. And even though both bands 
were already hot, record sales for both have increased since the festival, with 
NIN's "The Downward Spiral" album moving from No. 45 on Billboard's album chart 
pre-Woodstock to No. 23 last week and "Dookie" by Green Day (whose performance 
was marked by a mud battle with the audience and a fight with security guards) 
from No. 13 to No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "Green Day was on fire anyway," says Jeff Pollack, president of his own media 
consulting firm. "But this (mud scuffle) gave them a shove. They got 
substantially more record sales, and all it cost (singer Billie Joe) was a few 
teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 * Soundtrack albums -- "The Lion King" and "Forrest Gump" have held the top 
two chart spots for nearly two months, with other expected movie tie-in hits 
coming, including "Natural Born Killers," "Pulp Fiction" and "Fresh." 
</P>
<P>
 Our panelists pointed to last year's "Sleepless in Seattle" as the 
trend-setter, showing record and movie executives that there's more to 
movie-related albums than just a collection of songs. "It's much more of an art 
form than it used to be," says Pollack. "They used to make them half-assed, but 
films like 'Sleepless in Seattle' made it part of the movie's mood from the 
start." 
</P>
<P>
 * R. Kelly -- His own "12 Play" album is still hot (No. 57 after 42 weeks with 
more than 3 million sold), his protegee Aaliyah's "Age Ain't Nothing but a 
Number" is even hotter (No. 25), and his "Stroke You Up" by Changing Faces is 
the No. 2 single. While on the surface his biggest selling point is sex -- "All 
the songs are about sex," says Wherehouse Records new-release buyer Bob Bell -- 
Kelly's seen as a major future force. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an awesome talent as a writer, performer and producer who has the 
potential of becoming another Babyface in terms of his impact," says Ken 
Barnes, editor of the Radio & Records trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mazzy Star -- It's still far from the Top 10, but the L.A. band's dreamy "So 
Tonight That I May See" even being in the Top 50 -- and rising -- makes it the 
dark horse of the summer. It was released a year ago and languished beneath the 
Top 200 until MTV started playing the video for "Fade Into You" last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Our panelists congratulate Capitol Records executives for sticking with the 
record and giving it a second chance to find, as one says, "the yuppie 
alternative demographic out here that this is perfect for." The Losers 
</P>
<P>
 * Spin Doctors -- This band was the Mazzy Star of 1992, its "Pocketful of 
Kryptonite" album becoming a 3-million-selling hit only after going unnoticed 
by the pop world for a full year. The early performance of the new "Turn It 
Upside Down," though, makes it look as if the group has lost its super powers. 
It's wallowing at No. 70 with sales of less than 300,000 after 11 weeks of 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 Several panelists are not ready to bury the album, but think that the band and 
Epic Records made a perhaps insurmountable mistake in releasing the "real 
radio-unfriendly" song "Cleopatra" as the first single. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kind of song that I call a center divider -- it's so bad that you 
have to avoid hitting the center divider when it comes on the car radio," says 
one contributor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sir Mix-A-Lot -- The Seattle rapper's ode to les derrieres , "Baby Got 
Back," was the No. 1 single of 1992. But his new paean to breasts, "Put 'em on 
the Glass," hasn't even pushed the current album, "Chief Boot Knocka," any 
higher than No. 69 in the pop chart. (It was at No. 150 last week.) 
</P>
<P>
 Live by the novelty hit, die by the novelty hit, say our experts: "I don't 
know how far you can go with rapping about different body parts." 
</P>
<P>
 * Boston -- Comparisons to Meat Loaf are inevitable given both acts' '70s 
identification and current affiliation with MCA Records. But even with many 
years between releases, Boston had maintained a better profile than Mr. Loaf -- 
all three of its albums, including the last, 1986's "Third Stage" -- were 
multimillion-selling smashes. So when Meat Loaf's comeback last year sold more 
than 4 million, many expected Boston's fourth album, "Walk On," to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 No dice. It debuted strongly, reaching No. 7, but quickly dropped and after 12 
weeks in the stores is No. 107 and falling, though it has reached the "gold" 
500,000 sales mark. Meat Loaf has more personality than the faceless Boston, 
and his "Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell" had more fodder for pop radio. 
Boston's stuck on classic-rock, and album rock stations, our experts point out, 
don't help sell records. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boston represents the formula-corporate music that the current upheaval in 
new music has left behind, thankfully." 
</P>
<P>
 * Arrested Development -- Besides having a virtually unpronounceable title, 
the new album "Zingalamaduni" has been pretty much unsellable -- a dramatic 
contrast to the group's Grammy-winning 1992 debut, which sold more than 2 
million. Woodstock exposure helped return the new album to the Top 200 (to No. 
188) and then it was back off the chart the next week.  
</P>
<P>
 Industry insiders seem to be rooting for this group as a positive antidote to 
the gangsta rap that dominates the charts, but say that to turn things around 
group leader Speech must stop all his "preachy" theorizing and stick to 
rapping. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the first record, he kept saying people were missing the message. This 
time he wanted to make sure they got it, but he forgot about the music." Steve 
Hochman

 WHAM BAM: A California rock institution is about to get a major face-lift: BAM 
magazine, for nearly 20 years an influential biweekly focusing on the state's 
music and distributed free in record stores and other music-oriented locales, 
will shift next month to a "lifestyles" focus, with music as the primary topic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a music publication," says Bill Holdship, editor of BAM's Southern 
California edition, who last week broke the news of the format change to his 
stunned writers, most of whom will lose their regular columns. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem, Holdship says, has been image. BAM (which originally 
stood for Bay Area Music) started out as a champion of the punk and new-wave 
world when San Francisco's Dead Kennedys and L.A.'s Black Flag, X and Go-Go's 
were rising. But in the mid-'80s it got a reputation for dealing largely with 
the "big hair," Sunset Strip metal bands. 
</P>
<P>
 The change will include new words for the title acronym ("Beat Attitudes 
Music"), a glossy cover and coverage of such "adventure sports" as bungee 
jumping in addition to music. 
</P>
<P>
 The old format will be put to rest with a "best of" issue, probably in late 
September. Steve Hochman

 SMALL FACES: The pre-worldwide-fame days of the Red Hot Chili Peppers are 
being chronicled in "Out in L.A.," a collection of early recordings, including 
previously unreleased live and demo tracks and remixes. The EMI album is due in 
stores Oct. 4. . . . Annie Lennox is at work on her second post-Eurythmics 
album, due in early '95. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Baker is putting plans together for her first concert tour in four 
years, tentatively set to begin on the West Coast in December. . . . Look for 
the second album by female R&B trio SWV to be in stores in December. . . . 
Kirsty MacColl has recorded a duet with the Lemonheads' Evan Dando, which will 
be among the new tracks included on "Galore," a MacColl "best of" album due 
Oct. 18. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress Hill has finished four songs for its next album, due early next year, 
with a tour planned to follow. . . . The first live album from John Hiatt -- 
with the cheeky title "Hiatt Comes Alive at Budokan" -- is due in November, 
with one previously unreleased song among the 17 tracks.

 AND ONE MORE THING: "I haven't had a penny (from my songs) since 1980," says 
Neil Innes, in his guise of Ron Nasty, who will front the "New Rutles" in shows 
Thursday and (newly added) Saturday at the Troubadour. "Now it seems Michael 
Jackson has bought my publishing by mistake.You haven't got his phone number, 
have you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the Rutles were a spoof of the Beatles committed by former Bonzo Dog 
Band member -- and sometime Monty Python co-conspirator -- Innes with Python's 
Eric Idle. But this comment isn't so much of a joke.  
</P>
<P>
 It seems that due to the intentional references to Beatles songs in the tunes 
Innes wrote for the Rutles, he had to work a deal with ATV, then-owner of the 
Fab Four song publishing, for some of the royalties. Several years ago, of 
course, Jackson bought ATV, largely because he wished to own the Beatles songs. 
And with it he bought, whether he knew it or not . . . the Rutles canon. 
</P>
<P>
 A Rutles spokesman says that Jackson is welcome at the group's shows, and so 
is his wife, Lisa Marie Presley, for that matter.

 This is the fast-moving gangster classic written by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts 
from a Virginia Kellogg story. Director Raoul Walsh gets away with placing 
migraine-prone mobster James Cagney (pictured) on his mother's lap without a 
trace of self-consciousness; never was an Oedipus complex presented with so 
little fuss. This 1949 Warners production, which co-stars Virginia Mayo 
(pictured) and Edmond O'Brien, is even more famous fo Cagney's ironic tag line: 
"Top of the world, Ma!" (TMC Sunday at 7:30 a.m., Cinemax Tuesday at 6:30 
a.m.).

 Floating on a sweet cloud of nostalgia and wish-fulfillment, director Beeban 
Kidron and writer Todd Graf spin a romantic 1992 comedy-drama. Set in 1969 
Queens, N.Y., the film is about a Jewish widow (Shirley MacLaine, pictured) who 
suddenly finds herself pursued by an impassioned Italian neighbor (Marcello 
Mastroianni, pictured) who has worshiped her from afar for decades. 
Mastroianni, however, not only has to win over MacLaine but also her family: 
her frustrated daughter (Kathy Bates), her skeptical mother (Jessica Tandy), 
her schizophrenic glamorous other daughter (Marcia Gay Harden) and her even 
more disturbed 12-year-old grandson (Matthew Branton) (HBO Sunday at 6 p.., 
Wednesday at 2:30 p.m.). Michael Wilmington

 This 1990 sex-and-suspense thriller is about the divided consciousness of a 
woman in a man's world: a smoky-eyed vice cop (Theresa Russell, pictured) who 
becomes fascinated with her own alter ego as a hooker. Despite an uninspired 
plot, the film, directed by Sondra Locke, does have an edge, and Russell's 
performance suggests something softer and more woundable underneath (Lifetime 
Sunday at 6 p.m., Wednesday at 9 p.m.). Michael Wilmington

 From its first words on the screen right through its closing, this 1992 
release is programmed for playfulness. A confident caper movie with a pleasant 
sense of humor, it goes about its business in such a good-spirited way that it 
manages to make its familiar "Mission: Impossible" plot seem good as new.The 
film's light spirits are due both to the ensemble cast -- Sidney Poitier and 
Robert Redford (from left) plus Dan Aykroyd, Ben Kingsley, Mary McDonnell, 
David Straithairn and River Phoenix -- and to director Phil Alden Robinson. 
Redford plays the head of a group of San Francisco-based renegades who hire 
themselves out to companies eager to see if their security systems are really 
secure (Showtime Monday at 1:45 p.m., Tuesday at 4:45 a.m., Saturday at 8:45 
a.m. and 5:45 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; TIFFANI-AMBER THIESSEN ZIPS INTO '90210' READY TO DEFY 
EXPECTATIONS 
</P>

<P>
 There's a new bad girl in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, long of NBC's silly tween sitcom "Saved by the Bell," 
replaces the errant Shannen Doherty as the newest vixen in Fox's fabled zip 
code, which begins its new season Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 She won't take over the role of Brenda Walsh, the sweet, if slightly neurotic, 
character the publicly sour Doherty played on "Beverly Hills, 90210." She'll 
play Valerie Malone, a family friend of the Walshes who moves into Brenda's 
room and the lives of her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 For Thiessen, the transition has been easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew the cast already," she says, since her real-life boyfriend Brian 
Austin Green was already on the show. But what about working on the same set? 
"Our characters don't get involved," she says. But Valerie does get quite cozy 
with Dylan (Luke Perry), Brenda's ex. As Thiessen tells it, Valerie moves 
smoothly into the "90210" storyline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Valerie's described as a chameleon," she says at a small Santa Monica coffee 
shop. "She's totally different from scene to scene and from one person to the 
next." When it's suggested that kind of behavior might indicate Valerie's not 
too stable, she says, "They haven't said if she's mentally imbalanced yet. But 
that's how she feels safe. It's the only way she knows." 
</P>
<P>
 The "90210" producers don't want to "reduce Valerie to 'the bad girl,' " 
executive producer Charles Rosin says in a phone interview. "I don't want her 
to be that stereotype. I hope everyone's patient. We're reinventing the show 
and finding her character. Our show's always evolving and so'll Valerie." 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, Rosin says, Thiessen "plays her perky and she plays her very 
dark. I don't know her that well, but it doesn't seem part and parcel of what 
she is, that dark side." 
</P>
<P>
 "Valerie just does whatever she can to feel comfortable," Thiessen explains, 
as she sits back in the oak chair and throws her army-booted foot over the arm 
of the chair, her long floral dress flowing around her. "She smokes pot a lot." 
In her character's defense, typical of actresses who play connivers (a la 
Heather Locklear's "Melrose Place" nightmare, Amanda), Thiessen describes 
Valerie as "a very troubled lady." 
</P>
<P>
 And much of the hype surrounding the new character dwells on how nasty she is. 
"I'd call her a bad girl in the sense that she does bad things," says Thiessen. 
"She's had a lot of difficulty in her life and doesn't know how to deal with 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Thiessen, who's had little difficulty in her own life, proudly says she has 
nothing in common with her character. A model since the age of 9, she was Miss 
Junior America and a winner of the Teen Magazine Model Search. Her parents, she 
says, "entered me in pageants to teach me poise and how to be a girl. It wasn't 
to win prizes or do the beauty thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The "beauty thing," however, did lead to "Saved by the Bell" and its 
prime-time incarnation, "Saved by the Bell: The College Years," which lasted 
four months. She stars in the upcoming movie spinoff "Saved by the Bell: 
Wedding in Las Vegas," which airs Oct. 7 on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't gotten everything I've gone up for," she notes, lest it seem as if 
her life is too charmed. "I auditioned for 'Models Inc.' and didn't get it . . 
. but something better came along." 
</P>
<P>
 But does that something better mean she has big shoes to fill? 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew you were going to ask me that," she says with a sigh. "No. I am not 
Brenda, I am Valerie. I don't look anything like her," the blue-eyed brunette 
says of Doherty, who also happens to be a blue-eyed brunette. "They may say 
Valerie is a lot like Shannen Doherty. Maybe she is. But she's completely 
different than Brenda." 
</P>
<P>
 "Beverly Hills, 90210" airs Wednesday s at 8 p.m. on Fox.

BORN AND BRED

 Jack Mathews wrote a thoughtful commentary on Oliver Stone's film "Natural 
Born Killers" ("Look Into the Mirror . . . ," Aug. 21): 
</P>
<P>
 To the question: Are violent films only a reflection of society (as writers 
and producers claim), or is it the other way around -- does the glamorizing of 
violence in films influence society's behavior? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Alexander Pope said it best: 
</P>
<P>
 Evil has a face  
</P>
<P>
 of such horrible mien,  
</P>
<P>
 that to be hated,

 I am not concerned about white males, whom I consider to be "natural born 
killers" by virtue of their history both in America and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Any number of hangings, lynchings, executions of all sorts, wars and the many 
weapons of murder that have been created by white males support my opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 My concern is for the young black males who have been brainwashed into 
believing that Billy the Kid, Al Capone, John Dillinger, John Gotti, Freddy 
Krueger, Jason, etc., are figures to be admired -- and to a young black male 
who feels otherwise powerless in this society, the bad guys often are their 
heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the efforts of this society (vis-a-vis the media, TV, movies) to make 
us believe it, black males are not natural born killers, and I hope they do not 
go to see this movie and come away admiring another American hero, Woody 
Harrelson's Mickey.

 It is with the deepest regret that I will likely not have the opportunity to 
enjoy Rodney Dangerfield as the "father from hell" ("Natural Born Actor," Aug. 
21). Nothing against Dangerfield (on the contrary), it's simply a matter of not 
wanting to put another dollar of mine into director Oliver Stone's pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I take minor film history umbrage with Hilary de Vries' assertion 
that Dangerfield's participation in "Natural Born Killers" is his "first-ever 
dramatic role." 
</P>
<P>
 I think back to those heady days of 1971 when, as a cineaste wanna-be, I went 
to see Chuck McCann and Dangerfield in Harry Hurwitz's movie "The 
Projectionist." It was a comedy of sorts, with Dangerfield appearing as both 
the unpleasant and very non-comedic manager of a movie theater as well as the 
fantasized silent film villain "The Bat." 
</P>
<P>
 Not a highlight in moviegoing history, but Dangerfield was pretty menacing in 
both "real" life and on the silent screen.

SEVEN-YEAR GLITCH

<P>
 In your Letters column (Aug. 21), Fred Bauman of Riverside, commenting on your 
piece on my wife, Diane Sawyer (Aug. 7), claims, in a hot news flash, that he 
and I attended school together in Berlin and that as he is 69, I am 69, not 62. 
</P>
<P>
 I congratulate Mr. Bauman on being able to remember anyone from the first 
grade.I remember only two or three people from college. 
</P>
<P>
 I was born in November, 1931. In 1939, I attended the school Bauman refers to 
for two months before going to the United States in May. I was 7. The reason 
for the disparity in our ages is that in Jewish schools in Berlin during the 
'30s, children of different ages were in the same class. 
</P>
<P>
 My passport is available for purposes of ascertaining my age. It is 
dispiriting to have someone unknown to me reach out from the grave, which is 
what 69 is -- who are we kidding -- to try to do me harm. Sixty-two is tough 
enough.

 Shame on you, Mr. Bauman! You must be a very mean-spirited creature to be 
prompted to write a nasty, bitchy letter about the age of another person. It's 
none of your business. 
</P>
<P>
 What a shallow existence you must lead to be preoccupied by other people's 
ages. And shame on you, Calendar, for printing his letter!

 Martin Bernheimer seems to find Leonard Bernstein's close-to-40-year romance 
with communism sort of, well . . . cute ("Lenny the Red Menace," Aug. 21). He 
writes, of Bernstein: "A possible Commie. Yikes." 
</P>
<P>
 Communism a laugh ? Who knew? 
</P>
<P>
 But let's get serious here. Forget 73 years of murdering, enslaving, ignoring 
human rights, even threatening to "bury" us, and cut to what Bernheimer 
believes is the real horror: that under the direction of four decades of 
attorneys general, the FBI was ordered to keep track of Bernstein's activities. 
</P>
<P>
 For regardless of Bernstein's genius and personal charm, he was unprepared for 
the perfidious nature of communism, any more than Bernheimer's considerable 
expertise as a critic has given him the wisdom to recognize the cabalistic 
nature of the beast that is communism. 
</P>
<P>
 They used to call these well-meaning people "dupes." With the fall of 
communism all over the world nearly a fait accompli, I'd call them and us lucky 
!

FEARS GROW THAT FLORIDA, A STATE BUILT ON WATER, IS DRYING UP; ENVIRONMENT: 
LAKES ARE VANISHING. SO ARE THE ECOSYSTEMS THEY SUPPORT. DROUGHT, RAPID GROWTH 
AND LACK OF CONSERVATION ARE BLAMED. 
</P>

 Catherine Monsees retired to a house on a lake once stocked with fish and 
teeming with wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 That's all gone now. 
</P>
<P>
 What she has left is a dry lake bed choked with weeds and a tarnished dream 
for her golden years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been cheated out of our retirement," Monsees said. "It's more than 
upsetting. My husband wanted to kick back and fish, but we'll never see water 
in that lake." 
</P>
<P>
 The fish are long gone from Patriot Lake. It's the same story with Crews Lake, 
now a 500-acre muddy crater. Likewise with Big Fish Lake, so named for the 
good-sized bass it once gave up. Now, the docks at Big Fish Lake wind over a 
river of scorched grass. 
</P>
<P>
 California's water woes are well-known. Not so well-publicized are the 
problems of Florida, a state surrounded by water and built on water. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of acres of lakes and wetlands are drying up as the demand for water 
increases for Florida's growing population. Other lakes are polluted from 
pesticide runoff and factory chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 The culprits are varied: too much water pumped from natural underground 
reservoirs, persistent drought, rapid growth and virtually no thought for water 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lack of alternative water sources caused the crisis we're in today," said 
Judy Williams, a member of a coalition of lakefront property owners. "It's time 
to pay the piper. We're facing an environmental catastrophe. Let's not wait 
until we turn on the spigot and nothing comes out." 
</P>
<P>
 Patriot Lake, where the Monsees dreamed of a comfortable retirement, dried up 
over the past few years. Even the rains don't help anymore. The water 
disappears. It percolates down, searching for the aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
 From the air, the toll of heavy water usage on Florida's lakes, wetlands and 
swamps is vivid -- especially near a Central Florida water-pumping facility 
where 30 million gallons are pumped daily. Lake beds range from wet patches to 
lava-like fields of earth, parched and cracked under the blistering sun. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 17,000 acres of wetlands are damaged. Marshes are arid. Cypress 
trees are dead. Ducks, cranes, turtles and alligators are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida always has had water problems -- either too much or too little. 
</P>
<P>
 Dating to the last century, land was sold off to those who promised to drain 
it, dredge it, develop it and drive away the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Water historically has been viewed as a problem in the state of Florida, not 
a resource," said Richard Hamann, a University of Florida water specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the pendulum has swung the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 Police patrol neighborhoods trying to catch and fine lawbreakers who illegally 
sprinkle their lawns, wasting water. And Florida's water supply is governed and 
protected by five powerful regional management districts, which have the power 
to levy taxes and impose rationing to conserve supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cheap water is gone," said Mark Farrell, assistant executive director for the 
southwest water district, which regulates water use in a 16-county area on the 
Gulf Coast in Central Florida. "We have issued too many permits for water." 
</P>
<P>
 But the water districts' work has drawn criticism from homeowners, 
environmentalists and politicians running for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe Florida has a water policy," said Republican gubernatorial 
candidate Jeb Bush, the front-runner headed into the Sept. 8 GOP primary. "It 
has a number of water empires and would-be emperors, but no comprehensive 
policy. The long-term answer is a statewide water supply grid like the 
statewide power supply grid that would match supply with demand." 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Lawton Chiles defends the water boards' work, but has appointed a 
21-member statewide commission to examine Florida's water shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Florida's population increases, the demands on water will continue to 
increase," Chiles said. "There is no easy answer to this question and beware of 
anyone who has an easy answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Water is the lifeblood of the Florida economy. It's the engine that drives the 
biggest industries -- tourism and farming. 
</P>
<P>
 It lures vacationers by the thousands to posh hotels, sprawling attractions 
and sandy beaches. It produces bountiful harvests of oranges, grapefruit, 
berries and a medley of winter vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a magnet to developers who cash in on dreams of waterfront living and 
bring newcomers in droves to Florida's 1,100 miles of coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, North Florida is considered water-rich. It has most of the state's 
1,700 streams and a plentiful amount of the 7,000-plus freshwater lakes that 
serve as ground water reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 The southern half of the state, on the other hand, is heavily dependent on 
rainfall. It has one-third of Florida's supply of fresh water, but 75% of the 
state's more than 13 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Florida is among the wettest states in the country with an average 54 
inches of rain a year, that isn't enough to put back what the state's 
businesses and residents take out of the fragile system. Besides, about 40 
inches of rain is lost to evaporation and runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Making matters worse, the state is in the clutches of a five-year drought. 
Water experts say the drought has created an overall water reserve deficit of 
up to 60 inches that would take years to replace. 
</P>
<P>
 Aquifers are Florida's rain barrel. An underground system of porous limestone 
and sandstone formations, these aquifers stretch beneath the peninsula. Like 
giant sponges, they soak up and store drinking water until it's time to yield 
it to wells and springs that eventually feed water taps throughout Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 But water is consumed from the aquifers faster than it can be replaced. Until 
recently, there was no big push to reduce water use or develop alternative 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the warning signs of a water crisis abound. 
</P>
<P>
 In northeast Florida, people who bought lakefront homes near Jacksonville have 
found themselves high and dry.

 Near Keystone Heights, for instance, a "no diving" sign straddles a bridge 
over Lake Brooklyn, a throwback to bygone days. The bridge has crossed dry land 
for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Docks are out of water hundreds of yards from the shoreline. Lake Brooklyn is 
25 feet below normal. Lake Geneva is down 20 feet. In all, 29 lakes have 
severely reduced water levels or have dried up. 
</P>
<P>
 On Central Florida's Gulf Coast, thousands of acres of lakes and wetlands have 
been depleted in Pasco and northern Hillsborough counties. Private wells have 
gone dry. And 95 lakes have been damaged or threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, water regulators are getting an earful from residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm speaking for thousands of people much angrier than I. Many are fed up," 
said Bill Alexander, of Land O' Lakes, vice chair for legal action for the 
Coalition of Lake Assns.

 "People who worked hard all their lives to get just a little pinch of paradise 
are not going to sit by and watch it destroyed," he said at a recent meeting of 
the southwest water board. "It's time for that to stop happening. Yours is the 
public trust."

PAST, PRESENT CLASH IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN CITY; ALEXANDRIA: EXCAVATORS ARE 
GETTING TO WHAT'S BURIED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, THEN TURNING THE SITE OVER TO 
DEVELOPERS.

 Throughout Alexandria, archeologists who want to save the ancient city -- or 
at least record it -- are in a race with builders determined to erect a new 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is the hazy history of a Mediterranean metropolis built on the dreams 
of Alexander the Great. To win, the scholarly excavators must stay one step 
ahead of the bulldozers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is salvage archeology: getting to what's buried as quickly as possible, 
recording what's there, then turning the site over to the developers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the same story wherever past and present collide: London, Rome, Athens, 
Beirut, Jerusalem. Even in the youthful United States, road-building crews 
strike ancient Indian burial mounds or Civil War remains. 
</P>
<P>
 In Alexandria, countless treasures sleep beneath a city that has lived more 
than 2,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a blinding sun, French archeologist Jean-Yves Empereur hurries from 
excavation to excavation -- five at the moment -- where his colleagues are 
trying to find everything in time. 
</P>
<P>
 A Roman bath here, bits of mummy wrapping there. Parts of an ancient house, 
the torso of a statue, a broken amphora filled with 1,200 Roman coins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps this was once a garden," Empereur said. "Someone buried the coins 
here for safekeeping and never made it back." 
</P>
<P>
 Many centuries later, the garden became the site of a theater, which in its 
turn has been sacrificed to progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandria probably holds tens of thousands of such tales, but Empereur does 
not have the leisure of daydreaming. Archeologists estimate they have no more 
than a decade left to dig. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is a piece of the puzzle that is Alexandria," said Empereur, on 
loan from France's National Center of Scientific Research to help the Egyptian 
Antiquities Organization. "We could lose everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Exhuming Alexandria's 2,300 years of history is a little like cutting into a 
pan of lasagna. The earth holds layer after layer of time. 
</P>
<P>
 For centuries, Alexandria's buildings had no foundations. New buildings rose 
on top of old, leaving a lot of history intact. Also, Alexander's architects 
designed the city in grids, like Washington, D.C. Excavators have an idea where 
buildings should have been. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time you lower a shovel in Alexandria, great things come up," said Bob 
Bianchi, a Greco-Roman historian from Brooklyn, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandria's story began in 332 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
 As Bianchi describes it: "Alexander came down from Syria along the coastline. 
When he reached the site of what was to be Alexandria, he looked out and said, 
'What a harb" 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander, a Macedonian prince with great affection for things Greek, ordered 
a city built right there, to be named for him and to become the capital of his 
empire. He died nine years later in Babylon without seeing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ancient Alexandria, as large as a good-size American city, was designed for 
beauty, with palaces, temples, gardens, fountains and the renowned Alexandria 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
 In its heyday, "the Pearl of the Mediterranean" had the world's finest port. 
In beauty and culture, it rivaled Rome. Alexandria's design became so evocative 
that at least 34 communities around the world adopted it as their own, 12 of 
them in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The city flourished under many rulers, including Cleopatra and Mark Antony. 
But after they committed suicide in 30 B.C., disaster struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Riots, battles, invasions, earthquakes, fires and fluctuating sea levels took 
their toll on Alexander's city. Lost within its ever-changing precincts were 
the library; the tombs of Alexander, Cleopatra and Mark Antony; colonnaded 
temples; the world's largest gymnasium; mosaic-covered baths, and docks for 
small sailboats that took families on Sunday excursions. 
</P>
<P>
 By the Middle Ages even the Pharos Lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the 
Ancient World, was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Bianchi said two modern events had done the most to interfere with the 
preservation of Alexandria's past: 
</P>
<P>
 * A British bombardment in July, 1882, that destroyed major portions of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 * Construction of a waterfront highway a few decades ago that turned 
innumerable relics to powder, then dumped them into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern architecture has become the latest threat. High-rise buildings require 
deep foundations. At many sites, piles are driven almost 45 feet down, 
mutilating everything in their path. The archeologists try to get there first. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohammed Awad, an architect, is a founding member of the Alexandria 
Preservation Trust, whose 300 members scour the city for signs of antiquities 
on building sites. 
</P>
<P>
 If necessary, they file lawsuits to stop construction. That happened in 1993 
when an extraordinary mosaic and other valuable antiquities were discovered at 
the site intended for a new Alexandria Library.

THE SEA WORE BLACK: IN MOURNING FOR EASTERN EUROPE'S POLLUTED WATERS; 
ENVIRONMENT: YEARS OF NEGLECT MAY KILL THE BLACK SEA. ECONOMIC, POLITICAL WOES 
IN NATIONS THAT RING THE BODY OF WATER DO NOT BODE WELL FOR CLEANUP. 
</P>

 Flooded with pollutants from land, water and air, racked by civil war on one 
coast and packed with tourists on others, trapped in the midst of one of the 
world's great political and economic transformations, the Black Sea, the 
dirtiest sea on Earth, is dying an agonizing death. 
</P>
<P>
 In just 30 years this sea, famed since the times of Ovid and Herodotus for its 
rough storms and rougher inhabitants, has degenerated from one of the most 
productive bodies of water to a cesspool -- a dumping ground for vast 
quantities of phosphorus, inorganic nitrogen, oil, mercury and DDT cast off by 
the 160 million people of the Black Sea Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a region struggling to come to terms with environmental crisis after 
decades under centrally planned economic systems notorious for their disregard 
of nature. The death of the Black Sea would represent a major defeat in the 
campaign to clean up the mess left by communism. And the demise of the Black 
Sea would stand as a chilling prophecy for the world's other seas. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 26 species of fish caught in the Black Sea in the 1960s, only five 
remain. In less than 10 years the mackerel catch, once the mainstay of the 
fishing industry, has plummeted from nearly 700,000 tons a year to 100,000 
tons. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1 million dolphins frolicked in the Black Sea 30 years ago; now 
their number has dwindled to about 200,000. Many dolphins are infected with 
swine fever -- probably contracted from pig farm wastes dumped into the Danube 
River delta. The monk seals have disappeared. In 1993, a Bulgarian hotel 
developer blew up the last of the coastal caves the seals called home. 
</P>
<P>
 Oysters and blue mussels, known as the "kidneys of the sea" because they 
filter the water, also are vanishing. The sea's lungs -- rich meadows of 
bottom-growing algae and sea grass that occupied 4,200 square miles along the 
sea's once-fecund northwest shelf -- have shrunk to a tenth their previous 
size. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1970s, cholera outbreaks have become common because sewage treatment 
plants are few. Beaches throughout the region, the only warm-water vacation 
within the former Soviet borders, are often closed to bathers because of 
foul-smelling pollution and suffocating blooms of harmful surface algae and 
other phytoplankton. 
</P>
<P>
 One such bloom in 1991 is believed to have killed 50% of all the 
bottom-feeding fish along Romania's coast. It turned the beaches around 
Constanta into a "long line of death, an apocalypse," according to Radu Mihnea, 
a biologist at the Romanian Marine Research Institute there. 
</P>
<P>
 Against heavy odds, late last year a project backed by the United Nations and 
the World Bank began to tie together various efforts to save the Black Sea. The 
Environmental Management and Protection Program of the Black Sea, based in 
Istanbul and led by British marine biologist Laurence Mee, has a three-year 
budget of just $25 million. Its mission is to coordinate research and identify 
the most urgent cleanup efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations' Global Environmental Fund, which supports the program, has 
been accused of whitewashing environmentally risky developments favored by the 
World Bank, but the Black Sea effort has escaped that kind of criticism. "In 
this case, anything they do would be an improvement," said one official of 
Greenpeace, the private environmental group. "But, like all U.N. things, they 
like meetings too much." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Ukraine became the last of the Black Sea countries to approve a 
convention establishing the legal tools to get control of maritime pollution. 
And all six -- Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey -- have 
begun negotiating a second convention that would place limits on fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, economic disaster and political chaos in the former Soviet 
republics of Russia, Georgia and Ukraine, as well as in Bulgaria and Romania, 
do not bode well for a cleanup effort that will cost billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all the countries have agreed to conduct environmental impact 
assessments of major projects, construction of an oil terminal near Odessa 
began in February without any such precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is technically illegal, but we don't have laws here anymore," said Valery 
Mikhailov, director of the Ukrainian Scientific Center of Marine Ecology in 
Odessa, which should have done the report. "If (the terminal) opens, it will 
ruin whatever beaches we have left." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of all six countries bordering the Black Sea were to have met 
in June, but only those of Bulgaria, Turkey and Romania showed up. Russia said 
its invitation arrived too late. Ukraine begged a lack of funds. Georgia's 
excuse was its civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 The sea, a lake of 160,000 square miles, was formed about 8,000 years ago. A 
shifting of tectonic plates suddenly connected it to the world's oceans by the 
Bosporus -- a narrow, 19-mile-long waterway that leads into the Mediterranean 
Sea. This peculiarity -- similar to an Olympic-sized pool being drained through 
a keyhole -- has created enormous problems for the Black Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of good drainage mechanism in effect made two seas -- one of the 
world's most fertile bodies of water lying atop a huge, dead puddle. Below 450 
feet, the Black Sea contains no oxygen and supports no life. It is only above 
that depth that fish and other marine life survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The two layers are prevented from blending for much the same reason that oil 
and water do not mix: The lower water is saltier and denser than the upper, so 
much so that scientists estimate it would take a molecule of water on the 
bottom 100 years to travel to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is its ecological fate," said Ukrainian marine biologist Yuvenaly 
Zaitsev, 70, one of the foremost experts on the sea. He remains an avid 
snorkeler in its dying waters. 
</P>
<P>
 At depths of less than 450 feet, especially along its northwest coast, the 
Black Sea once swarmed with life. Its northern arm, the Sea of Azov, was the 
world's second-most-productive fishery, after the Chesapeake Bay. The whole 
Black Sea was five times more productive per acre than its larger neighbor, the 
Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
 Immense meadows of red algae on the shelf's bottom served up huge doses of 
agar, which is used as a base for bacterial cultures as well as natural dyes 
and raw materials for pharmaceuticals. Bays and inlets yielded large catches of 
blue mussels and oysters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were crazy with fish," recalled Nikolai Prodaivoda, 51, a fisherman at the 
Black Sea Collective Fish Farm in Vapnjarka, a village 20 miles north of Odessa 
where the motto "Our Goal Is Communism" still adorns the wall of a dilapidated 
boathouse.

SCIENTISTS BLOW HOT AND COLD ON GLOBAL WARNING IDEAS; WEATHER: RESEARCHERS HAVE 
FOUND AN INCREASE IN EARTH'S TEMPERATURE, BUT SAY IT'S TOO SOON TO DECLARE A 
TREND. ALSO, IT WARMS MORE AT NIGHT IN SOME PLACES AND MORE IN THE DAYTIME 
ELSEWHERE. CLOUD COVER MAY BE A FACTOR. 
</P>

<P>
 Scientists trying to take the world's rising temperature have discovered a 
data dilemma: It is warming more at night in some places and more in the 
daytime elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 American researchers reported last year that nighttime temperatures in much of 
the world were rising three times faster than daytime readings. But there have 
been conflicting studies. And some wonder aloud whether divergent cloud-cover 
patterns mostly account for the phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have found, unmistakably, a general increase in the Earth's 
temperature in recent years. But they generally agree that it's too soon to 
declare a trend because the amount of temperature change is small enough to be 
considered part of normal climate variation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meteorologists in India found daytime temperatures going up faster than those 
at night in some areas, for example. Researchers in Switzerland found that day 
and night readings were up by about the same amount for mountain communities, 
though the valleys warmed more at night than in the daytime. 
</P>
<P>
 And a Washington climate conference last fall heard reports that no 
significant nighttime warming has occurred in polar regions, while some Pacific 
Islands have experienced equal day and night increases. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, studies of global temperatures suggest that nighttime minimum 
readings are rising faster than daytime maximums. But that doesn't imply that 
everyone is in the same category. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are important reasons for differences from one place to another and 
many seem to be related to changes in cloud cover," said Thomas Karl of the 
National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings are part of research into the threat of global warming. 
Scientists have voiced concern in recent years that chemicals released into the 
atmosphere by industry will turn the Earth into a sort of giant greenhouse, 
raising temperatures everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists gathered in Berlin in April considered the possibility that there 
may even be a threat of global cooling -- at least in industrialized nations 
where cloud cover is increased by pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
 The British magazine New Scientist reports that an unpublished study by Guy 
Brasseur and Mai Pham of the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research 
found that cooling exceeds warming over Europe, the eastern United States and 
parts of Russia, China and the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
 Increased cloudiness may be the reason that some areas have experienced more 
warming at night than in the daytime, Karl wrote in a paper in the Bulletin of 
the American Meteorological Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Warmer temperatures can cause more water to evaporate, leading to more clouds. 
Clouds can act as a blanket to prevent nighttime radiation cooling. They may 
also shade the Earth from the sun, cooling the daytimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems is, we tend to say: 'What's the single cause of this?' In 
truth there very rarely is a single cause,' " Karl said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 If warming is concentrated at night, some researchers see possible benefits, 
such as a longer growing season and fewer killing frosts. And they say water 
evaporation, a threat in a warmer world, would be less likely if higher 
temperatures occurred at night. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, nighttime warming might encourage crop pests. Also, there 
could be a shorter dormancy period, adversely affecting plant growth. And 
people might suffer more from heat waves with less nighttime cooling. 
</P>
<P>
 James Hansen of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard 
Institute for Space Studies, a pioneer in global warming research, cautioned 
against accepting claims that global warming is a "benign" nighttime trend. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, global warming will continue despite increased cloudiness or 
other factors that appear to be reducing its effect, he predicted in a paper 
presented to associates last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The uneven warming trend was first detailed by Karl and a team including 
George Kukla of Columbia University and Philip D. Jones of England's University 
of East Anglia. They reported that between 1951 and 1990, average nighttime 
lows increased by 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit, while average daytime highs rose 0.5 
degrees. In other words, nighttime warmed up more than daytime. 
</P>
<P>
 They studied the United States, Canada, the former Soviet Union, China, Japan, 
eastern Australia, Sudan and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 But, at 121 weather stations in India, average nighttime lows were unchanged 
between 1901 and 1987, while daytime highs rose about 1 degree, according to a 
report in the journal Geophysical Research Letters by meteorologists at the 
Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune. 
</P>
<P>
 Kukla said that, too, is related to cloud cover. While clouds at middle and 
high latitudes lead to cooling in the daytime, it's a different situation close 
to the Equator, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We by no means were claiming that changes are uniform all over the world, no 
way," Kukla said. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate study of the period 1951-87, done for comparison with Karl's 
report, could detect no overall temperature trend in India, researchers K. 
Rupta Kumar, K. Krishna Kumar and G. B. Pant reported in Geophysical Research 
Letters, published by the American Geophysical Union. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't try to explain why Indian findings differ from studies of other 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has done an analysis of cloud changes in India since about 1960," Karl 
said. "It would be very interesting to look at what's happening to clouds 
(there)."

VENEZUELANS SAY THEY'VE HAD IT UP TO HERE, JOIN FORCES AGAINST CRIME; CARACAS: 
SOME FEEL THE CITY IS NOT AS DANGEROUS AS NEWSPAPERS MAKE IT SEEM BUT ALL AGREE 
BURGLARY AND MUGGING ARE EVERYWHERE.

 A gang of burglars was raiding Leonor Blanco's hillside slum, so she and her 
neighbors armed themselves with metal pipes, a pistol and a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 When the gang came again, the vigilantes captured one of the burglars. A few 
days later, they hunted the others down and shot one in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction in Petare, a slum on the eastern fringe of Caracas, illustrates 
the frustration and fear that keep many of the capital's 4 million people 
locked in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go out on the streets most nights, you won't find anyone," said Magaly 
Sanchez, a sociologist at the Central University of Caracas. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime touches the rich as well as the poor. One-third of respondents to a 
Gallup Poll conducted in February and March had been crime victims in the 
previous 12 months and 72% had close friends or relatives who were victims. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 murders were reported to Caracas police last year, compared to 
1,900 in New York City, which has nearly twice the population. 
</P>
<P>
 The true number is probably higher. Officials at the city morgue say they 
receive the bodies of about six homicide victims every weekday and an average 
of 25 each weekend -- Friday night through Sunday. Many bodies are taken 
directly to cemeteries by relatives, and never pass through the morgue. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, tens of thousands of motorists drove to work with their headlights on 
in a nationwide protest demanding action against crime, which Interior Minister 
Ramon Escovar Salom has called Venezuela's most serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents and officials feel hysteria has taken over, that Caracas is not 
as dangerous as newspaper headlines make it seem. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly Senior, director of the morgue, said most murder victims are gang members 
or delinquents, and the rest of the population is relatively safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but burglary and mugging are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolino Tadeo, who owns a shoe factory and lives in the well-guarded Los 
Naranjos district, said thieves had ransacked his home twice and held him up 
four times. One gang of burglars even took his whiskey, his children's video 
games and his two Japanese dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Tadeo, his wife and two children are taking karate lessons and taking pistol 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 In the slums, where one-third of the city's people live, many residents say 
they rarely go out after dark because armed gangs prowl the streets. Police say 
murder is routine for gang members, who kill each other for reasons as trivial 
as stolen sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopelessness and frustration drive many youngsters into gangs, said Xiomara 
Tortoza, a crusader for the poor. She said Venezuela's great oil wealth 
benefits only a few people while 80% of Venezuelans live in poverty, with poor 
schools, hospitals and job prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people claim police themselves commit crimes they are supposed to 
prevent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to watch out for both the gangs and the police because we don't know 
which is worse," Blanco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Col. Jose Rangel Teran, deputy commander of the city police, said corrupt 
officers are a minority and are being rooted out. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence has taken its toll on police as well: Rangel said 150 of the 
department's 8,000 officers had been killed in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are strengthening neighborhood and night patrols, enforcing an 11 p.m. 
curfew for minors, improving officer training and conducting such programs as 
paying cash for guns that are turned in. 
</P>
<P>
 Few feel those steps are adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 When her 19-year-old son leaves home every morning, Blanco said, "I don't know 
if he'll return."

 As schools around the country open for the fall term, teachers wary of battles 
with conservative Christians are thinking twice before asking children to write 
in journals, use their imagination or study people from other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Teeley, president of the Lake Washington Education Assn. in Washington 
state, said curriculum challenges by religious conservatives have a chilling 
effect on teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we will never be able to measure is how many books were not taught, how 
many topics were not discussed, how many newspaper articles were not brought 
into the classroom that would have been very valuable for kids to have read and 
learned about because of the fear that teacher had that they might become the 
object of another challenge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Simonds, president of Citizens for Excellence in Education, said the 
self-censorship by teachers and school administrators is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't mean they can't teach with freedom," he said in an interview. "It 
just means freedom has certain limits." 
</P>
<P>
 Writing in Educational Leadership, the magazine published by the Assn. for 
Supervision and Curriculum Development, Simonds describes some of those limits: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Who has the most to lose when public schools go off on another change 
binge? Parents, that's who! And of course, the innocent children who are being 
experimented with." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Under the name 'multicultural education,' students are taught that whites 
(European racists) owe minorities a living and are murderers, rapists and 
bigots . . . All human beings must be seen as equal and every race respected 
(including the white Europeans.)" 
</P>
<P>
 * "The manipulation of parents with misinformation -- about abortion services, 
school prayer, sex education, school-based (abortion) clinics, gay rights, 
values clarification, evolution and creation science (non-religious), busing, 
textbook and curriculum selection -- must be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 Though religious conservatives say they should not be lumped together as a 
single group, there is one thing they agree on. 
</P>
<P>
 Simonds and representatives of the Christian Coalition and Focus on the Family 
say they represent the view of parents. "We're not generating educational 
philosophy from here as much as we're trying to reflect it," said Paul Hetrick, 
a spokesman for Focus on the Family. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups also say they are not trying to cut themselves off from teachers 
and principals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to remember that we do want a dialogue with teachers and we do 
respect what they're trying to do," said Mike Russell, a spokesman for the 
Christian Coalition. "It's a difficult job." 
</P>
<P>
 But some teachers are changing their curriculum and their teaching style, even 
if it goes against their principles, just to avoid conflict. They don't want to 
get hate mail, be called names or find themselves lambasted in the media. They 
also don't want to lose their jobs -- and their reputations. 
</P>
<P>
 "People from the far right will do things like print up flyers that say, 'Do 
you know you have a pervert teaching around your child?' and they'll pass it 
around neighborhoods," Teeley said. "This is what these teachers are faced 
with." 
</P>
<P>
 At a round table during the National Education Assn.'s annual convention in 
July, Donald Evans, a high school math and computer science teacher in Sinking 
Springs, Pa., said teachers have had problems when raising the concept of 
multicultural diversity. Other round table participants responded with a 
resounding, "Oh, yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said so much pressure was put on a teacher who attempted to show the 
film "The Last of the Mohicans" in class that the principal of the school asked 
her not to. 
</P>
<P>
 The union advised the teacher to acquiesce, he said. "We told her, 'We could 
probably win the battle and lose the war.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Several teachers talked about books being banned from their schools, or 
offending sections being blacked out. Mike Russell, spokesman for the Christian 
Coalition, said his organization has concerns about novels with sexually 
explicit language or graphic descriptions of violence. But he added, "We do not 
advocate the removal of any book or material from the library." Instead, the 
group has called for creation of a parental-guidance shelf in the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers say objections also are raised to students writing in journals 
because of claims it infringes on their privacy. "It somehow is viewed as a 
subversive activity," said Diane Dyk, a speech teacher in Bismarck, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Teeley said teachers have been challenged for telling their students to close 
their eyes and imagine they're going to be a far-off place. "That's meditation, 
visualization, guided imagery," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sex and health education programs are another frequent area of attack, 
teachers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan McFarland, a high school math and health teacher in Salt Lake City, 
Utah, said some parents had objected to her use of correct anatomical names for 
reproductive organs. 
</P>
<P>
 And Susie Payne, a fifth-grade math teacher and president of the local NEA 
chapter in Shreveport, La., said textbooks were censored if there was any 
mention of homosexuality as an alternative lifestyle. She said teachers were 
told, "We do not want you to talk about this unless you say it's a deviant 
lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 Simonds was to meet with representatives of the Education Department and 
educational groups in an attempt to seek a common ground. "We're trying to quit 
calling school people our enemies and we're trying to quit calling people 
extreme left and radical left," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, he said, "parents have a right to bring any kind of 
pressure they want."

'TUNNEL' PLAY RECAPTURES JAIL ESCAPE; PENITENTIARY: 'BRAIN' AND HIS FRIENDS HAD 
NO CHANCE. MOST WERE QUICKLY RECAPTURED; ONE KNOCKED ON THE PRISON DOOR A WEEK 
LATER AND ASKED TO BE LET IN, SAYING HE WAS HUNGRY.

 He could have made it, if he had gone alone, in the middle of the night, past 
the rats and the underground river, up to the sky. He would have been home 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clarence Klinedinst, a small-time robber with big dreams of freedom, 
waited until daylight to break out of the Eastern State Penitentiary, a hulking 
stone fortress founded by people who believed that man will be good if left 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven other inmates followed him down the 100-foot-long hole right after 
breakfast on April 3, 1945. Ice truck driver Daniel Flowers, parked on busy 
Fairmount Avenue, was amazed to see 12 prisoners wriggling out of the ground 
covered with mud. 
</P>
<P>
 "They popped out like so many brown rats," he said. "I couldn't count them, 
they came so fast." 
</P>
<P>
 In broad daylight, Klinedinst and his friends had no chance. Most were 
recaptured that day; one knocked on the prison door a week later and asked to 
be let in, saying he was hungry. Two others lasted eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the story of this not-so-great escape has lived on. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the 165-year-old prison stands alone on 1 1/2 city blocks, its 
30-foot-high stone walls keeping the brightly lit restaurants and 
garbage-littered parking lots of the present outside. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, a play produced inside retold the story of Klinedinst's botched 
breakout. 
</P>
<P>
 Klinedinst, a mason before he was a petty thief, was left alone much of the 
time he spent at Eastern in the 1940s. Instead of using his solitude to repent, 
he engineered the most daring breakout in the prison's history, digging a 
tunnel from a hole in the corner of his cell. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent more than a year burrowing into the dark, cold earth, using tools 
from his job as the prison plasterer to tunnel through stone, gravel, rats and 
ground water before he dug under the thick outside wall to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the men who followed Klinedinst had nothing to lose by trying -- they 
were lifers. But Klinedinst was up for parole in a year. And all he got for a 
year of digging was two hours of freedom and another three to six years on a 
15-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't understand why he did it," said William Rayhill, an actor who plays 
Klinedinst in "Tunnel," the play dramatizing the breakout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tunnel" used the abandoned prison's cellblocks, its cold, stale air and its 
stone floors as a set. 
</P>
<P>
 Minty-green paint (prison officials thought it was a soothing color) peels off 
like sheets of paper. Water drips through a decaying plaster ceiling onto rusty 
metal bed frames. Trees grow through cellblocks, weeds and debris are 
everywhere and a horde of cats has the run of the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists have opened the prison for tours, hoping to spark interest 
its history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is, in our view, one of the most important buildings in the United States. 
It is also one of the most endangered," said Bill Bolger, a National Park 
Service director. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolger is on a task force dedicated to keeping the prison standing and out of 
developers' hands. In recent years Eastern has survived attempts to turn it 
into a shopping mall and an apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern State was a model for prison reform when it took its first prisoner in 
1829, founded by Quakers who believed criminals needed to be anonymous and 
alone to change for the better. 
</P>
<P>
 The penitentiary's architectural style -- seven cellblocks radiating from a 
central rotunda -- and its innovative penal philosophy inspired hundreds of 
replicas from Beijing to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly more people have heard of the Bastille, the Tower of London, 
Alcatraz and probably even Sing Sing," said Norman Johnston, a Beaver College 
professor who has written a book about Eastern. "But in terms of influencing 
other places, nothing compares to the Philadelphia prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern was a 19th Century tourist attraction. John Quincy Adams visited; so 
did Alexis de Tocqueville. When Charles Dickens visited America, he wanted to 
see only two sites: Niagara Falls and Eastern State Penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern inmates came into jail with sacks over their heads, so they could see 
no one and no one could see them to judge them later for their mistakes. They 
were ushered into 12-by-8-foot cells, dark temples of contemplation complete 
with toilets, central heat and individual exercise yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Prisoners never left their cells and, theoretically, didn't see or speak to a 
soul until their sentences ended. 
</P>
<P>
 The isolation system was abandoned in the 1860s, after authorities realized 
solitude drove many prisoners crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, its famous inmates included mobster Al Capone and bank robber 
Willie Sutton, who took credit for the 1945 escape in an autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
 But Randall Wise, who wrote and co-directed "Tunnel," wanted to credit the 
right man -- Klinedinst -- with the breakout. 
</P>
<P>
 Klinedinst had very little help, Wise said. Of the 12 inmates who crawled to 
freedom, only five knew of the break beforehand, said Wise. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Flowers, a milkman and two police officers witnessed the breakout. 
Klinedinst was captured in two hours, brought back to the pen by police who 
recognized his stutter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton was arrested immediately. Klinedinst's cellmate, William Russell, was 
brought back on a stretcher, shot seven times by police. James Van Sant, 
nicknamed "Botchie" for all the crimes he fumbled, and Freddie Tenuto, a mob 
hit man, took the milk truck and were on the lam for eight weeks before they 
were arrested in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 The tunnel was filled with concrete, ash and dirt. Klinedinst was transferred 
to the city's Holmesburg Prison, tried to escape again over the wall, again 
with Sutton, and again was recaptured in a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 He remained in prison for most of the rest of his life; he was released from 
Eastern State in 1970, and died months later. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, the penitentiary closed.

CRUSADER A SAVIOR TO SOCIETY'S MOST VULNERABLE; CHICAGO: PATRICK MURPHY'S 
PUBLIC GUARDIAN AGENCY SERVES AS ADVOCATE FOR THOUSANDS WHO ARE NEGLECTED OR 
ENDANGERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Patrick Murphy, defender of children and the elderly, fidgets briskly as he 
scolds a panel of appellate justices. 
</P>
<P>
 "The disgrace in this case is we are now six years later and there is still no 
termination of parental rights," Murphy says as a red flush of fury washes over 
his face. "What kind of society are we, that we let this kind of thing go on?" 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves a woman who witnessed the murder of one of her children and 
the sexual assault of two others. At issue is whether the woman should have 
been allowed unsupervised visits with her children. 
</P>
<P>
 For Murphy, it is just one more contemptible example in a mountain of 
injustices heaped each day upon children and the infirm. Each case -- each 
mistake by a parent, a caseworker, an attorney or lawmaker -- serves as fodder 
for Murphy's bully pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
 That pulpit is Cook County's Office of Public Guardian, a 250-person agency 
created by the county court system to serve as advocate for thousands of 
children and elderly people who are neglected or endangered but have no one 
else to fight for their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 As public guardian, Murphy has gone to court on behalf of an unborn fetus, 
attempting to force a woman to heed doctors' advice to deliver immediately or 
risk damaging the child. He fought for state money for two elderly women who 
were broke, but preferred their own apartments to a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is his slashing, often impolitic advocacy for children in the courts 
and in the news media -- and his belief that parents are given too many 
chances, children too few -- that sets Murphy apart from the average balding 
lawyer with a briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider some of the printable tags Murphy hung on his opponents last fall -- 
mostly child welfare officials -- during a legislative battle over funding: 
</P>
<P>
 "Vultures feeding on the flesh of dead children." And "whores." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy battled for a boy whose adoptive parents gave him up -- and wouldn't 
allow him to see his biological brother, whom they also had adopted. He won 
damages for a youth who alleged he had been sexually abused in state foster 
homes. He currently is waging war on the Illinois Supreme Court, which has 
ordered a 3-year-old returned from his adoptive parents to the biological 
father he has never seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been a very vocal advocate . . . (for) people who are unable to care 
for themselves because of their infirmities," said Robert Gettleman, an 
attorney who worked with Murphy in developing the state's mental health code. 
"I couldn't think of anybody better to be a public guardian." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's this view. 
</P>
<P>
 "He spends enormous amounts of energy battling other advocates needlessly," 
said Diane Redleaf of the Legal Assistance Foundation, which often represents 
parents in court cases. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has enormous amounts of energy to give. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy arrives at his office before 7 a.m. each weekday, using the early hours 
to write suspense novels longhand on yellow legal pads. His hard work is 
augmented with hard play, says friend John Friedman, who recalls a touch 
football game in which Murphy cracked a rib but insisted on finishing the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy is 55, the father of two boys; at his wife's instigation, they have 
applied to become foster parents, paperwork he knows will be regarded with 
great interest by state bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 He himself grew up with seven brothers and sisters in a working-class Irish 
Catholic family on the city's South Side. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy considered the priesthood but instead chose law school, helping rewrite 
Illinois' mental health code before being appointed public guardian in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 His initial mandate was to defend elderly people who become unable to tend 
their own affairs, but his office began defending abused and neglected children 
in 1987 after a suit brought by the Legal Assistance Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 What irks Murphy's critics most is his enthusiasm for airing child welfare's 
dirty laundry in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 His office "focuses more on public relations than appropriate decisions for 
children," said Ben Wolf, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of 
Illinois who works closely with the state's child welfare agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when Patrick's right about something, he's sometimes wrong in the manner 
he raises it," said Sterling (Mac) Ryder, who recently resigned as director for 
the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. 
</P>
<P>
 But Murphy offers no apology for dialing up reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their view is that you should not go to the media," he said. "Confidentiality 
laws were designed to protect children. They're now used to prevent anyone from 
knowing what's going on within the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy has made his mark with a philosophy that makes some people mad: Giving 
birth to a child doesn't give a parent endless chances to raise that child 
correctly. In abuse and neglect cases, parental rights should be terminated 
quickly, Murphy says, and the child moved to a long-term placement.

BOAT BATTLE ROILS WATER ON NEW YORK'S OTSEGO LAKE; DISPUTE: ISSUE AROSE WHEN 
PLANS WERE ANNOUNCED FOR A BOAT LAUNCH AT GLIMMERGLASS STATE PARK. OPPONENTS 
WOULD BAR THE LAKE TO ALL BOATS EXCEPT THOSE POWERED BY PADDLE, SAIL OR 
BATTERY.

<P>
 Otsego Lake, the fabled Glimmerglass of James Fenimore Cooper's 
"Leatherstocking Tales" and source of the Susquehanna River, has become a focal 
point in a growing debate over motorboats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about putting health and the environment ahead of mechanized 
recreation," said Michael Whaling, co-founder of the 2-year-old Motorless 
Otsego. He seeks to rid the lake of all boats except those powered by paddle, 
sail or battery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying every lake should be de-motorized," said Adrian Kuzminski, 
another co-founder. "But there should be some set aside for low-impact uses. 
This would be a good place to start because of the historic significance of 
Otsego Lake. It's sort of the Walden Pond of New York." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue arose four years ago when the state Department of Environmental 
Conservation announced plans to build a boat launch at Glimmerglass State Park, 
at the northern end of the 9-mile-long, finger-shaped lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Ennis, of nearby Hartwick, got 988 signatures on a petition asking for 
the ramp. He was tired of waiting up to an hour to launch his 60-horsepower 
Boston Whaler at the crowded Cooperstown dock at the southern tip of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's plan was opposed by environmental groups such as Otsego 2000 and 
the Otsego County Conservation Assn. Those groups, whose members include 
lakefront property owners with motorboats, want to restrict boats for fear of 
ecological harm, but not ban them outright. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for summertime algae blooms that turn its clear water cloudy green, 
Otsego Lake appears pristine. About half the hilly shoreline is undeveloped, 
with forested slopes rising steeply from the water. Perhaps a dozen boats, and 
often far fewer, can be seen sailing or motoring across the postcard scene at 
any given point. 
</P>
<P>
 One biologist says there are signs of trouble with the lake's ecology. Another 
disagrees. Motorboat opponents say it's time to act, before the lake is 
spoiled. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate is a bitter one. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good Lord put the water here for people to use," said Bob Berry of 
Oneonta, who has been fishing here for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think those people trying to limit access are a bunch of selfish 
individuals who just want to keep the lake to themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeryl Shauger, a member of Motorless Otsego, said someone poured oil on her 
lawn in the shape of a fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moon Motorless" bumper stickers, featuring a line of people dropping their 
pants at a lakefront, have been displayed around town. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is also making waves in other places where water-skiers, jet-skiers, 
speedboaters and the owners of big fishing rigs are being challenged by those 
who call themselves low-impact users: swimmers, canoeists and lovers of still 
water and silence. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vermont, a group called Vermont Quiet Waters has petitioned the state to 
ban or restrict motorboats on dozens of small lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're concerned with is noisy versus quiet users," said Ray Gonda, 
chairman of Vermont's Sierra Club chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Motorless Otsego deplore the noise of speedboats. But their greater 
concern is the purity of Cooperstown's drinking water, and the aquatic habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no doubt motorboats affect the environment. Propellers stir up weeds 
and sediment. Wakes erode shorelines. As much as one-third of the gasoline and 
oil put into the most popular motors, two-stroke outboards, goes through 
unburned, spewed into water and air. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is disagreement over how significant the impact is. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall the federal Environmental Protection Agency will propose regulations 
under the Clean Air Act to cut motorboat emissions by 80% to 90%, says John 
German of the EPA's office in Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Mele of Kingston, an electric boat designer and author of "Polluting for 
Pleasure," published last year by W. W. Norton, estimates that the nation's 12 
million gas-powered pleasure boats spew 150 million to 420 million gallons of 
fuel into the environment each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recommend that people fight to get two-strokes banned, especially those 
over 20 horsepower," Mele said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dispute everything in Mele's book," said Gregory Proteau, a spokesman for 
the National Marine Manufacturers Assn. in Chicago. "The industry has been 
working to clean up (emissions) for three decades." 
</P>
<P>
 Biologist Willard Harman has studied Otsego Lake for 20 years, as director of 
the state university at Oneonta's research station here. He has found signs of 
trouble: blooms of algae, declining deep-water oxygen levels, the introduction 
of milfoil weeds and alewife minnows that compete with native species, and 
decreasing numbers of mollusks, microorganisms and fish. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kay Sanford, an aquatic biologist for the state Department of 
Environmental Conservation, insists the water quality in Otsego Lake is good, 
the fishing is better than ever, and lake trout growth rates are at 
unprecedented good levels. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mele contends that hydrocarbons from motorboat fuel pollute the water, 
Sanford and German say there's no scientific evidence of that. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests at Cooperstown's water plant have found no hydrocarbons or pesticides in 
the incoming lake water, Harman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most obvious ecological harm done by motorboats, Harman says, is the 
introduction of exotic (non-native) species like zebra mussels and the stirring 
up of sediments, which makes phosphorus available to feed the algae blooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Motorless Otsego favor formation of an elected commission that 
could pass an ordinance against motorboats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agree with the philosophy of Edward Abbey," said Whaling, referring to the 
late author whose novels inspired the radical group Earth First! "It's not 
enough to respect the natural world. You have to defend it."

 Walter Musgrove in the U.S. Navy? The 20-year-old Taco Bell employee seemed a 
bit skeptical.

 "What's it like sending people back into slavery?" he inquired acidly when 
Navy recruiter Kevin Presley approached him at a Prince George's County, Md., 
shopping mall.

 That sounded like an invitation to get lost, but Presley cheerfully pressed 
on. "Slavery?" he parried. "Did they give people free medical and dental then? 
Thirty days paid vacation?" 
</P>
<P>
 After several minutes, Presley had persuaded Musgrove -- against all odds -- 
to make an appointment at his office to learn more about the Navy and consider 
enlisting. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the armed services have no choice but to be persistent. It's one 
of the ironies of the post-Cold War military: Even as the services are reducing 
forces, senior commanders are worried that they are in the early stages of a 
recruiting drought. 
</P>
<P>
 The military has been aggressively pruning the number of employees in the 
upper ranks, but that hasn't eliminated the need to be feeding the front end of 
the career pipeline with a steady stream of young men and women to fill 
entry-level positions. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Pentagon has little immediate cause for alarm. All the services 
have met or exceeded recruiting targets so far this year, although recruit 
quality -- as measured by aptitude tests and the percentage of high school 
graduates -- has slipped a shade in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 But two large trends suggest trouble in the future. The number of people age 
17 through 21 this year is the smallest it has been since the elimination of 
the draft in January, 1973, according to census figures. At the same time, 
surveys show the enthusiasm of young people for serving in the military is on 
the wane. 
</P>
<P>
 The Youth Attitude Tracking Surveys conducted annually by the military show 
that the percentages of men and women ages 16 through 21 who describe 
themselves as definitely or probably likely to serve on active duty have been 
dropping steadily, and are now at the lowest level in a decade. In 1989 nearly 
17% of the young men surveyed said they would be likely to serve in the U.S. 
Air Force; in 1993 that figure had dropped to just over 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, the Navy has exerted the least appeal on young men of all the 
services. In 1993, only a little more than 8% expressed likely interest on the 
attitude survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Rear Adm. Marsha J. Evans, the head of Navy recruiting, sees several reasons 
behind the drop in enthusiasm among young people. One is that so much of the 
publicity the military has received in recent years is about the force growing 
smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in 1987 there were 2.17 million Americans in uniform, compared to 1.64 
million today. Logically enough, young people assume the services aren't 
hiring. But the assumption is wrong. The armed services are hiring about 
200,000 people a year, 63,000 last year in the Navy alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Another obstacle, Evans said, is that since the end of the mandatory military 
service, most of the adults who serve as role models for young people aren't 
likely to promote the armed services as a career path. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fewer and fewer of the centers of influence -- moms and dads, a high school 
counselor, a coach, someone at church -- have had military experience," Evans 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter this trend and establish their own emotional connections with the 
younger generation, the services are doing their best to get hip. 
</P>
<P>
 A Navy ad that plays on MTV is itself a miniature rock video, with flashing 
images of sailors and pilots at sea, pulsing music, and lyrics that boast of 
the career advantages to joining the service: "If you're ready, if you're 
smart, here's the place to get your start. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Army advertisements, likewise, stress the training and educational 
opportunities. "I am soldier," croons the voice in one spot, "I am skilled and 
smart, I've got the training, I've got the heart." 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when many young people question the relevance of the military to 
their lives, appeals to self-interest make the most effective ads. "The message 
is: 'It's going to do something useful for you,' " said William J. Green, an 
executive at Young & Rubicam, which does the Army's advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Appeals to patriotism and sense of duty generally fall flat. "People say, 
'Don't lay a guilt trip on me.' It becomes kind of a turnoff," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, advertising budgets at the services dropped precipitously -- from 
about $270 million for all the services in 1986 to less than $110 million this 
year. But that trend has leveled off recently, and advertising budgets should 
grow modestly in coming years, according to Pentagon officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, however, it's not flashy advertising that persuades young people 
to join the military. That job remains where it always has been: with 
individual recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a position that favors ebullient personalities -- like Navy recruiter 
Presley. On a recent afternoon at Landover Mall, Presley displayed the fervor 
of a traveling missionary with the peskiness of those salesmen that call just 
as you're sitting down to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a talent for getting people locked in conversations about the virtues 
of the U.S. Navy without their realizing how they got there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, where'd you go to high school?" he'd ask some young person, acting as 
though he recognized an acquaintance. Soon enough, the talk would pivot to 
whether the person was working, and then on to whether they'd ever thought 
about the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other salesmen, Presley has learned not to let rejections bring him down. 
Many of the young people he talked to seemed to reflect the very disdain for 
service that the military's own surveys discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The military life? I don't think so," declared Melissa Roberts, 25, after 
talking with Presley. "I went to Catholic schools for 12 years -- I've had 
enough discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people -- like Musgrove, the Taco Bell employee -- express tentative 
interest but later decide not to join. 
</P>
<P>
 On other occasions, though, the unlikeliest prospects turn out to be excellent 
recruits. Presley has concluded it doesn't pay to draw conclusions about young 
people based on a slovenly appearance or a dimwitted demeanor. Sometimes, he 
said, people that seem vacant turn out to be quite bright. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never look at first impressions," he said, "unless they're wearing two 
beepers on their pocket," which is the signature of drug dealers.

CLINIC'S TECHNIQUE CUTS BLACKS' BLOOD PRESSURE; MEDICINE: SPENDING MORE NOW 
WILL SAVE MONEY LATER, SAY DOCTORS OF TEAM EFFORT ON PATIENT MEDICATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Graham Stroude figures he might be dead today if his fiancee hadn't taken a 
second look into her garbage can last year. 
</P>
<P>
 There she spotted a newspaper article that described a Brooklyn clinic with 
unusual success in treating persistent cases of high blood pressure, like 
Stroude's. 
</P>
<P>
 He had seen doctors about it, but "I wasn't disciplined enough to religiously 
follow the medication," he said. "Sometimes I would take the medication and 
sometimes I would not." 
</P>
<P>
 That changed after a meeting with clinic director Dr. Samuel Spitalewitz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sincerely believed I was on the threshold of a stroke," said Stroude, 61. 
"That caused me to check up on myself and realize the danger I was facing. . . 
. I could have been dead today." 
</P>
<P>
 Spitalewitz says he told Stroude the facts about high blood pressure and 
emphasized how medications would reduce the danger. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident tells part of the story of how the clinic does its job. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic, which serves a largely black inner-city population, is at 
Brookdale Hospital Medical Center, which has a more diverse patient mix. Black 
people run higher rates of high blood pressure and tend to have more severe 
cases than whites do, so doctors started the clinic in 1981 to deal with the 
problem, said Dr. Jerome Porush, chief of the medical center's division of 
nephrology and hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
 It treats only patients whose problem persists despite standard medical care. 
And it works: a 1991 study found that blood pressure was brought under control 
in 86 of 105 randomly chosen patients, and substantially improved in 10 others. 
</P>
<P>
 Those results are remarkable, said Dr. Elijah Saunders, co-founder of the 
International Society on Hypertension in Blacks. Hypertension is high blood 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic's intensive approach to treating high blood pressure in the inner 
city is not widely used, mostly because of cost, Saunders said. But money spent 
on controlling high blood pressure will save higher costs later on, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without that preventive approach, patients "will come back with a stroke in a 
few years, or a heart attack, or their kidney's going to go bad and they're 
going to go on dialysis. And it's going to cost you thousands of dollars per 
patient," Saunders said. 
</P>
<P>
 People at the Brookdale clinic "deserve a lot of credit for what they are 
doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What are they doing? Apart from the specialized expertise in the disease, 
Porush said, one important ingredient is that doctors, the nurse and even the 
clinic clerk take time to stress the medical consequences of ignoring medicines 
or appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 That is key because high blood pressure usually causes no symptoms, which 
makes it easy for a patient to forget or ignore medication. 
</P>
<P>
 So patients hear repeatedly about the importance of taking medicines and 
keeping appointments even while feeling healthy. It sounds basic, but not all 
doctors elsewhere take so much time, especially at the busy general medical 
clinic where most of the patients come from, Porush said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroude, who had gotten medications from several doctors elsewhere, said that 
in those offices the danger of uncontrolled high blood pressure "was never 
discussed in any great measure." 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic takes other steps to encourage compliance. Patients who miss an 
appointment get a call asking, "What happened today?" nurse Alba Correa said. 
If a patient has moved, the clinic clerk may start calling relatives to locate 
him. "We track those patients down." 
</P>
<P>
 When patients do appear for an appointment, they usually are seen by a doctor 
within a half hour, Spitalewitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders, the hypertension expert, called that "incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't see that in most clinic systems," he said. "If you get seen within 
two or three hours, you're doing good." 
</P>
<P>
 Since salt can contribute to high blood pressure, Correa keeps a collection of 
nutrition labels from high-salt foods to show patients. A dietitian familiar 
with the ethnic foods popular in the neighborhood also consults with patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Correa also emphasizes losing weight, because obesity contributes to high 
blood pressure. When the clinic scale shows a victory, "we're all very glad and 
we clap," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, when a portly man was reluctant to agree to a medical test, 
Correa was blunt. "This is no good," she told him. "You've already had a 
stroke." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the clinic's other features: Each patient is assigned a single doctor, 
family members are recruited to encourage medicine-taking and are taught about 
low-salt meals, and patients get Correa's phone number to call with questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroude says he is impressed by the level of commitment and the overall 
atmosphere of empathy. "This is the first time I have encountered an 
environment that is so conducive to healing," he said. "When you come into this 
little place, you feel yourself at home and you feel yourself as a 
participant." 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic has treated about 1,000 patients since it began and handles about 
300 at any one time. Once the blood pressure is brought under control, most 
patients return to getting care from the hospital's general clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stroude would rather not leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot think about that," he said. "I have a few more years to live and I 
want to live it in health."

COFFIN NAILS HAILED: 'CUT HEALTH COSTS' 
</P>

<P>
 Smoking may be bad for your health but it aids the economy because it kills 
people before they become a health-care burden, says Canada's largest tobacco 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 "A person who dies of lung cancer at age 70 will not be hospitalized later 
with another disease," said a study commissioned by Imperial Tobacco touting 
the benefits of early death in smokers on the health-care system. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . Anti-smoking groups rarely consider the reduction in health costs 
resulting from the premature death of certain smokers; and yet, this 
calculation must be made in order to avoid serious error," said the study, 
written by Montreal economist Jean-Pierre Vidal. 
</P>
<P>
 Vidal's report sparked protests Friday from anti-smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that life has no value is incredibly offensive," said David Sweanor, 
senior legal counsel for the Non-Smokers' Rights Assn. lobbying group. "It is 
terribly offensive from a human standpoint. It misses what human life is really 
about."

AUTO SAFETY HUNT A SMASHING SUCCESS; PREVENTION: RESEARCHERS LEARNING FROM 
DUMMIES HOW PEOPLE ARE INJURED IN ACCIDENTS AND HOW TO HELP THEM, AS WELL AS 
HOW TO PREVENT INJURIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You can learn a lot from a dummy -- but not everything. 
</P>
<P>
 The William Lehman Study Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital is helping auto 
safety experts go far beyond where test dummies like Vince and Larry, the stars 
of television public service announcements, can take them. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers at the center, named for a former Florida congressman who was a leader 
on trauma issues, are learning how people are injured in automobile accidents 
and how to help them, as well as how to prevent future injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Miami researchers, for example, have established a link between liver 
injuries and the use of automatic shoulder belts. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the lap belt, a crash victim's hips zoom forward until the shoulder 
belt catches the body at about waist level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have very good data showing that your liver doesn't stop your body 
as well as your shoulder can," said Dr. Jeffrey Augenstein, the principal 
investigator. "Up until now, most of the dummy research didn't give much 
information about what was going on inside." 
</P>
<P>
 The finding about liver damage was presented to about 200 people at a 
quarterly gathering on vehicular safety in June in Washington. Attended by 
doctors, representatives of all domestic and some Japanese auto manufacturers, 
and people from all U.S. government agencies involved in highway safety, the 
quarterly meetings give Augenstein and his staff a chance to share what they've 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Their research indicated that after a frontal collision emergency response 
teams should lift deflated air bags and look beneath them: If the steering 
column or wheel is bent, the victims should be brought to a hospital for closer 
examination, even if they feel fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The telltale signs of injury are masked," said Louis Lombardo, a physical 
scientist at the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration's office 
of crashworthiness research. 
</P>
<P>
 NHTSA has adopted the lift-and-look suggestion as a recommendation for 
emergency workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may be lulled into a false sense of security," Lombardo said. "They're 
used to seeing people bloodied and broken. But now, if a person doesn't have 
those signs, even physicians may be misled." 
</P>
<P>
 And that can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lurking beneath this undamaged skin you have this little spleen laceration or 
liver laceration and it kind of explodes," said Dr. Richard Hunt, associate 
professor of emergency medicine at East Carolina University. "You suddenly have 
a huge flow of blood in your abdomen and you end up dying of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt, who has studied motor vehicle crashes since the mid-1980s, noted that 
recommendations from the study can reduce the dollar costs of such accidents as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 He tells the story of a patient who arrived incoherent, a sign of head trauma. 
But a photo of the vehicle he had been in didn't match that indication: it was 
barely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, all of a hospital's trauma resources, such as an array of 
expensive tests, would have been brought into play in what Hunt described as a 
"full-court press costing literally thousands and thousands of dollars" to 
determine exactly what the man's problems were. 
</P>
<P>
 But guided by the photo, a resident gave him a simple blood test, which 
revealed he was diabetic. The man responded to an intravenous dose of sugar 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in its early stages, the crash study "already has shown the more you know 
about the crash, the more you know about the patient. The more you know about 
the patient, the faster you can intervene," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's crash victims and their vehicles are videotaped and photographed. 
The images are digitalized and entered into a computer along with records and 
other observations. Sometimes animated depictions of crashes are prepared as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the study team gathers to look at displays detailing the injuries and 
damage, taking notes and discussing what they see. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is some of the most in-depth reconstruction of crashes that I've 
ever seen," said Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, the detail they go into, from sort of even pre-crash events to the 
end point, whatever that might have been, be it the morgue or the disability or 
they walked away from it . . . It's like being in the crash, almost," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent case involved a short, stocky driver who suffered arm burns because 
of her position. She was so close to the steering wheel that the hot gases 
which inflated her air bag didn't have room to escape harmlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tube was a direct vent from the generator to her arm," said accident 
investigator Jim Stratton. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, they may make smarter air bags based on body types," Augenstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the program is operating on about $300,000 from the U.S. Department 
of Transportation -- enough for about 50 such case studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "As this (information) gets out, lives will be saved, and it will repay the 
government's investment many times over," Lombardo said.

PAWNING SAW COSTS ESCAPED KILLER FREEDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The decision by killer Michael P. Tully to pawn an electric saw cost him the 
freedom he gained by escaping from a Maryland prison work detail in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in Washington state nabbed Tully on Thursday by tracking him down 
through the pawned saw.Tully, 44, was in the King County Jail in Seattle on 
Friday awaiting extradition to Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been serving a life sentence for fatally bludgeoning a 68-year-old man 
with a monkey wrench during a 1970 robbery attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Redmond, Wash., Police Officer Ed Billington said the department routinely 
enters the names of people who pawn items into the National Crime Information 
Computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy brought in this power saw because he needed the 75 bucks or so he 
got, and when we ran it through the computer system, we got a hit in Maryland," 
Billington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in Redmond were not sure they had the right man because Tully was using 
the alias Michael Beeman. But the alias triggered the computer match to Tully. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike McKelvin, a spokesman for the Maryland State Police, said the state had 
added the alias to Tully's computer file on Aug. 9. Police did not say how they 
knew Tully was using the alias. 
</P>
<P>
 Police traced Tully to Kent, Wash., about 20 miles south of Redmond and 
arrested him Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He cried. He was upset about the fact that he was engaged to be married. But 
he was very, very cooperative," Billington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tully, a merchant seaman, was serving time at the Maryland Correctional 
Institution when he escaped in Baltimore while working as a plumber in a 
building across the street from the Maryland Penitentiary.

WILD RUSSIA FALLS PREY TO CIVILIZATION; NATURE: ECONOMIC CRUNCH HAS GIVEN 
PROFIT THE EDGE ON PRESERVATION. BUSINESSES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE TAKING 
OVER LAND AND RESOURCES. POACHING HAS INCREASED. 
</P>

<P>
 Pyotr Seryogin blows four blasts on a battered hunting horn, then calls into 
the thick green forest: "Little ones! Little ones! Little ones!" 
</P>
<P>
 A family of five huge European bison answers, slowly emerging from the birch 
trees and lumbering through chest-high ferns toward the fence where Seryogin, 
61, waits with pails of feed. 
</P>
<P>
 It looks like something out of a Russian fairy tale: the forest idyll, the 
beasts with long, curved horns, and their white-haired keeper. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in places like this, the protected heart of a nature reserve, the 
troubles of modern-day Russia are pressing in. 
</P>
<P>
 The bison, fenced in because of poaching and development, are suffering for 
lack of space, workers say. Other animals, allowed to roam outside the reserve, 
are being wiped out by poachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve workers are underpaid and under-equipped. Some have been dismissed; 
others take time off to tend their own small farms. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's vast protected lands -- 88 nature reserves, two dozen national parks 
and various other wilderness designations -- include virtually every kind of 
ecosystem and an abundance of wild species and natural wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many things now, however, their management runs largely on autopilot 
while the country absorbs the shocks of the last few years and figures out who 
is in charge of what. 
</P>
<P>
 Prioksko-Terrasny, a 12,350-acre reserve two hours south of Moscow, has been 
assigned to six different ministries and departments in as many years. Its 
exasperated director, Yevgraf Litkens, has resorted to using a letterhead with 
just his name. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't change stationery fast enough," Litkens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Natalia Danilina, director of the Nature Reserves Department, says the 
reserves are in no danger of being dissolved, but that the government is still 
learning how to respond to a variety of new threats. 
</P>
<P>
 From one angle, Russia's industrial decline could be seen as an environmental 
boon, causing some polluting factories to close and sidetracking large 
development projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But from another, the economic crunch has given profit -- or simple survival 
-- the edge on preservation. Businesses and local governments are taking over 
land and resources. Poaching has increased. 
</P>
<P>
 "Local nature-protection organs are not always strong enough to oppose 
authorities interested in fast profits," said Vasily Khramtsev, director of the 
Lazovsky Reserve in the Far East, where trees have been felled in the habitat 
for endangered Siberian tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 At a marine reserve near Vladivostok, an inspector said people were "literally 
emptying coastal waters" of salmon to sell the caviar. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's new rich are grabbing up protected woodland along roads and rivers 
for country houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people are under the illusion that we have such vast resources and such 
a tremendous country that it's inexhaustible," Litkens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under communism, the rules were clear. Across the Soviet Union, local party 
bosses used reserves and parks for their own private recreation, in the process 
protecting them from damage by others. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the system of party patronage is gone, and the new government has much 
less clout. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from some flagrant violations -- a pulp mill on the shores of Lake 
Baikal, for example -- environmentalists say the Soviets generally took their 
parks and reserves seriously. Reserves were off-limits to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a paradox: They made a mess, but they also protected a lot of 
territory," said David Gordon of the Pacific Environment and Resources Center 
in Sausalito, Calif., which works on Russian forest preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviet system also controlled the land around wilderness areas, which now 
feel the loss of those buffers. 
</P>
<P>
 In other former Soviet republics, the challenges may be even greater because 
wilderness managers have lost the Kremlin's financial support and the influence 
they had as part of a large parks system. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Russia has tried some Western-style solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the new Moscow banks finances programs to save endangered cranes and 
tigers, advertising its support for wildlife on television and billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental groups such as Greenpeace are taking polluters and developers to 
court, although with little success so far. Federal officials say the most 
effective way to deal with violators is still the old-fashioned way: winning 
over prosecutors and local administrators who can apply pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Some communities and local governments are trying to attract big-spending 
tourists, hunters and fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Lisitsin, who guides groups of foreign hunters for a Moscow company 
named Greenfield, says money from hunting licenses can protect bear populations 
that are being devastated by poaching, and habitat now being cleared by 
loggers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no money anymore to pay the bureaucrats, so who's left to protect 
wildlife?" he said. "Everything's commercial now." 
</P>
<P>
 Even officials of some closed reserves talk of opening areas to the paying 
public. "Many see it as a necessary evil," Gordon said. "Others are very upset 
by it." 
</P>
<P>
 Park rangers earn the equivalent of only $25 to $30 a month, which could make 
them susceptible to bribes. At Prioksko-Terrasny, director Litkens tries to 
supplement employees' incomes with livestock and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Seryogin, in his 15th year at the bison-breeding center, says survival is 
getting harder for both staff and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "There used to be lots of deer and wild boars," he said, but "this winter, 
there were no boars and only a few dozen deer." 
</P>
<P>
 He blames poaching and road traffic outside the reserve, pollution from local 
factories, even the 1986 nuclear explosion at Chernobyl, in Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something wrong with the climate," Seryogin said. "I don't know. 
There are hardly any birds anymore."

DISABLED SHED LABEL IN WILDERNESS RENDEZVOUS; RECREATION: A REMOTE MAINE TOWN 
IS A SPORTSMEN'S MECCA THAT HAS BECOME HANDICAPPED ACCESSIBLE AND BILLS ITSELF 
AS THE FIRST BARRIER-FREE TOWN IN THE NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Amy Phillips grimaced when she first threw the tomahawk -- it ricocheted off 
the target. Her second attempt and the next dozen or so were no better. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, seated in her wheelchair about 10 yards from the target, kept 
trying. She learned to snap her wrist, as an instructor advised, so the 
tomahawk would bite solidly into the wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I've got it," she said after her first good throw led to a string of 
successes. "The whole thing was, I wasn't throwing it hard enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The tomahawk throw was just one of the events that Phillips tried for the 
first time during this summer's Wilderness Rendezvous, a weeklong gathering 
that provides outdoor recreation for disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, injured in a motorcycle accident nearly two decades ago, was among 
about two dozen people in wheelchairs who competed in rifle and pistol 
marksmanship, archery and tomahawk throws, practiced fly fishing techniques and 
learned to get in and out of a canoe. 
</P>
<P>
 It was held for the third consecutive year in this remote town along the 
Canadian border, a sportsmen's mecca that has chosen to become handicapped 
accessible and bills itself as the first barrier-free town in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 85% of the motels, restaurants, shops and other businesses in the 
town of 900 have installed ramps, provided accessible rest rooms and made other 
renovations to accommodate wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea can be traced to a conversation nearly five years ago between Ken 
Coombs, who owned a hunting camp in Jackman, and Richard Spooner, a wounded 
Vietnam veteran from Orwell, Vt., who has continued to hunt and fish from his 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was bemoaning the fact that there was simply not the accessibility to 
allow him to do the things he wanted (to do)," Coombs recalled. "He explained 
what had to be done and he got it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Spooner, who went on to work on outdoor recreation programs for disabled 
people in Vermont, has fond memories of the time he spent in Jackman. 
</P>
<P>
 "That community up there opened its arms to people with disabilities like me," 
he said. "I've always been treated with dignity and respect in that little 
town." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a large market for outdoor recreation for the disabled. More than 40 
million Americans have some physical handicap that limits their activities, 
according to government figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a benefit for the handicapped people and a benefit for the town," said 
Richard McFarland, an archery volunteer at the Wilderness Rendezvous. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the annual event see it as just one element of a more ambitious 
effort to attract disabled people on a year-round basis for hunting, fishing, 
snowmobiling and boating. 
</P>
<P>
 Disabled Outdoor Experiences, the nonprofit group which coordinates the event, 
hopes to purchase an 80-acre farm along the Moose River and turn it into a 
nature center that would be a base for handicapped visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everybody is coming up here for a vacation, they'll need a place where 
they can hang out, and read and relax," said Pat Friedman, executive director 
of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 In this bucolic setting, where a dozen Canada geese glided on the surface of a 
pond on a hot summer day, Friedman evoked images of vacationers in wheelchairs 
rolling along trails by the river and through the woods. 
</P>
<P>
 A large garage and a former dairy barn would be converted into workshops where 
all-terrain vehicles, boats and snowmobiles could be adapted for use by 
disabled people, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the competitors in this year's Rendezvous say their accidents or 
illnesses haven't curtailed their competitive instincts or their willingness to 
try new forms of recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a different lifestyle," said Brad Williams, a Portland police 
dispatcher who was injured in a motorcycle crash in 1987. "I can do everything 
I did before. You just do it sitting down instead of standing up." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all disabled people share Williams' "try anything" approach. Some visitors 
to the Rendezvous came as observers, checking out the various events before 
making a commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers attempt to make the events more "user friendly" to people in 
wheelchairs by suggesting different techniques or adapting some of the 
equipment to compensate for participants' disabilities.

EROSION CONTROL CHANGES FARMERS' WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT GREENE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walk through a green field in farm country and, once the grasshoppers have 
scurried off, the eye turns to cobs and stalks of corn lying underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 That stubble holds down dirt. What might have been viewed as trash a few 
decades ago is becoming commonplace in fields as growers change their practices 
to save topsoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Required since 1985 to take steps against erosion of the most fragile soil, 
growers have been forgoing the plow and taking other steps, such as building 
terraces and making grassy field borders. A newly released update from the Soil 
Conservation Service says progress has been immense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over 200 years of farming tradition has changed in just 10 short years," the 
agency's chief, Paul W. Johnson, told a House Agriculture subcommittee this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Agriculture Department had already determined that, of the nation's 400 
million acres of cropland, 145 million acres are highly erodible, meaning it 
doesn't take much wind or rain to deplete the fertile part and send it clogging 
waterways or polluting the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1985 farm bill said farmers had to take protective measures to keep 
getting price supports, crop insurance, disaster aid and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The law required growers to have a conservation system at work by Dec. 31, 
1994. Congress is beginning to look at conservation programs as it studies what 
should be in the 1995 farm bill. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of 1993, 1.7 million conservation plans had been developed, Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers can save time, labor, fuel, water and equipment with many of the 
techniques, advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are drawbacks, farmers say. Spores that carry wheat scab stay in the 
residue that would have been cleared by plowing, creating a serious crop 
problem in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, said Ross Hansen, vice 
president of the National Assn. of Wheat Growers. 
</P>
<P>
 The residue also allows the Hessian fly to live through the winter in the 
Pacific Northwest, he said. Some weeds -- such as cheat, rye and jointed 
goatgrass -- also pop up more readily, requiring more use of herbicides, which 
become less effective as the weeds develop resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a great need to allow flexibility in modifying practices as 
necessary to protect crops from disease and other pest problems," Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Working Group, which specializes in environmental problems 
caused by agriculture, has challenged the Agriculture Department's rosy 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth A. Cook, president of the group, said the report provides too little 
information and comes too close to the Dec. 31 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's own field research and examination of government data, along with 
internal checks by the Office of Inspector General and others, has found 
widespread problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Compliance is uneven at best, and violations are underreported. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, "the weight of available evidence points to very significant 
erosion-control accomplishments on the parts of hundreds of thousands of 
farmers as a result of the conservation compliance policy." 
</P>
<P>
 If the government estimates hold true, the conservation practices will save 1 
billion tons of soil each year. How much is that? This is how Johnson put it: 
</P>
<P>
 "This is enough topsoil to grow 800 billion rosebushes using 3-pound pots. If 
these pots were planted at the density of one pot per square yard, roses would 
cover a combined area the size of Rhode Island, Virginia, New York, Arkansas, 
Oregon and Washington."

GALLERY: IN GOOD FORM

 Even though she was the first partner of both, Ninel Kurgapkina cannot teach 
Nureyev's magnetism nor Baryshnikov's grace. But she can teach the foundation 
of their forms.So, the principal ballet mistress of the Kirov (now Maryinsky) 
Ballet of St. Petersburg, Russia, came to the Ballet Ecarte studio in Culver 
City and taught the Kirov Vaganova method to 80 students. 
</P>
<P>
 The revered technique differs from those taught in the West by emphasizing the 
distribution of weight over the entire body. Nadezhda Kalmanovskaya, Ecarte's 
co-founder who invited her longtime friend to teach, attributes her 28 years of 
injury-free dancing to Kirov training. And, Kalmanovskaya says, Kurgapkina is 
also teaching her legacy, adding: "I'm a firm believer that you've got to pass 
on religiously what you've learned."

SOCIAL CLIMES / UP ALL NIGHT: THE '20S COME A-ROARIN' BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every Monday night, the bar at the St. James Hotel on Sunset Boulevard takes a 
hairpin turn to Tin Pan Alley. That's when Richard Halpern re-creates "the 
musical stylings of the teens and '20s." 
</P>
<P>
 This is virgin territory, even for most nostalgia buffs, and a refreshing 
change it is for those who aren't ready to accept that Culture Club belongs to 
the "oldies" circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think of the 1920s as old men in Styrofoam hats and striped jackets in 
a pizza parlor," Halpern says. "But that's not what it is at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the audience is caught by surprise, unprepared for the wit and naughty 
sophistication of the material, which comes from an era that predates the 
psycho-sexual coma of the mid-century. These are songs that come not from 
movies or Broadway, but from popular theater, which way back then was geared 
toward the ribald entertainment of the masses. 
</P>
<P>
 From Halpern's native Brooklyn, there's "The Yiddish Charleston" and "The 
Sheik of Avenue B." Halpern vamps it up, wiggling his eyebrows. With his 
narrow-shouldered tuxedo and slicked-back hair, he's nerdy and spry, his boyish 
charm a counterpoint to the risque humor of the songs. 
</P>
<P>
 As Halpern reaches the end of "Making Whoopie" from 1928, he snatches up an 
O.J. Simpson comic book brought in by a friend and holds it aloft while he 
sings the last lines: You'd better keep her/you'll find it's cheaper/than 
making whoopie.  
</P>
<P>
 A young tourist wanders in from the street, wearing bicycle shorts and 
carrying a Chanel shopping bag. She takes it all in with a blank expression and 
circumnavigates the dining room and balcony to reach the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 When Halpern asks for requests, there's a lot of head-scratching. "Only from 
the teens and '20s, right?" someone whispers. Finally a young man stammers out 
an answer, as if this were some kind of black-tie quiz show: "Um, Porgy and 
Bess?" 
</P>
<P>
 A young woman named Marea acts as hostess. She's wearing turn-of-the-century 
red velvet. "We don't have a word for this music, like 'Swing,' so it's falling 
out of our consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
 Bandleader Brad Kay is responsible for the original arrangements. "A lot of 
groups that play the '20s-type music play the old stock arrangements. When I 
listen to the records from the period, they didn't use those arrangements at 
all. Well, they may have used them the way you use a bouillon cube to make 
soup." 
</P>
<P>
 The bar at the St. James is a plush Art Deco room with soft, gentle light. 
Like the music, it's fresh without being trendy. But will it catch on? Halpern 
has every reason to think so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Margaret O'Brien was in the other night," he says with a merry twinkle.

A GREAT DISSERVICE TO OSTEOPATHIC PHYSICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article "It's a Control Thing" (Aug. 30) is misleading at best and 
slanderous at worst. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been a "doctor" practicing medicine for more than 20 years and I am 
fully licensed as a physician and surgeon in three states. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Leslie Knowlton's first question -- "What is your degree?" -- implies 
that osteopaths are called doctor erroneously. This is absolutely untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 Osteopathic physicians have the exact equivalent training as MDs in the United 
States. We are fully licensed physicians with full hospital medical staff 
privileges. To indicate other than these qualifications is a great disservice 
to the thousands of osteopathic physicians practicing as "doctors" in 
California.

ALL FAT IS NOT CREATED EQUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with interest your story "Thigh Anxiety" (Aug. 23). 
</P>
<P>
 When I researched my latest book, "The New Mother's Body Book," a handful of 
medical experts on human fat and female anatomy told me that fat gained in the 
bottom half of the body (thighs, hips, buttocks), where most women put on the 
pounds, really is biochemically different and harder to get rid of than fat in 
the face, abdomen and other high places (where men tend to store it). 
</P>
<P>
 Fat below the waist simply doesn't break down for use as energy as easily as 
fat in the abdomen does -- unless you're pregnant or breast-feeding. In fact, 
some of these experts staunchly believe that if you go into pregnancy carrying 
saddlebags on your thighs, breast-feeding is the only opportunity you'll ever 
have -- unless you opt for liposuction -- to rid yourself of that particular 
fat.  
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, it's yet another reason to opt for breast-feeding over 
bottle-feeding if you're able.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let me get this straight: The National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse asked 
parents if they hit or spanked their children within the past year, and they 
believe their findings? ("To Spank or Not to Spank?" Aug. 10). 
</P>
<P>
 This survey has to be skewed.In light of such incidents as the Kivi case, who 
would admit to using physical punishment nowadays? I'm surprised that anyone 
admitted to spanking a child, let alone a whole 49%. 
</P>
<P>
 It's more likely that 51% of the parental participants didn't want anyone to 
find out that last week, after repeated warnings and timeouts, Johnny ran into 
the street again and out of desperation Mommy spanked him. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents today are guilt-ridden from these isolated incidents. They're worried 
about damaging their children's self-esteem. They are also afraid of what 
Adrienne Ahlgren Haeuser so desperately wants -- government intervention.

CONCERN FOR ENDANGERED ANIMALS A MUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The disheartening plight of the animal kingdom is only worsened by such 
low-brow, Neanderthal humor as espoused by Rich Tosches in "An Instinct for 
Extinction: So Deal With It" (Aug. 30). 
</P>
<P>
 As long as people continue to disregard the essential right to life belonging 
to everything living, we not only will destroy everything external to the human 
experience but everything internal as well. 
</P>
<P>
 No explanation can be proffered to justify the writing of this horrific piece. 
What is next for The Times? Racial slurs?

WESTSIDE WATCH: MAKING LIGHT OF HARMAN'S INDECISION ON HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They could have held a sit-in or waved placards. Instead, they delivered 
balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Health Care Reform Project, a coalition of unions and other 
groups, delivered about 100 helium-filled balloons to Rep. Jane Harman's 
LAX-area office, calling on her to support one of the several reform plans -- 
preferably one with universal coverage -- that Congress has been debating. 
</P>
<P>
 "The balloons were not so much a slap in the face but simply a colorful 
reminder (of the health reform issue)," said Jarvis Stewart, who organized the 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, a Rolling Hills Democrat whose district includes Marina del Rey, 
Westchester and Venice, "just isn't saying (what plan she supports), which is 
driving everyone crazy," said Joyce Moscato, a spokeswoman for the Service 
Employees International Union, a member of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, who was not in her Century Boulevard office at the time of the 
demonstration, has not taken a position because "she's at the point of weighing 
the options that are out there," said her chief of staff, Ed Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's to criticize?" Hatcher said. "You are talking about a monumental 
policy issue. The fact that the congresswoman has to be deliberative and 
thoughtful in her approach is what her constituents expect from her." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman is not alone in being singled out. The Health Care Reform Project has 
been staging the demonstrations across the country, either protesting 
lawmakers' positions or their lack of one. 
</P>

 BIG SPENDERS: Many South Bay candidates for Congress or the state Senate spent 
well over a hundred grand in the June primary races. 
</P>
<P>
 Most losers are stuck holding a hefty bill; winners have spent much of the 
summer trying to raise more money. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 36th Congressional District, Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan 
Brooks spent $179,720 in her successful bid for the Republican nomination, 
according to campaign finance reports. (The figures include spending only since 
Jan. 1.) Her opponent, former Palos Verdes Estates Councilman Ron Florance, 
spent almost twice as much: $336,589, more than half of which was his own 
money. Incumbent Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills), who had no opposition, spent 
$183,856. 
</P>
<P>
 But you have to look to a state race -- the 28th State Senate District -- to 
find this year's biggest spender: incumbent Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo). He 
paid $459,797, the bulk of it on a barrage of mailers in the last weeks of the 
race. His chief opponent, Torrance Councilman George Nakano, spent $195,797. 
Dills won the race with 47% of the vote to Nakano's 34%. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Michael Sidley, who spent $212,720 on his campaign this year, got 11% 
of the vote. Manhattan Beach real estate broker Jo Ann Rodda got 8%, spending 
less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidley financed much of his campaign with his own money or with loans from his 
father. But he plans to run for office again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I was everybody's second choice," Sidley said. "Next time around, I 
will be positioned very well." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 SPEAKING OF SPENDING: Heard about taking back our streets? Well, here's a 
chance to take back our Waterford crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 This and more goes on the auction block at 3 p.m. Thursday in Century City. 
The occasion is the sale of booty seized by the U.S. Customs Service and the 
Internal Revenue Service's criminal investigations division. 
</P>
<P>
 The site is the J.W. Marriott Hotel, 2151 Avenue of the Stars. Preview and 
registration start at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the items up for bid, organizers say, will be 900 ounces of gold bullion 
and rare coins seized in an IRS money laundering case. There will also be 100 
pieces of Waterford crystal and 150 bottles of rare wine that the Customs 
Service and other federal agencies bagged in a fraud and money laundering case. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy, those crooks must be miserable now.

CULTURE LESSONS; HOLIDAYS: LECTURES HELP JEWISH EMIGRES FROM THE FORMER SOVIET 
UNION DISCOVER THE HIGH HOLY DAY TRADITIONS LONG DENIED TO THEM IN THEIR 
HOMELAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five-year-old Tzvi Adelerstein raised the shofar to his lips and gave a 
breathy blast, the sound from the ceremonial ram's horn spluttering out weakly. 
</P>
<P>
 Tzvi's father, Rabbi Yitchok Adelerstein, smiled and picked up a second 
shofar, successfully emitting a long, loud blow that prompted smiles of 
approval from the Russian immigrants gathered at the Jewish Learning Exchange 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in short sentences in deference to the Russian translator, 
Adelerstein explained the Jewish tradition of sounding the shofar on High Holy 
Days -- a rite few of the 20-plus immigrants in the audience had ever heard 
about while living in the former Soviet Union, which did not tolerate religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Adelerstein's recent talk on the traditions of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New 
Year, which begins at sundown on Monday, and Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, 
which is 10 days later, was for some of the immigrants the first opportunity 
they had to learn about 3,000 years of Jewish heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles and run 
through its Committee on Refugee Acculturation: Religious Life, the lectures 
are part of a program to bring Russian-speaking Jewish families in Los Angeles 
closer to Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee estimates that 50,000 to 60,000 Jews from the former Soviet 
Union are living in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of them managed to surreptitiously get some knowledge of the 
Jewish holidays in their homeland, many come to the lectures to fill gaps in 
their understanding of religious practices, said Alla Feldman, a Russian 
translator and coordinator for the Council on Jewish Life, a branch of the 
Jewish Federation Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "To many (Russian) Jews, Judaism was a negative that was imposed upon them," 
said Adelerstein, a professor of Judaic Studies at Yeshiva of Los Angeles. 
"They suffered because they were Jewish. They never knew why they should be 
proud that they were Jewish. Now they can taste the fullness and richness of 
Judaism." 
</P>
<P>
 As Adelerstein outlines the significance of eating sweet food such as honey on 
Rosh Hashanah to symbolize the sweetness of the new year, his audience nods and 
smiles, jotting down the how's and why's of the High Holy Days. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronislav Bortnik, 17, who arrived from Odessa, Ukraine, two months ago, was 
attending his second lecture at the center. When asked what he enjoyed learning 
about, he replied through a translator: "Everything, everything!" 
</P>
<P>
 Taking notes as Adelerstein spoke was Alla Smorodinsky, a former Muscovite who 
came to Los Angeles five years ago with her husband and two children. 
</P>
<P>
 She had learned about Passover from her grandparents while growing up in the 
Soviet Union, but other religious traditions had not been passed along in her 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, it was too dangerous because of the political situation, Smorodinsky 
said, but later, with the social and political reforms known as perestroika, 
some of the Jewish youth began to learn about the basic traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that she is in Los Angeles, she said, it has become important for her to 
explore her religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to know who you are," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she immigrated to Los Angeles in December, 1992, Irena Govlich said she 
knew little about religious ceremonies and had not celebrated the Jewish 
holidays in her home in Donetske, Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be a religious Jew in Russia was unusual," she said, adding that there 
were few synagogues in the former Soviet Union. There had been a synagogue in 
Donetske, but in the 1930s it was closed and converted to a warehouse, Govlich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only in the last year when everything was changing was there an interest in 
Jewish culture" in the Ukraine, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since coming to Los Angeles, Govlich and her daughter have been active in the 
Jewish community. But they have not yet joined a synagogue, citing a concern 
that Jewish Federation officials say many refugees share: lack of money. Many 
synagogues charge several hundred dollars to join, although some waive the fees 
for emigres. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have barely enough for everyday necessities," Govlich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman, herself an emigre from the former Soviet Union, said that despite 
financial constraints, she has watched her compatriots come to discover that 
religion is something they need. 
</P>
<P>
 Earning money, buying food and raising children is not enough, and although it 
is not easy to do, it is important to seek out a "religious niche," Feldman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A sense of community is also something most of the emigres who attend his 
lectures are looking for, said Temple Israel Rabbi Edwin Goldberg, who recently 
taught emigres the basic prayers and beliefs of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mostly, they're not interested in ritual, but in coming together and being 
with people who are similar to themselves," he said.

SHELTER OPENS IN SANTA MONICA'S BID TO CLOSE PARKS AT NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BUZBEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten homeless people left the Santa Monica streets for a bunk bed on a clean 
concrete floor last week as part of the city's strategy to close the parks at 
night and provide an alternative place for people to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 But although Samoshel, a new homeless shelter at 505 Olympic Blvd., opened its 
doors to its first residents Thursday, it won't be fully open for another 
month. And it will probably never attract everyone who spends the night in the 
city's public areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, 11 homeless people turned out for the opening, but one woman left 
when shelter director Wanda Brown told her there was no on-site parking for 
residents. Brown told the other homeless woman and nine men that if they wanted 
to stay, they'd have to live by the rules and try to turn their lives around. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want this to be another shelter where people don't feel safe," she 
told them. "We're willing to give you things," such as meals, counseling and a 
safe place to sleep, "but you've got to reach out and take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica is footing the $400,000 bill for the shelter, which has a 
fabric-covered, metal shell. The city is contracting with the Salvation Army to 
run the shelter for about $365,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 When the shelter is up to its capacity of 100 residents, Santa Monica will 
enforce its new law closing the parks at night. But homeless people will still 
be able to sleep in other public places, such as the City Hall lawn, said Julie 
Rusk, the city's manager of human services. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter residents have to report between 3 and 4 p.m. every day, unless they 
have a job or class, and they have to be out by 8 a.m. They are searched for 
drugs and weapons, and might be tested for drug and alcohol use. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who want to stay longer than 20 days are required to try to find a 
job, attend school, attend drug and alcohol rehabilitation or whatever else 
their counselors think necessary. Then they can stay up to six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter employs about 20 people in 15 full-time positions. Three of the 
employees are currently homeless, and about half are formerly homeless or in 
recovery from a drug or alcohol addiction. Residents are also expected to help 
keep the shelter clean and running smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody pitches in and takes pride in the community," Brown said. "When you 
get people involved in what's happening in the community, there's a sense of 
ownership." 
</P>
<P>
 But the shelter is not for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 A homeless man who identified himself as Bob Johnson, 48, was lounging with a 
friend on the City Hall lawn Thursday reading the morning newspaper. Johnson 
said he was seeking disability payments for a neck injury, and he expected to 
move into an apartment next week. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, he said, he won't be heading to the shelter. He spent some time 
in the Salvation Army's Bell Shelter, which is serving as a model for Samoshel, 
but he said he didn't feel welcome because he only needed a place to sleep, not 
help recovering from an addiction or mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
 He has few complaints about Santa Monica, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here in Santa Monica, they treat you pretty good if you're homeless," he 
said. "Better than a lot of places." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, his friend, who declined to give his name, said they had been 
comfortable enough sleeping on the City Hall lawn that they didn't feel the 
need to seek another summertime sleeping spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for City Hall, we'd be out of here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other homeless people are looking forward to living in the shelter, however. 
Jose Marino, an out-of-work welder who has spent the last few months living in 
Memorial Park, said Thursday that he expected to move in the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be better than sleeping in the streets," he said.

BRIEFLY: SCREENWRITING: CONTEST FOR MINORITIES TO BE HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Writers Workshop, a nonprofit organization for hopeful 
screenwriters, is holding its fifth annual screenwriting contest for 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 American Film Institute graduate Willard Rogers founded the contest in 1990 as 
part of the workshop's Ethnic Minority Screenwriters Development and 
Promotional Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, 53, head of the organization, established the $500 scholarship to 
discover talent in ethnic communities, which account for only 2.5% of writers 
employed by the motion picture industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Five winners will be chosen. According to Rogers, at least half of the 
previous scholarship winners have been hired by major motion picture studios. 
The entry deadline is Dec. 16.

TRAVEL; THIS TRAVELIN' WOMAN IS GOING PLACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years ago, while taking an outdoor shower in Bali -- a tropical bird 
perched on her shoulder -- Nancy Mills had an epiphany, a 
"life-transformational experience" that gradually led the former publicist into 
the exotic and quixotic ranks of travel journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, while pondering the economic vagaries of her newfound 
profession, Mills, 41, had another flash, this one having to do with the dearth 
of information available to the roughly 55 million women who travel each year 
for business or pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of that inspiration was Travelin' Woman, a "know before-you-go 
guide for women travelers" produced three-and-a-half weeks later on a budget of 
about $400, with no marketing plan or survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its March debut, Travelin' Woman, which industry observers say is the 
first newsletter devoted exclusively to the itinerant woman, has quietly 
mushroomed far beyond Mills' Bel-Air home. 
</P>
<P>
 TW, as it's referred to, now has a circulation of more than 500 readers 
stretching from Arizona to Bangladesh to France -- including one subscriber 
living aboard a landlocked boat in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Featuring firsthand adventure accounts, interviews with travel experts, love 
and vacation tips, book reviews and a travel astrology column, TW has been 
written up in 80 national and international publications, and has received more 
than 1,000 inquiries from active and armchair travelers worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent issue focused on summer love and some of the best destinations in 
the world to find romance; another featured a conversation with travel guru 
Arthur Frommer on the subject of women and travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a dynamite idea," said John McManus, co-founder of Magellan's, a 
Santa Barbara travel store, and, ironically, the newsletter's first subscriber. 
"There is a real niche here." 
</P>
<P>
 Agreed Leigh Leshner, an Encino movie and television producer who often 
travels with her sister and who was given a subscription to TW by their mother: 
"This gives you a woman's perspective. I do know a lot of women who feel 
uncomfortable traveling alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys of female travelers bear out both comments. One conducted by Endless 
Vacations magazine found that only a little more than half of the women said 
they felt safe traveling by themselves; 50% reported "negative travel 
experiences" because of their gender. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two-thirds said the travel industry treats male travelers better, 
even though women are journeying in greater numbers and by 2000 are expected to 
account for half of all business travel in the United States, according to 
government figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills, both in person and through TW, urges female travelers to be prepared 
for obstacles that any traveler may face, but not to dwell on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Peppered throughout TW are exhortations to readers to "follow your passion" 
and not let things such as government travel advisories and political 
instability stand in the way. Even matters of language or other nations' 
bureaucracies can be weathered with equanimity. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you learn how to view them as alternate experiences rather than as a royal 
pain, you will save yourself a lot of stress and have a better trip," said 
Mills, who has traveled extensively throughout Asia by herself. On a South 
African safari she was charged by an angry elephant. "You shouldn't let the 
differences of the locale get in the way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her most poignant moments as editor of TW, she said, came when a 
middle-aged subscriber thanked Mills for her publication and expressed her wish 
to one day travel abroad by herself. In the meantime, she was reading Travelin' 
Woman, hoping that one day, "it will give me more courage to do what I want to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Travelin' Woman: c/o: Nancy Mills, 855 Moraga Drive, Los Angeles 90049. $48 
yearly for 12 issues ; s ample copy $4.

BRIEFLY: JAZZ: HANCOCK TO RECEIVE STAR ON WALK OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jazz musician and composer Herbie Hancock will be honored with a star on the 
Hollywood Walk of Fame on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock, 54, whose many achievements include an Oscar in 1987 for his work on 
the " 'Round Midnight" movie soundtrack and the 1983 hit single "Rocket," began 
playing the piano at the age of 7 and by 11 was performing with the Chicago 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 His star will be placed next to the late Thelonious Monk's, a celebrated jazz 
composer and pianist whom Hancock is often compared to. Jazz legend Miles Davis 
once said of Hancock: "See, Herbie was the step after Bud Powell and Thelonious 
Monk, and I haven't heard anybody yet who has come after him."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; PANHANDLING PETITION IN THE WORKS -- AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, supporters of get-tough homeless policies plan to seek signatures 
at a shopping center near you. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens for Safe Parks and Streets is circulating another petition calling 
for panhandling restrictions and other measures that were contained in a 
petition that the group recently qualified for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 But the signatures qualified at the last minute and the City Council voted to 
study the issue for a month, leaving no time to put the issue up for a vote in 
November. The first petition did not receive enough signatures to trigger a 
special election. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition organizers blame a technicality for the problems with the first 
petition drive, so they're going to try again to get the signatures of 15%of 
Santa Monica voters, or about 8,100, needed for a special election to be held 
on the measure in early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition's sponsors include longtime opponents of the renters' rights 
group that dominates local politics. "It's just so irritating that the council 
majority would ignore (the earlier petition)," Jean Sedillos of Citizens for 
Safe Parks and Streets said shortly after filing the new petition Thursday at 
Santa Monica City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The new petition, like the old one, would close city parks at night and ban 
camping in the parks. It also calls for a review of homeless services and would 
require the council to give police enough money to enforce these and other 
public safety measures. It would ban panhandling of people at bus stops, in 
their cars, at outdoor restaurants, within 80 feet of an automated teller 
machine or waiting in line for a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has already approved many of the measures, including closing the 
parks and restricting panhandling, but organizers say the petition would ensure 
that the measures are enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 They acknowledge, however, that it's no coincidence the petition drive is 
coming as the city prepares for an election involving three of the seven City 
Council seats. People who circulate the petition will also campaign for 
candidates who support it, Sedillos said. 
</P>
<P>
 All that could change if the City Council decides to adopt the provisions of 
the first petition at a meeting Sept. 7. In that case, the citizens' group will 
drop its plans to gather signatures. "If they do adopt it, it's not because 
they believe in it, it's because they want it to go away," Sedillos said. JOHN

COVER STORY; FIREFIGHTING FELONS; FEMALE PRISONERS BATTLE BLAZES, CLEAR AWAY 
TINDER AND GAIN SELF-ESTEEM WHILE SERVING OUT THEIR SENTENCES AT MALIBU'S FIRE 
CAMP 13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After firefighters finished dousing the massive San Luis Obispo County brush 
fire last month, homeowners heaped praise on their soot-covered saviors. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents may not have known, however, that their heroes included 97 
convicted felons, all of them women, from Malibu's Fire Camp 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The Malibu camp houses nonviolent female prisoners who have chosen the hard 
labor of firefighting -- typically the preserve of males -- rather than serve 
their time in a cramped cell at the California Institute for Women at Frontera. 
</P>
<P>
 For the women, that made the residents' gratitude all the more welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Giving us the thumbs up and saying, 'Good work,' made me feel really good 
about myself," said Cathy Andrews, a 41-year-old serving time for petty theft. 
"I felt like I really contributed to something. It's not an experience that I 
had out there (outside prison). . . . My only regimen was getting up in the 
morning and getting more drugs and more drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Camp 13, high above Malibu in remote Encinal Canyon, is run jointly by 
the Los Angeles County Fire Department and the state Department of Corrections. 
There are three such camps for women in the state and 35 for men. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say the camps -- with a total population of 4,000 -- could 
help ease overcrowding in the California corrections system. Overall, there are 
now about 8,000 female prisoners statewide, nearly four times as many as 10 
years ago. That compares to 117,000 male prisoners, about three times more than 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main asset of the camps, officials say, is that they contribute to the 
inmates' rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've found that the camps provide inmates with a means to improve their 
social habits and work ethics," said Bill Gengler, a California Department of 
Corrections spokesman. The inmates, he added, "work as a team . . . and raise 
self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 The camps' mission of using inmate labor for firefighting is very much in 
evidence this year at Fire Camp 13. The women have been sent to 40 fires this 
year, three times as many as last year -- all before the fire season's official 
start date of September, camp officials say. The worst blaze so far this year 
was the fire in San Luis Obispo County, which charred more than 48,000 acres 
and consumed 37 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 For camp residents, the training is every bit as demanding as the 
firefighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The women, including former housewives, secretaries and store clerks convicted 
of nonviolent crimes such as check forgery or drug trafficking, begin their 
morning workouts with a grueling run and a hike in the mountains. They race 
along trails with names such as "agony." 
</P>
<P>
 After such heart-pounding physical tests, the women usually clear brush -- 
swinging axes, hacking with heavy Pulaskis (a grubbing tool) and guiding 
snarling chain saws through the gnarled wood. Prison wages are $1.45 to $3 a 
day, enough to maintain what appears to be an inmate-wide cigarette habit -- 
though smoking on the job is not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 100 women who inhabit the camp, home is a bed-lined barracks with 
lockers, metal-frame beds and gray wool blankets. There are TV rooms and a mess 
hall. But there are few of the most oppressive features of a prison. No bars. 
No locks on the doors. No guard towers -- not even a gate at the camp's 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven informal head counts are taken every day. There has been only one 
attempted escape -- in the late 1980s, according to the camp commander, Lt. 
Scott Little, who added that the woman was quickly caught. Women rarely try to 
escape because most have children and are reluctant to risk more jail time, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the camp's primary aim is to benefit society and save taxpayer dollars, 
some inmates find themselves transformed emotionally -- as well as physically 
-- by the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 In at least 11 instances, parolees have landed firefighting jobs. Another 
parolee got a job with the county Parks and Recreation Department at Leo 
Carrillo State Beach. A number of women who will soon be released from Camp 13 
say they have filed job applications with state, federal or local firefighting 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "With something like this, we're adapting to society," Andrews said as she 
moved huge pieces of dead brush down a steep hillside. "When you leave prison, 
you're just thrown back in society. This gives you self-worth." 
</P>
<P>
 The women, chosen from the prison population's best-behaved, are taught by 10 
Los Angeles County firefighting specialists. They are separated into five, 
14-member crews. Like male firefighters, they learn to cut a three-mile fire 
line in just three days, donning standard firefighter gear that includes blue 
jeans, a T-shirt, a long-sleeved work shirt and a pair of three-pound, 
calf-high work boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are proud veterans of the Nov. 2 Calabasas/Malibu fire, in which 350 
homes were damaged, 35,000-acres were burned and three people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the Malibu fires, the girls not only showed themselves, but they 
showed me how much more endurance they had than I thought they had," said Tom 
Benton, a firefighter specialist who runs a camp crew. 
</P>
<P>
 "(During) one stretch we were up for 30 hours," he added. "We (burned brush 
in) Old Topanga Canyon ahead of the fire (to deplete the fuel supply). We 
checked on homes and cut six-foot fire lines along the edge of the flames." 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighting specialist Roark Paschall, called Mr. P by his crew, says there 
are some differences in the performance of males and females. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a man can do in two swings takes a woman twice as many," he said. "But 
women cut cleaner, better fire lines because they are meticulous." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent trip out to clear dense brush from hills behind Coastline Drive 
near the Pacific Palisades, the blue-clad women from Fire Camp 13 piled out of 
half a dozen red firetrucks in 90-degree heat and hiked up a steep hill behind 
some houses. 
</P>
<P>
 They formed a line that snaked from the top of the hill to a truck parked on 
the street below, then passed large branches from trees and bushes down to a 
woman operating a chain saw. The woman sliced through the masses of wood, 
reducing them to manageable pieces that were then piled into a truck for 
removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Careful to pick up any twigs or branches that fall in their tracks, the women 
-- who have been given such nicknames as Lucky, Kool-Aid and Thumbelina by 
foremen -- urge each other to keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am learning something from the system that I can take out with me," said 
LaTonya Blackburn, 28, as she passed a huge piece of dead manzanita over her 
head to the next woman in line. "You go out every day and you are not locked 
up. . . . There is more freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Blackburn said that, since entering the camp, she has become physically fit 
and "spiritual." But she added, referring to the work: "I also never want to do 
it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Up the line from Blackburn, stood Andrews, breathless from exertion, her hair 
pulled up in her helmet and her face smudged with dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. P is one of the best," Andrews said during a break in the brush hauling. 
"It's a working relationship we have. They're the bosses, we're their 
employees. . . . I've been to prison before, and before I'd say, 'I'm never 
coming back.' But I never really meant it. Now I say it and I know I can do 
those things (necessary) to stay out of prison." 
</P>
<P>
 If there was an oft-repeated sentiment from the dirt-specked women, it was 
that the intense labor is a cure for recidivism. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say the state of California doesn't have rehabilitation centers," 
quipped Teri Williams, who stood near the end of the line. "Quite frankly, this 
is rehabilitation. Doing hard labor, risking your life. . . . Prison is like a 
vacation compared to here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me put it this way, I came in wearing size-36 jeans," she said. "Now I am 
wearing a size 30. And that is in five months." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "You don't want to go back to prison once you get in camp. You can 
see the kind of work we do. . . . Why would I want to do this ever again for 
almost no pay?" 
</P>
<P>
 After experiencing Fire Camp 13, some women say that they would have preferred 
the less strenuous prison life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could make the same amount of money sewing boxers in prison, about $100 a 
month," said Ethel Miranda, 34, who was convicted of robbery. "Your can get 
comfortable there. (Here) it's physically harder." 
</P>
<P>
 The camp, which became a women's camp in 1985, is jointly funded through the 
county forester and fire warden and by the state Department of Corrections. The 
other two fire camps for women in the state are in San Diego County, where camp 
lore has it that labor and workouts are less strenuous. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire camps were created when an equal rights court order required that 
California prisons give female inmates the same training opportunities as men. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the low-cost inmate labor, Fire Camp 13 saved state taxpayers nearly 
$900,000 in 1993-94, according to state corrections officials. The cost to 
house an inmate at the Malibu camp are about $12,000 annually, compared to 
$20,000 at the California Institute for Women at Frontera. 
</P>
<P>
 The recidivism rate of men and women who serve their time in the camps -- 
39.1% -- is only about one percent lower than that of high security prison 
inmates, according to state corrections officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But such statistics do little to dampen the enthusiasm and optimism that seem 
to be the norm among correctional officers and firefighter specialists in 
charge of Fire Camp 13. Benton, called "Boss" by his crew, takes great pride in 
his crew's achievements and clearly believes that the camp can change the 
women's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very good about our camp," he said recently. "Instilling them with a 
positive attitude, that is the unwritten part of our program. . . . So many of 
these girls come from abusive homes and go out and become baby machines and get 
the s--- kicked out of them . . . running drugs for some idiot. After our 
program, they realize they don't have to take it. They can hold a 9 to 5 job." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the crew foremen and corrections officers expressed high hopes for 
Debbie Oberlin, a camp success story as far as most of them were concerned, as 
she was released. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old inmate, who was convicted of forgery, spent 10 months in camp, 
working her way up from the bottom of the fire line pecking order to "drag 
spoon" -- the crew member who gives orders and looks out for crew safety. Among 
female prisoners, her position was second only to the "Swamper," who serves as 
the foreman's primary assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never come back again," Oberlin said as she waited on a camp picnic 
bench for her mother to pick her up. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she had filed job applications with two firefighting agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting out of here and I am going to try and get a job with a 
(firefighting) hot shot crew in San Bernardino. I worked hard. . . . In base 
camp, when you are fighting fires, you sleep on the ground, showers are three 
minutes, it's not even like being human. . . . Now I know I can do anything."

HOLLYWOOD: STREET NAME CHANGE DRAWS FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The residents of Los Angeles need to become aware of their governing 
officials' knowledge and mismanagement of a multimillion-dollar tourist 
industry known as "Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently the Los Angeles City Council, including Hollywood's council 
representative, Jackie Goldberg, authorized changing the name of Hudson Avenue 
(south of Hollywood Boulevard to Sunset Boulevard) from its historic name of 
Hudson to Rand Shrader Boulevard (a gay/AIDS activist). The change was 
initiated by the Gay and Lesbian Center and endorsed by Councilwoman Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 I strongly disagree with any street name change within historic Hollywood. I 
do support the appropriate designations of "place" or "square" with respect to 
Hollywood's historic street grid developed by Hollywood founder H. H. Wilcox 
during the late 1800s. Ironically, this issue seems to have surfaced elsewhere 
in the Hollywood community (Chandler Square/Tamarind Avenue proposed change to 
L. Ron Hubbard Avenue). 
</P>
<P>
 The preservation and maintenance of historic Hollywood (including street 
grids) is important culturally and economically. Within that small area, a 
multibillion-dollar film industry blossomed and a multimillion-dollar tourist 
industry continues -- a tourist industry rooted and drawn to Hollywood's 
100-year-old history. 
</P>
<P>
 In my letter to Lorri Jean, executive director of the Gay and Lesbian Center, 
I stated the following: "I don't understand why a representative of the gay 
community would choose to disregard another community's history and another 
man's contribution to this community considering the gay community decries this 
same behavior in regards to their own history. Wouldn't it be more noble to 
show that the gay community can respectfully coexist within a multicultural 
community? The Los Angeles community desperately needs to see examples such as 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 I also made the recipient aware that the address of the Gay and Lesbian 
Center, 1625 Hudson Ave., is, according to documentation, the approximate 
historic address of Thomas Hudson's estate. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Goldberg, I suggest she re-evaluate her knowledge and position on 
historic preservation. A significant portion of her district has landmark 
status, and that portion known as Hollywood contributes millions of dollars 
annually to the Los Angeles economy. If Los Angeles bureaucrats continue what 
appears to be their "Hollywood agenda," the historic foundations of the 
community will crumble. Let's face it, Hollywood without historical landmarks 
is just another Downey.

ELECTION: CIVIC CENTER FALLOUT CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In recent letters, two ardent foes of the new Santa Monica Civic Center plan, 
Laurel Roennau and Merritt Coleman, have sought to rationalize their landslide 
loss in the June election (60% to 40%). Along with smog, we must now contend 
with the pungent bouquet of sour grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman expressed the usual lamentations of one who has lost an election: "the 
winners bought it" and "if we'd only had a bigger turnout." As if more money 
hasn't been spent both on losing in Santa Monica (ask Michael McCarty) or 
winning (ask Tom Hayden). As if this shouldn't have been the perfect election 
for the foes of the plan, since their champion, Hayden, was running for 
governor and presumably attracting his supporters to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Coleman was more truthful when he was collecting signatures to put the 
measure on the ballot. His line then was that the Santa Monica voter was 
sophisticated enough to judge complex development issues. He was right. (Not 
that it's a good idea: We elect a City Council to do that.) 
</P>
<P>
 Roennau's letter was a calculated "late hit" on Kelly Olsen and the members of 
the City Council who worked on the plan. She claimed that the 
"RAND-council-Planning Commission-city staff pro-development team" tricked 
Olsen by agreeing publicly to his request to lower the maximum height of the 
RAND buildings by 14 feet, but then raising the height 14 feet in secret. A 
serious charge. But patently false. 
</P>
<P>
 Roennau is, as she states, a retired urban planner and transportation analyst, 
experienced in reading planning documents. She read the Errata Report, 
containing the change, "with some care." I submit that she cannot believe in 
good faith that the council did anything other than lower the height limit by 
14 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The old formulation, prior to the Errata Report, provided that the 
"predominant" height of the Rand parcel would be 56 feet (four floors), but 
allowed 40% of the eastern half of the site to be built to 70 feet, and 40% of 
the western half to be built to 84 feet (six floors). So although the 
predominant height was to be 56 feet, the maximum height was 84 feet. This is 
what Olsen objected to. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new formulation, the concept of "predominant height" was discarded, 
and instead, on the bottom of Page 3 of the Errata Report, the sentence was 
changed to read: "The maximum building height . . . shall be five floors or 70 
feet . . ." Believing that the council had raised the height limit 14 feet, 
Roennau must have stopped her careful reading at this point, or perhaps she was 
missing Page 4 of the report, because on that very next page the clause that 
allowed development of part of the site to 84 feet was deleted. So that, in 
fact, just as Olsen had requested, the maximum height was now 70 feet. These 
changes were reflected in the plan sent to the voters, and anyone who still has 
the voter information pamphlet can look at the cross-section drawing on Page 
35. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest anyone be alarmed even at a 70-foot maximum, the maximum height along 
Ocean Avenue is only 31 feet, and anything above 56 feet must be on the average 
at least 45 feet from the Ocean Avenue building face. 
</P>
<P>
 Roennau was an active member of Citizens for a Better Civic Center, an 
organization that during the campaign showed no reticence in making the most 
extravagant claims not only about the substance of the plan but also about the 
general depravity of the council. If she believed her charge to be true, why 
did she hold it back until after the vote? Why nurse a grudge when you can put 
it to work? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is simple politics. Her letter appeared only five days before a 
SMRR convention at which Olsen and three other candidates who supported the 
Civic Center plan would be competing for SMRR endorsements against two of 
Roennau's cohorts (including Coleman) from the anti-Civic Center group. 
Although all three candidates that SMRR endorsed were supporters of the plan, 
Olsen lost his endorsement. Ironically, he has been one of the two strongest 
anti-development votes on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess that's hardball.

FOR SENIORS; BRIDGES WINS HANDS DOWN FOR 'LIVING BETTER LONGER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The winner for fulfilling the UCLA Center on Aging motto "To Live Better 
Longer" is -- the envelope, please -- Lloyd Bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 When associate director Audrey Stein was looking for someone to host an 
upcoming Friends of the Center meeting, there wasn't much competition. He wins, 
she said, in every category -- husband, father, professional and world citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always want to promote a positive image of aging, and so asking Lloyd 
Bridges made sense because he has one," Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridges, a UCLA graduate, has spanned so many generations that he seems 
ageless, starring in the television series "Sea Hunt" in the 1950s as well as 
movies in the 1980s, including "Airplane!" 
</P>
<P>
 Bridges asked that his age not be disclosed, though he is not self-conscious 
about it. His reason has to do with Hollywood, where producers often use a 
calendar, rather than an actor's experience, as casting criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 He's up for two parts, both with his son Beau, in which he plays a 
grandfather. Which one is he going to do? "Both, I hope," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He's lanky -- he weighs 10 pounds less than the 180 he did at UCLA -- 
soft-spoken, silver-haired and has two of the most sparkling blue eyes this 
side of Paul Newman. 
</P>
<P>
 It was probably his 1,000th interview; he prefers playing doubles with Chris 
Evert or Dennis Ralston at a pro-celebrity tennis tournament rather than 
talking about "the business." 
</P>
<P>
 But when he does, he's generous in praising others such as Howard Koch, whose 
idea it was to use him in "Airplane!" And he especially credits his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "My career, what there is, didn't happen that easy," Bridges said. "Thought 
I'd never get in that door. But I married someone who had faith in me. It 
helped. That's where a good marriage comes in. I remember the days when I 
thought (after being turned down for a part) I should be in the hotel business 
like my father up in Eureka and (my wife) said to me, 'They made a mistake,' 
and I'd go on to the next audition." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, if that hotel was in Paris maybe. . . ." joked Dorothy Bridges, mother 
of their children Beau, Jeff and Lucinda. 
</P>
<P>
 They met at UCLA 56 years ago, just a few blocks from where they live now. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days," said Bridges, "all of the sorority pledges lined up in their 
pretty dresses and the fraternity guys would case them. And I remembered that 
sexy Alpha Chi girl and went back to meet her. I thought it was love at first 
sight for both of us but I found out later she wanted to be in the University 
Dramatic Society and she knew that I was the president," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been married 55 years, although when asked, Lloyd guessed 53. He 
said he has trouble with counting the years -- "never got past 45 in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 He has worked diligently over the years, because a person can't rehearse 
enough, work hard enough or have enough good habits, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He did Shakespeare when he was younger, was a method actor with the Actors Lab 
in Los Angeles and has acted with his sons, most recently with Jeff in "Blown 
Away." He admits doing some terrible parts to support his family, but he said 
he has always tried not to portray violent characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd and Dorothy Bridges are a team. Their trophies are the pictures of their 
children and grandchildren. Their rewards are the many blessings they count 
every day. This year they will be awarded the Ralph Bunche Peace Award, 
commemorating the United Nations Year of the Family. Lloyd will receive the 
World Federalist Assn.'s Norman Cousins Global Governance Award. The 
organization is devoted to bringing about peace, a healthy environment and 
justice through strengthening the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 He will also host the Center on Aging's fall meeting titled "Eating." 
</P>
<P>
 Participating on the panel are Dr. David Heber, chief of clinical nutrition at 
UCLA School of Medicine; Judith Ashley, a dietitian at UCLA School of Medicine, 
and Judith Pacht, author of "Lean or Lavish" -- a book that shows how to 
convert recipes into dishes that are low in fat yet tasty. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience will get to sample low-fat, low-salt fare such as Moroccan 
eggplant, blanched vegetables with three sauces, tortilla-pizza with smoked 
turkey, pear and garlic, cold borscht and for dessert -- chocolate cake with 
orange glaze. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Lloyd Bridges, he eats his standard oatmeal topped with fruit, a muffin 
and milk for breakfast -- no coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 He works out in his Spartan exercise room and prefers to swim in the ocean 
than in a pool. There's a pillow in his study embroidered with the saying: "The 
older the violin the sweeter the music." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Center On Aging fall meeting will be Sept. 27 at 5 p.m. at the Jules 
Stein Eye Institute Auditorium. Information: Linda Lee at (310) 312-0530. 
Reservations required.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; HIS GRAND OBSESSION; TO JAMES BURKS, THE AFRICAN 
MARKETPLACE IS MORE THAN JUST AN ANNUAL FESTIVAL. HE SEES IT AS THE SEED OF A 
PERMANENT CULTURAL ATTRACTION. AND NOT EVEN HIS CRITICS CAN DIM HIS VISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The very first one, James Burks recalls, was built out of twigs and clay -- an 
8-year-old's Spartan vision of an earth-toned Africa. "It turned out to be a 
nice little project," Burks says, his stern face relaxing into smile at the 
memory of the little village of mud huts molded with his own small hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, Burks knows that constructing an African village isn't as simple as 
getting one's hands muddy in a labor of love. In his ninth year as director of 
the African Marketplace and Cultural Faire, he is well aware that this annual 
show-and-tell is far more high profile, and thus provides a higher precipice 
from which to tumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few days before the Marketplace's opening day late last month, Burks 
dashes off his signature on a steep stack of time sheets at the William Grant 
Still Art Center on West View Street, where he is the full-time director. 
Although retaining a calm veneer, he can hardly finish a thought, let alone a 
task, without a telephone ringing, a buzzer sounding or a soft knock on the 
door followed by "James, I know you're busy, but. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 For this man who has yet to make the journey, Africa is kept alive in his 
heart, on his walls, in his daily dealings. The Marketplace arrests his full 
attention. It is the grand obsession. "I've never been to Africa, which is 
strange," Burks admits. "I've been invited on numerous occasions, and I just 
have not gone." One of the reasons, he quietly reveals: "I don't like taking 
all those shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its tangled roots and disputed origins, the African Marketplace -- 
which last year attracted an estimated 360,000 people over three weekends -- 
has evolved into a colorful, bazaar-style conflation of fashion, music, 
memorabilia, food, literature, art, history and film. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, as in the past, Jamaican jerk spices mingle with the pulse of Latin 
drums. Women work under a tent with a hand-lettered shingle reading "The 
Locksmith," braiding hair into neat cornrows, while children parade eagerly 
past a walk of fame of black inventors. 
</P>
<P>
 And, also as in the past, Burks can't pause to take in the full picture, the 
fruit of his yearlong effort. There are too many hidden details to tend to, too 
many snags to unsnarl. 
</P>
<P>
 What was conceived in 1986 as a back-yard fund- and profile-raising event for 
the art center has become Burks' way of working toward renewing 
long-disenfranchised neighborhoods, reviving spirits. His larger plan is to 
make the annual event a permanent place where people of color can convene, 
educate themselves, build a business and ultimately enrich their lives. And so 
far, on a smaller scale, it has done just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Expanding from three vendors to 250, from the back yard of a firehouse to the 
playing fields of Rancho Cienega Park, the Marketplace might bloom into a 
stunning adolescent. But Burks has learned that taking people on a quick 
pleasure tour is one thing. Having them visualize his grander scheme is quite 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 More environment than event, the Marketplace unfolds each summer as a 
colorful, fragrant, educational ebullient affair celebrating culture and 
tenacity. More than a vagabond that constantly pulls up stakes, it emerges as a 
proud centerpiece for a community in search of a master plan. A promise of 
something better. Even as detractors cry "commercialism," it continues to grow 
in size and attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we began we knew kind of topically about being an African American and 
having African roots," says Cheryle Grace, who has been Burks' right hand since 
1987. "But in working with this project, what you discover and explore is a 
really clear picture of the history of the African and the diaspora and how it 
relates to you personally," she says. "You begin to embrace your Africanism." 
</P>
<P>
 The hope is to provide some clarity, to foster understanding among the 
descendants of Africans on American soil and those African immigrants who don't 
always understand their distant kin. And to smooth tensions heightened through 
a lack of exposure, of education, of dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Marketplace) has made us very tribal, very, very connected to the 
community and has given us a great source for looking at our history and 
ancestry," Grace says. "I think if we had the permanent Marketplace it would be 
like -- I don't want to say like Koreatown or (Little Tokyo) -- but we would 
have a hub. And I think that we need a hub. Our educational and cultural center 
where we can find ourselves." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Radio news muttering in the background, James Burks pulls in beneath a broad 
shade tree on the grounds of Rancho Cienega Park. The plates on his 
cranberry-red Nissan read "TRANQUL" and Burks is doing his best to retain that 
demeanor -- sipping from a bottle of Jamaican ginger beer. Dead center in what 
will probably be yet another 15-hour day, he plants his cowboy boots in the 
dusty thruway, then surveys the grounds. Almost instantly he begins to tick off 
concerns: about the position of the fence, the spacing of the booths, the size 
of the walkways. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 His quick fixes will protract the workday -- for the workers uncoiling fat 
spools of shiny chain-link who will have to move it; for Grace, wind pushing 
through her blond dreadlocks, who will have to tell them; for on-site 
coordinator Levin Bailey, who will see that it gets done -- to the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Burks, 44, knows that he inspires criticism. He is a man who thinks big, plans 
broadly and speaks in absolutes. It is not if the Marketplace becomes 
permanent, it is when.  
</P>
<P>
 He is soft-spoken, but there is cool steel behind the words. "I'm a 
perfectionist," Burks explains. "And I hate that sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 His is a difficult portrait, indistinct at the edges, like a photograph whose 
subject couldn't quite keep stock-still. "I have people who hate me," Burks 
says, ". . . or they love me. They think I'm short-tempered. . . . They think 
I'm arrogant. I've always thought: Somebody has to be that way for the project 
to work. So I take all the flak and I don't leave it on anybody on the staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Many who work with or around Burks understand that he is a big dreamer, that 
he paints his schemes with a dramatic brush, and in bold, attention-arresting 
colors. "Single-tracked" is how his old boss at Inner City Cultural Center, C. 
Bernard Jackson, pegs him. "People who are single-tracked are not necessarily 
likable," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The roots of Burks' drive aren't hard to pull up. 
</P>
<P>
 A native son, he spent his childhood in Watts, good with his hands, and with 
an escapist's appetite for books -- especially fantasy, mythology, comics. 
Looking back, he supposes, it was a way to travel, to move outside his 
boundaries. "I wanted to have more. I (wanted) to experience what other people 
experience. And (reading) fantasy gave me vision . . . it's fantasy, you can do 
anything you want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Burks' father, a skilled factory worker, handed him a toolbox at age 3. First 
he used it to make trains, then larger structures. "I would always build the 
pigeon cages, the clubhouses. But I'd build (clubhouses) with escape hatches, 
or two stories. I would always try to outdo the next guy." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother and father separated when he was 8, and Burks lived with his 
mother, then a school district custodian, in Compton. "I had a fun childhood," 
he says, recalling rich years full of French horn lessons, band practice, team 
sports, writing and producing plays for garage productions. "The things that we 
did in Compton were fun. . . . It wasn't like now, where there is so much going 
on there that you're at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Long before landing in such high-profile positions as press deputy to 
then-City Councilman Robert Farrell or as director of the Institute of 
Performing and Visual Arts at Inner City Cultural Center in Los Angeles, Burks 
sampled freely -- everything from furniture manufacturing and trailer 
remodeling to chemical milling and custodial work. Through it all, he kept his 
grades up in college classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer work with a branch of VISTA and the L.A. Community Design Center 
helped to shape and shade his vision. And while earning his degree in urban 
planning at Pepperdine University, he helped to develop the student-run design 
center at Harbor College. 
</P>
<P>
 Burks says that with this glimpse into urban planning, something began to gel. 
He'd always had an interest in engineering, in the idea of planning and 
sculpting cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess that's why I went into architecture. I didn't know what it was about, 
but it always seemed like something . . . that would make a living, and make me 
be important. And I didn't want to grow up unimportant," Burks says, revealing 
just a hint of a smile. "I would become that kind of artistically endowed 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What most burnished Burks' artistic skills, in the administrative and the 
creative sense, was his time -- mid '70s through mid '80s -- at Inner City 
Cultural Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "James was always very serious-minded," says Fred Beauford, former editor of 
Inner City's Neworld Magazine as well as the NAACP's the Crisis. "He always had 
a business mind while the rest of us expected (funding) to be given to us. 
James knew you had to work for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, Beauford, who had long left this coast, found himself pulled out 
of one dream and into another. In the middle of the night, in the dead of 
winter, Burks showed up on his doorstep in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was visibly frozen," Beauford recalls, "and he just started talking about 
this Marketplace. And it sounded like he was talking about the Second Coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Beauford agreed to use his summer break from teaching to help Burks promote 
his project, although he was skeptical about what he might find. "I was 
enormously impressed," Beauford says. "But," he adds with a wry laugh, "knowing 
James, I should have known better." 
</P>
<P>
 Burks' key strength, Beauford surmises, is his steadiness in making 
incremental advances and improvements to the Marketplace. And what adds to its 
allure, he says, is Burks' commitment to keep it multicultural. 
</P>
<P>
 " Everybody shows up. It's not exclusively aimed at one community. I see all 
of these farmers markets all over the city as a sign that Southern Californians 
are finally coming to grips with being here instead of hiding up in the hills. 
I see all of these festivals and fairs as a way to reach out and get to know 
our neighbors. So I see James riding a trend. Answering a need." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Burks' predecessor at the William Grant Still Art Center, the late 
Hakim Ali, had produced his own series of vibrant festivals, Burks wanted to do 
more to raise the center's quiet profile. "This center here needed something 
bigger. . . . This center needed a Watts Towers, so to speak . . . an 
identity," Burks says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1986 it hosted its first Marketplace under his steady eye -- 
three vendors (one of whom was his mother), one stage and some space for 
dancing. It was small enough to fit behind Old Engine Company No. 67. 
</P>
<P>
 C. Bernard Jackson, co-founder of the 30-year-old Inner City Cultural Center, 
is proud to see Burks bringing together a fractured city through the arts. 
Inner City, which grew out of the Watts uprisings, was founded on that very 
premise, and Jackson sees the sturdy threads of its philosophy running through 
Burks' work. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson also sees Burks as unwaveringly committed -- perhaps to a fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's strongly dedicated to his vision of what impact the arts can have on the 
society as a whole. It's not just about putting on a festival," Jackson 
stresses. "He is extremely innovative, and he knows how to go out and get the 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he adds with a laugh, "(Burks) can be a pain in the ass. He can be 
charming and sophisticated when he needs to be." But to take the Marketplace a 
step further, Jackson says, "James Burks has to work on being more likable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a man who carves out very little room for his personal life, except for the 
important hours he spends with his 7-year-old son, Daimien, Burks expects a lot 
from others. 
</P>
<P>
 His strictness and steadfastness can be off-putting. And he knows that barbs 
fly from all directions. If it isn't some small drama brewing over the 
Marketplace itself, it may be a comment about William Grant Still suffering 
under the weight and pull of the Marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics, such as Museum in Black owner Brian Breye, are still stinging 
from some early, unresolved rifts. Breye voices frustrations shared by other 
merchants and artisans, many of them struggling, who are unhappy with Burks and 
his mega-operation -- the big engine that does. They feel priced out and thus 
left out and behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuilt from the ground up each year, the Marketplace would cost upward of $3 
million, Burks estimates. "But I only have $250,000," he says, factoring in a 
$24,000 city grant, donated services as well as public and private support. "So 
that's what it (has) to cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Breye believes that Burks should give more credit to Ali, and that he should 
offer a fair price to merchants who cannot afford the Marketplace fee of $750 
for the booth, $65 for cleanup, plus $15 for application processing. And that 
Burks has not made good on his promise to help black businesses and to recycle 
black dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where does the money go from the vending?" Breye asks. "Are we recycling 
dollars back to the black community? Or to other communities? I would ask him 
why is the expenditure so high when he receives money for this event from the 
city?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Earnest Preacely, chairman of the Marketplace board, seeks to clarify. He 
shines a wider, brighter light. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes it difficult is having to operate with limited funds and limited 
resources. James overcommits himself. His expectations and drive blur reality 
for him. He believes so much in the dream, that he assumes everyone else is as 
excited about it. I think he wishes that people understood the concept better. 
People have let him down, yet he still embraces them." 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Burks says, "I'm trying to develop a tight skin, hard skin so 
that stuff bounces off. . . . I've had people accuse us of all kinds of 
insensitivity toward the black community. Black people. I've had people say, 
why are there so many white vendors in there? They didn't stop to understand 
why. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Emma Pullen, producer of the African Marketplace Short Film Festival, says she 
understands the complexity of Burks' vision. "He really does have a worldview 
and he sees the relationship of African Americans to the rest of the world. I 
think he is trying to help the rest of us put ourselves in a world context." 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to smooth rough edges, the Friends of the African Marketplace 
and Cultural Faire, a volunteer support group, plans to conduct public forums 
in the community. This way, Burks can hear firsthand ideas for a permanent 
Marketplace, as well as address any criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always somebody in the community who says they've done it already. 
That they can do it better," Burks says. "And I agree. . . . We're not here 
trying to disrespect somebody," he explains. "The African Marketplace is just a 
composite of the old Watts festival, the Caribana Festival, the old African 
Marketplace that was here (at 62nd and Crenshaw) during the Olympics and the 
old Festival in Black. I don't think I'm the first. I'm just taking it to a 
contemporary level." 
</P>
<P>
 Burks wants to make certain his event doesn't become a relic. That it doesn't 
find itself in a sentence that begins: "Remember when the old. . . ." It is 
what drives him toward the realization of his dream of permanence. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he doesn't often express it, Burks feels the weight of trying to pull 
off this grand feat amid public scrutiny. Shouldering the worries of both his 
full-time city job and his full-time dream, he is sometimes frustrated by his 
limitations. "The problem here is I think that we've taken it as far as we can 
with the resources we have -- including me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This month, Burks will trade his William Grant Still duties for a job as the 
city Cultural Affairs Department's coordinator of jobs and volunteers in the 
arts. But that will not alleviate his Marketplace workload or his 
stress-induced migraines. If he were to assume the role of executive director, 
with Grace taking over as the Marketplace's director, Burks believes only then 
could he better see the big picture and operate at arm's length rather than 
knee-deep. 
</P>
<P>
 With his emphasis on replicating the look and feel of various regions of 
Africa, one might view his project as yet another theme park. But to say that 
Burks looks at the Marketplace simply as a "Black Disneyland" would trivialize 
his larger intent -- to renew and revitalize neighborhoods caught somewhere 
between a downward spiral and an ultimately debilitating holding pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 If people of many different backgrounds can identify with African American 
culture in some way shape or form, Burks believes, "suddenly you create a new 
industry to help stimulate our community. . . . People will say: 'God this is 
Crenshaw Boulevard?' And you are going to take some sort of pride in Crenshaw 
High School, Crenshaw Boulevard. Crenshaw Mall. . . . This is the big purpose 
for why." 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, it is Burks' attempt to become more proactive, to be a more 
influential force in his community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every 20 years the black community reinvents the wheel," he says in a rare 
quiet moment. "Everybody can see what happened after the Watts Riots is 
happening again. We're not dumb. I don't think there is this big plan in the 
sky. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 To wait for government agencies to provide the solution is a mistake, he 
believes. "We've got to funnel normal spending patterns into (a) new industry. 
So that the money is circulated in the community. That's what we should be 
thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 And providing jobs is only the tip of it. Burks has worked out a design that 
he hopes will support the Marketplace as an event while also creating a 
permanent African trade, cultural and specialty shopping center. "We need to 
initiate some intercontinental trade between people of the diaspora. And trade 
in terms of promotion of tourism to countries that have communities of the 
African diaspora." 
</P>
<P>
 Some have sniffed around this plan, Burks says, and shown plenty of interest. 
A few neighboring cities have tried to woo him, as have Oklahoma City, Dallas, 
Miami, Chicago, San Francisco and Las Vegas. But Burks refuses to budge. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of them," he sadly reports, "want to do more than L.A. has provided. So 
people say: 'Why haven't you done it?' Because I like Los Angeles. I grew up 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 And although this city is "a difficult nut to crack," as Burks puts it, he 
lets his passion override. "And every now and again, it tries to become some 
sort of reality in life and I don't let it." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to this dream, he seldom eschews whimsy, steadfastly clinging to 
this belief: "I think if you do anything in L.A. you can do it anywhere in the 
world." James Burks 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 44. 
</P>
<P>
 Native?: Yes. Born in Watts; lives in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: A son, Daimien. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Going to the theater, traveling, reading, building resources for a 
permanent African Marketplace and Cultural Faire. 
</P>
<P>
 On the arts being supported by the government: "Because people are so used to 
the arts being supported by government . . . it has taken on an air of welfare, 
and I've always resented that. I feel that we do as much for the salvation of 
our city as anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 On media misconceptions about South-Central: "When you listen to the media, 
you think only the gangbangers run this city, but how many black people are in 
gangs really? Well, if we're a gang, we're a positive hospitality gang. And 
we're going to gang up on the tourism industry. . . . There are some nice 
places within the inner city to come to." 
</P>
<P>
 On stimulating community pride and industry: "Our community cannot be 
stimulated if we don't have jobs. If we can't control the industries. Sure, 
(the Marketplace) is not Ford or GM, but hospitality is an industry . . . a new 
industry to help stimulate our community." 
</P>
<P>
 On the allure of Los Angeles: "This is a difficult city to crack, but once you 
reach certain inner circles, it's fairly easy. And I know how to do things in 
L.A. I know who to call. . . . I think people . . . want to have that kind of 
(L.A.) excitement in their lives. Hollywood has that allure. It has that kind 
of allure for me."

PARIS' BASTILLE DISTRICT; CAFE COOL; AN OLD QUARTER IS NEWLY HOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rich get richer. And Paris, which didn't particularly need another lively 
neighborhood, has one. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the gloom of recession throughout Europe, the last few years have 
brought new eateries, operatic strains, modern architecture, daring galleries 
and youthful energy to the formerly workaday and blue-collar Parisian 
neighborhood surrounding the old Bastille prison site. The Bastille building 
itself, long associated with the revolution of 1789, is long gone. But the July 
Column, the 170-foot-high monolith commemorating lives lost as 19th-Century 
Parisians struggled against later oppressors, is surrounded each night by 
alfresco diners, strolling musicians, preening motorcyclists and general 
hubbub. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnaud Dupont, a 28-year-old Parisian I found dining in the elegant Bistrot du 
Dome -- then in its fourth month of operation just a block from the July Column 
-- explained it all this way: "When (the district of) Montmartre got very 
boring, because it got taken over by second-generation, non-trendy adults, 
people came here." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, added his friend Rolande Claude, the inclinations of the pop 
culture kids in this neighborhood happened to agree with the ambitions of local 
government. The Paris politicians "really want to see this area grow in 
popularity," Claude said. "It used to be a real pauper." 
</P>
<P>
 All this energy caught me off guard when I straggled into the neighborhood 
last summer. The Place de la Bastille lies at the east end of the city, on the 
Right Bank of the Seine River, and acts as a hub from which the city's 4th, 
11th and 12th arrondissements radiate. Its neighbors include the Marais 
district, an area once regal, later neglected and resurgent again, with 
government backing, over the last 30 years. Still, until recently the Bastille 
area was best known as a neighborhood of furniture-finishing shops and 
wholesale wine warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 I had come to the Bastille area because the hotels were cheaper than in the 
fancier neighborhoods near the city center, and because a Metro stop was handy. 
But as soon as I could be rid of my bags, I found my way to a sidewalk-view 
seat beneath the July Column, hoisted a Judas -- that's a Belgian brand of beer 
-- and set to people-watching. 
</P>
<P>
 It was about 10:30 in the evening. A jazz band by the curb was grooving along 
on "Straight No Chaser," and the sun had just dipped beneath the skyline. (It's 
easy for an American to forget that Paris is as far north as Vancouver.) Down 
the narrow neighboring streets, the trendy restaurants and bars were bustling 
in all their glory -- the Bofinger brasserie and bistro on Rue de la Bastille, 
for instance, and the Blue Elephant on Rue de la Roquette, Chez Paul on Rue de 
Charonne, the China Club on Rue de Charenton, and on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 The next night, I found my way to Rue de Lappe, which has been the liveliest 
street in the neighborhood for decades. Edith Piaf is said to have sung here 60 
years ago in the Balajo dance hall, whose sign still casts a red neon glow on 
passersby. On weekend nights, the press of students and young revelers makes 
automobile passage down the narrow lane almost impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night of my tour, in the Crepes Show restaurant, at 51 Rue de Lappe, 
half a dozen fish circled in a globe-shaped fishbowl, a mannequin stood draped 
in black by the door, and two dozen candle-lit, late-night diners conspired 
over lemon, chocolate and banana crepes. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tapas Nocturne, at 17 Rue de Lappe, bullfight paintings hung on a stone 
wall, and a pair of guitarists flailed furiously, sounding about as Spanish as 
a practitioner of flamenco can sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they turned out to be representatives of the new Europe without 
borders -- the new world without borders, in fact: one was Japanese; the other, 
Argentine. Still, they had the attitude, and so did their listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Those crowded around -- some just a foot or so from the performers in the 
warm, small room -- wore expressions simultaneously fierce and jovial. A sign 
on one wall announced a special of the house: "Sangre de Toro," for about $16. 
Not actual bull's blood, surely. But what? I never found out. 
</P>
<P>
 Up and down the block there was Thai food, fish and chips, an ersatz American 
diner, the Iguana Cafe, Rio Grande, the Del Rio Cafe and half a dozen bistros. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neighborhood was very old before. In the buildings, a lot of laborers and 
furniture businesses. Now, as Paris becomes more expensive, they rebuild the 
hotels and the restaurants," said Rudolphe Leroux, a neighborhood resident for 
most of his 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Chinese and Japanese restaurants on nearby Rue de la Roquette just a 
few years ago, Leroux recalled, "it was 100 francs (about $18), and you could 
eat everything you wanted. Now, it's 200." 
</P>
<P>
 As Leroux spoke, he stood in the modest lobby of the Libertel Bastille, yet 
another sign of the Bastille's resurgence. An aged hotel property, the site was 
sold, renovated and then reopened in March, 1993, as a crowded but clean 
lodging with prices that young travelers can afford -- well under $100 nightly. 
</P>
<P>
 As such developments progress, some worry that the loft-dwellers who helped 
spark the neighborhood's new energy will all be driven out. But that's not 
going to slow anything down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every month, there is something new opening," said Michel Arnaud, proprietor 
of Le Pavillon Bastille, a striking post-modern hotel around the corner on Rue 
de Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnaud opened in May, 1991, hoping to draw patrons of the sophisticated new 
opera house that had officially opened on the Place de la Bastille, and says 
he's been so pleased that he's considering another hotel venture on the other 
side of the July monument. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the Bastille Metro stop, meanwhile, city planners have seized another 
opportunity. Between Boulevard Bourdon and Boulevard de la Bastille, where the 
waters of the Canal St. Martin emerge from their underground course toward the 
Seine, city officials in the mid-1980s created a pleasure boat harbor. It's 
known as the Port de Plaisance de Paris Arsenal , and includes about 200 slips. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest opening in the neighborhood's last decade, hands down, has 
been the hulking opera house that stands near the footprint of the old prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The original Bastille was built as a moated fortress for Charles V in the 14th 
Century, but later converted to its more infamous use as a prison primarily for 
political dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Convicts included the philosopher Voltaire and the Marquis de Sade (presumably 
not in the same cell), but by the last years before the French Revolution in 
the 18th Century, the prison population had dwindled to almost nothing. Still, 
the masses needed a target to march on in 1789, and eventually, probably in 
search of weapons, they charged the Bastille and released the seven prisoners 
inside. Within a year, the old prison was demolished, but the name was set in 
historical vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the site, meanwhile, was taken over by a railway station from 1859 to 
1970, then converted into an exposition hall. Instead of the prison, the 
neighborhood took as its identifying monument the 170-foot-high July Column, 
constructed in 1840 as a reminder of the hundreds of Parisians who died in 
skirmishes leading up to the fall of Charles X in 1830. 
</P>
<P>
 The project to build an opera house near the old prison site began under 
Socialist President Francois Mitterrand in the early 1980s, and climaxed with 
the new building's official opening on July 14, 1989 -- the 200th Bastille Day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The building, designed by Canadian-Uruguayan architect Carlos Ott, more 
closely resembles a downtown bank tower than it does the curlicued 19th-Century 
lines of the city's most famous opera house, the Opera de Paris Garnier. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Opera de la Bastille is undeniably striking and modern. From anywhere 
around the Place de la Bastille, you can't look up without confronting a broad, 
curving face of glass and metal rectangles. Inside is a stark 2,700-seat main 
auditorium, covertly served by all manner of stage hydraulics and modern 
theatrical technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on in the project, there was much talk about making this an opera house 
for the masses. As it worked out, it's an opera house for those among the 
masses who care to pay $24-$104 for a reserved seat (though those who appear at 
the door have a chance at gallery seats for about $11). After the show, many of 
the operati settle in next door at Fouquet's brasserie and restaurant, a recent 
satellite venture of the eatery best known for its Champs-Elysees location. 
</P>
<P>
 At least some of the non-paying masses, however, have found a use for the 
opera house: Waiting for friends or merely loitering, young Parisians gather 
nightly to sit, slouch, gossip, admire each others' scooters, and laconically 
smoke on its stone front steps. An excellent Parisian solution: While the rich 
get richer, the idle get idler. GUIDEBOOK

TRAVEL INSIDER: DISCOUNT PRICING FOR LOCALS TAKES TOLL ON THE TOURISTS; COSTS: 
PROPONENTS SAY RESIDENTS DESERVE A BREAK BECAUSE THEY PATRONIZE ESTABLISHMENTS 
YEAR-ROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES T. YENCKEL, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a trip to the Colorado Rockies this spring, Bill Fish of Washington 
encountered a pricing policy he considered unfair to tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the restaurants and shops he patronized, including a Wendy's fast-food 
outlet in Silverthorne, routinely offer residents a 10% discount for which he 
as a visitor didn't qualify. It angered him, and he lodged a protest with the 
Chamber of Commerce of Summit County, where Silverthorne is located. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really dumb on their part," charges Fish, an employee of the Federal 
Aviation Administration. "The bread and butter of the county is tourists. I 
think everybody ought to be treated squarely." 
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not, tourists frequently are expected to pay more for the same 
services or goods than their hosts. In Hawaii, permanent residents can fly 
between the islands on Aloha Airlines for a one-way fare of $64 while visitors 
pay $74. When I visited St. Petersburg, Russia, last year, I paid $6.50 to 
enter the Hermitage, one of the world's great art museums. The price for 
Russians came to about 26 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 So what can you do about it? 
</P>
<P>
 In Fish's opinion, you can avoid places that discriminate in pricing against 
tourists, or you can "pretend you're a local." At the Silverthorne Wendy's, 
however, the latter tactic doesn't work. As Fish discovered, the restaurant 
asks for a valid Colorado driver's license showing a Summit County address. 
</P>
<P>
 A third option, perhaps, is simply to understand why residents sometimes get a 
better deal. Wendy's and Aloha, along with the Summit County Chamber of 
Commerce, maintain that there are valid reasons for the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to do something nice for the locals," says Mina Baker, manager 
of the Wendy's outlet in Silverthorne. Unlike tourists who may visit for just a 
few days or a week or two, "The locals are here all year-round. They give us 
steady business." She says a 10% discount on food is offered throughout the 
year to customers with a Summit County address, as well as to those age 65 and 
older. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker believes that the majority of restaurants and other service-type firms 
in the county offer locals much the same deal. Maxine Thomas of the county 
chamber of commerce says she is aware of several county firms that give 
residents a discount, but she doesn't want to speculate on how widely spread 
the practice is. Nevertheless, the firms that offer discounts do so 
particularly during the spring and fall off-seasons when the tourists aren't 
around. "They have to give incentives to the locals to come in and buy stuff," 
she says, "so they can last through the off-season. They're just trying to 
cover their costs." If the locals didn't shop in the off-season, many of the 
firms providing goods and services tourists demand might go out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 And in many cases, the locals really do need the price breaks. Many of them 
earn little more than the minimum wage in food-handling or other tourism-type 
jobs, she says, and dining out even at a fast-food outlet is considered a big 
expense.  
</P>
<P>
 Visitors who are aware of a discount for locals should ask for it for 
themselves, she advises. She doubts that many firms will require 
identification, because "they need the business." 
</P>
<P>
 Aloha contends that the airline's discounts to Hawaiian residents compensate 
them for disadvantages not borne by tourists. As Deaner Snively of Aloha's San 
Francisco sales office explains, mainland residents who want to travel can hop 
in their cars and drive from state to state. But anyone in Hawaii who wants to 
go any distance from home must fly, even if only to a neighboring island, which 
is costly. 
</P>
<P>
 But locals don't get the best deal; members of the American Automobile 
Association Assn. get an even better break. A one-way ticket between islands is 
just $58 if you hold an AAA card, compared to the $64 price for locals. 
</P>
<P>
 In my experience, many economically strapped nations -- including Russia and 
the former Communist bloc nations -- impose two-tier pricing systems for 
theater and museum tickets and city sightseeing tours. As long as I'm aware of 
what's happening, this has never bothered me. At the Hermitage, a sign at the 
ticket booth in Russian -- noted the differing prices for Russians and 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 At $6.50, the entrance fee hardly seemed outrageous. The price is about what I 
would expect to pay in many American cities for a museum of similar quality. 
And if during these troubled times for Russia the extra money helps keep the 
museum open and in good shape then so much the better. 
</P>
<P>
 As Fish points out, my option if I didn't want to pay more was to skip the 
museum. That's every visitor's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in Russia, you can get around this double standard if you choose. I 
stood in line at the Hermitage with a group of about 20 teachers and high 
school students from California touring on a cultural exchange program. To save 
money, they sent their Russian guide up to the ticket booth to buy 26-cent 
tickets for everyone.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: WHEN A CRUISE BECOMES A RESCUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For some Caribbean cruise passengers, the traditional diversions of a day at 
sea -- betting on snowball bingo and swilling umbrella drinks by the pool -- 
are being supplemented by a new activity: rescuing Cuban rafters. 
</P>
<P>
 Under maritime law, ships must provide humanitarian assistance to other 
vessels in distress. Though neither the U.S. Coast Guard nor the cruise lines 
have exact numbers, officials in Miami estimate that more than 200 Cuban 
refugees have been picked up by cruise liners over the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the rescues have taken place in the Florida Straits between Key West 
and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest rescues took place Aug. 15 on Royal Caribbean's Majesty of 
the Seas, when crew members plucked 51 Cubans from three boats in the Straits. 
The ship provided food, water and medical care and kept the refugees in a crew 
area until a Coast Guard cutter arrived, said Royal Caribbean spokesman Rich 
Steck. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Caribbean and Coast Guard officials say the number of Cuban vessels 
intercepted by cruise ships has decreased recently, largely because more than 
70 Coast Guard and Navy vessels are now patrolling the Florida Straits. 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokeswoman for Carnival Cruise Lines, whose ships Holiday, Ecstasy and 
Sensation travel through the Florida Straits en route to Mexico, said the 
number of cruise ship rescues has "definitely escalated" over the past several 
weeks. And Norwegian Cruise Line, whose Seaward sails weekly from Miami to Key 
West andCozumel, reports the ship has picked up Cuban rafters over the past two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruise line officials say that in most cases, the delays caused by picking up 
refugees at sea have not affected passenger itineraries. Refugees are generally 
confined to crew areas until they are transferred to a Coast Guard vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Florida Keys tourism industry is battling a perception among 
would-be visitors that the state's southern tip is inundated with Cuban 
refugees. The Monroe County Tourist Development Council took out newspaper ads 
and sent a computer message to 75,000 travel agents nationwide, letting them 
know it's business as usual in Key West and the rest of the keys. LAURA BLY

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: ONCE MORE INTO THE CHUNNEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, there is a scheduled start date for Channel Tunnel passenger train 
service between London and Paris and London and Brussels. But so far, there are 
no rates, no reservations nor any firm word on how many trains will be making 
the first trips. 
</P>
<P>
 High-speed passenger service, called Eurostar, is scheduled to begin Oct. 23 
(pending final approval by a Joint Inter-Governmental Committee). Spokesmen for 
BritRail and Rail Europe say rates will be set sometime this month, with 
tickets scheduled to go on sale Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still don't have the fares and until we have the fares, we can't take 
actual bookings," a BritRail spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it starts, the nonstop service is going to be limited to one or two 
trains a day in each direction. Rail spokesmen say plans call for 15 trains a 
day on each route by mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Eurotunnel was opened with much fanfare in May, it has seen only 
test runs since then. Le Shuttle, the transport service for cars, trucks and 
motorcycles that was expected to begin operations first, encountered various 
delays and is now anticipating an October start date also. 
</P>
<P>
 BritRail and Rail Europe have taken thousands of "priority reservations" from 
consumers. Both companies say they will contact travelers when they have more 
specific information. Consumers wishing to add their names to the lists can 
call BritRail (800-677-8585) or Rail Europe (800-94-CHUNNEL) for Eurostar; and 
(800) 388-3876 for Le Shuttle.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: INVERNESS; AT THE ARK BED AND BREAKFAST, GROOVING ON NATURE AND 
THE BEAT OF AN EARLIER ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE HURLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Hurley is film editor for The Times 
Calendar section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You might think you've had it up to here with the commemoration of the 
Woodstock era, but there's a cozy, offbeat (and fully plumbed) bed and 
breakfast in Marin County -- perfect for two or four, not 200,000 -- that 
stands as a self-sufficient monument to the best of the hippie era. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as the Ark, it was built in 1971 in woodsy Inverness by a class of UC 
Berkeley architecture students under the tutelage of architect, professor and, 
later, maverick California State Architect Sim Van der Ryn. The Ark (nicknamed 
by the students for the main architecture school building on the Berkeley 
campus) and its surroundings embody the back-to-the-land ethos of the early 
'70s at its most guileless. 
</P>
<P>
 Van der Ryn began the project after purchasing a plot of prime forest land up 
several switchbacks from the hamlet of Inverness, 60 miles north of San 
Francisco, near the Point Reyes National Seashore. His class, "Making a Place 
in the Country," set out to do just that, using reclaimed materials such as 
wood from old chicken coops and glass salvaged from the town dump. The project, 
chronicled by a scrapbook that remains in the cottage, was clearly a labor of 
love for the students, who added their own embellishments such as vast 
skylights and mosaic windows as they went along. 
</P>
<P>
 After a long, hot summer in Los Angeles, my boyfriend and I were ready for 
just such a place in the country, and boarded a flight from LAX to San 
Francisco one recent Friday afternoon. We picked up our Budget compact and 
settled into a comfy drive north 53 miles through the center of San Francisco, 
over the Golden Gate Bridge, and then northwest into Marin County on tiny 
winding roads. The weather here can be blustery, even in summer, but this day 
was clear, sunny and just cool enough to feel like we really had escaped Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in Inverness, we turned up Inverness Way and climbed steadily up the hill 
as the road narrowed and threatened to become overrun with ferns and 
overhanging cedar branches. As the forest became thicker, the road became 
narrower until, finally, it petered out completely near the top of the hill; to 
our right, just as the directions had said, there was a tiny carved wood sign 
saying simply "Ark," before a parking spot covered with pine needles. 
</P>
<P>
 Just beyond the sign, through a thicket of vegetation, lay the cottage, an 
invitingly warm dwelling that has apparently changed little since the day it 
was completed. (It is left unlocked on the day a new guest is checking in, 
though there is a key to use when you leave for an outing.) The utter stillness 
of the setting -- adjacent to a Nature Conservancy wildlife preserve -- is 
interrupted only by birds and the occasional rustling of the trees. The decor 
is mostly differing shades and finishes of wood, punctuated by an occasional 
period piece such as a squat wood-burning stove (the woodpile outside is 
generously supplied; and, since the cottage is available year-round, there are 
also baseboard heaters) and lovely fabric screens and weavings created by Van 
der Ryn's wife, artist Myung Jin.  
</P>
<P>
 There is also a stereo system, complete with turntable and vintage vinyl LPs; 
a stack of them, including Joni Mitchell's "Court and Spark" and Neil Young's 
"Harvest," create the ideal weekend soundtrack. We listened to them over and 
over, with a little Cris Williamson thrown in -- though the radio is equipped 
with a strong antenna to pick up Bay Area stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The kitchen is tiny but serviceable (on a previous visit here the year before, 
I'd made a complete roast-chicken dinner, though this time, the most ambitious 
dish we whipped up was a fresh-fruit salad), and is stocked with some staples 
and all the cooking utensils one could need. The "breakfast" portion of bed and 
breakfast is supplied each afternoon when innkeeper Suzanne Storch, who lives 
nearby, pays a visit to fill the larder with organic oranges for juice (an 
electric juicer is one of the few nods to the '90s), organic coffee beans, 
baked goods, granola, milk, fresh fruit and brown eggs. The original outhouse 
is long gone, replaced by a fully functional bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 We spent the better part of our arrival Friday afternoon exploring the cottage 
and the grounds, after a quick read through the students' scrapbook for an 
overview. There are remnants of several original outbuildings, including a 
sauna, which is no longer operative, and which the forest moss and furry 
creatures are slowly reclaiming -- but it was fun to climb around it and go 
inside. A separate shower building, constructed with a full-length window next 
to the shower head so that bathers could have an unobstructed view of the 
forest (the building now houses a rather unprosaic washer and dryer), sits 
between the sauna and the Ark, and an abandoned brick oven, the first meal from 
which is mouthwateringly chronicled in the students' scrapbook. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ark comfortably can sleep six, with a deluxe queen-size bed in the main 
room, trundle beds in a small adjacent room and futons in the sky-lit loft. But 
its biggest appeal is as a romantic getaway for two, judging from guest-book 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Such bliss doesn't come at 1971 prices; a Friday and Saturday night weekend 
stay costs $297 for two (including tax), plus $15 for each additional person 
per night. But considering the prices at comparable bed and breakfast inns or 
hotels in similar lovely settings, it seems quite reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, we headed out to Point Reyes National Seashore, just a few miles 
away, one of the most wind-swept sites in North America; even when temperatures 
are sunny and warm in Inverness or San Francisco, it's not unusual for fog, 
wind and clouds to sock in the area. This day, it was mildly overcast with just 
a brisk breeze. It is bleak and beautiful, and with a couple of well-timed 
breath stops disguised as view appreciation, we schlepped down, and back up the 
300 stairs from the top of the point to the grand old lighthouse, which 
operated from 1870 to 1977. From the point, we could see families of sea lions 
and common murres. The Seashore acreage also includes miles of trails for 
hiking and mountain biking. Bikes can be rented at Trail Head Rentals in Olema, 
just about a mile from the Bear Valley visitor's center in the seashore park. 
</P>
<P>
 Small cozy cafes that capitalize on local treats such as fresh fish and 
oysters can be found in Inverness and the nearby small towns of Point Reyes 
Station and Olema. We dropped in at the Roadhouse Oyster Bar and the Station 
House Cafe in Point Reyes Station for seafood and pasta; the more adventurous 
can try chicken paprikash at Vladimir's in Inverness, an apparently authentic 
Czechoslovakian restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 But for a truly special weekend, your best bet would be to eat cheaply for 
most meals, or cook for yourselves at the Ark, and then splurge for one meal at 
Manka's in Inverness, one of Northern California's most innovative and widely 
praised restaurants.  
</P>
<P>
 Manka's, begun as a hunting lodge in 1917, features a revolving menu that 
focuses on local ingredients, especially game. On a recent Saturday night 
dinner we dined on a flawless meal, from appetizers of simple, earthy greens 
and a summer corn-squash soup, to sumptuous main courses of roast duck in 
nectarine sauce and pan-seared venison with summer chanterelles. The total tab 
for two, with dessert and bottled water but no wine (and if you're a wine 
drinker, you will definitely want to sample the impressive wine list) was $75. 
</P>
<P>
 By Sunday morning, thoroughly mellow and contentedly full of granola and 
organic coffee, we headed back south, listening to an oldies station all the 
way. Budget for Two

TAKING THE KIDS: GETTING THE TODDLERS' TAKES ON TRIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Melanie refused to be hurried. She wanted to inspect every leaf, turn over 
every rock and dip her hands in every trickle of mountain water. 
</P>
<P>
 Exasperated, her older siblings, Matt and Reggie, hurried ahead of us on the 
trail in Mt. Rainier National Park. Soon Melanie demanded to be carried but 
every minute or so, wanted to get down to examine something else. "Good thing 
we weren't attempting a really long hike," my husband, Andy, said, straining 
with 37-pound Melanie on his shoulders. I wondered if we would ever get to the 
top of the waterfall. (We didn't.) Melanie was alternately hungry and thirsty, 
taking her sweat shirt off and putting it back on. 
</P>
<P>
 That's traveling with a 3-year-old: frustrating, exhausting and, at times, 
havoc-wreaking with any agenda. She was always starved just after we left the 
restaurant and wide awake when the rest of us were ready for bed.  
</P>
<P>
 But having Melanie along as we toured Oregon and Washington state this summer 
was an adventure I wouldn't have missed for anything. She made all of us stop 
and look at every turn, enjoying every place all the more. She had an opinion 
on everything: the devastation from the volcano eruption of Mt. St. Helens 
("The mountain blew up on us?" she asked); the ugly giant Pacific octopus in 
the aquarium ("He's too yucky!"); the snowboarders on Mt. Hood, the varying 
quality of chocolate milk at different locales. She made us all laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick to traveling successfully with preschoolers, I decided, is to slow 
down and look at the world from their perspective, rather than expecting them 
to adapt to an adult world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't go to countries where the main activities are fine dining and art 
museums," said Susanne Nowicki, who traveled to Malaysia with her 3-year-old 
and to New Zealand with that child and a younger son. "Forget those romantic 
dinners for two. It's not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 "We went berry picking instead of antiquing," said Diane Hammond, who recently 
returned to her home in Newport, Ore., from a trip to North Carolina with her 
young daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there was the time in Malaysia when Nowicki sat in the back of a 
cab reading "Curious George" to her daughter while her husband raced out to 
look at temples. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond's daughter, meanwhile, was terrified of the airplane bathroom and 
refused to use it on a cross-country flight, causing her mother more than a 
small amount of anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I would have liked to have spent a lot of time in those temples. I'd 
come all that way. But it seemed a small price to pay for having her along," 
said Nowicki, who lives near Chicago and is planning a fall trip to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We listened to the night bugs and smelled the pine needles," Hammond said. 
"We walked around the neighborhood a lot. We had a wonderful time." 
</P>
<P>
 Her advice: Bring "sleep friends," and even a night light from home to make 
the nighttime ritual easier in a strange place. Another mother, in fact, said 
bringing her child's sheets from home made all the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 But forget lugging huge bags of toys. A few will keep the kids amused en 
route. In a new place, Nowicki said, there's so much to see and do, 
preschoolers won't even bother with their toys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let the kids pick what to take along," said Gillian McNamee, a professor at 
the Chicago-based Erikson Institute, the graduate school and research center 
for advanced study in child development. 
</P>
<P>
 McNamee is also the mom of a well-traveled 5-year-old daughter and year-old 
son. She never leaves home without a skein of rope (for making tents from hotel 
blankets), a flashlight (to play with in the tent) and a bag of Legos (because 
they can be used over and over again in different ways). 
</P>
<P>
 "Audio cassettes are the backbone of our trips these days," she said. Young 
children respond especially well to stories their parents have taped for them. 
</P>
<P>
 McNamee recommends, if possible, planning the trip so that there will be other 
adults and young children. If you're lucky, you may even be able to trade off 
some child-care chores. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't forget to let your preschooler in on the planning, said veteran Chicago 
nursery school director Sue Brenner. That doesn't mean letting a 3-year-old 
decide whether to go to London or San Francisco. But let them pick whether they 
would prefer a zoo or a museum with dinosaurs in the city, a canoe ride or a 
hike in a national park. "They'll feel they have some control," Brenner said. 
They might also learn a bit about making decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Show them pictures ahead of time of what they will see and do so it won't be 
totally unfamiliar. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why we've been looking at books on Yellowstone National Park. But even 
the pictures haven't dissuaded Melanie's notions of what she'll find there. 
Surely if there are so many animals, there must be elephants and giraffes, she 
said.

BACKPACK & BUDGET; NURTURING NATURE IN COSTA RICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the most memorable moments I've experienced in a foreign country were 
during a moonlit night on a Costa Rican beach when I joined a small group to 
watch quietly as a giant leatherback turtle hauled herself up from the sea to 
dig a nest and, in a trance-like state, deposit her eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny Central American nation of Costa Rica is an environmentalist's 
delight. About 5% of all known species on Earth can be found here and yet it 
covers less than three-ten thousandths of the world's land area. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent travelers have a new source of current information to help them 
learn more about the fascinating flora and fauna of this Central American 
nation and to help them arrange their own explorations of the country. It's the 
574-page, first edition of "Costa Rica Handbook" (Moon Publications, $17.95) by 
Christopher Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the compact nation is a diverse terrain that includes belching 
volcanoes, tropical rain forest and sandy surfing beaches. "About the only 
adventure activities not possible in Costa Rica are those that involve snow 
skis or camels," Baker points out. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget travelers will find that they can reach most points within the country 
from San Jose by bus for under $6. One of the areas especially attractive to 
young North American travelers is Tamarindo on the Pacific Coast. It's a 
popular surfing area with a range of accommodations from backpackers' lodges to 
deluxe hotel rooms.  
</P>
<P>
 From Tamarindo, it's a short trip to the beach with the turtles. In fact, 
evening turtle tours can be arranged at many Tamarindo hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearby Playa Grande beach in Las Baulas Marine Turtle National Park is a 
key Pacific Coast nesting area for the giant leatherback turtle. The nesting 
period is October to April. Up to 70 of these giants (they can weigh up to more 
than 2,000 pounds) lug themselves up onto the beach over the course of a night 
to deposit their eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Rica protects a larger proportion of its land than any other country. 
This means protection for a diversity of creatures, ranging from the shy but 
powerful jaguar to 51 species of hummingbirds, from the mysterious manatee to 
vampire bats or howler monkeys.  
</P>

 Another popular stop for group and do-it-yourself ecotourists is Monteverde 
(the name means Green Mountain). The area was settled by 40 American Quakers in 
1951 and has developed into the 25,935 acres Monteverde Biological Cloud Forest 
Preserve, home to more than 100 species of birds and over 1,200 species of 
amphibians and reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are 30 lodges in the area, it is also possible for backpackers 
to arrange dormitory-style lodging at the visitor center for $5 per night ($15 
with meals). Reservations are advised.

GEARS & GADGETS: CUSHIONING A PAIN IN THE NECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDI DASH

<TEXT>
<P>
 A cramp in the neck, a pain in the back -- hey, it's all part of the joy of 
travel. Spending long spells in odd positions, or just trying to get a little 
sleep while sitting in an airplane seat can beget a host of strains and other 
discomforts. For years, I've carried around an inflatable plastic pillow, just 
for a little support on the road or in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, I've discovered several other innovative products aimed at 
cushioning the way on the go. Prices do not include any shipping and handling: 
</P>
<P>
 The Hedbed is an inflatable neck rest with a difference. Unlike the 
traditional collar-style inflatables that wrap behind the head, forcing it 
forward, this one is a small crescent that tucks under the chin and curves 
slightly around the neck, so you can switch it from one side to the other as 
needed. In addition, this neck rest has a removable cover of soft washable 
poplin -- a great asset after repeated use. The pillow folds down to a 
diminutive 4 inches by 5 inches by one-half inch, and weighs just 2 1/2 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 I found the Hedbed both comfortable and efficient -- though some travelers may 
still prefer the better-known collar style, which does not have to be 
rearranged as you shift your head. The washable cover is an especially sanitary 
selling point. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hedbed, in navy, maroon or gray is about $10 in stores. For a location 
near you, contact Talus, the distributor, in Portland, Me . ; telephone (800) 
634-8180 . 
</P>
<P>
 For those who want something softer and more malleable than an inflatable and 
don't mind sacrificing more room in their baggage, a neck rest called Bucky is 
a comfortable alternative. A collar-shaped pillow loosely filled with tiny 
lightweight buckwheat hulls (hence the name) is covered by a fleecelike fabric 
cover that zips off for washing. The pillow comes in a zippered plastic bag, 
which keeps it clean and dust-free when not in use. Bucky hogs about 12 inches 
by 11 inches by 2 inches of luggage space -- about the same amount as a pair of 
sneakers, but at 14 ounces, is no heavyweight. 
</P>
<P>
 This pillow would be my choice on a car trip, when space isn't an issue. The 
fabric is deliciously soft and in testing the neck rest, it molded nicely to 
whatever position I happened to be in. I was a little disconcerted by the 
crackly sound of the little buckwheat pieces moving around inside the pillow, 
but once my head was still, so were they. 
</P>
<P>
 Bucky Travel Pillow in navy (item No . IF384N) or dark teal (No . IF384G) is 
$23.50 from Magellan's; tel.(800) 962-4943.  
</P>
<P>
 But enough about necks -- your back needs support, too. Le Pump is an 
inflatable backrest that fills the gap between the small of the back and the 
seat with an adjustable cushion of air. The pillow inflates via an attached 
rubber hand pump and deflates with the pressing of a valve. Le Pump measures 
about 13 inches by 7 inches by 2 inches when inflated, but deflates and folds 
to 6 inches by 5 1/2 inches by 2 inches and weighs about four ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 While not as effective as a genuine lumbar cushion, Le Pump performs better 
than a standard pillow and packs small when deflated. The fabric is quite 
rough, especially at the  
</P>
<P>
 I found the hand pump a bit cumbersome at first, but it worked fine once I got 
the hang of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Le Pump, in black (No. 53620M), is $24.95 from Hammacher Schlemmer; tel. (800) 
543-3366.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, it's not your back, but your backside that needs cushioning. 
Cascade Designs, makers of the well-respected Therma-a-Rest self-inflating 
camping mattresses, now has a mattress just for sitting. The SportSeat 
self-inflates via a twist-on valve to 12 inches by 16 inches by 1 1/2 inches, 
then deflates and rolls tight to about 12 inches by 2 1/2 inches thick. It 
weighs just eight ounces. I use the pad at sports stadiums, on camp-outs, at 
the beach, and as cushioning on canoe trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Therm-a-Rest SportSeat is $15 from Campmor, a sporting goods store: (800) 
226-7667, or contact Cascade Designs, the manufacturer, for a store near you: 
tel. (800) 531-9531.  
</P>
<P>
 Space is always at a premium for backpackers, who often just roll up a pile of 
clothes for a pillow. Now there's a compact alternative, which is also a fine 
pillow for airplane and car travel. Cascade Designs, makers of the SportSeat, 
above, has developed a very soft 15-inch by 11-inch by 4-inch pillow filled 
with an equally soft polyester stuffing. When tightly rolled and folded into 
its built-in pouch, which is secured with a nylon drawstring with a cord lock, 
the Therm-a-Rest Deluxe Pillow takes up no more space than a water bottle, and 
it can be tied to the outside of a backpack or stuffed inside a rolled sleeping 
bag. An inner nylon lining forms a bottom pocket that can be stuffed with 
clothes or a SportSeat for more pillow height. 
</P>
<P>
 The fabric is truly comfortable, and I no longer wake up in the middle of the 
night with a pile of flattened and dispersed clothes under my head. 
</P>
<P>
 Deluxe Travel Pillow is $16 in the plum color or the fish pattern (No. 9204 ) 
, from TravelSmith, (800) 950-1600. Or, for a store near you, contact Cascade 
Designs at (800) 531-9531.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: REMEMBER THE DISCOUNTS IN ALAMO COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Antonio has its Texas share of history and tourist attractions that offer 
senior discounts. But the city's focal point is the Alamo, where in 1836 an 
estimated 183 outnumbered American defenders fell to Mexico's Gen. Antonio 
Lopez de Santa Anna. A history museum, chapel and library, all open to the 
public at no charge, contain relics and mementos of the Alamo. 
</P>
<P>
 With its flat terrain, the city is perfect for walking. In the heart of San 
Antonio's business district is the "Paseo del Rio," or River Walk, a waterway 
bordered by cobblestone pathways and benches on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Some sections are parklike and others have European-style sidewalk cafes, 
nightclubs, high-rise hotels and specialty boutiques. Entertainment at an 
outdoor amphitheater, where the audience sits on one side of the waterway and 
the stage is on the opposite side, is free. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio also has three Franciscan missions open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the major attractions offering discounts for seniors: 
</P>
<P>
 * Fiesta Texas, a family theme park celebrating the different heritages and 
eras of Texas -- Mexican, German, 1920s Southwest and 1950s rock 'n' roll. More 
than 400 entertainers appear in ongoing productions or perform in small groups 
throughout the park. Senior (over 55) one-day admission is $17.95, a 30% 
discount. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sea World of Texas has more than 25 shows and dozens of exhibits with 
sharks, sea lions, seals and penguins. Senior (over 55) one-day admission is 
$20.35, a 15% discount. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of San Antonio's unique hotels are among those that offer senior 
discounts: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Fairmount Hotel has only 37 guest rooms and suites and is situated less 
than a five-minute walk from central San Antonio, the Alamo, El Mercado Mexican 
shopping center, River Walk and the city's convention center. It is listed in 
the Guiness Book of World Records as the largest building ever moved when it 
was relocated from a site six blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 The regular rate of $185 for two is reduced to $145 for guests over 55. For 
more information, call (800) 642-3363. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Menger Hotel had its grand opening in 1859 and is a National Historic 
Landmark. A large section of the original lobby has been preserved in its 
original decor and a 19th-Century wing has Victorian-style guest rooms 
available by special request. 
</P>
<P>
 Famous guests have included Presidents Eisenhower, (Teddy) Roosevelt and 
Grant. Others included Robert E. Lee, Sarah Bernhardt, Lilly Langtry and Mae 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 The regular room rates, which range up to $142 for two, are reduced for guests 
over 55 to $80 per room. For information, call (800) 345-9285. 
</P>
<P>
 * The St. Anthony Hotel located near the city's center has also been 
designated a National Historic Landmark. Its grand lobby is reminiscent of the 
historic old hotels of Europe, but the St. Anthony is modern in every respect. 
</P>
<P>
 It offers a senior discount of $85 per room, about 40% off the published rate, 
valid indefinitely for seniors over 50. Call (800) 338-1338 for reservations or 
the hotel at (210) 227-4392. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Antonio Convention & Visitors Bureau has published a bulletin with 
discount coupons for hotels, car rentals and dozens of attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 For a free information packet on the San Antonio area including the discount 
coupon publication, call (800) 447-3372.

CRUISE VIEWS: CARNIVAL'S FASCINATION WITH HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch travel as guests of the 
cruise lines. Cruise Views appears the first and third week of every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether this gigantic 2,600-passenger vessel with its glass elevators and 
multihued lounges that change color with computer-controlled neon tubing 
strikes you as glamorous or glitzy depends on your taste, but it's certainly 
not boring. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth in the series of six mega-liners designed by Joe Farcus, Carnival's 
seagoing answer to Frank Gehry, the new Fascination has a Hollywood "central 
idea" (Farcus dislikes the word theme) that branches out all over the place, 
from lounges named for movie titles ("Diamonds Are Forever Disco") to drinking 
establishments that could, but don't, exist in real life (the posh Beverly 
Hills Bar with its own BHB monogrammed carpeting in navy and gold). 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most controversial elements on board are the 20 movie-star 
mannequins at various public venues. By controversial, we mean they are not 
easily recognizable. Passengers ask, "Is that supposed to be Lucille Ball?" and 
"Do you think that's Robert Redford?" "No way!" 
</P>
<P>
 Provided with a list of the stars, we made our way around the ship, spotting 
most but failing to locate Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn until noting an 
otherwise unidentifiable couple in the Beverly Hills Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's nit-picking. The passengers on our five-day pre-inaugural cruise 
from New York to eastern Canada at the end of July loved them all, posing for 
pictures by every one almost every hour of the day or night. "Stand behind 
Bogie and put your arms around him, honey," we heard one husband, camera in 
hand, say. 
</P>
<P>
 What does work 100% on this ship is the entertainment, from flawlessly 
professional full-scale productions with laser lighting, superb sound, 
sensational costumes and a talented company of 18 singers and dancers, to 
sophisticated late-night adult-only cabaret shows.  
</P>
<P>
 Cabins are basic but comfortable, if you don't plan to snuggle in and read. 
(And with only 100 or so books in the Tara Library for 2,600 passengers, that's 
not likely.) This is a "get up and get out and have fun" ship; even the cabin 
TV runs the same feature film over and over during a 24-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
 You can ask your steward to push the twin beds together if you want a double 
bed, but you'll have to settle for a bathroom with shower only unless you book 
a suite. Take along your own shampoo and shower cap; unlike most cruise lines, 
the only bath amenities Carnival provides is a slender bar of soap. 
</P>
<P>
 The food is much improved in recent years on Carnival ships, with both 
vegetarian and low-calorie, low-fat spa dishes on every menu. A showy flambe 
dessert parade takes place every night after dinner. Passengers are assigned to 
early or late seating in one of the two dining rooms, both of which are 
nonsmoking; most tables seat six to 10 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coconut Grove cafeteria is more glamorous than the self-service meal areas 
on the earlier ships. The casino is more early James Bond than late Las Vegas, 
with a subdued light level and gilded Art Deco figureheads around the walls. 
Players will find 14 blackjack tables, three Caribbean stud poker tables, two 
craps tables, three roulette wheels and countless slot machines and MegaCash 
slots. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two pools, the sheltered midship deck pool with its corkscrew 
plastic slide and nearby stage for steel drum music and deck games, and a 
quieter open pool on the aft deck with plenty of sunbathing area around it. 
</P>
<P>
 Details we loved: the Al Hirschfeld show business drawings on top of the 
cocktail tables in the Stars Bar; the glittering mirror-tile piano and dozens 
of little replica piano-shaped tables in the 88 Piano Bar; the top-hat motif in 
the Puttin' on the Ritz club, where Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn are 
standing by the entrance; the excellent modern art on board, much of it by 
London sculptor Susanna Holt; the bright and cheery children's playroom; the 
reasonable wine prices, and the springy rubberized jogging track. Details we 
could do without: the canned rock music all around the ship, even in the 
library; an unappealing breakfast buffet with bulk-scrambled eggs, underdone 
bacon and pale white toast (they should check out the bountiful breakfasts on 
sister company Holland America's ships), and the constant din from dinging slot 
machines that seeps into the six-deck open atrium. The Fascination makes 
year-round seven-day cruises from its home port of San Juan every Saturday 
(beginning Oct. 1, 1994). Ports of call include St. Thomas, Guadeloupe, Grenada 
and Aruba, and fares range from $1,349 to $2,429 per person, double occupancy, 
including round-trip air fare from most major North American gateways. A few 
cities require an additional $100 add-on. 
</P>
<P>
 In the port of Los Angeles, Carnival's 1,452-passenger Holiday will join its 
sister ship Jubilee beginning June 5, 1995, for three-day cruises to Ensenada 
and four-day sailings to Ensenada and Catalina Island. Fares with advance 
purchase discounts begin at $299 per person, double occupancy.

2 SIDES OF PERE BISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article on L'Auberge du Pere Bise prompted me to write ("Lakeside 
Romances," July 31). 
</P>
<P>
 My girlfriend and I stayed at the hotel about six years ago (and from the 
moment we arrived, the usual routines gave way to the unusual). A young man met 
us as we drove in the gates, looked up our names on a list and showed us to our 
lake-view room. But when we inquired about registering, we found that we did 
not have to do that until we went to dinner! We drove in and out of the hotel 
at least twice that first day before we formally registered. It felt good to be 
trusted. The maitre d'hotel knew our names when we walked into the restaurant 
where we had a superb meal then and on all other occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 We spent our stay either lounging on the wonderful deck or driving in the 
mountains. We had some memorable picnics by clear streams in the daytime and in 
the evening, the town of Annecy provided good entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Mention was made in your article of the Villa des Roses, an annex of the Pere 
Bise. We went there for cocktails and it turned out to be a treat. The 
bartender persuaded us to try pink Champagne with fresh crushed strawberries in 
the glass. How could we resist? Wonderful concoctions but beware, the romantic 
setting of the villa and the hotel makes one forget how much they cost! 
</P>

 Like Colman Andrews, I, too, dream of an idyllic stay at Pere Bise. Was I 
disappointed! In April, 1994, my $200 annex room, facing the lake and a noisy 
public walkway, had a tacky built-in platform that held the TV, and a pinon 
love seat that was a duplicate of one I'd bought on a sour impulse. The 
six-course $90 dinner (another $10 for a glass of house wine) was tasty but 
unbalanced, devoid of any vegetable, fruit or starch. I'd reserved for two 
nights, but left early for the Relais L'Abbaye down the street. I found it 
superior to the Bise in character, price ($135), salads, service and sweetness: 
At breakfast I was gifted with a spray of lily of the valley. Just as charming 
was Les Pres du Lac with balcony and view ($120). No way would I ever return to 
Pere Bise, though I loved Talloires.

<P>
 Andrews' article brought back fond memories of our April, 1990, visit. 
However, he failed to mention that the "main building, which houses the 
restaurant and kitchen," is called "Le Cottage." It is less expensive than 
L'Auberge du Pere Bise, has the same marvelous view of Lake Annecy and is ably 
run by Fernand and Celine Bise. Also, it has a four-star rating!

 Andrews replies: The main house at Le Pere Bise is not called Le Cottage. Le 
Cottage is a separate establishment next door, run by another branch of the 
Bise family.

MY BEST SHOT, TOO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Your "My Best Shot" of the entrance to Fowey harbor in Cornwall (Aug. 7) was 
deja vu all over again! Several weeks ago I took exactly the same shot. 
Incidentally, the town of Fowey (pronounced Foy) boasts a couple of illustrious 
literary former residents: Daphne du Maurier and Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch 
(remembered fondly by Helene Hanff in "Q's Legacy").

 Thanks for the memories.

FIDDLE FACTS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article on Prince Edward Island ("Green Gables and Lobster Dinners," Aug. 
14) presented a wealth of information. However, I was disappointed to see no 
mention of the several large fiddle festivals that take place there each 
summer.The two largest are the Rollo Bay Fiddle Festival in Northeast Kings 
County and the Atlantic Jamboree in Southern Prince County. The Rollo Bay 
festival is largely a Scottish event, including artists from Cape Breton, and 
the Jamboree is mostly an Acadian event, including artists from New Brunswick. 
Each draws several thousand enthusiasts on an island of less than 150,000. A 
number of smaller festivals and local events provide many opportunities for 
visitors to enjoy the energetic music of traditional cultures.

<P>
 Regarding "Heat Wave Hotel" (Weekend Escape, Aug. 21): Barnum (or was it 
Bailey?) said, "There is one born every minute" and Shawn Hubler's weekend 
escape to Shutters Hotel in Santa Monica proves it. Did they pick up the 
two-night tab of $896.60 or did The Times? Just how many of your readers have 
that kind of disposable income? Get real!

 * * * Shawn Colvin, "Cover Girl," Columbia. On her first album of solely 
outside material, Colvin tends to make bittersweet ballads (Tom Waits' "The 
Heart of Saturday Night" and David Byrne's "Naive Melody") sweet, and sweet 
numbers (Sting's "Every Little Thing (He) Does Is Magic") sweeter.If a sense of 
revelation is your standard of successful song interpretation, this might not 
cut it. But sometimes, as here, dulcet is just dandy enough.

 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four (excellent).

RECORD RACK: II BAD BOYZ AREN'T MORE INNOVATIVE

 It's no secret that songwriting has taken a back seat in contemporary R&B, 
resulting in adept harmonizing wasted on cliched, banal material. A good 
example is this Philadelphia quartet's third album.The production credits read 
like a who's who of R&B songwriters/ producers -- Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis, 
Dallas Austin, Babyface and L.A. Reid. But the album consists of limp ballads 
with unchallenging lyrics, which the Boyz sing effusively. 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent attempt to duplicate the mondo-success of "End of the Road," 
producer/writer Babyface came up with an equally uninspired song and presto -- 
another No. 1 single. The hit, "I'll Make Love to You," includes such 
by-the-book lyrics as: I'll make love to you / Like you want me to / And I'll 
hold you tight / Baby all through the night.  
</P>
<P>
 Boyz II Men might be tempted to work with more innovative writers if sales 
didn't indicate the fans' desire to live vicariously through the dull 
romanticism of songs such as these. Only "I Sit Away," an unpredictable track 
about loneliness, and the near-folky "Water Runs Dry" hint at what the Boyz 
might be if they worked with more inventive material.

 "Born Dead"

 * * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what everybody wants to know about the second album by rapper Ice-T's 
metal group Body Count: Does it include anything as daring as the notorious 
"Cop Killer," the song on its 1992 debut album that stirred up controversy and 
led to Ice-T's breakup with Warner Bros. Records? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is no. 
</P>
<P>
 A cop-out? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sort of. The L.A. group, which merges speed-metal music and gangsta rap 
themes, has no obligation to be outrageous. But since people now routinely 
associate it with controversy, they feel that it's gone soft when it doesn't 
offer anything shocking or trespass in dangerous territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Ice-T wrote most of the lyrics -- rages about war, racism, drive-bys 
and drugs -- the album is tame by gangsta-rap standards. And nothing on it 
really jolts like some of the material on the first album. 
</P>
<P>
 Stronger vocals would have helped. Ice-T's delivery, somewhere between surly 
rapping and lightweight rock singing, is uneven -- effective in places and 
unconvincing in others. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Born Dead" is basically an interesting album, and it's refreshing to hear 
the often-frivolous metal genre infused with a social conscience, some stark 
reality and a heavy dose of soul. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four (excellent).

HOME, HOME IN THE SADDLE: HE ISN'T HORSING AROUND; RODEOS: DAN DAILEY HAS WON 
ALL-AROUND COWBOY CHAMPIONSHIP 16 TIMES, SADDLE-BRONC TITLE 9 TIMES. LOOKS LIKE 
ANOTHER WINNING YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the end of a bad day in the saddle, rodeo star Dan Dailey says, "What 
really keeps you going is winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Although finishing no better than sixth that recent hot summer afternoon in 
Northhampton, Mass., Dailey had little time to worry. He jumped into his truck 
and began a 14-hour trek to Wilmington, Ohio, for another in a long season of 
rodeos. 
</P>
<P>
 Most days the 43-year-old Dailey finishes in the money. He has been the 
International Pro Rodeo Assn.'s World Champion All-Around Cowboy 16 times and 
won the IPRA's world saddle bronc title nine times. He's well on his way to 
repeating both titles this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dailey has already outlasted the average rodeo cowboy, who retires before 
reaching his 40th birthday. "I don't feel any different than when I was 25," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 About his continued success in this physically challenging sport, Dailey says, 
"I feel blessed. I give all the credit to the Lord." A deeply religious man, he 
prays before each event. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Dailey's years in the saddle haven't gone without injury. "I've 
broken both my legs," he says. "In 1977, I broke my left leg bull riding. It 
took three screws and a plate to put it back together. Over the years, I've had 
cracked ribs, I cracked a vertebra and broke my wrist." 
</P>
<P>
 Dailey used to compete in all six rodeo events: bareback riding, saddle-bronc 
riding, steer wrestling, team roping, calf roping and bull riding. But he quit 
bull riding in 1989 and bareback riding in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's a consistent performer in the other events, especially saddle-bronc 
riding. He's the current world champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Dailey, who calls Edmond, Okla., home, travels 125,000 miles a year from rodeo 
to rodeo, often performing in a different state each day. 
</P>
<P>
 He made $86,000 in prize money in 1993, along with about $40,000 in 
endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think they don't make enough rodeos for me to get to," he says.

BRUINS, PUSHED INVOLUNTARILY, HOLD ON; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: AFTER LEADING BY 18-0, 
UCLA SURVIVES FOR A 25-23 VICTORY OVER TENNESSEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was like sand piling on, a little at the time, and by the fourth quarter, 
Daron Washington felt as though he was under a mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he scored a 30-yard touchdown with 1:34 to play to give UCLA a 25-23 
victory over Tennessee in Saturday's season-opening game at the Rose Bowl. 
"Man, it was like a 100-pound sack was lifted off my shoulder," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA had rolled up an 18-0 lead, only to fritter it away when the Volunteers 
rallied for two fourth-quarter touchdowns and two-point conversions. Tennessee 
had momentum and the ball in the closing minutes, but Bruin linebacker Donnie 
Edwards stole both, cutting off a Todd Helton pass to Aaron Hayden, 
intercepting at the Volunteers' 32 with 1:55 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Sharmon Shah was caught for a three-yard loss. Washington gained five 
yards and Tennessee called its final timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 The play was a simple off-tackle run, the sort that seldom produces a 
surprise. "I really wasn't expecting it to get all that much," Washington said. 
"Then I got blocks by my left guard (James Christensen) and big Jonathan Ogden, 
and there it was." 
</P>
<P>
 The hole opened all the way to the goal line and a 25-16 lead. "I really 
hadn't done anything to that point," Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
 He had carried three times for 17 yards and watched Shah, the starting 
tailback, carry 21 times for 133 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington had caught four passes for 20 yards but had dropped two in the open 
field. The touchdown "was a big relief," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was third and seven or third and eight, and we were already trying to 
decide whether to punt or try a long field goal," UCLA Coach Terry Donahue 
said. "That's a decision we really didn't want to make." 
</P>
<P>
 The game's first decision was an easier one. The Bruins drove 90 yards, 
scoring on a Wayne Cook-to-Kevin Jordan touchdown pass on their first 
possession. En route, Cook completed four passes, two of them to J.J. Stokes 
for 16 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Volunteers adjusted to Stokes, Cook faked a handoff, faded back and 
found Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The safety (Raymond Austin) had really bit on the play action," Jordan said. 
"I just got behind him (and cornerback DeRon Jenkins) and Wayne threw a great 
pass." 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of six passes Jordan caught, for 152 yards. Stokes also caught six, 
for 84 yards, but he was held out of the end zone and suffered a bruised thigh 
muscle early in the game. He played sparingly in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a 6-0 lead -- Bjorn Merten missed the extra-point attempt -- the 
Bruins unveiled a no-huddle offense, with Cook playing back in a shotgun 
formation and alternately handing to Shah or throwing. Cook completed 25 of 38 
passes for 295 yards, finding nine receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 There were field goals of 24, 45, 40 and 23 yards by Merten, a personal-best 
four for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were getting frustrated about not getting the ball in the end zone," Cook 
said. "They run a lot of zone defenses down on the goal line, and one time I 
made a bad read, throwing the ball over J.J.'s head." 
</P>
<P>
 The play, in the second quarter, came when Stokes had beaten Ronald Davis to 
the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-0 lead seemed comfortable enough, particularly when Tennessee's offense 
sputtered after losing its quarterback, Jerry Colquitt, on the game's first 
possession. A series of successors, beginning with backup Todd Helton, then 
stretching to freshmen Peyton Manning and Branndon Stewart, was tried and found 
wanting. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Helton came back in, and the Volunteers found an offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first three quarters, we left our defense on the field way too much 
and we gave up big plays," Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer said. "I don't think 
they punted in the first half (actually, Darren Schager punted once, out of 
bounds on the Tennessee five), but we did hold them to field goals. Still, we 
just kept shooting ourselves in the foot." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton completed three passes for 45 yards on a 76-yard, seven-play drive. 
Chief among the seven plays was one in which Nilo Silvan took the ball on a 
flanker reverse, headed left, then cut back across the field, going 28 yards to 
the UCLA one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our defense was getting tired by that point," Edwards said. "You 
could see it by the way we were missing tackles." 
</P>
<P>
 Helton's pass to Billy Williams for a two-point conversion cut UCLA's lead to 
18-8 and kept some of the 55,169 on hand from heading for the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 With the idea of taking as much time as possible, the Bruins abandoned the 
no-huddle offense for something a little slower, and three plays later punted. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight plays later, their lead was cut to 18-16, Helton having gone to Cortney 
Epps on a 10-yard touchdown pass that was successful because Teddy Lawrence 
wasn't. Lawrence, UCLA's left cornerback on the play, flashed in front of the 
ball with an interception and 90-yard touchdown in mind. His timing was off, 
leaving Epps open. Helton passed to Joey Kent for another two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook went to Jordan for 15 yards on a second-and-10 play and handed to Shah 
for a 14-yard gain after spreading the Tennessee defense. Schager then punted 
out of bounds on the Tennessee one with 3:14 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton got the Volunteers out of immediate trouble, but the pass interception 
by Edwards ended Tennessee's hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 James Stewart's touchdown from the one with 10 seconds to play was little 
salve for the Volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be proud of what we accomplished," Fulmer said. "We fought back in 
the fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 And UCLA woke up in the fourth. "We felt we had control of the game, but it 
was only 18-0," Donahue said. "We kicked too many field goals. Those threes 
aren't enough, we want sevens." 
</P>
<P>
 They got one, in the nick of time.

USC DOES A TAILBACK U-TURN; FOOTBALL: WALTERS AND WASHINGTON COMBINE FOR 200 
YARDS IN 24-17 VICTORY OVER THE HUSKIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The run is back. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's long-dormant running game was sparked into life Saturday when sophomore 
Shawn Walters and freshman Delon Washington combined for 200 yards as the 
Trojans defeated the Washington Huskies, 24-17. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum crowd of 54,538 came expecting to see USC quarterback Rob Johnson 
launch his quest for the Heisman Trophy. But the Trojan aerial attack faltered, 
accounting for a mere 129 yards, as Johnson was sacked six times. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it was the running of Walters, who gained 91 yards, and especially 
Washington, who picked up 100 of his 109 yards in the second half, that had the 
crowd buzzing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies, not surprisingly, had a fairly decent running back of their own, 
but while Napoleon Kaufman's efforts were impressive, they were not decisive. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-9, 185-pounder had a total of 244 yards. He gained 152 of them in 
26 runs; he caught three passes for 34 yards and added 58 more yards on two 
kick returns. But he made no game-breaking plays, his longest run being 21 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great back, and he did a great job today," USC Coach John Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Walters and Delon Washington who had Robinson more excited. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters, the 225-pound Texan who led the Trojans in rushing a year ago, had a 
powerful seven-yard touchdown run in the third quarter when he carried three 
Huskies into the end zone. Walters is a makeover project, a physical back who 
came to USC trying to outrun defenders, instead of running through them. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1:10 left in the third quarter, Walters crashed up the middle and slammed 
into three Washington defenders, carrying all three over the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 It was probably Walters' best game for USC, and yet Washington -- who began 
summer training camp listed as the No. 7 tailback -- played well enough to 
cause some to wonder if he might actually challenge Walters later in the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 His 10 carries included one for 34 yards. He showed great acceleration, 
causing Robinson to say: "Yes, the run is back -- at least for the next few 
days." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson blamed Johnson's relatively unimpressive numbers on injuries to key 
receivers and a defense geared to stop the short-passing game. 
</P>
<P>
 USC wide receivers Ed Hervey and Keyshawn Johnson sat out or were slowed for 
most of the week's practice sessions and Johnson said later the pass offense 
was out of sync. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who passed for 3,630 yards last season, had only 129 Saturday, 
completing 18 of 23 attempts. He was intercepted once. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the Trojans' winning touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter, it was 
Johnson who made the big play -- a 13-yard scramble up the USC sideline. With 
the score 17-17, USC needed to convert a third-and-six play at the Washington 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson called a pass play that deteriorated almost immediately, so he started 
running. He reached the nine, where he dived over the sideline. Johnson rose 
and spiked the ball, as if he had scored. 
</P>
<P>
 The touchdown came soon enough. Walters carried on three consecutive power 
plays, scoring standing up from the three with 3:36 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Kicker Cole Ford gave USC the 24-17 lead and the Trojan defense stopped 
Washington's last drive at midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Trojan cornerback John Herpin had two interceptions. The second, with 
10:50 to play, was a game-turning play. It launched the USC drive that produced 
the final touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 And sophomore defensive end Willie Lowery was a force, particularly on 
Washington's last drive, when he tackled Husky quarterback Damon Huard twice, 
once on a sack. 
</P>
<P>
 USC trailed early, 7-0, when Huard connected with a 1993 quarterback, Eric 
Bjornson, now a split end, on consecutive first-quarter plays of 34 and 52 
yards. That's 86 yards in 17 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 USC tied the score when Johnson completed a six-yard pass to tight end Johnny 
McWilliams, and Ford gave the Trojans a 10-7 lead with a 32-yard field goal 
early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington got the halftime lead, 14-10, on the game's longest drive, a 
seven-minute, 15-play, 75-yard march. Kaufman got the touchdown with a one-yard 
plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wales' 29-yard field goal early in the third made the score 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
 USC tied the score on Walters' seven-yard burst, then scored again after 
Johnson's big scramble play two drives later. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington outgained USC, 361-294, but Robinson did not seem too concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went through some serious lows today, almost got ourselves beat, but once 
we established that we could run the ball then we got control of the game," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Of Delon Washington, Robinson said: "For a while there, he looked like 'The 
Natural.' He did a wonderful job." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Johnson: "Rob was looking for patterns that just weren't there. The 
receivers were going sandlot on us, making up patterns as they went along. It 
was a tough day, because Washington was really geared to Rob. He made the big 
plays, though, that won (the game) for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "On that scramble, it took him two minutes (to gain 13 yards), but he did a 
great job. Good quarterbacks win when things aren't going so good." 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the game, the quarterback said, USC was stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our offensive line had them worn down and Shawn was pounding on them," 
Johnson said. "Then we brought in Delon, and he's fast and quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Huard, the Husky quarterback, agreed. Sort of. He was 12 for 25 for 197 yards 
but was intercepted three times.

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS RIVALRY LOSES NOTHING WITH DISTANCE

<P>
 One more day until the start of the Raider season. One more day until 
Raiders-49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 This has never been a normal rivalry, because of the teams' proximity when 
they shared the Bay Area. It wasn't then, and it isn't now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to just be on the sidelines and then run out and hit some 49er," 
former Raider linebacker Phil Villapiano, now a marine-shipping salesman in New 
Jersey, told the San Jose Mercury News. "I hate the 49ers, the players and 
their fans. Their fans stunk." 
</P>
<P>
 Countered linebacker Ken Norton, who will be making his San Francisco debut: 
"Now, I know what you've been told about the Raiders, and most of it is true. 
They're not the cleanest group, and they've got some guys who cut block, chop 
block, leg whip, push you after the play and hit you in the back. And you know 
something? I can't wait to see them." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Norton: The opposition was obviously on his mind during a "Life as a 49er" 
first-person story for the Mercury News. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be honest: I think so much of that Dallas game I've circled Nov. 13 on 
my calendar," the UCLA product said of facing the Cowboys, his former team, for 
the first time. "I understand that there are key games before that, but if we 
take care of business by the time we get to the Dallas game, that'll be one of 
the biggest games out there. And one other thing: I don't really care what 
Jimmy Johnson says anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What is significant about Nov. 20, 1965, in Laker history? 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous wishes: A brochure for the Northeast Louisiana football team 
proclaims: "The Big Time is Here!" Yeah, too often. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians, a powerhouse in NCAA Division I-AA for nearly a decade, move into 
I-A with a schedule rated as the toughest in the nation by the Sporting News, 
starting with a 48-13 loss to No. 8 Colorado on Saturday, Auburn next Saturday 
and then Georgia. After the three top-25 opponents, they will play Wyoming, 
Brigham Young and Kentucky, all of which went to bowl games last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since I got here," linebacker Damon Poage said, "we felt like we could 
play with the big guys. Now, we've got a chance to prove it." 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't innocence wonderful? 
</P>
<P>
 "Our players are excited," Northeast Louisiana Coach Ed Zaunbrecher said, "but 
I'm not sure if they know what they're getting into." 
</P>
<P>
 Never healthy Pervis: The Boston Celtics last month signed Pervis Ellison, who 
has had chronic knee problems, to a six-year contract reportedly worth more 
than $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Celtics say he is a long way from 100% healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he isn't (ready by early November), that's OK," Executive Vice President 
M.L. Carr told the Boston Globe. "I purposely told (trainer) Ed Lacerte I'm not 
looking for a sprint. I want Pervis to finish the marathon. If that means a 
December start, then we'll live with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: It is the last time Chick Hearn missed a game. His streak is at 
2,692 consecutive regular-season and playoff broadcasts.

DAVENPORT WEIGHING OPTIONS AFTER BEING RUN OFF THE COURT; TENNIS: ENDO'S 
STRAIGHT-SET VICTORY LEAVES SIXTH-SEEDED PLAYER FRUSTRATED AND GROPING FOR WAYS 
TO GET FASTER AND REACH NEXT LEVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lindsay Davenport, her tennis career moving much faster than her feet, 
stumbled in the third round of the U.S. Open on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-year-old Murrieta standout whose world ranking has improved since 
January from No. 20 to No. 7, sending her into the Open with the highest 
seeding of any American woman at No. 6, was beaten by the element of speed. Her 
opponent had it and she didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Ousting Davenport was 23-year-old Mana Endo of Japan, who scurried all over 
the court for a 6-3, 7-6 (7-1) victory that allowed her to advance for the 
first time to the round of 16 in a Grand Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
 Endo ran down everything the hard-hitting Davenport sent at her and closed out 
the match in the tiebreaker -- after serving for it and failing at 5-4 of the 
second set -- by sprinting after a drop shot for 2-0 and cracking a forehand 
past Davenport at the net for 6-1. On match point, a sagging Davenport hit a 
forehand long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel really physically tired," Davenport said. "I just didn't really 
move well, and it was a little hard to catch my breath. She was taking every 
shot I took and coming back with one better. That's tough to play against." 
</P>
<P>
 The central issues of this match were size, speed and endurance. Endo's size, 
5 feet 3 and 119 pounds, went against Davenport's 6-2 and 165 and proved 
quickly that bigger isn't always better; in this case, not always faster, 
either. David and Goliath imagery was not too extreme a stretch for this match. 
</P>
<P>
 The endurance issue is an entirely different thing, and that aspect of 
Davenport's performances has been dealt with delicately this week. Because 
Davenport is only 18, and because she is so liked and likable, other players 
tiptoe around it in conversation and interviews. And the press, when posing 
questions to, or about, Davenport, carefully avoids use of the W word. 
</P>
<P>
 But the consensus is clear, the need obvious, even to Davenport, who answers 
carefully phrased questions with carefully phrased answers. To take her game to 
the next level, she needs to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the things on that topic that Davenport said Saturday were: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I really couldn't get my legs into the ball. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I think I should come into the net more, but I just don't feel, I just 
don't move around very well at the net. I don't feel like I'm nimble enough to 
go cover those volleys." 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Shriver, who was yanked all around the court earlier this week in a 6-1, 
6-2 rout by Davenport, spoke after that match from her perspective as the elder 
stateswoman here at 34, as the only player in the tournament who has played 
here in the last three decades, and as a player who admires Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is not that unfit, I mean, she obviously is a big gal and she does carry 
a little extra," Shriver said. "But that doesn't mean that somebody is not in 
pretty doggone good shape. . . . I don't think it should be written that she is 
in horrible shape, because I don't think she is. I just think she is not in the 
kind of Steffi Graf shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport will play a tournament in Japan after the U.S. Open, then return 
home for more than a month to train and work with a San Francisco doctor named 
Don Chu, whom she called both a medical doctor and a trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe he can tell me what I need to do (to get faster)," she said. "He knows 
some secrets." 
</P>
<P>
 With Martina Navratilova about to retire, and the futures of Monica Seles and 
Jennifer Capriati uncertain, Davenport's progress has generated increased 
interest. For one thing, her status as the highest-seeded American female made 
her the first player since 1974 to achieve that status other than Chris Evert, 
Mary Joe Fernandez, Tracy Austin and Navratilova. And Fernandez and Austin held 
the spot only once each. 
</P>
<P>
 Only four American women remain in the round of 16, and only Zina Garrison 
Jackson at No. 10 is seeded. The others are Gigi Fernandez, Ginger Helgeson and 
Ann Grossman. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison Jackson survived a tremendous struggle Saturday on Court 16, taking 2 
hours 25 minutes to get past unheralded Alexia Dechaume-Balleret of France, 
2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-1). In the third set, Dechaume-Balleret, No. 68 in the world, 
saved 14 break points in a match as tense and closely contested as any here so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the third set, I just stayed very tough, and she did, too," Garrison 
Jackson said. "We went to the tiebreaker and I just hit five great volleys. You 
should win a tiebreaker if you play like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Grossman will play No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the afternoon and 
Gigi Fernandez will play Helgeson at night. Monday, Garrison Jackson will play 
Graf. The likely scenario would leave American women with one quarterfinalist, 
the Fernandez-Helgeson winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Endo's victory over Davenport, the Japanese, with little 
international tennis tradition, could well double that, if No. 5 Kimiko Date 
plays to her seeding Sunday and Endo can run another opponent off the court on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the state of American women's tennis. One might call it a weighty 
problem.

GOLF ROUNDUP; ESTES HAS NEW GRIP ON PUTTER, GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Estes switched putters and changed his grip last week. Judging by his 
performance in the first three rounds of the Greater Milwaukee Open, further 
adjustments aren't necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had plenty of chances every year to win golf tournaments and just 
couldn't find the putting stroke to get over that hump," said Estes, who shot a 
six-under 65 Saturday and has a one-stroke lead over Mark Calcavecchia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, if I'd have been hitting shots as bad as I'm hitting them now, I 
would barely survive the cut. Now, it almost doesn't matter where I hit it, I'm 
putting so well." 
</P>
<P>
 Estes, winless in six seasons on the PGA Tour, had an eagle and five birdies 
for a 15-under 198 total on the Brown Deer Park Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcavecchia, who lost in a playoff with Billy Mayfair in last year's 
tournament, had two eagles and five birdies for a 64. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Britton, who had a hole in one Friday, was two back after a 65 and Mike 
Springer (65), John Inman (66), Joey Sindelar (66) and Loren Roberts were three 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 D.A. Weibring, the first- and second-round leader, was four back after a par 
71 along with Jay Don Blake (66), David Toms (67) and Jay Haas (69). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Davies shot a seven-under 65 to take a one-stroke lead after the first 
round of the LPGA State Farm Rail Classic at Springfield, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies, a three-time winner this season and the LPGA tour's money leader with 
$615,811, was disappointed that she failed to approach the 62 that she shot in 
1991 on the 6,403-yard Rail Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sixty-five is a good score, but when you've shot 62, it kind of pales," said 
Davies, who made the turn at five-under 31. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Simon Hobday had a one-stroke lead when the second round of the GTE Northwest 
Classic seniors event at Kenmore, Wash., was suspended because of darkness. 
Fourteen players were to complete their rounds this morning.

DAVIS LEADS THE WAY FOR NO. 12 AUBURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Auburn Coach Terry Bowden got what he wanted Saturday from junior tailback 
Stephen Davis, and it wasn't particularly the 158 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis emerged from the shadow of departed James Bostic with 33 carries and a 
touchdown as 12th-ranked Auburn held off Mississippi, 22-17, in a Southeastern 
Conference game, extending the longest winning streak in Division I-A to 12 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't see the big plays, but I wanted to see him carry 30 times on a hot 
day," said Bowden, still undefeated at Auburn after going 11-0 last season. "It 
was some tough running. That's good enough. We'll see a long run here or there. 
That was our workhorse." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers had to hold on as Mississippi rallied in the second half, 
penetrating the Auburn 10 twice in the fourth quarter, coming away with a 
touchdown but having a field-goal attempt blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's going to be a big win for us," Bowden said. "Our team continued to 
play hard. What I saw -- a team that wanted to win so bad. (Mississippi) got 
down there twice, we held them to a fourth and 12, they got that one great 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got down there again, we held them again." 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn quarterback Patrick Nix passed for a touchdown and ran for one in his 
first start. 
</P>
<P>
 With Bostic, Auburn's leading rusher the past two seasons, now in the NFL, 
Davis got his first opportunity to showcase the talent that made him the 
national prep player of the year as a high school senior. He ran for 480 yards 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 After rushing for 60 yards in the first half, Davis did most of the work on a 
third-quarter drive that gave Auburn a 22-10 lead. He carried eight times for 
58 yards, including a four-yard touchdown run on the 10th play. His longest 
runs of the game, 16 and 19 yards, came on the drive. Davis was the first 
Auburn back since 1989 with 30 or more carries in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi, held to four yards before halftime, opened the second half with 
an eight-play, 80-yard drive that ended when quarterback Josh Nelson dumped a 
screen pass to Mark Smith, who spun out of a tackle at the 10 and scored to 
complete an 18-yard play. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson completed 24 of 34 passes for 224 yards despite being sacked seven 
times and under constant pressure.

ATLANTIC COAST ROUNDUP; FLORIDA STATE HAS NO TROUBLE ON FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Florida State, plagued by problems during the off-season, had no problems in 
its opener Saturday against Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Kanell, following in the footsteps of Heisman Trophy winner Charlie 
Ward, passed for 330 yards and four touchdowns as the defending national 
champions crushed the Cavaliers, 41-17, at Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-ranked Seminoles played without seven suspended players, including 
All-American linebacker Derrick Brooks and three offensive linemen who were 
penalized for accepting improper gifts from agents. However, the team did just 
fine without them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offense started a little slow, but the defense came out there pretty 
pumped up," Kanell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bobby Bowden said he didn't think the team's off-the-field problems, 
which included the arrest of several players, had any impact on the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played good today because they wanted to win and because they were 
defending national champions," said Bowden, who sat on a sideline stool part of 
the game to rest his bad back. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanell, who passed for five touchdowns against Maryland last season when Ward 
was injured, was impressive again in leading the Seminoles to their 17th 
consecutive Atlantic Coast Conference victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior passed for three touchdowns in the second quarter -- 16 yards to 
Warrick Dunn, three to Billy Glenn and four to Kez McCorvey. He hit McCorvey 
with another scoring pass, a three-yarder, in the fourth period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he played well," said Ward, who watched from a coaching booth in 
the press box, where he spoke to Kanell on the phone several times during the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 18 North Carolina 27, Texas Christian 17 -- Jason Stanicek had 244 yards 
of offense in the first half to help the Tar Heels overcome four turnovers and 
a blocked field goal at Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanicek passed for 179 yards and rushed for 65 as the Tar Heels built a 
10-point halftime lead. But the Tar Heels, playing without four injured 
starters, nearly gave the game away in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanicek, who finished with 230 yards passing and 80 rushing, had two passes 
intercepted in the second half. And teammate Curtis Johnson lost a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 TCU, which has 19 starters back from a team that was 4-7 last season, also 
blocked a 34-yard field-goal attempt early in the fourth quarter to stay within 
24-17. 
</P>
<P>
 But a third-down sack by Oscar Sturgis after the block put TCU out of scoring 
range, and Stanicek engineered a six-minute scoring drive late in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 24 Clemson 27, Furman 6 -- Emory Smith, brother of Emmitt Smith of the 
Dallas Cowboys, scored two touchdowns and freshman Anthony Downs ran for 89 
yards to lead the Tigers at Clemson, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's second-half touchdowns on runs of three and two yards helped Clemson 
overcome a sloppy effort against the NCAA Division I-AA Paladins. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemson outgained Furman, 377 yards to 99, but gave up 205 yards on kickoff 
returns and committed nine penalties for 92 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first regular-season victory for Clemson Coach Tommy West, who made 
his debut in last season's Peach Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke 49, Maryland 16 -- Robert Baldwin set a Duke rushing record with 238 
yards and tied a record with four touchdowns at Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin broke the mark of 234 yards set by Randy Cuthbert in 1989 against 
Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Saturday, Baldwin's best day was 81 yards in 21 carries last year 
against North Carolina State. His four touchdowns -- on runs of three, one, 11 
and 34 yards -- tied Mike Dunn's record set against North Carolina in 1976.

SOUTHEASTERN ROUNDUP; DEAN PASSES FOR 7 TOUCHDOWNS AS FLORIDA OPENS 
IMPRESSIVELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terry Dean showed why there is no quarterback controversy at Florida, tying an 
NCAA record with seven touchdown passes in the first half Saturday night to 
lead the top-ranked Gators to a 70-21 season-opening rout of New Mexico State 
at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth-year senior, who considered transferring when he lost his job to 
Danny Wuerffel last September, passed for touchdowns on seven of Florida's 
first eight possessions. Coach Steve Spurrier called on third-stringer Eric 
Kresser to lead the last scoring drive of a 56-point half. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Jackson caught four touchdown passes and Ike Hilliard, Aubrey Hill and 
Sorola Palmer one each from Dean, who tied the NCAA record for touchdown passes 
in a half set by Dennis Shaw of San Diego State against New Mexico State in 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean, who completed 20 of 30 passes for 271 yards with no interceptions, broke 
his Southeastern Conference record of six set against Southwestern Louisiana 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a chance to be the best quarterback I ever coached," Spurrier said, 
"and he played like it tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Kresser completed a seven-yard touchdown pass to Hilliard on the only drive he 
directed in the first half. Wuerffel, who began his sophomore season as a 
backup despite passing for 2,230 yards and 22 touchdowns last season, played 
most of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 11 Alabama 42, Tennessee Chattanooga 13 -- Sherman Williams rushed for a 
career-high 153 yards and two touchdowns as the Crimson Tide piled up 343 yards 
rushing at Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crimson Tide defense, which is supposed to rival Alabama's great unit of 
two years ago, didn't live up to expectations, giving up a pair of 
second-quarter touchdowns to the Division I-AA Moccasins. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alabama reached the end zone on its first three possessions and seemed 
able to move the ball at will against the Moccasins, whose defense was the 
worst in the Southern Conference last season, giving up more than 34 points a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams started last season with five consecutive 100-yard games, including a 
148-yard performance against Arkansas. But injuries slowed him the rest of the 
season, even though he still finished as Alabama's leading rusher with 738 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia 24, South Carolina 21 -- Eric Zeier completed 31 of 51 passes for 485 
yards and three touchdowns to lead Georgia at Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Zeier's touchdown passes went to Hason Graham, who both times got 
behind cornerback Corey Bell and raced up the left sideline to the end zone. 
One play covered 77 yards, the other 63. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky 20, Louisville 14 -- Antonio O'Ferral had a 64-yard touchdown pass 
and a four-yard touchdown run to lead Kentucky at Lexington, Ky., in the first 
game between the intrastate rivals in 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Ferral, a backup last season, came in when Jeff Speedy suffered a separated 
shoulder midway through the second quarter. O'Ferral completed four of 10 
passes for 79 yards and ran for five yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky was bolstered by the running of senior fullback Damon Hood, who 
carried 13 times for a career-high 108 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas 34, Southern Methodist 14 -- Quarterback Barry Lunney Jr., named the 
starter hours before kickoff, passed for two touchdowns to J.J. Meadors and 
tailback Oscar Malone ran for 151 yards in 19 carries to lead the Razorbacks at 
Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunney's 79-yard scoring pass to Meadors midway through the fourth quarter put 
Arkansas up by 14 points. Until then, the Mustangs had remained close behind 
the play of Ramon Flanigan. On the second-down pass, Lunney faked into the line 
and calmly waited for Meadors to run by the secondary inside the SMU 45. Lunney 
completed 10 of 12 passes for 203 yards and also ran for 61 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderbilt 35, Wake Forest 14 -- Ronnie Gordon ran for two touchdowns and 
passed 36 yards for Vanderbilt's first touchdown through the air since 1992 at 
Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderbilt, the only Division I-A team not to throw a touchdown pass last 
season, broke the drought in the fourth quarter as Gordon hit Cliff Deese on a 
screen pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandy's last touchdown pass was an 88-yard completion to Clarence Sevillian in 
the final game of the 1992 season against Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi State 17, Memphis 6 -- Michael Davis rushed for 86 yards and two 
touchdowns to lead the Bulldogs at Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis scored on runs of seven and two yards and teammate Tim Rogers added a 
43-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Patterson scored the only touchdown for Memphis, going over from a yard 
out midway through the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi State had 223 yards to Memphis' 195. Memphis' leading rusher was 
reserve wide receiver Andre Woods, who gained 30 yards on two reverses.

BIG TEN ROUNDUP; PENN STATE TUNES UP FOR USC WITH 56-3 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Paterno went into Penn State's opener with questions about his defense. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though his ninth-ranked Nittany Lions shut down Minnesota's vaunted 
passing attack with a 56-3 victory Saturday night at Minneapolis, his questions 
were not answered to his satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were never any questions about Penn State's offense. Kerry Collins 
completed 19 of 23 passes for 260 yards and three touchdowns and Ki-Jana Carter 
rushed for 210 yards, with scoring runs of 80, 62 and two yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensively, Penn State held the Gophers to 130 passing yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything went our way," said Paterno, whose team plays host to No. 17 USC 
next Saturday. "We really had no adversity, so it's hard to judge if we're good 
or not. Next week might give us a better idea of where we stand and how far 
we've got to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny, Minnesota Coach Jim Wacker had no trouble making the judgment that Penn 
State already is pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did about everything as good as you can do," he said. "They turned us 
inside out and upside down. Ki-Jana Carter is as good as any back in the 
country. If there's a better one, I don't want to see him. And Collins had a 
great, great night." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins had 14 consecutive completions during one stretch, breaking by two 
Bill Smaltz's 54-year-old school record. Collins' touchdown passes went to 
Freddie Scott, Keith Olsommer and Bobby Engram. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to establish the fact that we can spread the ball around," Collins 
said after Penn State churned out 345 yards rushing and 344 passing for a 
near-record 689 total. "It is a good feeling to get into a good rhythm. 
Everything seems to slow down, defenses are easy to read and your confidence 
builds. Tonight was a good omen. I just hope it continues." 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa 52, Central Michigan 21 -- Sedrick Shaw ran 80 yards for one touchdown 
and Kent Kahl punched in for three others as the Hawkeyes ran over the 
Chippewas in a nonconference game at Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawkeyes, who averaged only 108 yards rushing last season, had 347 against 
Central Michigan and scored seven running touchdowns, two shy of the school 
record set against Cincinnati in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Central Michigan stunned Big Ten opponent Michigan State two of the past three 
years but had no chance against Iowa, which finished with 568 total yards. Iowa 
punted only once. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 28, Cincinnati 3 -- Alex Smith, the first Indiana freshman to start at 
running back since 1945, rushed for 152 yards and two touchdowns as the 
Hoosiers beat the Bearcats at Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a redshirt last season, scored on runs of one yard in the first quarter 
and 22 yards late in the third. He did not play in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Three interceptions, two in the first quarter, hurt Cincinnati.

NO. 8 COLORADO HAS 649 YARDS IN ROUT OF NORTHEAST LOUISIANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine the production Colorado will have when Michael Westbrook returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing without its talented receiver, serving a one-game suspension for a 
campus altercation, Colorado generated 649 yards -- the fifth-highest total in 
school history -- in crushing Northeast Louisiana, 48-13, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado's per-play average of 9.41 yards was a school record. 
</P>
<P>
 Rashaan Salaam ran for 184 yards and three touchdowns and Kordell Stewart also 
accounted for three touchdowns, running for two and passing for another, as the 
No. 8 Buffaloes spoiled Northeast Louisiana's jump to Division I-A. 
</P>
<P>
 "Offensively, I thought we were sharp, other than the early fumbles," Colorado 
Coach Bill McCartney said. "We were in control, and we mixed the run and pass 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, who completed 15 of 19 passes for 207 yards, said Westbrook "wasn't 
in there, but we can't lose a beat just because one guy's out." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said felt he made progress in reading pass coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a matter of me hitting the passes," he said. "If they took 
something away from me, something else was getting open."

BIG EIGHT ROUNDUP; LATE FIELD GOAL SAVES OKLAHOMA FROM UPSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Blanton kicked a 48-yard field goal with 11 seconds to play and No. 16 
Oklahoma, which blew a 24-point lead, came back to beat Syracuse, 30-29, 
Saturday night at Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma led, 24-0, and was all set to celebrate another touchdown as P.J. 
Mills neared the goal line at the end of a 70-yard pass play. But cornerback 
Bryce Bevill, beaten on the reception, ran down Mills inside the five and 
popped the ball loose. It went through the end zone for a touchback. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orangemen scored four plays later as Kevin Mason threw to Marvin Harrison 
on a 78-yard touchdown pass play with 7:02 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oklahoma's next possession, Kevin Abrams blocked Blanton's punt and 
Syracuse took over at the Sooner 13. Kirby Dar Dar scored on a four-yard run 
four plays later. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanton's 23-yard field goal with 7:47 to play extended Oklahoma's lead to 
27-14, but quarterback Garrick Mason scored on a six-yard run with 3:53 
remaining and the Orangemen were within 27-21. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than risk another blocked kick, Oklahoma took an intentional safety on 
fourth-and-15 from its 15, bringing Syracuse within 27-23 but giving Oklahoma a 
free kick and the opportunity to pin the Orangemen in their own territory. 
</P>
<P>
 That strategy backfired when Syracuse scored 60 seconds later on a 48-yard 
pass play from Mason to Harrison. Sean Reali missed the extra point wide right, 
a mistake that proved costly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sooners drove from their 36 to the Syracuse 31 in eight plays, converting 
a fourth-and-13 on McGee's 18-yard pass to Albert Hall, to set up Blanton's 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas State 34, SW Louisiana 6 -- Tyson Schwieger and Dederick Kelly scored 
first-quarter touchdowns as the Wildcats won at Manhattan, Kan., in front of 
the biggest crowd for a home opener in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 A happy, noisy gathering of 38,216 watched the Wildcats, coming off a 9-2-1 
campaign and first-ever postseason victory, seize a 17-0 lead over 
mistake-prone Southwestern Louisiana, 8-3 last year when it was the most 
improved Division I-A team in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Iowa 28, Iowa State 14 -- Brett O'Donnell passed for two touchdowns 
and set up another in his first start as the visiting Division I-AA Panthers 
repeated their 1992 upset of Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Iowa scored in the final minute of the first half for a 14-0 lead, 
then drove 80 yards at the start of the second half to go up, 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Iowa, ranked eighth in its division, beat Iowa State, 27-10, two 
years ago. That was just the Panthers' second victory over Iowa State and first 
since 1900.

POWLUS LEADS IRISH PAST NORTHWESTERN; NOTRE DAME: THE SOPHOMORE PASSES FOR 291 
YARDS AND FOUR SCORES IN 42-15 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Powlus was worth the wait. The Notre Dame sophomore threw four touchdown 
passes in his first game and the third-ranked Irish overcame a slow start to 
rout Northwestern, 42-15. 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus, who sat out last season after breaking his collarbone, had been 
bothered by a sore elbow in preseason practice. But there was nothing wrong 
with his arm or his passes Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed 18 of 24 for 291 yards and with his four touchdown passed tied a 
school record held by Steve Beuerlein, Daryle Lamonica and Angelo Bertelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus, regarded as one the nation's top prep quarterbacks at Berwick, Pa., 
hit three of his touchdown passes in the second quarter as Notre Dame took 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed 10 of 13 first-half passes for 186 yards as the Irish scored two 
touchdowns in the final 72 seconds to take a 21-3 lead before a sellout crowd 
of 66,946 at Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus hit four more passes on the opening possession of the second half, one 
a 21-yarder that Ray Zellars caught one-handed, as the Irish moved in for 
another score. Lee Becton's two-yard run capped the 65-yard drive that made it 
28-3 with 9:18 to go in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus threw a 36-yard pass to Derrick Mayes, who wrestled the ball away from 
Rodney Ray to make it 35-3 with 4:55 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern's Dennis Lundy had 116 yards in 21 carries in the first quarter 
and finished with 138 in 27 to move past the 2,000-yard mark in his career.

MICHIGAN ANSWERS, BARELY MISSES A BEAT WITHOUT WHEATLEY; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: 
FILL-INS DAVIS AND BIAKABUTUKA SCORE THREE TIMES IN 34-26 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Say this about Michigan's 34-26 victory against Boston College Saturday: The 
fifth-ranked Wolverines proved they could win even with one sling tied behind 
Tyrone Wheatley's back. 
</P>
<P>
 Life without Wheatley, a Heisman Trophy favorite sidelined because of a 
separated right shoulder, officially began with the Wolverine hero dressed in 
civvies and perched atop a Michigan Stadium sideline bench. From there he saw 
Boston College take a 12-0 lead, only to be answered by five consecutive 
Wolverine touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for upsets and early talk that Michigan was doomed without Wheatley at 
tailback. Instead, the Wolverines simply turned to quarterback Todd Collins and 
wide receiver Amani Toomer for two of the scores, and tailback replacements Ed 
Davis and "Touchdown" Tshimanga Biakabutuka (otherwise known as Tim) for the 
three others before a crowd of 105,936. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitors never knew what -- or who -- hit them. Wheatley did. Ever since 
suffering a shoulder injury Aug. 23, Wheatley had been hyping his backups. 
Davis was as dependable as a Michigan Stadium sellout, he said, and 
Biakabutuka, born in Zaire and raised in Longueuil, Canada, was the quickest 
thing to hit campus since Bo Schembechler's temper. 
</P>
<P>
 He was right, of course. Davis plugged away for 50 yards and two touchdowns, 
and Biakabutuka finished with 128 yards and one touchdown in 12 carries. 
Afterward, Wheatley gloated. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did I think?" he said. "I think I was excited to see them play more than 
anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been waiting for this opportunity and they got it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley wouldn't mind a similar chance this Saturday against third-ranked 
Notre Dame, but it probably won't happen. By all accounts -- his and teammates' 
-- Wheatley will be sidelined at least until Sept. 24 against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the tailbacks," said Collins, "that wasn't a concern for us." 
</P>
<P>
 You wouldn't have known it by the opening minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 First play: Eagle quarterback Mark Hartsell, making his first start, connected 
with flanker Greg Grice on a 74-yard touchdown pass play. It was 7-0 before the 
band played "Victors" for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Second Michigan offensive series: Wolverine left tackle Trezelle Jenkins 
nearly wrestles linebacker Kerwin Waldroup to the ground on a third-and-nine 
situation at the Michigan two-yard line. Since the holding penalty took place 
in the end zone, Boston College was awarded a safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, with 10:48 to play in the second quarter, David Gordon kicked a 28-yard 
field goal to give the Eagles a 12-point lead. You could have heard a pom-pom 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Collins stifled a yawn. Panic? Against this team? 
</P>
<P>
 "I hoped we'd get down to Boston College, seven-nothing . . . . 14-nothing," 
said Collins, who finished with 17 completions in 24 attempts for 258 yards and 
two touchdowns, with one interception. "The guys didn't get nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they started taking turns throwing to Toomer or handing off to Davis 
and, a little later, to Biakabutuka. By halftime Michigan was ahead, 14-12. By 
the end of the third quarter, the score was 21-12. Late in the fourth quarter, 
it was 34-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Toomer did most of the work. He caught seven passes for 179 yards, most of 
which came after catching the ball. Boston College insisted on playing him man 
to man, which was fine with Toomer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think you can play our receivers completely . . . . one on one," 
he said. "We've proven in the past that it's not going to happen if you do." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College tried and look what happened. The Eagles loaded guys on the 
line and took their chances in the secondary. Maybe they forgot Wheatley was 
out. Then again, maybe they knew Biakabutuka was in. 
</P>
<P>
 Biakabutuka, a sophomore, was minding his business on the Wolverines' third 
team when Wheatley suffered the separated shoulder. That's when Michigan 
backfield coach Fred Jackson told Biakabutuka that his days as a caddy for 
Wheatley were temporarily finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Biakabutuka felt a fainting spell coming on. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Ty got hurt, I got scared," he said. "When Coach Jackson told me (the 
news) I said to myself, 'I got to learn my plays. I got to be more focused in 
meetings.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Biakabutuka, whose parents brought him to Canada when he was 6, didn't know 
the blocking schemes. He didn't recognize defenses. He was a little short on 
subtleties. 
</P>
<P>
 But he knew how to run. In fact, there are still Boston College defenders 
frozen in the Michigan Stadium turf from Biakabutuka's jukes and moves. 
Biakabutuka's average gain on the day: 10.7 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to lay down," he said afterward. "I'm tired." 
</P>
<P>
 First, he needs to learn a few things about next week's game against Notre 
Dame, where he'll see the ball more than 12 times. A history lesson might be a 
nice start. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first game I saw was Michigan or Notre Dame," he said proudly. "The 
'Rocket,' or somebody like that." 
</P>
<P>
 As in, Rocket Ismail, one of the best wide receivers ever to wear an Irish 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Gipper? 
</P>
<P>
 "What is it?" said Biakabutuka. 
</P>
<P>
 Knute Rockne? Frank Leahy? 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, no," he said, drawing a blank. 
</P>
<P>
 Touchdown Jesus? 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew Touchdown Jesus," he said. "That's basically all I know. You see 
pictures of Jesus like this (holding his arms outstretched), but he never 
scores touchdowns." 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan scores them. Lots of them Saturday. And that's all Boston College 
knows. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, they might even know how to spell Biakabutuka.

COMMENTARY; IT'S A SHAME SO FEW KNEW THE 'SPECIAL' BUCK O'NEIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE KINDRED, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All he ever wanted to do was play ball and he got to do plenty of that, even 
if it paid him nothing for a long time before he worked up to $700 a month in 
the Negro American League. 
</P>
<P>
 So Buck O'Neil was a happy man in the 1930s, and he is a happy man all these 
years later. This fall he will become a star when the Ken Burns documentary on 
baseball gives him room to tell us what the game was like, for black players 
and black fans, in a time when Americans lived in separated worlds under 
separate laws. 
</P>
<P>
 John Jordan (Buck) O'Neil is 82 years old. Ask him why baseball means so much 
to so many people and he says, "Baseball is the American sport. Really, 
everybody knows baseball. There's just something there that belongs to us. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell because, I don't care how good a player is, there are people up 
in the bleachers watching him and saying, 'I could do that.' They're not saying 
that about 7-foot basketball players dunking balls, and they're not saying that 
about 300-pound football players. But baseball, they say, 'That sucker do that, 
I can do that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Buck O'Neil was laughing out loud, his laughter a wonderful sound in these 
miserable days for major league baseball. These days are this miserable: What 
Hitler couldn't do, the men and women who own today's teams are about to do -- 
stop the World Series. If the owners do that, they prove beyond doubt they are 
fools beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, what a joy in this dead summer of 1994 to hear Buck O'Neil remember a 
glorious summer day in 1946 when he came to bat needing a triple to do 
something he had never seen anyone do. 
</P>
<P>
 "First time up, I had the single," he says. "Then the home run over the 
left-field fence. We were playing in Memphis, the Memphis Red Sox. After that, 
the double. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time up, I wanted that triple. I hit the ball with a good swing and 
it was headed toward left-center field where the power alley was 375 feet. I 
was running saying, 'Don't go out, don't go out, don't go out.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A half-century later, Buck O'Neil still sees that ball flying to left center. 
He laughed again as he spoke across time to the distant baseball, Don't go out, 
don't go. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It hit off the top of that fence and bounced back between the center fielder 
and left fielder. I wanted that triple, so I was running to third no matter 
what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Got to third easy. Got there standing up, if you want to know. I could have 
probably gone on around to home. But I stopped there. I wanted to hit for the 
cycle because I had never even known anybody who did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Because he was black, Buck O'Neil never played in what white America knows as 
baseball's major leagues. He worked in the Negro American League for 17 seasons 
as a first baseman and later as manager for the Kansas City Monarchs, the 
league's royalty. By the time the white folks of America decided to allow 
African Americans in their baseball leagues, Buck O'Neil was too old. 
</P>
<P>
 He would have liked to have been there with Jackie Robinson and Larry Doby and 
Monte Irvin. But his time as a player had come and gone. Even leading the Negro 
A.L. in hitting in 1946 did him no good; he hit .353 at age 34. His only 
regret, all these years later, is that integration of major league baseball 
killed the Negro Leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, what's important for people to know is that Negro League baseball 
wasn't 'The Bingo Long Traveling All-Star and Motor Kings,' " says O'Neil, 
naming a 1976 movie about barnstormers in broken-down buses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were 16 Negro League ballclubs, each with at least 15 players -- the 
Monarchs had 18 players. There were all those people putting on the games, 
booking agents, traveling secretaries, trainers. Baseball was black 
entertainment and was important to black communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very happy that integration happened, but it killed our business. 
Thing is, it could have been done a different way. Clubs like the Monarchs 
could have been used as farm clubs for the major leagues. But our businesses 
were taken away from us and there was nothing we could do about it. Nothing we 
could do against corporate America. So integration was a bittersweet thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he said it again, slowly, "Bitter . . . sweet," Buck O'Neil asks to be 
understood: He enjoyed every day of his baseball life. He left Sarasota, Fla., 
to play in the Negro minor leagues at Shreveport, La., where, on some nights, 
if any tickets were sold, he was paid 50 cents a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The happiest day of my life was coming to play with the Kansas City 
Monarchs," he says. "It would be like a white boy going to play for the New 
York Yankees." 
</P>
<P>
 He dreamed of becoming a manager because, in his boyhood around Florida spring 
training camps, Buck O'Neil had seen John McGraw managing the New York Giants 
and Connie Mack waving his scorecard from the Philadelphia Athletics' dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of managing fascinated me," says O'Neil, who in time won five Negro 
league championships and two World Series managing players named Ernie Banks, 
Elston Howard and Hank Thompson. In 1962, O'Neil was hired by the Chicago Cubs, 
the first black coach in the big leagues. He now is active in building a Negro 
Leagues museum in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 A baseball life 82 years in the making, and one night not long ago, all these 
years after Sarasota, after Jim Crow, after lives in parallel universes, John 
Jordan "Buck" O'Neil came to stand on a stage with Ted Williams and Mickey 
Mantle, heroes talking baseball. O'Neil stood there proudly and told anyone who 
would listen that the old days weren't hurtful. He said, "It was the time of 
our lives. All we wanted to do was play. We loved baseball."

 Grambling State's Kendrick Nord passed for 485 yards and seven touchdowns and 
Alcorn State's Steve McNair passed for 534 yards and five touchdowns as 
Grambling escaped with a 62-56 victory Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The two teams combined for 1,318 yards total offense.Grambling rolled up 612; 
Alcorn 706. 
</P>
<P>
 In an incredible offensive display, the two teams combined for 70 points in 
the first half, battling to a 35-35 standoff before a record Robinson Stadium 
crowd of 25,347. 
</P>
<P>
 McNair completed 27 of 52 passes and also rushed for 99 yards, giving him 633 
yards total offense, just 10 short of the Division I-AA record. McNair, who was 
3-0 against Grambling, had one final shot at rallying Alcorn, but his pass on 
fourth-and-10 from the Grambling 11 with four seconds left was knocked down by 
freshman Christopher Sampson in the end zone.

SOUTHWEST ROUNDUP; PITTSBURGH, MARTIN COME UP SHORT AGAINST TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Curtis Martin ran for more yards than any opponent in 101 years of Texas 
football. But when underdog Pittsburgh needed only three yards to tie the 
19th-ranked Longhorns on Saturday, he didn't even get the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Taje Allen, a reserve defensive back, batted away Sean Fitzgerald's two-point 
conversion pass with 36 seconds to play and the Longhorns held off Pitt, 30-28, 
at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Two missed conversions proved costly for Pitt as Texas won its opener for only 
the second time in eight seasons. Pitt lost its 10th consecutive home game but 
its first opener in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, a 1,000-yard runner on a team that won three games last season, turned 
in a Tony Dorsett-like performance on Dorsett Day at Pitt Stadium, carrying 28 
times for 251 yards. Texas Christian's Jim Swink held the Texas opponent's 
record with 235 yards in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony Dorsett was a great back, and Curtis Martin is becoming a great player," 
said Pitt's Johnny Majors, who became the fifth active Division I-A coach to 
participate in 300 games. "He was phenomenal. All of the great backs are 
different -- Gale Sayers was different from Tony Dorsett, for example -- but 
Curtis is one of the best I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
 But Martin got only 17 yards as Texas held the ball most of the fourth 
quarter, and a last-minute Pitt comeback fell short after Anthony Holmes' 
fumble with 1:14 to play led to Fitzgerald's 16-yard scoring pass to Matt 
Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitt would have needed only a conversion kick to tie if David Merrick had not 
missed the conversion after Pitt's first touchdown. Fitzgerald, a transfer from 
L.A. Valley College, passed to Chad Askew in the end zone, but Allen knocked 
the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have made a lot of calls there, but what might have worked there 
we'll never know," Majors said. "It's a one-shot deal . . . and a big guessing 
game. Giving it to (Martin) might have worked, but it didn't work earlier on a 
third down (from the five)." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Texas Coach John Mackovic: "What I really worried about was the simple 
handoff." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 15 Texas A&M 18, Louisiana State 13 -- Leeland McElroy's second touchdown 
run of the game, a 59-yarder with 7 1/2 minutes to play, lifted the Aggies at 
Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy, who ran for 132 yards, excelled despite LSU's efforts to contain the 
Aggies' highly regarded running attack. Texas A&M used the run in shutting down 
LSU, 24-0, in last year's season opener, with Rodney Thomas and McElroy 
combining for 331 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, Texas A&M's leading rusher last season, had losses of two, one and 
three yards to open the game and only 10 yards in his first five carries. 
McElroy's lone carry was for a two-yard loss as Texas A&M managed only two 
yards in seven carries in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy added legs to the Aggie ground game early in the second quarter. On 
the Aggies' first possession, McElroy found a hole at right tackle and powered 
through for 13 yards. Three plays later, McElroy ran around left end for 32 
yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor 44, Louisiana Tech 3 -- Freshman quarterback Jeff Watson completed a 
touchdown pass and fullback Bradford Lewis scored two touchdowns to lead the 
Bears at Waco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, the No. 4 passer in Texas high school history, guided the Bears to 
four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson completed 10 of 16 passes for 139 yards, and Jerod Douglas rushed for 
92 yards in 12 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Tech 37, New Mexico 31 -- Redshirt freshmen quarterbacks Tony Darden and 
Zebbie Lethridge helped the Red Raiders come back from from a 17-0 deficit to 
beat the Lobos at Lubbock, Tex. Lethridge completed 16 of 22 passes for 190 
yards, Darden seven of 13 for 92. Darden also scored from the one to give Texas 
Tech a 27-17 lead in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tech was threatening again later in the quarter when Darden fumbled attempting 
a pass at the Lobos' 25. Damon Burrest, a 350-pound defensive tackle, scooped 
up the ball and ran 75 yards to pull New Mexico to within 27-24.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP; MIAMI'S HOME STREAK REACHES RECORD 58 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Miami Hurricanes won, 56-0, and improved to 58-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami's rout of Georgia Southern on Saturday at the Orange Bowl was its 58th 
consecutive victory at home, which is an NCAA record. The old mark of 57 was 
set by Alabama from 1962-82. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-ranked Miami allowed Division I-AA Georgia Southern only two first downs 
until the game's final five minutes. The score equaled the most lopsided during 
the winning streak, which began nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M, with 20, has the second-longest active home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The shutout, preserved by a goal-line stand in the final two minutes, was the 
Hurricanes' 14th during their winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 James Stewart rushed for 145 yards and three touchdowns in 17 carries and 
scored on runs of 31, 16 and two yards, and Alfred Shipman scored on an 82-yard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Frank Costa, who lost his starting job midway through last season, 
passed for 168 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami's swarming defense included end Rusty Medearis, playing for the first 
time since suffering a knee injury that nearly ended his career two years ago. 
Medearis played most of the first half and made one tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia 16, Ball State 14 -- Freshman Bryan Baumann's first collegiate 
field goal, a 33-yarder with eight seconds left, gave the Mountaineers a 
surprisingly difficult victory over the Cardinals at Morgantown, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
 The defending Big East champions (1-1), playing the defending champions from 
the Mid-American Conference, needed Baumann's field goal after linebacker Kevin 
Johnson of Ball State stopped a two-point conversion bid with 3:46 left by 
sacking quarterback Eric Boykin. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia held on the next series and Boykin, a sophomore playing in his 
second game, led West Virginia on a 12-play, 51-yard drive that set up the 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia was coming off a 31-0 loss to Nebraska in the Kickoff Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 21 Virginia Tech 34, Arkansas State 7 -- Maurice DeShazo completed 13 of 
20 passes for 209 yards and two touchdowns and ran for a third score to lead 
the Hokies at Blacksburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Tech scored touchdowns on its first three possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutgers 28, Kent 6 -- Ray Lucas ran for a touchdown and passed for another in 
a 21-point second-quarter as the Scarlet Knights opened their new $26 million 
stadium in Piscataway, N.J., with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss spoiled the debut of Kent Coach Jim Corrigall and extended the Golden 
Flashes' losing streak to 17 games, longest among the nation's 107 Division I-A 
schools. SOUTH 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Mississippi 25, Tulane 10 -- Chris Buckhalter gained 186 yards in 30 
carries and Howard McGee had 141 in 13 to lead the Golden Eagles at New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee put the game away with a 60-yard run up the right sideline that put 
Southern Mississippi up 25-10 with 3:32 remaining in the game. MIDWEST 
</P>
<P>
 Temple 32, Akron 7 -- Danny Davis ran for two touchdowns and caught a scoring 
pass as the Owls took advantage of five turnovers to win at Akron, Ohio, and 
snap a 10-game losing streak. WESTERN ATHLETIC 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado State 34, Air Force 21 -- With the Rams leading, 28-21, at halftime, 
this season opener at Air Force Academy, Colo., looked as if it was going to 
turn into a typical high-scoring Western Athletic Conference game. But the Rams 
shut down the Falcons in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 32, Utah State 17 -- Mike McCoy threw for 286 yards and two touchdowns to 
lead the Utes at Logan, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyoming 36, Texas El Paso 13 -- Ryan Christopherson ran for 244 yards, 
second-best in Wyoming history, and John Gustin threw three touchdown passes as 
the Cowboys opened with a WAC victory at Laramie, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State 45, San Jose State 13 -- Sophomore Adrian Claiborne completed 14 
of 19 passes for 319 yards and four touchdowns to lead the Bulldogs at Fresno. 
BIG WEST 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada 30, Northern Arizona 27 -- Junior Mike Maxwell, in his first college 
game, threw for one touchdown and set up two others to lead the Wolf Pack of 
the Big West to a comeback victory over the Division I-AA Lumberjacks at Reno. 
Northern Arizona outgained Nevada, 506 yards to 445. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada Las Vegas 17, Eastern Michigan 3 -- Jason Davis completed 17 of 35 
passes for 253 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Rebels at Las Vegas in Jeff 
Horton's debut as the Rebels' coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific 24, UC Davis 7 -- Craig Whelihan threw for 302 yards and two touchdown 
passes to lead the Tigers in Stockton. Whelihan was 17 of 34 with two 
third-quarter scoring passes to Kerry Brown.

 Although it was ranked among the top NCAA Division II teams in the nation, 
Portland State was no match for Division I Oregon and quarterback Danny O'Neil 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They looked good on film, but it ended up being easier than I thought," 
O'Neil said after the Ducks routed the Vikings, 58-16, in the season opener for 
both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just don't play hard every down. I think they slacked off after a while 
when they realized that they were out of it."  
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil passed for four touchdowns and 180 yards in only three quarters. Oregon 
led, 38-9, with 6:50 to play in the third quarter after leading at halftime, 
28-9. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got what we wanted out of the game," Oregon Coach Rich Brooks said. "We 
came away with the win." 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon's defense held Portland State to only 144 yards total offense and 
minus-11 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you don't execute and the other team does, it's going to be a long day 
no matter who you play," Portland State Coach Tim Walsh said.

 Chris Hopkins ran six yards for the winning touchdown Saturday night as 
Arizona State came from behind to defeat Oregon State, 22-16, in the season 
opener for both Pac-10 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins, who gained 135 yards in 24 carries, bounced off a tackler at the line 
of scrimmage, veered left and lunged for the score. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Devils got their first touchdown early when Jake Plummer, who started 
with eight consecutive completions, found Clyde McCoy for a 58-yard score on 
his first attempt. Plummer found McCoy crossing midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Baker kicked 33-, 24- and 37-yard field goals for Arizona State, which 
took a 9-0 lead but was up only, 9-7, at halftime after Don Shanklin raced 83 
yards to score with 23 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State's other points came on Randy Lund's 28-yard field goal and a 
68-yard run by J.J. Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State got the ball on its 44-yard line with 3:02 left, but Shanklin was 
sidelined with a strained right shoulder after gaining 120 yards in 10 carries, 
and backup Rahim Muhammad couldn't move the Beavers. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State's defense dominated in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Schmidt ended two possessions with recovered fumbles, and Arizona State 
kept the Beavers out of the end zone on back-to-back drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State marched from its 20 to the Arizona State 13 in the first quarter. 
Then Ken Talanoa tackled Young for a three-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds later, the Sun Devils dropped J.D. Stewart after a one-yard run on 
fourth-and-two. 
</P>
<P>
 One lapse proved costly, however. On a play that began with 35 seconds left in 
the half, Shanklin sprinted to his right and raced down the sideline for the 
score.

 San Diego State can still move the ball, even without Marshall Faulk. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Gutierrez unveiled the Aztecs' no-huddle offense with a near-perfect 
performance Saturday night, passing for 248 yards and four touchdowns as the 
Aztecs routed Navy, 56-14. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no stopping us," Gutierrez said. "We wanted everybody to see what 
this Aztec offense is all about. . . . Once we get rolling, we're going, we're 
fast-breaking. We're going to move the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State outgained Navy, 503 yards to 232. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory marked the debut of Ted Tollner, a former USC coach who was named 
San Diego State's 14th head coach in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy, which has lost six in a row dating to last season, had four consecutive 
turnovers in the first half, including three interceptions thrown by Jim 
Kubiak. San Diego State scored after three of the turnovers, starting drives 
from the Navy 28, 34 and 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez completed his first 10 passes for 112 yards before tight end Zach 
Smith dropped a pass. Gutierrez, who left after the first drive of the second 
half, completed 21 of 25 passes, with no interceptions and one sack. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very impressive," Tollner said. "He makes good decisions and throws a 
very accurate and catchable ball."

TRACK AND FIELD / GRAND PRIX FINAL; JOYNER-KERSEE SCORES ONE FOR EQUAL PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Heike Drechsler are close friends, which is 
remarkable considering that they have regularly competed against each other in 
the long jump for eight years and that one grew up in East St. Louis and the 
other in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is friendship, and there is business, and while Joyner-Kersee is too 
easy-going to publicly complain, she did not object when her 
coach/manager/husband, Bob Kersee, did because Drechsler was receiving more 
lucrative appearance fees on this summer's European track and field circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It upset me more, of course, but, really, this is one time when we agreed," 
said Kersee, who withdrew Joyner-Kersee from two meets before promoters 
realized he was serious and agreed that she and Drechsler should receive equal 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, it was up to Joyner-Kersee to prove she deserved it. 
</P>
<P>
 If she had not already done that, she certainly did Saturday in the Mobil 
Grand Prix Final. In her fifth victory in six meetings against Drechsler this 
season, Joyner-Kersee won with a best of 23 feet 8 inches. That was a foot and 
a quarter better than the 22-5 jumped by Drechsler, who finished third. 
Ukraine's Inessa Kravets was second at 22-10 3/4.

 Joyner-Kersee earned $30,000 for winning the 15-meet Grand Prix women's 
long-jump championship and an additional $100,000 for finishing first among all 
female track and field athletes in the overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it might have seemed like an unusual time to complain about money, 
Kersee realized that there might never be a better one after surveying the 
near-capacity crowd in the newly refurbished, 20,000-seat Charlety Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Coinciding with the close of the Olympic Centennial Congress in Paris, the 
meet attracted the most influential members of the International Olympic 
Committee, including President Juan Antonio Samaranch, and the International 
Amateur Athletic Federation, which governs track and field. With all those 
policy-makers within earshot, Kersee began his newest crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal this year was to get Jackie up there with Heike in pay," Kersee said. 
"Jackie is the world's greatest woman athlete, and if she hasn't ranked with 
Heike in the long jump the last few years, it's because Jackie has been 
concentrating on the heptathlon.  
</P>
<P>
 "But now that's settled, the next step is to get Jackie, Heike and the other 
top women up there with the men sprinters, pole vaulters and distance runners. 
Some of them make about $25,000 or $30,000 a meet. The best women average about 
half that. They have to set a world record and collect a bonus just to get what 
a man gets for running a normal race. That's not fair. The women are just as 
good for the sport as the men." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Saturday's activities, score one for Kersee. 
</P>
<P>
 The two best performances were by women. France's Marie-Jose Perec, who lives 
and trains in Westwood, returned to Paris and ran the fastest time of the year 
in the 400 meters, 49.77. Jamaica's Merlene Ottey ran the second-fastest time 
of the year in the 100 meters with a personal best of 10.78. Runner-up Gwen 
Torrence of the United States also ran a personal best, 10.82. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, for the most part, appeared burned out by the long season, although 
there were some interesting results. 
</P>
<P>
 Unsure about whether to compete after awaking Saturday with bronchitis, 
Algeria's Noureddine Morceli decided that he should at least make the effort 
considering that he entered the meet with the lead in the 1,500 meters and the 
overall standings. Fortunately for him, his competitors did not push the pace, 
and Morceli won in 3:40.89, earning him, like Joyner-Kersee, $130,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A photo was required after the 100 meters to determine that the United States' 
Dennis Mitchell beat Great Britain's Linford Christie, the Olympic and world 
champion. Believing that he had won, Christie took a victory lap. "How 
embarrassing," he said later, upon learning that he had been recorded in 10.13 
to Mitchell's 10.12. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine's Sergei Bubka won the pole vault at 19-4 1/4, but just as he was 
about to make a world-record attempt at 20-2 1/4, a windy afternoon turned 
rainy. He packed up his poles and said au revoir .

RENEBERG MIGHT BE HITTING THE BIG TIME; TENNIS: NO. 48 PLAYER ADVANCES TO 
FOURTH ROUND WITH SOLID GROUND STROKES AND PLAYS NO. 9 TODD MARTIN NEXT.

 Four seeded players won, two lost and unseeded Richey Reneberg continued to 
prove that his opening-night stunner in the U.S. Open over Boris Becker 
shouldn't have been that stunning after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Reneberg dropped a first set to Richard Fromberg of Australia and then, 
hitting the ball as solidly and consistently as anybody in the men's bracket, 
ran through Fromberg, 2-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels great," said No. 48-ranked Reneberg, 28, who has won 10 doubles 
titles in his career, including the 1992 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning of the year -- last couple of years, I really wanted to play 
better in the Grand Slams. I'd feel confident in the regular tour events but 
always fell short in the Grand Slams." 
</P>
<P>
 His victory on the grandstand court Saturday earned him a spot in the round of 
16 against No. 9 Todd Martin, who defeated Patrick Rafter of Australia in the 
night session, 7-5, 6-3, 6-7 (7-3), 6-2. Reneberg and Martin have split their 
four matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Martin, other seeded men winning were No. 3 Sergei Bruguera of Spain, 
who was forced to five sets by Marc Goellner of Germany; No. 6 Michael Chang, 
who got a break when Jim Grabb had to retire in the second set because of a 
sore shoulder, and No. 13 Thomas Muster of Austria. Losing were No. 12 Wayne 
Ferreira of South Africa, who went out quickly to Andre Agassi, and No. 15 Marc 
Rosset of Switzerland, who lost in five sets to Bernd Karbacher of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was seeded, and Agassi wasn't," Ferreira said, "but if I had to pick a 
favorite going into that match, I would have picked him." 
</P>
<P>
 The only women's casualty was No. 6 Lindsay Davenport. No. 1 Steffi Graf of 
Germany, No. 4 Mary Pierce of France, No. 7 Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic, 
No. 10 Zina Garrison Jackson, No. 11 Amanda Coetzer of South Africa (11) and 
No. 15 Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria advanced. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf gave her supporters a scare when she had a nosebleed during practice, but 
she was fine in her match against Radka Bobkova of the Czech Republic, winning 
in straight sets. Pierce, Novotna, Coetzer and Maleeva did the same; Garrison 
Jackson was stretched to a third-set tiebreaker, 7-1. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The attendance stayed near the 20,000 mark per session for the seventh 
consecutive day here. The afternoon, when additional grounds passes are sold, 
drew 22,830; the evening 20,572. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Weisner of Austria made only two of 15 break-point opportunities 
against Mary Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 Richey Reneberg, when asked if he felt on the verge of breaking into the top 
level of the game: "Not really. And if I did, at 28, I'd be kind of a late 
bloomer."

CLASSICAL MUSIC; ON THE VERGE; KENT NAGANO HAS BEEN CALLED THE NEXT LEONARD 
BERNSTEIN AND THE MOST IMPORTANT AMERICAN CONDUCTOR OF HIS GENERATION. SO, WHEN 
WILL THE BIG LEAP HAPPEN? IN TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Everything about the performance seemed natural, confident, vibrant, at the 
British premiere of John Adams' Violin Concerto recently given by the London 
Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there were backstage tensions. The composer, himself a conductor, 
later confessed that the desire to conduct his own music has become so strong 
that he had to hold his arm down like Dr. Strangelove. 
</P>
<P>
 The soloist, the Russian violinist Gidon Kremer, likes to play everything 
differently each time he plays it, especially when he gets a new concerto so 
mysterious and rich in expression that he is just getting to the bottom of it. 
</P>
<P>
 And a British Rail strike had robbed a very overworked British orchestra of 
some of the already brief rehearsal time it had for a score full of very 
American rhythmic difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever pressures and insecurities these might have caused, what occurred 
on the stage seemed natural, confident, vibrant, because Kent Nagano was 
conducting. 
</P>
<P>
 Most really persuasive conductors are noisy people, full of bluster and 
panache; they pretty much have to be in order to command an army of musicians 
and captivate an audience at the same time. Conversely, most quiet conductors 
-- unless they happen to be unusually illuminating, like Pierre Boulez, or 
unusually elegant, the way Pierre Monteux was -- tend to be satisfied with 
workmanlike performances. That is to say, the quiet Germans, British, Italians, 
Americans, Russians are likely to be dull. Only a few quiet French seem to be 
able to get away with brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
 And, now, there is a quiet American, one who displays some of Boulez's clarity 
and insight and Monteux's suavity along with a certain understated but vivid 
theatricality all his own. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not appear so from a perusal of Nagano's very British program with the 
quintessentially British Halle Orchestra this week at the Hollywood Bowl in 
conjunction with the UK/LA Festival, but Nagano happens to be almost 
quintessentially melting-pot American. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a third-generation Japanese American who grew up on a farm in Morro Bay, 
who tooled around in sports cars and listened to rock 'n' roll in the '60s, and 
who surfs. 
</P>
<P>
 It may also come as news to many who do not follow the international music 
scene closely that the 41-year-old Nagano is now generally felt to be the most 
important American conductor of his generation. In his careful, determined way, 
Nagano, who heads the Berkeley Symphony Orchestra, the Lyon Opera in France and 
the Halle Orchestra in Manchester, England, has been building a very important 
career in secondary cities. 
</P>
<P>
 It will probably come as news to most Angelenos, who might remember Nagano 
from a couple of seasons at Ojai in the '80s, from a low-key debut conducting 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl eight years ago and from two 
appearances at Music Center Opera (Adams' "Nixon in China" and Kurt Weill's 
"The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny"). 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly came as news to New Yorkers last season. Five years ago Nagano 
led somewhat lackluster concerts with the New York Philharmonic and the 
Brooklyn Philharmonic. (He had also conducted the New York premiere of Adams' 
opera "The Death of Klinghoffer," but the subject of the opera so infuriated 
the ethnic populations that Nagano's contribution was lost in the storm of 
controversy -- although his cool at the stormy atmosphere surrounding the 
opera's premiere in Brussels was lost on no one.) 
</P>
<P>
 This past season, however, Nagano returned to New York to conduct a program 
with the American Composers Orchestra that included Adams' "El Dorado" and an 
obscure Hindemith symphony, and a revival of Metropolitan Opera's production of 
Poulenc's "The Dialogues of the Carmelites." 
</P>
<P>
 While hardly disrespectable, these were not the most prestigious of New York 
dates nor did they represent the most popular of repertoire. But this time the 
raves were unanimous. At the Met, Nagano got thunderous ovations, the equal of 
those for two sopranos in the cast who have cult followings -- Teresa Stratas 
and Dawn Upshaw. Then New York magazine upped the ante, producing the city's 
highest praise. In a headline for a profile of the conductor, it screamed, "The 
New Lenny." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nagano is nothing like Leonard Bernstein. Bernstein was a loud 
personality, Nagano is not. By Nagano's age, Bernstein was music director of 
the New York Philharmonic, a huge television personality, a best-selling 
recording artist and the composer of hit Broadway musicals and substantial 
works. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagano is none of those things, and not even close. Bernstein, who had grabbed 
celebrity from the start, was the first American conductor to make a big career 
without going to Europe. Nagano, on the other hand, has built a career slowly 
and done it primarily in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein was a podium extrovert. Nagano, while a striking podium presence 
with his long hair and leonine gestures, moves more in service of musical 
execution than to achieve personal expression. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a subtle and important sense, Nagano may well be the next Lenny by 
simply not trying to be like Bernstein at all. Bernstein's great accomplishment 
was to be himself, an American Jew, when that wasn't supposed to be a viable 
mold for a conductor to fit into. And likewise, Nagano, never forgetting his 
roots, has calmly and thoughtfully helped turn the sleepy Lyon Opera into one 
of the most alluring and most talked-about companies in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, where he conducts regularly as the principal guest conductor of the 
London Symphony, Nagano gets much better reviews then do the music directors of 
most of the other London orchestras. With Halle, where he was hired to 
revitalize what had once been an important orchestra in what had once been an 
important city, he seems, after only two full seasons, to have already done so. 
In Berkeley, where he has remained faithful to the orchestra that helped give 
him his start, he has created a small miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, being a Californian may well have served as Nagano's key to 
successful adaptation to such very different traditions as those in Lyon and 
Manchester (the Halle is the oldest orchestra in Britain) while still keeping 
his roots in countercultural Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like California, where I grew up," Nagano explains at a recording 
session for the Adams concerto, where his elegant manner makes him seem equally 
at ease with the California composer, British musicians and Russian violinist. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think maybe part of our culture, or part of being a Californian, is 
that it nurtures a natural sense of curiosity and a sense of flexibility. And 
that lends itself not just to going someplace and imposing yourself on that 
place as a foreigner playing the role of a tourist. It's true, I admit, I'll 
never pass as a Frenchman; I'll never pass as British citizen either. But 
that's not to say that you can't be a part of these communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The communities today, as they probably always have been, are a very complex 
combination of very diverse backgrounds. That's why we've always had bursts of 
social creativity along with bursts of social tension. They both come from 
those differences. And it's those differences that, for me, make a community 
particularly interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I am pretty convinced that if you're willing to put quite a bit of effort 
to learn languages, to learn customs, to suppress your own criticism and try to 
learn something instead, you can go a long way toward belonging to part of a 
community and at least beginning to understand it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of music is really to share. If music represents those parts of 
life worth living -- and that's a quote that's not mine, unfortunately, but 
it's a wonderful quote -- then that's certainly worth sharing with as many 
people as possible. But to just share doesn't mean giving something without 
sensitivity to how the other person feels. That sharing implies that you're 
making an effort toward those people with whom you're trying to share." 
</P>
<P>
 Building ties with the communities may help explain why Nagano has had the 
successes he has had and why he may not have always made a big first impression 
when he had initial opportunities to conduct orchestras such as the New York 
Philharmonic or the Los Angeles Philharmonic and had to prove himself in a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagano's first community was Morro Bay. His microbiologist mother and 
architect father temporarily sacrificed their careers to help with the family 
farm when his Japanese grandparents returned from internment after World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clearly a sophisticated, multicultural farm life, however, one in which 
Nagano could become proficient on piano, clarinet, viola and koto before high 
school. He also put them all aside for electric guitar in the pop-crazed world 
of high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagano was enough of a product of the social and political unrest of the late 
'60s and early '70s to have vacillated between music and social science while 
an undergraduate at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He did 
eventually, as a graduate student at San Francisco State University, choose 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 But his real start toward a music career began when he took a job as an 
assistant to Sarah Caldwell at the Boston Opera, where he learned the opera 
business from the ground up by doing everything from sweeping the stage to 
playing in the pit to negotiating labor contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Such practical experience was probably as attractive as Nagano's nascent 
conducting ability to the Berkeley Symphony, a fledgling, barely surviving 
organization, when it appointed him music director in 1978. At his first 
concert, Nagano remembers that only about 125 people were in the audience, and 
so financially uncertain was the orchestra that during Nagano's first four 
years with it, it had to cancel at least one concert a season, and once almost 
disbanded. But it also proved an ideal training ground for Nagano, who is 
remembered as the kid with the ponytail and funky formal clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're under these kinds of pressures and these kinds of conditions, you 
learn quickly what is really exciting and what is not," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 What Nagano learned was that it was foolish to compete against the San 
Francisco Symphony and the Oakland Symphony, so he decided to offer audiences 
something they couldn't hear anywhere else. Feeling that he had nothing to 
lose, he became wildly ambitious, programming such impractical occasions as a 
cycle of huge Messiaen orchestra works and a concert performance of Hans 
Pfitzner's Gargantuan opera "Palestrina." 
</P>
<P>
 It worked for Nagano. Olivier Messiaen noticed and Nagano became a favorite 
interpreter of the composer. 
</P>
<P>
 Conductor Seiji Ozawa also noticed, and Nagano became his assistant at the 
Boston Symphony, where he won international recognition when he led a 
triumphant performance of Mahler's Ninth Symphony on one day's notice and 
without rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
 And it worked for Berkeley: The orchestra is now a success story financially 
and artistically. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Lyon we've done something very similar over the past seven years -- golly, 
I've been there a long time now, five years as music director," Nagano says of 
how his Berkeley experiences might have influenced him in Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the Lyon Opera triumvirate, completed by an artistic director and a 
general director, Nagano says his mandate is only to do what there is a really 
good reason for doing. And that kind of thinking has led to innovative 
productions and recordings that have brought the company a wide international 
following. 
</P>
<P>
 One example Nagano gives is the Puccini cycle with which he is currently 
involved in Lyon. Puccini, while overdone everywhere else, is actually foreign 
to the company, which Nagano claims had never before performed "La Boheme," 
"Madama Butterfly," "Tosca" or "Turandot." But Nagano also feels that the 
operas profit from a contemporary sensibility, and he is particularly proud of 
the attention-getting productions of "Butterfly," directed by Kon Ichikawa with 
sets by Arata Isozaki (the Japanese architect who designed the Museum of 
Contemporary Art in Los Angeles) and with a basically Japanese cast, and a 
"Turandot" directed by the legendary Japanese filmmaker Hiroshi Teshigahara 
("Woman in the Dunes"). 
</P>
<P>
 These productions, which will tour Japan, also represent Nagano's continued 
involvement in his Japanese heritage, something further enhanced by the fact 
that he has married the Japanese pianist Mari Kodama. 
</P>
<P>
 But another key to his success in Lyon, which has been documented on a number 
of award-winning recordings (including Prokofiev's "The Love for Three Oranges" 
and Poulenc's "Dialogues of the Carmelites") has been Nagano's painstaking 
attention to details, to maintaining utter clarity and first-rate ensemble 
playing at all times. That has even brought him into the pit for ballet 
productions. A new video of choreographer Angelin Preljocaj's "Romeo and 
Juliet" not only demonstrates the innovative staging and musical solutions that 
have become typical of Lyon, but also a level of orchestral execution that is 
almost unknown in ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 Given his successes with marginal institutions (Lyon was not in bad shape 
under his predecessor, the early-music specialist John Eliot Gardiner, but 
neither was it the venturesome operation it is today), it is hardly surprising 
that Halle would go shopping for Nagano. What is surprising is that Nagano 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Though once a glorious orchestra under Sir John Barbirolli, Halle had become 
an orchestra one British critic called "in terminal decline after 20 years of 
mediocrity under James Loughran and Stanislaw Skrowaczewski." 
</P>
<P>
 But as part of an attempt to boost its image, Manchester had applied to become 
an Olympic city in 2000. And to make the city more attractive to the Olympic 
committee, it had thought to upgrade its once great orchestra and to build a 
new hall for it. It had hoped to match Sir Simon Rattle's achievement for the 
City of Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Manchester and the Halle turned out to be as little known to Nagano as it 
is for most of us these days. "It's far away," Nagano notes. "Most people think 
of it, I guess, as an industrial base; or even worse than that, many people 
think of it as a former industrial capital." 
</P>
<P>
 But to Nagano's surprise he found that Manchester had adapted to its 
post-industrial situation the way few other cities have. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful, and the air is clean. The buildings are spotless. There is a 
lot of new construction. That image of a dirty old decaying industrial city 
just doesn't ring true anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did Nagano find that Manchester seemed a worthwhile place to settle 
for a large part of each year, he was also impressed by the civic support for 
the orchestra, since the city continued right along with its plans for the new 
hall even after it lost its Olympic bid. He also found that the orchestra had a 
tradition that felt just right for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you'd be surprised what that tradition is," Nagano exclaims with 
enthusiasm. "It's the tradition of the most progressive and advanced thinking 
both in terms of performance (and) in terms of performance standards. Sir 
Charles Halle came from an illustrious career in France, where he was very 
close to composers like Berlioz, Chopin and Liszt. He invited to Manchester all 
of these people, all of his friends that he knew in Paris, establishing 
Manchester as a real cultural avant-garde center. It's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Halle tradition continued with Hans Richter, the great 19th-Century 
conductor who debuted works by Wagner and Brahms and continued with the likes 
of Sir Thomas Beecham and Sir John Barbirolli. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think of Barbirolli as someone really steeped and immersed in the 
British literature," Nagano suggests, "but it just wasn't true. The fact is 
that he was recording Mahler when no one else was recording Mahler. He was 
championing Sibelius when Sibelius was considered radical music. When he played 
Vaughan Williams symphonies, he was giving premieres -- this was brand-new 
music. Elgar didn't really have an outlet before Barbirolli championed him. 
This repertoire that Barbirolli was bringing was on the forefront of musical 
development at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 And, most notably, that is just what Nagano has set out to do in modern terms 
in Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
 He opened his first Halle season in 1992 with Messiaen's last piece as well as 
John Adams' "El Dorado." He has greatly involved himself in the orchestra's 
educational programs. And the results have already been gratifying, he says, 
with many, many younger people in the audience and the programs selling out. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that Nagano is now thought of as a major conductor in England 
just as much as he is in France. And he is sought after everywhere. 
</P>

 The week of the Adams premiere with the London Symphony Orchestra, for 
instance, also found him in the recording studio, taping the concerto for 
Nonesuch, squeezed in between other London Symphony recording sessions (part of 
the Ravel cycle for Erato and a "Boheme" with Kiri Te Kanawa for Teldec). The 
release this summer of a spectacular new recording with the London Symphony of 
Stravinsky's "Firebird" was greeted by the British as an occasion once more for 
feature stories and a magazine cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, though working day and night in London and coping with 
singers' illnesses and cancellations in the "Boheme" sessions, Nagano seemed 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Adams recording session he listened as intently to the wishes of the 
composer and violinist Kremer as he did to the orchestra. And when Kremer would 
want to repeat something to get yet another perspective, Nagano's quiet 
diligence kept the overworked orchestra alert, the soloist and composer happy, 
the studio atmosphere collegial. 
</P>
<P>
 The music bloomed. Very few loud conductors can do as much.

MOVIES; HOLLYWOOD'S MONSTER FALL; REMEMBER WHEN THE SEASON AFTER SUMMER WAS A 
MOVIE DUMPING GROUND? WELL, NOT THIS YEAR. NEARLY 60 FILMS ARE COMING OUT 
BEFORE THE TRADITIONAL HOLIDAY CRUNCH. GROWN-UPS, REJOICE.

<P>
 Fall. The kids refill their loose-leaf binders. The leaves depart the old ash 
tree. Sweaters and coats are pulled out of the cedar chest. So much to do. Not 
much time to catch a new movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Hollywood perennially puts some slack in its release schedule for 
the season as people get back to their lives apres the deluge of summer movies. 
</P>
<P>
 But not this year. Some of it has to do with films' having been pulled from 
summer so they wouldn't be run over by blockbuster express trains: the Meryl 
Streep action/suspense movie "The River Wild"; the Albert Brooks baseball 
comedy "The Scout," and "Only You," a romance between Marisa Tomei and Robert 
Downey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, the movies' premises required more advance groundwork than can 
be packed into a 30-second high-concept TV commercial: "Pulp Fiction," starring 
John Travolta and Bruce Willis; "Ed Wood" with Johnny Depp, and "Exit to Eden," 
featuring Dana Delany and Rosie O'Donnell. These three self-described 
"comedies" deal with contract murder, transvestism and sadomasochism, 
respectively.  
</P>
<P>
 The fall is also used to get a running jump on the holiday season, when the 
major studios cram as many movies as they can into a space no bigger than a 
phone booth. This year, there'll be Paul Newman and Melanie Griffith starring 
in the drama "Nobody's Fool," Kenneth Branagh returning to the Mary Shelley 
novel for his "Frankenstein," and Tim Allen attempting a smooth TV-to-film ride 
in "The Santa Clause." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm no fortune-teller," says 20th Century Fox distribution head Tom Sherak, 
"but fall looks strong on product. It's not a dumping ground this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor, says Touchstone Pictures President David Hoberman, will fall merely be 
the preserve of sophisticated fare with limited commercial potential. "There 
are a number of films this year with great playability," he says. Playability 
means box-office appeal.  
</P>
<P>
 With limited playing time and a smaller available audience than in summer or 
around Christmas, it's a challenge for a fall movie to build a substantial 
audience. Still, everybody hopes against hope for a "Fatal Attraction" or a " 
'Crocodile' Dundee" or an "Under Siege" -- fall releases that each grossed 
upward of $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
 No baseball playoffs or World Series this year could boost movie attendance 
too, some industry wags say. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, a real-life murder mystery will be playing out on 
television. The O.J. Simpson trial will begin Sept. 19 and is expected to run 
through December. "If there's gavel-to-gavel coverage of the trial, it could 
have a major impact on the movie business," Universal Chairman Tom Pollock 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 For struggling independent companies, fall is a time to snare some attention 
for themselves, although this year, says Samuel Goldwyn Co. production head 
John Manulis, the studios are crowding them as never before. And since the 
independents can't spend what studios do on ad campaigns, they have to find 
other ways to call attention to their wares. 
</P>
<P>
 One way is to get there first. Goldwyn is releasing David Mamet's 
controversial sexual harassment drama "Oleanna," two months before Warner 
Bros.' adaptation of Michael Crichton's similarly themed "Disclosure," which 
opens Dec. 16. Renewed debate about the topic "should stir up the Internet," 
Manulis predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the independents' side is the fall film festival hoopla -- starting 
Labor Day with the Telluride Festival and continuing at Toronto, Montreal and 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a time when independent films get a lot of press attention," says 
October Films principal Jeff Lipsky. "That makes it easier for us to reach our 
core audience than for the major studios -- if we have cutting-edge films."  
</P>
<P>
 And there's nothing like controversy to stoke audience interest. Two 
independently made fall movies have run afoul of the Motion Picture Assn. of 
America ratings board -- the romantic drama "Jason's Lyric" and the low-budget 
comedy "Clerks" -- over sexual content and language, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when all is said and done, one senior studio executive says, this fall 
season is likely to fit, more or less, into the pattern of years past: 
"There'll be five movies that work and about 15 to 20 movies that break even. 
All the rest will lose money." 
</P>
<P>
 With nearly 60 movies due for release between Labor Day and Nov. 11 (Nov. 18 
will see the release of such holiday films as "Interview with the Vampire"), 
that means about 30 flops. Small wonder that the principals involved in the 
major fall releases are working hard to distinguish themselves from the rest of 
the pack.  
</P>
<P>
 "We work hard to sell these movies. But word-of-mouth is the still most potent 
way," Paramount head Sherry Lansing says. Battle of the True Romances 
</P>
<P>
 "Warren Beatty and I have duked it out before," jokes director Norman Jewison, 
whose romantic comedy "Only You" is due mid-October, around the same time as 
Beatty and Annette Bening's amorously inclined "Love Affair." (Jewison's "In 
the Heat of the Night" and Beatty's production of "Bonnie and Clyde" opened at 
the same time in 1967.) 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Beatty wonders whether an "unabashedly romantic" movie might be viewed 
a bit of a gamble in these hard-bitten times, Jewison is confident that romance 
is always in fashion and love always in bloom. "Everyone told me that no one 
would come to see 'Moonstruck,' " he says of the Cher/Nicolas Cage close 
encounter he directed several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love Affair" is the second remake of Leo McCarey's 1939 romantic drama 
starring Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer. McCarey himself remade it in 1957 as 
"An Affair to Remember," with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, one of the great 
weepies of all time. Beatty says the 1994 model hews closer to the original yet 
has a contemporary sensibility. A delicate juggling act. But, Beatty points 
out, his "Heaven Can Wait" updated the 1941 comedy "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" 
without losing the original's emotional underpinnings. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Only You," Jewison may not have the publicity value of a real-life famous 
married couple playing lovers on screen, but he is pleased with the chemistry 
between Tomei and Downey. Down Memory Lane 
</P>
<P>
 What do Woody Allen, George Lucas, Robert Redford and Kevin Costner have in 
common? Going into the past to create contemporary entertainments. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's "Bullets Over Broadway" is an out-and-out comedy about a '20s mobster 
who finances a Broadway show. It features a younger ensemble than usual for the 
Woodman -- including John Cusack, Mary-Louise Parker, Chazz Palmintieri and 
Jennifer Tilly. After a string of financial disappointments for Orion and 
TriStar, it's Allen's first film to be released by an independent company, 
Miramax. Producer Jean Doumanian is counting on Miramax's TLC, which worked so 
well for "The Piano" and "The Crying Game," to help Allen broaden his audience. 
"Miramax cleverly takes movies that are not necessarily mainstream and sells 
them to a mainstream audience," Doumanian says. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer George Lucas is also dabbling in nostalgia with his first big-screen 
venture since the third "Indiana Jones" movie in 1989. "Radioland Murders," he 
says, combines the humor of Nick and Nora Charles, "His Girl Friday," the Marx 
Brothers and the Three Stooges. Brian Benben of HBO's "Dream On" gets his first 
starring role in a film that Lucas promises has six murders, 16 musical numbers 
and more than 100 speaking parts. "It's a very active film," Lucas says. "Lots 
of different things are happening all the time. It starts out as a 
murder-mystery and then the hero's on the run. I guess you could say it's a 
sequel to 'The Fugitive.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Redford has dipped into the past in a more personal way. "Quiz Show," 
which he directed, stars "Schindler's List" Oscar nominee Ralph Fiennes and 
John Turturro in a film centering on the 1958 "Twenty-One" TV game show 
scandal. The moment has resonance for him, Redford says, because it marks the 
year he first arrived in New York at the age of 19 and became aware of the 
immense power of the new medium of television; in fact, he got his first acting 
break on a TV quiz show. 
</P>
<P>
 "That event set something in motion," Redford says of the scandal. "It 
provides a context to look at ourselves today and why we're now in a place of 
moral ambiguity and cynicism." 
</P>
<P>
 Director/producer Jon Avnet ("Fried Green Tomatoes") returns to another 
pivotal moment in our history, 1970, the height of the Vietnam War, to tell the 
story over children's battle for a tree house in Mississippi in "The War." The 
title is a metaphor for violence from a child's (Elijah Wood) point of view. 
Avnet acknowledges that the comedy-drama will need strong word-of-mouth to draw 
audiences in. Fortunately, "it has Costner" as the boy's Vietnam vet father 
"who teaches him what's worth fighting for." A star of Costner's magnitude, 
even in a supporting role, could bring attention to the film whose concept, 
like that of "Fried Green Tomatoes" "doesn't exactly reach out and grab people 
by the throat," Avnet says. In a League of Their Own 
</P>
<P>
 Director Michael Ritchie was adamant in insisting that his "The Scout," 
starring Albert Brooks and Brendan Fraser, is not a baseball movie. Since the 
start of the baseball strike, however, he's been telling people: "It's the 
movie to see if you miss the national pastime." There are no big games, he 
says, no villains, no underdogs in this movie based on a "classic unproduced 
script" by Andrew Bergman (rewritten by Brooks and Monica Johnson) about a 
down-and-out scout who discovers an idiosyncratic talent out in the boonies. 
Ritchie says he's not worried about anti-baseball backlash affecting the 
movie's commercial chances. "But you should call Albert and ask him if he's 
worried about opening against a Meryl Streep action picture," he said, 
referring to "The River Wild." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Scout" is straight down the middle compared to a curve ball like "Ed 
Wood." The plot -- which concerns a schlock-movie director (Johnny Depp) who is 
also a heterosexual transvestite -- is definitely not formulaic. Factor in too 
that it was directed by Tim Burton, the man who won audiences over to a 
teen-ager with pruning shears for hands ("Edward Scissorhands").  
</P>
<P>
 Producer Denise DiNovi calls "Ed Wood" "the weirdest 'Rocky' movie ever made." 
As with most Burton movies, DiNovi says, "it's about an outsider who wants 
desperately to be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a comedy, really," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly how producer Lawrence Bender describes "Pulp Fiction," the 
already widely praised new film from "Reservoir Dogs" director Quentin 
Tarantino. "It's not a comedy like 'Naked Gun,' " Bender says, "but you laugh a 
lot. It's an epic, bold movie." With a high body count. The multistory 
roundelay of murder, slapstick and verbal idiosyncrasies features an ensemble 
cast that includes John Travolta, Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson. "Pulp 
Fiction" has already won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and will open the New York 
Film Festival in late September. Action Central 
</P>
<P>
 The high-adrenaline crowd will have a chance to see Sylvester Stallone in a 
suit, Jean-Claude Van Damme in the future and Meryl Streep on a raft. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Luis Llosa describes "The Specialist" as a thriller with action, a 
different kind of Stallone movie, one with a strong female character, played by 
Sharon Stone. Stallone's blood-and-guts fans will not be disappointed, he 
promises, but there will be characters who are developed, who have 
psychological dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Damme's "Timecop," about time travel, was originally set for summer. It 
got pushed to September, he says "because Universal wasn't expecting this good 
a movie. So they held it." 
</P>
<P>
 Streep comes out swinging in "The River Wild," in which her character must 
scale the rapids to save her family. "It's not simply 'Meryl Streep as Bruce 
Willis,' " cautions director Curtis Hanson. Nor is it "a woman's movie," he 
says, any more than was his last suspense film, "The Hand That Rocks the 
Cradle." 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys who are threatened by a strong woman might think of it as a woman's 
movie," he says. "I think women will appreciate a movie of this size and scope 
with a woman at the heart of it. Usually in this kind of story she'd be in the 
background." Early Birds 
</P>
<P>
 If you have the "other" period thriller and the "other" Santa Claus movie, it 
helps to get a bead on the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 TriStar is opening "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," which stars Robert De Niro 
and Kenneth Branagh (who also directed), on Nov. 4, well in advance of this 
year's holiday releases, even though it is a prestige film that could have been 
expected to be opened over the holidays. One reason is to get a two-week jump 
on "Interview With the Vampire," the much talked-about screen version of Anne 
Rice's popular novel, starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know the Anne Rice novel," Branagh says, "but anybody would be 
interested in a Tom Cruise movie directed by Neil Jordan. Both are distinct," 
he says of the two movies, "and I hope both will be seen." The perfect 
diplomatic answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Branagh says that two years' work on the project has made him every bit as 
feverish about his creation as the character of Dr. Victor Frankenstein. He 
promises that De Niro's performance as the monster -- in which he reads from 
Goethe and Milton -- is "terrifying, but he also breaks your heart. He will 
absolutely make people forget Boris Karloff." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Allen hopes to appear so at home in "The Santa Clause" that people will 
forget it's his first starring role in a movie. It'll arrive right before the 
much more experienced John Hughes ("Home Alone") delivers his Santa Claus 
production "Miracle on 34th Street." But in addition to Kris Kringle, Allen's 
movie "involves sleighs, kids, reindeer, elves and a smart-ass like me," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 And if that's not enticement enough, he says: "This is the movie the North 
Pole doesn't want you to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever their relative merits, the fall releases will have to catch on fast 
and stay red hot if they hope to compete once the holiday stampede begins. 
During the final six weeks of the year, there'll be a crush of big films. 
</P>
<P>
 A partial list includes the aforementioned "Interview With the Vampire" and a 
new "Star Trek" entry called 'Star Trek: Generations." Family fare will include 
the "Miracle on 34th Street," "Jungle Book" and "Little Women" remakes and a 
big-screen version of the comic strip "Richie Rich." There'll be biographies of 
Dorothy Parker ("Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle," starring Jennifer Jason 
Leigh) and Ty Cobb ("Cobb," with Tommy Lee Jones). Robert Altman's ensemble 
comedy about fashion, "Pret-a-Porter" will debut. There'll also be romantic 
comedies such as "Speechless," with Michael Keaton and Geena Davis; "I.Q.," 
pairing Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins, and "Lifesavers," featuring Steve Martin and 
Madeline Kahn. Arnold Schwarzenegger will give birth to his comedy "Junior." 
And Michael Douglas will be raked over the coals by Demi Moore in the drama 
"Disclosure."

COVER STORY; TRUE TALES OF TV TRAUMA: 3 COMICS CHASE ROSEANNE-DOM; BRETT 
BUTLER; HOW HAS BUTLER HIT THE BIG TIME IN SUCH A SHORT TIME? SHE'S USED THE 
VERY SAME DEMONS SHE'S BEAT IN HER LIFE TO TOUCH AUDIENCES WITH HER HIT, 'GRACE 
UNDER FIRE.' BUT, WHAT ABOUT THAT NEW DEMON, STARDOM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Understand this and all the rest makes sense -- the tough-girl act, the 
weepingly devoted audiences, the whispered comparisons to Roseanne -- all of it 
because Brett Butler has what she calls "huge feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 And has them pretty much all the time. At least since she was a kid back in 
Alabama watching television and the other drama unfolding in her living room -- 
a real-life family feud, the kind that winds up with the cops outside and 
somebody heading for divorce court. Or in her own life as an alcoholic married 
to a mirror image of her dad, living in a trailer park and covered with 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now when Butler is on TV, the star of ABC's hit "Grace Under Fire," where 
she plays Grace Kelly, a working-class single mother with an abusive ex-husband 
-- a woman not unlike her own mother -- she still wrestles with those feelings. 
It's why she got into stand-up in the first place. Get on a stage and, in that 
syrupy, Dixie-by-way-of-Texas argot, make people laugh with stories ripped 
right from those feelings. Stories about her crummy ex-husband, competitive 
women, lunkhead rednecks. Mostly the rednecks, like that guy on the plane who 
just up and irritated Butler for no good reason, so she leaned forward and 
suggested that the only time he ever enjoyed, uhm, marital relations was to a 
refrain of "Daddy, don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Those kind of feelings. People ate it up. Except now it's different. Now she 
isn't one of a gazillion hopefuls grinding it out on the stand-up circuit. Now, 
she's on the cover of magazines, TV Guide to the tabloids. Now, she's got 
lawyers and managers and a public-relations team just to get through a week's 
worth of headlines unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most hideous things that have been done to me this year have been done by 
people who were smiling at me," she says, nodding at her publicist, stationed 
here in the otherwise amiable offices of her producer like a bailiff. "Now, I 
don't talk to anybody unless he's in the room." 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment, it looks as if Butler's huge feelings are going to hold sway 
despite objections from her interviewer. She doesn't call herself "Princess" 
for nothing, even if it is a joke. After all, one executive producer, Chuck 
Lorre, already bit the dust after crossing swords with her. Eventually a 
compromise is struck: Today's meeting with the press will be on her own while 
her publicist waits just outside the open door. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, for a minute anyway. "For Christ sake, it's not like I'm in here having 
my first Pap smear," Butler says, jumping up to slam the door, apparently 
embarrassed now by the arrangement. "I am a big girl, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, very big when you consider the kind of year Butler has had. Even 
before "Grace" had its premiere last September, analysts had picked the series 
as one of the few sure hits of last season. Taking its cues from ratings 
powerhouse "Roseanne" -- a tough-talking comedian and trailer-park realism -- 
"Grace" was clearly the new darling of ABC. It was airing in one of the most 
coveted time slots -- 9:30 p.m. Wednesdays right after the runaway hit show 
"Home Improvement." And it was the latest series from Carsey-Werner 
Productions, the fabled producing team of Tom Werner and Marcy Carsey, who had 
turned Bill Cosby and Roseanne into network gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after a year in which "Grace" fulfilled those early expectations, 
consistently landing among the week's Top 10 shows -- and ending the season in 
the No. 6 position -- the anticipation is that Butler is poised to make a 
similar leap. Earlier this summer, she won top honors at the annual People's 
Choice Awards. ABC, meanwhile, has already capitalized on her popularity, 
upping the series' ad rates to an average of $200,000 per 30-second spot. (The 
season's first show airs Sept. 20.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The single-mother show has been around since 'Julia,' " observes Ted Harbert, 
president of ABC Entertainment. "The success of 'Grace' has to do with Brett's 
own amazing personal appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as Mark Flanagan, the executive producer of "Grace," puts it, "Brett is the 
new franchise." 
</P>
<P>
 For Butler, the past year has been an only-in-Hollywood trajectory that has 
left the 36-year-old comedian wrestling with a whole new set of emotions, equal 
parts gratification and guilt over the sudden celebrity that has capped her 
12-year journey from that trailer park to the TV ratings charts. Not only has 
the past year left literal scars -- an on-again, off-again second marriage to 
Ken Zeigler, a contracts attorney and sometime jazz musician based in New York, 
and some much publicized breast implants Butler had done last Christmas as a 
gift to herself -- but she also has had many of her long-held opinions about 
women and fame ripped open. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know there are those female celebrities that you love to put a harder 
tack on -- like Diana Ross and Barbra Streisand. 'Get over yourself, honey.' 
Well, this year, I'm like, 'They're so misunderstood' -- except I would never 
endow a chair in human sexuality" -- as Streisand did at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real important for me to be here in life," she adds, raising her hand to 
chin-level. "Not too high and not too low. But with 'Grace,' I feel like I'm 
this hologram of fame. It's just how the light hits you and sometimes you start 
to think you're the one that's shining. But I'm just me and I'm flawed." 
</P>
<P>
 If the public has been quick to embrace Butler, flaws and all, Hollywood has 
been less sanguine. While executives at ABC and Carsey-Werner insist it is 
business as usual -- "I think more has been made of this because Brett is a 
woman," says Tom Werner -- Butler has earned a reputation as "the new Roseanne" 
for being temperamental and difficult. When Lorre, the creator and executive 
producer of "Grace," left the show last spring after reports of fractious 
disagreements with Butler, his departure was seen as eerily similar to creator 
Matt Williams' abrupt firing from "Roseanne" after its first season. And when 
"Grace," like "Roseanne," was largely stiffed in the Emmy nominations after its 
first season (getting only one, for guest star Diane Ladd), the perception 
seemed to exist in certain circles that Butler's success fell under the old saw 
involving sow's ears and silk purses. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's brusque; she's ballsy; she's trouble on the set," Butler says pointedly 
of herself. "She's also good at what she does and she's human too. Look, just 
because I haven't paid my dues here doesn't mean I haven't paid my dues. I've 
been a not-formally-educated, self-contained entertainment machine for years. 
And the thing is, I could walk away from all this." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the kind of in-your-face riposte that audiences, at least, have come to 
expect from the public Butler. And while she has proved herself equally tough 
in her off-stage dealings, Butler in person cuts a far more complex, even 
perplexing figure than the abused-wife survivor portrait the media has so far 
drawn. Despite the honeyed drawl and good ol' gal demeanor, Butler evinces an 
odd mix of braggadocio and insecurity, as if she is uncertain whether to be 
embarrassed or proud of her accomplishments. There is a watchfulness about her, 
an almost bewildered, childlike me-too-ness she adopts when talking about her 
life now.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am smart," she insists repeatedly, "and I deserve this" -- assertions that 
are just as likely to be followed by shrugging insouciance. "I hate all this 
dewy-eyed celebrity stuff," she adds. "Like 'My daddy touched me, so here's my 
new exercise bike.' Look, I did this Phyllis Diller-Fang thing about my 
ex-husband, so now I'm the poster child for the battered wife movement?" 
</P>
<P>
 Butler lets a scowl cross the face that would appear to have seen far more 
than her 36 years -- a face that seems caught in that apocalyptic moment when 
cheerleader pretty gives way to housewife fatigue. "But I guess that's what I'm 
here for, in a way," she says, adding almost as an afterthought, "and I'm not 
interested in biting the hand that feeds me." 
</P>
<P>
 That last issue seems most nettlesome to her now, why she has taken to calling 
herself "Princess" as a way to beat others to the punch line. "You know, nobody 
good ever resented me before," she says, sounding almost plaintive. "I know I'm 
a lot (to handle), but I'm not bad a lot. I'm just a lot, and I have these huge 
feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler sighs and seems to shake off her fears. "I went up to Tom (Werner) the 
other day and I said, 'You know what the neat part of all this is?' And he 
goes, 'No, Princess, what?' 'That I'm an interesting, complicated woman and 
people don't hate me yet.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A little past 7 on a hot Friday evening, the studio audience assembled in 
Stage 14 on the CBS lot in Studio City is restless. The taping of "Grace Under 
Fire" is still several minutes away and time is not passing quickly given the 
room's fitful air conditioning and the evening's warm-up act, a somewhat 
frantic Wendy Cole, who is attempting to fire up the crowd with such lines as 
"OK, who's here from out of town?" It isn't until Butler unexpectedly bounds 
down the aisle in what has become her own slightly unorthodox tradition of 
personally greeting the audience that the room comes alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a short, snug jeans dress -- "I'm a woman pushing 40 dressed in 
Sears Junior Miss," she jokes -- Butler launches into a fast, tight rendition 
of her stand-up routine that includes digs at her own upbringing ("I'm so 
Southern I'm related to myself"), Hollywood celebrities and Trish Halverson, 
Butler's composite portrait of repressed female executives ("Trish takes one 
look at me and says, 'Oh, you're so . . . so dressed like a whore' "). 
</P>
<P>
 It is a rather amazing performance in miniature -- 10 minutes that are hip, 
smart, funny and oddly populist all at once. The audience is literally reaching 
out to her when Butler, cannily checking her watch, says she'll take a couple 
of questions. A revival meeting would be less fervent with all the testimonials 
pummeling the air. "Do you realize," says one woman, her voice ringing out, 
"the impact you have had on other women?" 
</P>
<P>
 Realized and then some. A self-described "post-post-feminist" whose hackles 
are raised by any kind of oppression -- "It just surges up in me when I detect 
anything racist or homophobic" -- Butler came to prominence with a self-taught 
stand-up act that managed to pack a punch without over-reliance on the usual 
province of female comedians: tampon jokes and male-bashing, or what she calls 
"the tendency of women comics to act self-deprecating or promiscuous when they 
first get on stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Her performances, instead, were in the Southern narrative vein, rambling 
personal monologues laced with quirky observations and references to her own 
largely dysfunctional life -- her upbringing as the oldest of five daughters 
born in Alabama, raised in Georgia in a household that included two divorces, 
physical abuse and other alcohol-related problems. On her own at age 16, Butler 
found herself confronting her own bouts with alcohol as well as an abusive, 
trailer-park marriage to Charles Wilson, a steelworker whom she married when 
she was 20 (and who has publicly refused to confirm or deny her accusations). 
</P>
<P>
 "I come from a family where the humor was really dark," she recalls, "a house 
headed by interesting, intelligent, bohemian, minimally agnostic parents in the 
middle of the Bible Belt, where girls were either good or bad, where when I got 
married, everyone said, 'Sugar, you're finally settling down.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It was the gap she saw between that conventional life "and the feeling that I 
wasn't good enough to lead that life" that Butler says drove her to the brink 
of despair. "I knew I was going to die," she says of those alcohol-laced years. 
When she finished high school with night classes, stumbled through a semester 
at the University of Georgia, and fell into and out of her marriage to Wilson. 
"I wrestled with a lot of inconsistencies in my life and then I found comedy. 
You know, the ability to yell out 'Screw you' and be liked at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 It went down like gangbusters, and with men as well as women, first in the 
honky-tonks of Texas and the clubs of Atlanta, eventually on stage in New York 
and Los Angeles. For however autobiographical her act, Butler was canny enough 
not to lick her wounds in public. "I married a man who beat me," she says. "I 
took the blame and I took the credit." Her humor, she realized, had less to do 
with a polarizing feminism than the kind of anger evinced by such comedians as 
Richard Pryor and Lenny Bruce. "Here I was this Southern white chick, but I 
realized that my humor was like urban minority comics," she says, "the humor of 
the oppressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone saw it that way. In 1984, when a 26-year-old Butler arrived in 
Manhattan with $200 in her pocket and a reputation that stopped at Atlanta, the 
world of stand-up comedy was still very much "a strident, quota-oriented boys 
club where I got a lot of jobs just because I was a woman," she recalls. But 
her unconventionality also cost her. Several owners of the most prestigious 
clubs refused to book her, claiming that her act was too hostile. A six-month 
foray to Los Angeles in 1987, where she worked briefly as a writer on "The 
Dolly Parton Show" and as a contestant on "Hollywood Squares," led nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare act of concession, Butler bleached her naturally brown hair after it 
was suggested that she would have greater license on stage as a blonde.  
</P>
<P>
 "Brett was a lot more ballsy than anybody I had ever seen," says Jamie Masada, 
owner of the Laugh Factory and one of the few who booked Butler in Los Angeles. 
"Here was this woman who was so open and honest about any subject, it was 
really unique." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not one of these people who thinks a joke has to be politically correct 
anymore," says Butler. "If you've got a point of view and you know something is 
humorous, just say it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was exactly the kind of spiritedness that Carsey-Werner wanted in the star 
of a new pilot about a single mother. Looking to mine the blue-collar realism 
pioneered by "Roseanne," ABC executives had two years ago asked the producing 
duo to develop a series about a working-class single mother. "It was jokingly 
titled 'Life Sucks and Then You Die,' " recalls Lorre, a veteran writer of 
"Roseanne" who had been tapped to create the new series. "It was to be this 
story of a comedically heroic woman and the obstacles she faces just getting 
through the day." 
</P>
<P>
 After Carsey-Werner's David Tochterman scouted Butler in New York, she was 
flown out to shoot the pilot in the spring of 1992. She got the nod from both 
the network and the producers "because she is tough, funny, uncompromising and 
has an amazing talent for getting an audience in the palm of her hand," says 
Werner. 
</P>
<P>
 For Butler, the opportunity to star in her own television show was not only 
the realization of any comic's dream but also an end to the more than 10 years 
she had spent on the road. "Anybody can go up on a second show on a Friday 
night and rip a room for 45 minutes," she says. "I've done that and I know any 
comic can. Stand-up was starting to feel hollow." 
</P>
<P>
 She was also wooed by the fact that "Grace" was "about something" -- namely an 
intelligent, skilled, working-class woman who's had some hard knocks in life. 
"This isn't just making Tuna Helper on TV," says Butler. "I'm always amused by 
the people who say, 'I just love it that she's so intelligent and working 
class.' There's a lot of intelligent poor people. It's not always some 
self-defeating economic mechanism." 
</P>
<P>
 And from the very first, Butler urged the show's creators to move into bolder, 
less predictable story lines. "I was inspired by the kind of risks Roseanne 
took in her show, and so I begged them to make Grace more flawed and the show 
even more reality-based," says Butler, who was on the show's writers from the 
very first episode, when she buttonholed Marcy Carsey to complain about some 
excessively scatological humor. Subsequent disagreements flared over issues big 
and small, from story lines such as a potential romance between Grace and 
Russell (played by actor Dave Thomas) that Butler found improbable to "fat 
jokes" that she found insulting and sophomoric. By mid-season there was the 
inevitable showdown that resulted in Lorre's departure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brett was very unhappy and I asked them to let me leave," says Lorre, who 
remains a creative consultant on "Grace" while he develops a new series for 
Cybill Shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
 When Flanagan, a former producer on Fox's "Tracey Ullman Show" and CBS' "Love 
& War," was brought on board as the show's new executive producer, Butler was 
given the additional title of executive creative consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to be the hallmark of a Carsey-Werner show that you have this 
outsize personality and fashion a show around their talents," says Flanagan. 
"And Brett is mercurial, so there was a certain amount of reparation that 
needed to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we tried something and sometimes it worked and sometimes it 
didn't," Werner adds cautiously. "Now, everyone pitches their ideas to Mark, 
and some of Brett's ideas make it and some don't, but I think she understands 
the process." 
</P>
<P>
 And by all accounts Butler has been appeased by the arrival of Flanagan and 
his new creative team. "I told Mark that I'm really intense but I'm not unfair, 
that I'm opinionated but I am willing to be more diplomatic," says Butler, 
"because I deserve this, the chance to create something good with people who 
are not insane or mean." 
</P>
<P>
 Already Flanagan has begun repositioning the series -- which includes some 
cast changes including the addition of Paul Dooley as Grace's new boss -- to 
include Butler's suggestions for grittier episodes that address such social 
issues as sexual harassment and latchkey children. He is also working with the 
writers to hone the show's dramaturgy, introducing new characters and more 
sharply defining existing ones. "The second season will be more Grace under 
more fire," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, executives at Carsey-Werner and ABC are taking a carefully 
optimistic attitude toward the show's second season. "It's a much more fragile 
situation than 'Roseanne' was at the start of its second year," says one close 
observer. And ABC's decision to keep "Grace" paired with "Home Improvement" in 
its switch to Tuesday nights can be interpreted as both a vote of confidence as 
well as concern. "I like owning that hour," says ABC program chief Harbert. 
"But we've also got a new creative team and I need to give them time to shake 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, Butler will be as much a part of that process as she can 
be, refusing agents' proposals of possible film roles to concentrate on the 
task at hand. "I got these guys coming up to me and I say, 'What do you want me 
to be? Betty Rubble? I mean, God love Rosie (O'Donnell), but doing a sitcom is 
the most deluded thing I will ever do because I know I can go to Arizona and 
wait tables. I can do something else -- this was about the getting of it, 
that's what I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Already she has modified her goals. Next summer, instead of touring her act on 
the road, Butler plans to take a respite from Hollywood to finish the book she 
has promised her publisher, a memoir based on a one-woman show she wrote for 
herself several years ago. "This is not a book like 'SeinLanguage' about the 
wacky way I look at life," Butler says, rattling off the first sentence. " 'I 
spent the first 20 years of my life waiting for two men that I was reasonably 
certain would never come back -- my daddy and Jesus Christ.' " It is, she adds, 
the kind of personal, even painful self-analysis that "you can't do on stage 
but only on paper." 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been something screwy about me and guys all my life," she says, 
suddenly introspective. "My dad left when I was 4 and I never had a father 
growing up. I was reading self-help books when I was 11, trying to fill up that 
hole in the middle of me, which is why I think I drank." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler pauses and gazes out the window at the sound stages. "Sometimes it's 
very difficult not to look at performing as some kind of emotional weakness 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 So she will become a writer, teaching herself the way she taught herself 
comedy, by reading the great books -- Shakespeare, Tennyson and the like -- and 
by listening to the great operas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of like a closet opera fan," Butler says. "I don't know what it 
means but I like the diva-ness of it. I think it's a throwback to that big 
geeky girl who never fit in and who always wondered what she was missing 
because she didn't finish college or go into the corporate world." 
</P>
<P>
 She suddenly thrusts her hands in the air. "I'm huge," she says. "I have huge 
hands, like from some fastidious transvestite. I tell my friends, 'Wouldn't it 
be great to be an opera queen, just to be this huge person who gets to yell on 
stage?' " She pauses one last time. "Well, I act like one anyway; I just wear 
blue jeans and work on a sitcom." Vital Stats

 Ellen DeGeneres on "These Friends of Mine," the original title of her TV 
series: "It was bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen DeGeneres on her show's initial opening title sequence, in which she and 
those friends of hers cavorted in the desert and did leg-kicks: "Everyone hated 
that. . . . (Shooting) it was a hellacious time. . . . I don't know where that 
came from, I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen DeGeneres on two mystery episodes that will not run: "They were just 
bad. Bad ideas, bad. . . . ABC paid a lot of money for them, but I begged them 
not to run them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen DeGeneres on some of the episodes that did run: "It's like having a 
photo of you that you hate and the whole world is out there looking at it 
going, 'God, that's hideous.' And you think, 'I know it is; so why are you 
looking at it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to believe she's talking about a hit show, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 DeGeneres' show was an instant ratings smash as a replacement series this 
spring, and it enters its sophomore season -- retitled "Ellen" at the behest of 
the network -- in a plum position, following "Roseanne" on Wednesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, DeGeneres, whose first act as a stand-up comic 14 years back 
consisted mainly of munching on a Whopper, has now become, more or less, the 
symbol of a network: ABC has announced that she will be the network's 
spokeswoman in radio ads and on-air promos, personally introducing the debut of 
every show in ABC's lineup this fall -- an almost unprecedented vote of 
confidence. She's also co-hosting the Emmy Awards telecast on ABC Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet ABC held the series back more than a year after the first episodes were 
taped. And in its earlier incarnation, "These Friends of Mine" was a textbook 
case of how even the engine that powers the machine has no control over the 
steering wheel. Staff defections, critical jabs, a brief production shutdown to 
regain creative focus, and DeGeneres' own dissatisfaction with some of the 
writing made the program's success less sweet than it should have been. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "As in any business, there are creative, talented people and then there are 
people who could have been working at IBM, but they're working at a studio 
instead, and people who have no idea what the creative side is, they just look 
at the business side," DeGeneres observes. "That's frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though significant moves were taken during the show's hiatus to ensure 
that everyone concerned was on the same page artistically, the recent departure 
of executive producer Wendy Goldman after only 10 weeks on the job suggests 
there may be a few more kinks to be ironed out. 
</P>
<P>
 DeGeneres, who mirrors her TV character, Ellen Morgan, in her 
look-on-the-bright-side demeanor and eager-to-please friendliness, casts the 
negatives in an upbeat light. "Even if it's bad, and it hurts, at least you're 
now somebody to talk about," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the creative struggle now, ABC has really just taken control of the 
ship and said where it's going. They said: 'It's going to be called "Ellen," 
and it's going to be more about Ellen.' It wasn't even me standing up and 
saying things should change." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney, the show's production house, "didn't want to call the show 'Ellen,' " 
DeGeneres says. "They had a rule: They didn't want to call a show by the star's 
name. We asked many, many times. 'Couch People' was one of the suggested names 
for the show, and we were, 'Omigod! Why would anyone want to watch a show 
called "Couch People"?' " 
</P>
<P>
 When DeGeneres signed on for the series, she says, executive producers Neil 
Marlens and Carol Black "really had all the clout," but following internal 
disagreements regarding the direction of the program, they left after a handful 
of episodes. Many critics dismissed the show as "Seinfeld Lite," and more, who 
were fans of DeGeneres, responded as your parents might -- they weren't mad, 
just disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Without an executive producer who truly understood and appreciated DeGeneres' 
own distinctive comic sensibilities, as Larry David does with Jerry Seinfeld, 
her perspective was submerged, and the show was less sophisticated and more 
risque than her stand-up persona (the pilot tried to eke laughs out of a 
character who barked like a dog during sex). 
</P>
<P>
 "What ultimately people were saying was, 'How come the show is not what you 
do?' " DeGeneres concedes. "That's because I didn't have a Larry David. . . . 
If someone's trying to create a show for you, unless they've been your writing 
partner for the whole 14 years, they can try and they can come really close, 
but that's why no one's written for me in the past 14 years, because I write 
the best for myself. They tried, they gave it a good shot, and these producers 
are trying, they're getting closer, and they're seeing more what they can do. 
And eventually they're going to hit the bull's-eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem, perhaps, was that DeGeneres was so happy just having her 
own show that she was too willing to please others and didn't assert her own 
vision -- in other words, a rare case of a star not having enough ego. "I felt 
I was the lucky one," she says. "They were giving me this wonderful break. I've 
learned that I have a large part to do with the show and I should speak up and 
say, 'This is not what I would want to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 David Rosenthal, who wrote for "Laurie Hill," an earlier series on which 
DeGeneres co-starred, and a co-creator and executive producer of "Ellen," adds: 
"Unfortunately, we didn't have the benefit of being on the air when shooting 
those first shows. There was more than a year between taping the shows and 
their airing. That's a lot of time to go without audience feedback. The 
criticism came in a vacuum. There was no public response." 
</P>
<P>
 When "Ellen" returns Sept. 21, last season's clunky title and the cloying 
title sequence will be gone, as will actress Holly Fulger. (Another actress, 
Maggie Wheeler, left after the first six episodes.) Joely Fisher joins the cast 
as Paige, Ellen's childhood chum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holly is a wonderful actress, but ultimately the problem was she projected a 
real vulnerability, which is what Ellen does as well, and they stepped on each 
other," Rosenthal explains. "Paige has more of an edge, a tougher, bolder side. 
She's more act-now-think-later." 
</P>
<P>
 Adam (Arye Gross), Ellen's platonic roommate, will return, but sans goatee and 
his more weaselly impulses. Adam didn't test all that well with audiences, 
Rosenthal explains, "so we cleaned him up, made him a little sweeter." 
</P>
<P>
 Mainly, though, "Ellen" will focus on Ellen, particularly her talent for 
talking her way into and out of uncomfortable situations. "My feeling is, Ellen 
is the funniest person in the room -- it would be foolish not to listen to 
her," Rosenthal says. 
</P>
<P>
 In Studio 3 on the Disney lot in Burbank, DeGeneres is rehearsing a scene in 
which Ellen Morgan visits her dentist, a handsome gent she just happens to have 
a crush on. DeGeneres, wearing a "Late Show With David Letterman" T-shirt and 
sweat pants, lets loose with her beaming, appealingly childlike smile as she 
begins playing with the dentist's chair. She hits a button once, it whirs and 
elevates her; hits it again, it whirs her back down. She hits the buttons so 
that the chair undulates up and down as quickly as it can, but still at a 
soporific pace, and, ad-libbing, throws an arm upward, like a suburban cowgirl 
atop the kind of dull, listless mechanical bull that lawyers would have 
designed in order to avoid lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, DeGeneres' bumpy ride through the world of network television has 
gotten smoother. The episode's centerpiece is a sequence in which Ellen, under 
the influence of nitrous oxide, flirts shamelessly and humiliatingly with her 
dentist. "If I had a scene like this in every show, I'd be ecstatic," DeGeneres 
says. "It's, 'You're attracted to this guy, you're on nitrous: Go.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, none of this might have happened had DeGeneres not become so 
disillusioned with stand-up. After laboring long years to create a unique comic 
persona that, she says, revealed and distorted "all sides of me to form a 
sneeze guard to protect me from the public," she got burned out about five 
years ago, weary of having to compete with slick yet lame wanna-bes and 
opportunists who stole her material. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started on the road and somebody on the plane would ask me what 
I did and I'd say, 'I'm a comedian,' they'd look at me like I was a gunslinger. 
That was weird. Then it got to the point where saying 'I'm a comedian' was like 
saying, 'I'm an attorney'. . . . It got to the point where I hated saying I was 
a comedian." 
</P>
<P>
 Cable TV helped destroy the integrity of stand-up, she says. "Everybody 
suddenly realized: 'We can have a half-hour program, and you don't have to pay 
actors huge sums of money. You have a set that's a brick wall. And put up five 
people, pay 'em scale and you own 'em forever. You get different guys every 
week, and you have a show.' All of a sudden, you started running out of good 
comedians and anybody got on television." 
</P>
<P>
 On her farewell tour, however, she regained a smidgen of appreciation for what 
she had done all those years. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a show, I usually just kind of say thank you and leave, but in New 
York, I just kind of watched everybody stand up and listened to the applause 
for the first time in a long time, because you get so used to that," she 
recalls. "And it really kind of -- I let it in. It was weird. I was thinking, 
'This is a really nice thing that not too many people get to experience,' and 
here I was taking it for granted for so long." 
</P>
<P>
 Though her series is only entering its second season, DeGeneres is already 
looking forward to a time when she'll no longer do TV. Call it the David Caruso 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be 50 years old going 'Aaaaaugh!' You see those people on the 
talk shows and they have the one catch phrase and they do it and the audience 
goes crazy," she says, the distaste of the idea apparent on her face. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so uncomfortable. You watch 'I Love Lucy,' which is wonderful, then you 
see 'The Lucy Show,' and you're just cringing. Somebody should've stopped her. 
Somebody should've said, 'Don't do TV anymore.' " Vital Stats

TO PLAY BESIDES THE 'ALL-AMERICAN GIRL.' CHO IS HOPING TO BE A GROUNDBREAKER.

 It is midafternoon, and Margaret Cho, a 25-year-old Korean American stand-up 
comedian, is sitting on a couch in a quiet cafe on Beverly Boulevard, 
contemplating the scrutiny that her new ABC comedy series is bound to get when 
it makes its debut Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The half-hour show is, rather pointedly, entitled "All-American Girl," and, 
depending on how it is received, could be a significant breakthrough for 
minorities on network television. Asian Americans have not been entirely 
invisible as regulars on TV series -- one of the most popular was the late Jack 
Soo, who played a detective on "Barney Miller" -- but they have most certainly 
been in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Cho's series, which not only is built almost entirely around Asian 
Americans but also deals -- in a sitcom way, of course -- with the social and 
cultural gap between more traditional elders and their offspring. The principal 
offspring in this case, naturally, is Cho, a San Franciscan who says that much 
of the show is based on her relationship with her more tradition-oriented 
family -- material that she has employed as a comedian. 
</P>
<P>
 Is she sick and tired of repeatedly being asked about her upcoming TV image as 
a role model for Asian Americans? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, not at all," she says. "I think that's my whole purpose now." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the wide variety of the Asian American population, an attempted 
breakthrough in any minority area is nonetheless a step worth watching as 
prime-time network television tries to come to grips in a popular way with the 
nation's evolving multicultural society. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great position to be in," Cho says of her series, "because I 
don't have to necessarily follow anyone's lead. I can kind of break ground and 
create my own niche in this industry. And because of my ethnicity and my gender 
and my youth, I think it's easier for me in a lot of ways, because in this 
business, one of the great things is that if you stand out, it's a real 
advantage. And I do that by virtue of who I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the stand-up comedy she's been doing since she was 18, Cho says 
audience reaction has been "positive, in that I have a different perspective to 
offer, a different story to tell. Nowadays there are so many stand-up comedians 
and stand-up comedy is so readily accessible on TV, on cable, in clubs, it's 
almost like there's too much of it around. Oftentimes, you hear the same things 
over and over. 
</P>
<P>
 "And since I talk about my life as a young Asian woman, I offer something 
different to this already overcrowded market. So I became in demand, actually 
very quickly. I got work right away in San Francisco, nightclubs around the 
area, just because club owners wanted to put people on and see different 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sept. 14 debut of "All-American Girl" at 9:30 p.m. will get a potent 
lead-in from the final Wednesday appearance of "Home Improvement," which then 
switches to Tuesdays. After its launch, the Cho series will move to its regular 
8:30 p.m. slot, where it will precede "Roseanne," newly moved to Wednesdays. 
ABC is counting heavily on "All-American Girl" to help maintain the new 
Wednesday comedy block, which also includes "Ellen" and "Thunder Alley." 
</P>
<P>
 But "All-American Girl" will have to go head-to-head with two high-profile 
competing network series, Fox's "Beverly Hills, 90210" and NBC's new hourlong 
drama "The Cosby Mysteries," starring Bill Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, however, Cho is relishing her opportunity and her apparent 
advance clout at ABC; in the pilot episode of "All-American Girl," she even has 
a personal billboard credit stating that the material is derived from her 
stand-up routine. 
</P>
<P>
 She admits, however, that while she was building her reputation on the 
stand-up circuit -- and in film and television appearances -- she and her 
father did not always see eye-to-eye on what was funny. Elaborating on past 
acknowledgment of their differences, she notes that he also writes comedy 
material: 
</P>
<P>
 "He wrote a joke book. It's kind of like 101 jokes for speakers. It's a 
toastmaster-style book. He does a lot of different work. And he writes columns 
for a couple of different papers in Korea. There's a lot of political satire, 
social satire. He's a humorist, but I don't necessarily find it funny. Comedy 
is so relative to culture, and his culture is so different from mine that we 
don't really understand each other. His jokes are based on the way that Koreans 
are and tradition and myth and social structure -- things that I just don't 
understand at all because I don't live there and never have. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I guess he doesn't really understand what I do because what I do is very 
modern, very pop America. He just doesn't understand that. He doesn't 
understand MTV or rock music or the latest fashions. He just doesn't get things 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
 H ave things changed as her work has succeeded? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. Actually, in a lot of his columns he's writing about me and the show, 
and about how I came to be how I am and his relationship with me. So he's 
really excited about everything that's happening and really glad for me. He's 
always been supportive, but we just don't really understand each other's work." 
</P>
<P>
 Cho also elaborates on remarks she has made about the rough time she has given 
those who now claim to be friends after being "mean to me" in school: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's because I am so immature and so vindictive that I won't let go of any 
petty slights. That's my fault. I was such a terrible misfit in school -- shy 
and awkward and never good at making friends. None of my childhood friends were 
ever really friends. They were really mean to me, and I just think it's so 
ironic that they all come to my shows now and act like we're such great 
friends. And I have no ability to let go of my anger enough to embrace them. 
I'm just very cold and mean and it's so stupid, but I can't help it." 
</P>
<P>
 Does she feel less vindictive now with major success? 
</P>
<P>
 "No. I still have that in me. I can't let it go. But, you know, I try. At 
least I acknowledge it. That's the first step." 
</P>
<P>
 A s for "All-American Girl," be ing produced at Disney Stu dios, Cho says it 
is about "two basic things: It's about me having these two families that I 
don't exactly relate to -- my family at home, my biological family, who are 
very traditional, kind of strict and a very Asian, very Korean family. And they 
don't understand me because I'm just too wild and too Americanized. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then there's my family of friends who understand me but find me a little 
bit conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I'm in between these kind of two extreme cultures. It's something I think 
a lot of Asian Americans go through because many live at home in a more 
controlled environment and then they go out or watch TV and they're exposed to 
this whole other world. (The series) is exploring the feelings associated with 
assimilation and becoming an American." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, says Cho, the series "has parallels to shows that are about the 
generation gap, like 'Happy Days,' which I was very fond of." 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe a touch of "That Girl" too? 
</P>
<P>
 "Just a little bit -- yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the subject of her series, are there Asian American writers on the 
staff? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. Two are Asian American women." 
</P>
<P>
 In private life, Cho, who is single, is also stepping out on her own since the 
series has started to take shape. After sharing a house in the Hollywood Hills 
with four show business colleagues -- three women and a man -- she recently 
moved out and into a home of her own. It's also in the Hollywood Hills, and she 
says: "It's a big jump. It's a bungalow, a hideaway, the house I always wanted. 
I've never lived by myself before." 
</P>
<P>
 Of living with her previous roommates, she says: "They were all, like, 
stand-up comedians and musicians and actors, and we were all working all over 
the country all the time. It was very rare for all of us to be home at the same 
time. So it was very easy to live. It was like a youth hostel or a 
bed-and-breakfast. But then I started really working on the series, and I 
needed something quieter and more secluded because you get a little 
overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents, too, are a bit overwhelmed, says Cho: "They saw the pilot and 
were absolutely speechless. I guess it's a combination of intense pride and joy 
and also maybe astonishment that this show is about my relationship with them."

JAZZ; A REAL JAZZ COMMUNITY; THE CRENSHAW DISTRICT'S REPUTATION IS GROWING AS A 
NUCLEUS FOR CLUBS THAT ARE NURTURING MUSICIANS AND DRAWING SOME OF THE BIGGEST 
ARTISTS IN THE BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Josef Woodard, Josef Woodard is a free-lance writer and a frequent 
contributor to The Times' Ventura County edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a recent holiday weekend, there was a palpable buzz around the World Stage, 
one of the most modestly scaled but huge-hearted places in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, it was the fifth anniversary of the grass-roots jazz 
headquarters in the Crenshaw District, a validation of both the survival 
instinct and the community need for the workshop-performance space. 
</P>
<P>
 For another thing, the boss was in the house, putting forth the kind of 
charismatic rhythmic force on drums that could only mean that Billy Higgins was 
at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Often called the most recorded drummer in jazz history, the understated 
Higgins issues his friendly pulse, his warm flowing sense of swing, and solos 
of raw beauty and easy wit, solos that surprise and delight. A full house of 
listeners squirmed on their folding chairs and hooted out support, riff by 
riff, tapping into the electricity in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 On this night, Higgins had recently returned from a long road trip with one of 
his regular employers, pianist Cedar Walton. 
</P>
<P>
 Higgins made a few well-placed phone calls to get a few friends -- some of the 
finest jazz players around -- to make the gig, including tenor saxophonist 
Harold Land, trumpeter Oscar Brashear and trombonist George Bohannon. They 
chased down some loose versions of " 'Round Midnight" and "Rhythm-a-Ning," with 
extra-fiery solos implying that there was a cause at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hero of the night was, undoubtedly, Higgins, the lanky, beaming jazz 
icon who co-founded the World Stage with poet-activist Kamau Daa-ood. Higgins 
continues to drum up support to continue its evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 After a hot set, Higgins told the crowd, "We have a unique situation going on 
here. There's no place like this in the United States that I know of. A lot of 
people in strange countries know about this place. It's gettin' famous." 
</P>
<P>
 As drummers go, Higgins' vision is not about flailing limbs or aggressive 
tactics on his instrument, but taste and subtlety. The same could be said of 
his approach to community activism, one not of militancy but a desire to 
nurture. 
</P>
<P>
 Also playing on that anniversary weekend were local veterans and young bloods 
alike: pianist Horace Tapscott, a stalwart figure in jazz life in inner-city 
Los Angeles, who was there at the very beginning of the World Stage, and 
Black/Note, the young quintet that has made a steady ascent from its origins at 
the World Stage to its recent debut on Columbia Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Black/Note's Columbia coup serves as testament to the validity of the World 
Stage experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did great," Higgins said. "That was our aim: to get young artists out 
and let them know about the business and be exposed to other things. They 
really are serious young guys, as are the guys in B Sharp Quartet," Higgins 
said, referring to another World Stage-nurtured group that recently released 
its first CD. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like that," Higgins said, commenting on the seriousness to which the 
two groups approach their music. "They come along great and they're going to be 
all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the admiration is mutual. Black/Note bassist Mark Shelby 
said: "We all really look up to Billy Higgins for inspiration. He's open, he's 
encouraging. Even though he is who he is, he's still down-to-earth and humble. 
He's someone who really puts his money where his mouth is." 
</P>
<P>
 Higgins' cachet in the jazz world has helped lure stellar guests such as Elvin 
Jones, Max Roach, Pharaoh Sanders, Roy Hargrove, Ron Carter and Geri Allen to 
the World Stage for impromptu workshops. During the week, the storefront hosts 
instrumental and vocal workshops, a popular poetry workshop on Wednesdays and 
the all-important jam session every Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a storefront church," said D. J. Riley, a supporter of the World 
Stage who has watched its growth. "If you didn't know it, you wouldn't know how 
important the World Stage is." 
</P>
<P>
 And the World Stage is not alone in its mission to spread the jazz gospel. 
</P>
<P>
 From all appearances, you might think that this small area adjacent to Leimert 
Park was the cradle of a bona fide scene, a rare case of concentrated cultural 
energy in a city given to sprawl and diffusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Just around the corner from the World Stage is the coffeehouse known as 5th 
St. Dick's on 43rd Street, started by Richard Fulton two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Fulton's first customers were National Guardsmen brought in to quell 
the unrest in the wake of verdicts in the first Rodney G. King beating trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the World Stage and 5th St. Dick's keep the block awash in the sound of 
jazz. And 5th St. Dick's presents jazz every night of the week, as well as 
after-hours jam sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting more exposure, little by little," Willie Jones III, drummer for 
the group Black/Note, said of the Leimert Park scene, "but, for the most part, 
it's been pretty underground. It doesn't get the same type of exposure in the 
paper as Catalina's or the Bel Age or Chadney's -- mainstream clubs. But all 
the guys who are serious, young and old, know about it. It's a serious vibe 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, a serious vibe surrounds Black/Note, which has essentially evolved 
in public and set an example for young straight-ahead jazz in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 This band -- composed of twentysomething players -- found a home and spawning 
grounds at the World Stage. Shelby founded the group after meeting original 
trumpeter Richard Grant at a World Stage jam in 1990. Jones, pianist Ark Sano 
and alto saxophonist James Mahone came on board, and Black/Note was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "The World Stage was definitely our place where we were able to hide and work 
on our stuff," Shelby said in a late morning interview at a Hollywood 
coffeehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows? If that place wasn't there, we probably wouldn't be sitting here 
talking to you. The whole group pretty much formed there and that's where we 
rehearsed. A lot of good things came out of that place. That's where we 
woodshedded for months, before we started gigging." 
</P>
<P>
 The group took a big leap forward in 1991 when they released a CD, "43rd and 
Degnan," on the World Stage label. But along the way, they lost Grant, who 
moved back east to go school at Rutgers. Mexico-born, Fresno-raised trumpeter 
Gilbert Castellanos was enlisted, adding to the multicultural mix of the band. 
</P>
<P>
 More and better local gigs surfaced in various parts of the city. But the band 
still gravitates toward the spaces of old. 
</P>
<P>
 Black/Note's saga is one of many with a link to the Marsalis brood. Branford 
Marsalis and other members of "The Tonight Show" band have been known to jam in 
the Leimert Park scene, and it was trombonist Delfeayo Marsalis who passed a 
copy of their demo tape to Dr. George Butler, Columbia's jazz head. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, suitably impressed, signed them, and the band recorded last November, 
occasionally supplemented with tenor saxophonist Phil Vieux (another World 
Stage/5th St. Dick's regular). 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-bop-minded music of the group crosses generational lines in terms of 
its appeal. In the end, Black/Note's arrival is less a fluke than a signpost of 
ongoing jazz evolution in inner-city Los Angeles. All it took was a venue or 
two to reignite the scene. And some energy. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial energy for the transformation came from Daa-ood, a tall man with a 
goatee and large warm eyes. In an office above his Final Vinyl Records -- a 
repository of old, classic jazz and soul records nestled between the World 
Stage and 5th St. Dick's -- Daa-ood talked about the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Live music was really the hook for this area," Daa-ood said. "It was a 
catalyst to speed up the whole process of making this a vital area. Then, when 
Richard Fulton came on board with 5th St. Dick's, that just made it all more 
powerful. It was actually a place where musicians could jam and young musicians 
could meet older musicians. There was actually a place like that, in this 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a given Saturday night here at 3 o'clock in the morning, you will find 
people from all over Los Angeles. Some people drive from the Valley to get here 
. . . . It's a cross-cultural mix. People are hungry to feel alive. The music 
does that. It allows us to feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Daa-ood got the notion for the World Stage after another similar space in the 
neighborhood, Artworks Four, folded. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummer Carl Burnett had operated that space, but frequent road trips with the 
likes of Freddie Hubbard and Horace Silver forced him to close. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw music and poetry in that empty space," Daa-ood recalled. He culled 
$3,000 from a small collective of people, including Higgins, to pay for first 
and last month's rent. In a case of literal continuance, Daa-ood salvaged the 
chairs and stage from Burnett's operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Daa-ood recalls, "The first concert I remember was with Billy Higgins and 
Horace Tapscott. They were just warming up the space. It was just an improv, 
but it set the tone for things to come." 
</P>
<P>
 By his account, Daa-ood has been involved in local grass-roots efforts in Los 
Angeles for the past 25 years, in such organizations as the Watts Writer's 
Workshop and Horace Tapscott's Pan-Afrikan Orchestra, as the "word musician." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the transformative power of the arts," he says, "because I've seen 
that in my own life. I know how important it is for there to be a space within 
the community where artists can gather, and also a space within the community 
where the artist meets the community and shares its wares. Basically, that was 
the concept involved. It's never been a profit-making venture. It's basically 
been a labor of love and, also, I guess I should say, a labor of necessity. 
It's working." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing comparisons with New York loft/performance rooms run by Ornette 
Coleman, Sam Rivers, Barry Harris and others, Daa-ood commented, "The concept 
of taking a small space and turning it into a performance area and workshop 
space is not new. It's a viable concept that has not been explored in the way 
that it could be, because of the need. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's really a need for people to have alternative spaces to experience 
different aspects of their lives and culture and art. The culture and art are 
so rich and so deep, and it puts us in touch with some very important things 
that are inside ourselves that our everyday routines don't seem to fulfill." 
</P>
<P>
 Higgins amplified this theme in a later conversation recalling his experiences 
in New York. " . . . They had a few places in the Village, coffeehouses where 
you go play all the time. They had a place called the White Wheel, and a lot of 
people used to come and play in there, but there was no place where it was this 
wide a situation. This whole block is great. I feel good about being here. 
Everybody in the block are friends and they're tight." 
</P>
<P>
 Did they intentionally avoid creating a typical nightclub scene? 
</P>
<P>
 "A nightclub is all right, you know," Higgins said. "But you don't really get 
to serve the community as well. I figure there will always be clubs around. 
Right around the corner, there is 5th St. Dick's nightclub, so we're like the 
hothouse, you know. This is a place where people can come and get their scene 
together. Then on Friday and Saturday nights, people come and play and then 
play around the corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Another avenue of expression is through distributing recordings. Dennis 
Sullivan, an independent producer, got involved in forming the World Stage 
label, which enjoyed respectable success with its first release, Black/Note's 
"43rd and Degnan." Now, the World Stage label is run by Shelby and Willie Jones 
III. This spring the label put out its second project, "Judgment," by Robert 
Stewart, a Bay Area-based tenor saxophonist. On that session Stewart was backed 
up by pianist Eric Reed, bassist Mark Shelby and, inevitably, Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is not only in the recording studio that Higgins provides support. He 
is the one who provides the financial safety net when the space can't make ends 
meet at the end of a given month. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan commented that "part of the problem is that so much of the 
responsibility falls on Billy. In spite of it being a great idea, too much is 
falling on a few individuals. The government or the city needs to supplement 
these types of groups or organizations." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a feeling afoot that the World Stage is ready to take a step forward 
in its support system, to seek outside help from grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Muhammad, the World Stage manager, noted that "one thing we're kicking 
around now is how we can do whatever it takes to organize to the point where we 
can go nonprofit and see if we can't go to the city for grants. It's sort of a 
Catch-22. We don't have the funds to put that kind of operation into place, and 
grant money would do that for us. On the other hand, you have to have that 
(operation) organized in order to get a grant." 
</P>
<P>
 One implicit mission at the World Stage is to keep jazz alive in the area, an 
area which has produced a number of jazz greats -- Charles Mingus and Higgins, 
among them -- but has had trouble maintaining a live jazz scene. Higgins is one 
musician who has opted to live in his hometown and lend a hand to its cultural 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Los Angeles on Oct. 11, 1936, Higgins worked in the area until 
circumstances propelled him, almost inevitably, eastward. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late '50s, Higgins joined Ornette Coleman's groundbreaking quartet, 
along with bassist Charlie Haden and trumpeter Don Cherry. Theirs was a music 
which blended the naturalistic fiber of folk music and the complexity of a new 
kind of jazz vocabulary. It was a revolutionary sound that, while created in 
Los Angeles, went nowhere fast in the conservative musical atmosphere here. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nesuhi Ertegun, of Atlantic Records, saw the light, flew out to hear the 
group and took them to New York, where they were instantly hailed as the 
vanguard of a new jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Higgins remembers the Coleman group's L.A. days: "We were together for a long 
time, before we even started working. It was always just about the music, 
because it wasn't popular to play like that then. That's what's so beautiful 
about New York: New York is ready to accept things that other places don't want 
to accept and don't really have an open mind about. It was wonderful, a good 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The original members of the Coleman group went separate ways, reuniting 
occasionally. The last time the core group played together, and the first time 
back in their original stamping grounds in 30 years, was a concert in downtown 
Los Angeles as part of the L.A. festival in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cherry couldn't show up because of illness, a power trio of Haden, 
Higgins and Coleman delivered a memorable homecoming to a sold-out house -- 
hardly the situation in the late '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Higgins exclaimed, "Every time we play, it seems like it's always right there, 
like we never stopped playing. It's like second nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Higgins lived in New York from 1959 through 1977, when he felt an urge to look 
homeward. "Everybody's back here -- my mother, my grandchildren. It's time for 
me to be back here. I lived in New York so long. I'm traveling so much, I found 
that it doesn't make any difference where I'm at. So I might as well be here. 
My mother's 91 years old. I've got a lot of kids. I've got a brand new baby, 4 
years old. It was a natural movement." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of coming home meant getting involved in a hands-on way in the community 
where he grew up and where now his own offspring are growing up. Hence, the 
World Stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just like to see the young people have a chance to be aware of this 
music. There are a lot of good young musicians, but if they don't have a place 
to play and get together, they're not going to do anything. If you don't get 
out there, you just get lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can listen to it from afar, but if you're not exposed to it on a ground 
level, it's hard to understand what it is. That's really the main concept here. 
It was to keep the music going on. That's the whole thing, because when the 
music stops, it's all over."

 Laziness, actor Eric Stoltz maintains, is an underrated virtue. On an ideal 
day, he'd read newspapers in bed, lunch with friends, indulge in some 
mid-afternoon sex, and cap off dinner with a really great film. Still, with 
four of his own movies surfacing by the end of the year -- and three more in 
1995 -- it's a case of "do as I say . . . not as I do." 
</P>
<P>
 The actor appears as an ex-junkie/bank robber in "Killing Zoe," which opened 
last month, and as Meg Tilly's misogynistic husband in MGM's "Sleep With Me," 
due Sept. 23. He plays a heroin dealer in Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" 
and a suspected murderer in "Fluke." Only the role of an angel in "God's Army" 
and another in the holiday release "Little Women" recall the early Stoltz -- a 
wholesome, slightly gawky boy next door. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Waterdance" (1992), in which Stoltz played an embittered paraplegic, was 
the turning point. Surrounded by actors with parts more flamboyant than his, 
the actor emerged as the anchor for the picture that won the audience award at 
the Sundance Film Festival and two Independent Spirit Awards for best picture 
and screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 "People started looking at the kid in 'Mask' as an adult," observes Tarantino. 
"For all his intensity, Eric never had 'edge.' Now he does. He's on 'the list.' 
He's cool." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Stoltz is anything but cool sitting poolside at a Westside hotel, 
having his picture taken during a record-setting heat wave. A dark green suit 
and crisp white shirt set off red shoulder-length hair and a goatee he's 
sporting for a part in "Rob Roy," an 18th-Century adventure now shooting with 
Liam Neeson and Jessica Lange in Scotland. His humor is dry and 
self-deprecating. ("My role? To make Neeson look bigger and more handsome.") 
His manner is gentle and unfailingly polite. ("You must think I'm the black 
hole of hotel guests," he remarks to the front desk after losing his second 
room key in two days.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Other actors of his generation, most notably the Brat Pack, went for big 
roles in bigger pictures," observes director Michael Steinberg ("The 
Waterdance," "Bodies, Rest & Motion"), who also co-produced "Sleep With Me." 
"But Eric distanced himself by sidestepping the obvious. Ironically, his 
approach seems to have worked. He's here -- and they're not." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, two dozen films to his credit, the 32-year-old Stoltz is one step 
removed from a household name. "I'm often mistaken for (World Cup soccer 
player) Alexi Lalas and, until recently, for (late Nirvana lead singer) Kurt 
Cobain," the actor acknowledges. "Without facial hair, people confuse me with 
Jodie Foster or Suzy Amis." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to choosing roles, gut rather than pocketbook predominates. 
Stoltz is as open to ensemble pieces as to bravura parts. If possible, some of 
each year is reserved for the stage. A regular on the Off Broadway scene, where 
he played a serial killer in last year's "Down the Road," the actor won a Tony 
nomination for his 1988 Broadway debut as The Everyman, George Gibbs, in 
Thornton Wilder's "Our Town." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a career builder," Stoltz says. "I've never plotted out how to become 
a 'marketable persona.' Poor Creative Artists (Agency), God love 'em, they've 
accepted me for what I am. They channel the billion-dollar scripts Tom Cruise's 
way and send the smaller, independent films to me. I have homes in Manhattan, 
New Mexico and L.A., but I don't live high on the hog. I haven't owned a TV 
since 1979. I rented a tux for the Tony Awards." 
</P>
<P>
 So why's a nice guy like this playing such sleazeballs? For one thing, he's 
maturing, getting in touch with the darker elements of his personality. 
Besides, he suggests, playing villains is more fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darker roles are very appealing to me," Stoltz says, taking a sip of 
blood-red orange juice. "Since most of the evil people I've met are quite 
charming, it's a challenge to paint them in shades of gray. What's fun about 
acting is that you get to behave outside the bounds of societal rules. Much 
healthier to do it in a 'Pulp Fiction' or a 'Killing Zoe' instead of in real 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 No chance those images could lead to violence instead of diffusing it? 
</P>
<P>
 "Only psychopaths can't distinguish between story and reality," Stoltz shoots 
back. "Keep antisocial behavior out of movies and you end up with fluff -- 
happy-go-lucky stuff they show on airplanes." 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics have lashed into the amoral violence of "Killing Zoe," a tale in 
which Stoltz, an American safecracker with a quasi-humanist streak, is drawn 
into a heist planned by some drug-crazed Parisians. Stoltz prefers to see it as 
a psychedelic fable -- a cross between "Alice in Wonderland" and Roger Corman's 
"Bloody Mama," both of which propel an innocent into a world of madness. 
First-time director Roger Avary wrote the role with Stoltz in mind, much to the 
amazement -- and skepticism -- of the powers-that-be. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wanted to see Eric," recalls Tarantino, who executive-produced the 
film. "I got a script to him after running into him on the street. Though Eric 
was annoyed when a reviewer accused him of doing a Mickey Rourke impersonation, 
that's not really off-base. His performance in 'Zoe' was an unconscious homage 
to Mickey Rourke-style roles -- that don't-give-a-(expletive) attitude 
delivered in a tough monotone."  
</P>
<P>
 To prepare for the role, Stoltz hung out with a junkie to observe speech 
patterns and body movement. He dug even deeper on other films. For "The 
Waterdance," the actor remained in a wheelchair for two months, refusing to get 
up even at the director's request. For "Mask" (1985), he wore his makeup in 
public to get a sense of the ridicule his character -- a severely deformed 
adolescent -- had endured. The 22-year-old Stoltz was changed by the 
experience. He saw what human nature was like -- and it wasn't a pretty 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eric walked around in 105-degree heat in makeup which took four hours to 
apply," recalls "Mask" director Peter Bogdanovich. "Fake teeth prevented him 
from eating solid foods so he lost a lot of weight. I started out as an actor 
and used to pride myself on not asking an actor to do anything I wouldn't have 
done. But that wasn't possible with him. He deserved a Purple Heart for that 
role." 
</P>
<P>
 What sets him apart, Bogdanovich observes, is a keen intelligence ("Some 
actors, you have to put glasses on"), good instincts and those remarkably blue 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eric has very expressive, beautiful eyes that are able to convey a lot," the 
director explains. "That's what the part needed because there wasn't anything 
else. After one scene, I yelled, 'Cut!,' and cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs 
commented to me: 'He just wrote a sentence with his eyes.' The picture would 
have been unthinkable without him but instead of riding its success, Eric went 
off to Paris, where he lived for a couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
 As passionate as Stoltz is about the work, say his colleagues, he's able to 
disengage. On the set of "The Waterdance" -- a low-budget, intense shoot in 
need of some levity -- he was the cheerleader/court jester. He's regarded as an 
inveterate "teaser," fond of testing people to find their limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eric's a bit of Peck's Bad Boy," says "Waterdance" co-star Helen Hunt (TV's 
"Mad About You"). "I was the only woman working around a group of men in 
wheelchairs who viewed me from waist-height. He took full advantage . . . but 
only because he knew I'd come back strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Like last year's "Bodies, Rest & Motion," a Generation X comedy in which 
Stoltz played a house painter, Rory Kelly's "Sleep With Me" targets 
relationships in the '90s -- in this case, the complications posed for three 
friends when one (Craig Sheffer) falls in love with the other's wife (Meg 
Tilly). The project got its start in a Manhattan bar where Stoltz and some pals 
were ruminating about life and love. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally intended as an up scale home movie -- a $10,000 16-millimeter 
black-and-white affair shot for fun or possibly film festivals -- the picture 
changed course when Tilly signed on. Shoot it in 35mm, the money men said, and 
the financing is yours. Two months later, the $3-million shoot was under way. 
</P>
<P>
 During the rather unorthodox script-writing phase, each of six writers was 
assigned a scene and briefed on the points to be covered. Characters were based 
on people they knew. The actors worked for peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like guerrilla filmmaking in a commune," Tilly recalls. "We clasped 
hands and jumped off without knowing if our parachutes would hold up. But at 
least we'd die with great people. Eric is unusual, more successful than 99% of 
the actors I know. It's not about selling tickets but about having your head on 
straight. He has his own personal boundaries. He's not a diarrhea-mouth who 
spills everything out." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltz admits to being shy, which is one reason he turned to acting. Hiding 
behind a character not only makes it easier to reveal oneself, he observes, but 
that much safer to explore. The topics investigated in "Sleep With Me" -- 
marriage, infidelity, friendship, lust -- struck a particular chord. Like many 
Hollywood romances, his four-year relationship with actress Bridget Fonda 
("Point of No Return," "It Could Happen to You") is a bit of a high-wire act -- 
on the heels of some difficult and failed relationships. Though they worked 
together on "Singles" and "Bodies, Rest & Motion" and visit each other on the 
set, the "migrant worker" lifestyle and "predatory co-stars," says the actor, 
take a toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're in different cities, different environments . . . usually romantic," 
Stoltz begins. "You're encouraged to disconnect from reality. And many of your 
co-stars feel it's their right to seduce you -- whether you have a relationship 
off the set or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not above it," he adds. "I had a few on-the-set romances myself when I 
was in my 20s. Dumb, but understandable. Actors and rock stars are treated like 
gods in our culture and some begin to think they're beyond reproach. They're 
often charming, talented people who just weren't raised right." 
</P>
<P>
 That certainly wasn't the case with Stoltz, however, a native Angeleno whose 
early years were a curious mix of "Leave It to Beaver" and "South Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
 Mom was a first-grade teacher, dad a high school principal. When Eric was 3, 
they took him and his two older sisters to live in American Samoa, returning to 
Santa Barbara when he was 8. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, young Eric fell in with the Santa Barbara theater crowd, playing 
the piano for local productions and road shows. Because music was so solitary, 
however, he refocused his sights on acting. By the time he enrolled at USC in 
1979, he had appeared in nearly 50 plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by the regimentation of college and itching to see the world, 
Stoltz dropped out of school in 1981. He then hooked up with a troupe 
performing repertory at the Edinburgh Festival, where he stayed until he was 
broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Hollywood, Stoltz won a role as a surfer in Amy Heck erling's "Fast 
Times at Ridgemont High" (1982). The film, he says, was "one long party," and 
the celebrants included such soon-to-be-stars as Nicolas Cage, Forest Whitaker, 
Phoebe Cates and Jennifer Jason Leigh, with whom he later became involved. 
</P>
<P>
 After completing "The Wild Life" -- the first of his four collaborations with 
Cameron Crowe ("I was his mascot") -- Stoltz landed the lead in "Back to the 
Future." His euphoria proved short-lived, however, when director Robert 
Zemeckis fired him and replaced him with Michael J. Fox three weeks into the 
shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltz says it was a "brutal" time -- fired without warning from his first big 
film. Though Zemeckis took full responsibility for miscasting him, the actor 
was so shaken that he headed straight to acting class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zemeckis told me I was giving a good performance in a film he didn't want to 
make . . . contemplative and thoughtful instead of comedic," the actor recalls. 
"I felt I could have done the part had he pointed me in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mask's" success took the edge off his pain. Scripts came pouring in. 
Hollywood executives, curious about how he looked without makeup, came to check 
him out. Life, too, has provided perspective -- most notably, the death of his 
67-year-old mother from cancer three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting fired? Nothing comes close to dealing with death," Stoltz maintains. 
"Life would be so much fun if we didn't have to contend with that at the end of 
it. I'm still reeling, stunned, confused. The loss is so profound and 
all-encompassing that it's hard to see beyond it." 
</P>
<P>
 The actor rubs his goatee and lowers his gaze. "Sorry . . . the sorrow just 
comes over me," he says softly. "Right now, it's about getting up in the 
morning and sleeping through the night. Not thinking but accepting." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltz has an easier time discuss ing producing, an area in which, in a rare 
burst of immodesty, he concedes he's "pretty good." Since none of the other 
producers of "Bodies, Rest & Motion" had made a film before, his production 
debut was a "trial by fire." Co-producing "Sleep With Me," however, was 
considerably more comfortable.  
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, it's a relief to be on that side of the camera," the actor says. 
"You don't have to look good and you can go home and forget about work and that 
obscene hierarchy of egos. Still, acting and producing simultaneously creates a 
lot of headaches. One moment you're concerned about losing the light. The next, 
you're proposing to Meg (Tilly), forced to be romantic when you're really 
furious and anxious inside. I have enormous respect for people like Clint 
Eastwood who can do it all at once." 
</P>
<P>
 Though directing is of no immediate interest to Stoltz, writer-director Neil 
Jimenez ("The Waterdance") regards him as a natural-born filmmaker. "Eric is 
very aware of how a movie is put together, where he fits in the story," he 
explains. "He's not out to build up his character or shove himself into scenes 
in which he doesn't belong. Eric can put vanity on the middle burner, if not 
the back one. That's a rare trait in an actor -- or anyone, for that matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Stoltz has made five films since "Sleep With Me," he bucks the label 
"workaholic." When it comes to his career, he insists, he has very little 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I planted some garden plants in the wrong place four or five years ago," 
Stoltz says, by way of explanation, "and every once in awhile they bloom. There 
were 40 flowers a few months ago and now, for no apparent reason, there are 
two. I always tend it but it has a life of its own. My career has a similar 
dynamic." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he loved living out of a suitcase in his 20s, Stoltz says, he now has 
to work up the energy to go to Scotland for three months. He has less sense of 
adventure and doesn't know how to rectify that. Still, there's little evidence, 
on the face of it, that the actor will be pulling back. He dreams of tackling 
Shakespeare -- on stage or on film. And he'd like to hook up with the "usual 
suspects" -- Brian De Palma, Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick and Terence 
Malick -- before checking out. 
</P>
<P>
 All well and good, says Stoltz pal and collaborator Michael Steinberg. Just 
don't go "mainstream" and leave us in the dust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sundance this year could have been renamed 'The Eric Stoltz Film Festival,' " 
the director quips. "On every picture I've done, he's gotten the ball rolling. 
Without him, a lot of directors would have a hard time getting work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any book on independent filmmaking should begin with a chapter entitled: 'Get 
a Good Script.' Chapter 2 should be 'Show It to Eric Stoltz.' "

 'I just got off the phone with the Spam people," announces Terry Lewis, 
co-chair of the British Academy of Film & Television. He gleefully ticks off 
the triumphs. "They've been incredibly positive. They're sending us 3,000 Spam 
recipe cards and refrigerator magnets, and 400 'Great Taste of Spam' recipe 
books, and we've got 400 cases of Spam arriving. Of course the Spam always has 
a trademark symbol next to it, so it just couldn't be more perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 This can only mean two things: Another great war is imminent in Europe, or 
it's a significant Monty Python anniversary year. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily -- or preferable to a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, anyhow -- 
it's the latter, with the 25th anniversary of the first broadcast of "Monty 
Python's Flying Circus" on the BBC on Oct. 5, 1969 fast approaching. Though the 
influentially absurdist English comedy troupe hasn't worked together since the 
"Monty Python's the Meaning of Life" film was released 12 years ago, its 
popularity refuses to wane, and related projects continue to whet fans' 
Spam-sated appetites. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis is collecting the aforementioned foodstuff for a private party the 
academy is throwing this week at the British consul general's home for several 
Pythons who are coming to town. The fete is expected to attract many of L.A.'s 
foremost comic luminaries. But if rank-and-file Python fans can't attend that, 
there'll still be plenty of other ways to celebrate in the coming weeks: 
</P>
<P>
 * Next weekend, Los Angeles is the site of the only official 25th-anniversary 
Python film festival, a five-day affair designed to exhaust any compleatist. 
"Monty Python: Lust for Glory" -- the series is named after Eric Idle's 
legendary jest that the filmic follow-up to "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" 
would be called "Jesus Christ: Lust for Glory" -- lines up as easily the most 
comprehensive roundup of group and solo film and TV work ever assembled. 
</P>
<P>
 The whirlwind schedule (co-sponsored by the American Cinematheque) promises 
movie outtakes, rarely seen side projects, industrial films and pre-Python 
material that member Terry Jones says "even we haven't seen in 25 or 30 years." 
Besides Jones, Terry Gilliam and Eric Idle have committed to attend key 
screenings at the Directors Guild. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two key Python collaborators, at least, will also be coming to town this 
fall. Neil Innes, who co-wrote much of the troupe's musical material, will be 
resurrecting the Beatles-spoofing side project the Rutles (sans Idle, but with 
a string section) as "Ron Nasty and the New Rutles" in a club show Thursday and 
Saturday at the Troubadour. And Carol Cleveland, the "seventh Python" (at least 
when the six fellows tired of doing drag), is scheduled to perform a one-woman 
show Oct. 13 at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Tuesday, Virgin Records issues "The Instant Monty Python CD Collection," 
a six-disc box covering nearly all the audio product ever put out by the 
troupe, including some sketches never previously released in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 * And perhaps most exciting of all is a beyond-the-state-of-the-art CD-ROM due 
later this month and called "Monty Python's Complete Waste of Time," which not 
only serves as a retrospective but also includes significant new writing and 
voice-over contributions from four of the five surviving members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like seeing the show for the first time. You see these same things that 
you've always seen, but it's like -- aghhhh! -- completely different," Jones 
says with a chuckle about the CD-ROM, whose hilarious and intricate design may 
astonish even the most cynical computer buffs. "I think we're all stunned by 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 If it seems as if Python is bigger in death -- or just inactivity, for those 
hopeful for a reunion -- than in life, it's not just an optical illusion. 
Reruns of the 40 "Flying Circus" episodes, broadcast in the United States on 
PBS and ABC in the '70s, are a staple of cable's Comedy Central nowadays, where 
a new generation of kids is memorizing the Parrot Sketch and such. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Pythons' skewed view of the world is still appropriate today," 
says Bob Ezrin, the record-producer-turned-multi-media-mogul whose company, 7th 
Level, is putting together the CD-ROM. "It takes on a whole segment of society 
or a whole era in history or a whole personality type." 
</P>
<P>
 The British academy's honcho Lewis -- who produced the series of "Secret 
Policeman's Ball" benefits in Britain in the '80s and is a longtime friend of 
all the members -- thinks that that very timelessness and lack of topicality 
has gotten the troupe unfairly dismissed by some snobs in the United Kingdom. 
Hence, he figures, America is the perfect locale for the anniversary confab. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parallels with the Beatles are always there, and it extends to their 
being more cherished by their comedic peers here than at home in Britain," 
Lewis maintains. "There, some people say, 'Oh, it was absurdist humor, it was 
completely irrelevant, they didn't attack the icons of the day.' But they 
didn't go for the 'political' gag. . . . They captured that anarchic spirit (of 
the late '60s). . . . That's why the Pythons have felt at home in America, 
because their stuff is appreciated here." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones tends to agree, remembering that the BBC was on the verge of "wiping" 
all the "Flying Circus" episodes as a matter of procedure after the show went 
off the air in 1974. He even made some crude video copies at the time to store 
in his basement, after being alerted by a BBC worker that the masters were 
about to be taped over. "Then they suddenly made the overseas sale, so it was 
thanks to you guys in the United States that Python wasn't wiped and the shows 
weren't just a memory in my cellar. I think it's absolutely right that the only 
Python festival should be going on in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Much vault-digging has been going on throughout England to provide little- or 
never-seen material for the film festival and the CD-ROM.  
</P>
<P>
 Jones is delighted, for instance, that curator Lewis was able to track down 
what is likely the lone surviving copy of a 1969 TV special called "The 
Complete and Utter History of Britain," co-starring and co-written by Michael 
Palin and Jones. It was presumed lost, but Lewis, making calls from his L.A. 
office to London Weekend Television, suddenly had the thought: What if the tape 
was mistakenly filed away somewhere under history , not comedy ? His hunch was 
right; the tape had been filed away for decades with film of royal pageants. 
</P>
<P>
 All the surviving Pythons contributed lists of solo works they wanted to have 
shown, with the exception of the often-contrary John Cleese, whose contribution 
to the festival was submitting the name of a project that he did not want shown 
("The Strange Case of the End of Civilization as We Know It," a misfired 
Sherlock Holmes parody shown on PBS in 1977). 
</P>
<P>
 For the CD-ROM, Ezrin and his collaborators were allowed access to Gilliam's 
"dungeon," where they sorted through the various pieces Gilliam used to cut out 
and paste together Python animations, finding bits to reassemble for the disc's 
graphic interfaces. "That was such a tremendous honor," says Ezrin (best known 
as producer of Pink Floyd's "The Wall"), "to be able to sift through the 
original pieces that were literally cut out from Victorian art books and 
historical texts and magazines of the '50s. He had -- has -- such a 
constructive eye. He'll take two completely dull and lifeless images and in his 
brain combine them to make something that's absolutely ridiculous that makes 
you laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliam's favorite part of the CD-ROM, according to Ezrin, is a game in which 
the player tries to maneuver a chicken with a man's head into a gaping mouth on 
one side of the screen, without getting electrocuted by wires overhead or 
stabbed by jutting arrows underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Gilliam's favorite because it's really grossly violent. See, we 
originally just had this antiseptic little thing that fell on the arrows and 
disappeared, and Gilliam said, 'Come on . Let's get some blood gushing here!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the ultimate hope of any Python fan is another movie, though that's 
generally been given a snowball's chance in hell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, I was in hell last week, and it was snowing," Ezrin responds. 
"I don't think you can say there's no chance. One of the things this (CD-ROM) 
title has done, if nothing else, is it's gotten them talking and brought them 
together around a project of mutual interest.  
</P>
<P>
 "So who knows where this will lead us? A Python film, I think, would be 
phenomenal. There might be a problem filming Graham's scenes (the late Graham 
Chapman, that is), but aside from that, it'd be great." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones is more reserved about what sort of reunion the anniversary might spark: 
"Possibly the Pythons themselves might get together for lunch or something, I 
don't know; we haven't actually organized anything like that yet ourselves."

THEATER; AN ACTRESS NAMED DESIRE; KANDIS CHAPPELL IS 'ONE OF THE BEST-KEPT 
SECRETS' IN TOWN. NOW SHE'S TAKING ON 'STREETCAR'S' BLANCHE DUBOIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When actress Kandis Chappell went for her first fitting as Blanche DuBois, 
costume designer Walker Hicklin told her to make sure the clothes were 
comfortable. She was, he explained, taking on the "King Lear" of women's roles. 
</P>
<P>
 It was time. Tennessee Williams' doomed heroine in "A Streetcar Named Desire" 
is one of few leading ladies that Chappell hasn't played on major local stages 
recently. The actress opens Friday in "Streetcar" at South Coast Repertory in 
Costa Mesa, taking on her ninth leading role at that theater alone the past 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a business where most actors spend more time waiting tables than performing 
onstage, Chappell has theaters planning long in advance to hire her. "I have to 
book her 10 months ahead," says Jack O' Brien, artistic director of San Diego's 
Old Globe Theatre, "and she's an associate artist here." 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast keeps pretty busy all by itself, offering her such roles in the 
last few years as the eccentric Lettice of "Lettice and Lovage," the crazed 
"Woman in Mind," the flamboyant Judith Bliss of "Hay Fever," and poet Joy 
Davidman Gresham in "Shadowlands." Last summer, she was at the Old Globe 
playing the "The Merchant of Venice's" Portia and daughter Regan in "King 
Lear." 
</P>
<P>
 "She gives something to a performance that's mesmerizing," says Hal Holbrook, 
who played the Globe's Lear and was Shylock to Chappell's Portia. "She's one of 
the finest actresses I ever worked with. I don't know anybody around who's any 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Chappell ranks among the biggest fish in Southern California's theatrical 
pond. She is the only actress who has won three Los Angeles Drama Critics 
Circle awards for featured performances -- for "The Crucible," "Woman in Mind" 
and "Shadowlands." 
</P>
<P>
 She is, by her own admission, "an anachronism," an actress dedicated to the 
non-commercial stage. Aside from her work in Neil Simon's "Rumors" on Broadway 
and on tour a few years ago, Chappell has worked almost exclusively in regional 
theater, mostly locally. And now in her 40s, she is an unlikely candidate for 
TV or film stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you work in regional theater, you know who Kandis Chappell is," says 
casting director Elisa Goodman. "She's always doing a play, and it just didn't 
occur to her to have a film or television career. She's one of the best-kept 
secrets in Hollywood."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Few heads turn as Chappell shows up for lunch at a Costa Mesa restaurant near 
the theater. She wears little make-up, a simple hairstyle and nondescript 
clothes that don't much flatter her. But tall and confident, she comes across 
as both attractive and theatrical. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 'Woman in Mind,' she had on a really frumpy dress, a bobby pin in her 
hair and no makeup," comments "Streetcar" stage manager Bonnie Lorenger. "Some 
actors wouldn't be caught dead looking like (that), and that doesn't bother 
her. She wants to look the way the character looks." 
</P>
<P>
 This time out, of course, the character has to look very, very good. Blanche 
DuBois may be a faded beauty, but she is also an accomplished seductress. From 
Jessica Tandy who won a Tony for her performance in the show's Broadway debut 
in 1947, to Vivien Leigh's who starred in the 1951 film portrayal to Jessica 
Lange who reprised the role on Broadway in 1992, an impressive roster of 
actresses have taken on Williams' deluded Southern belle.  
</P>
<P>
 "Streetcar" is generally considered one of the greatest American plays, and 
Blanche among the stage's juiciest roles. (Everyone knows what playing Stanley 
Kowalski did for young Marlon Brando.) There must be electricity between her 
and her brother-in-law Stanley, caring between her and her sister Stella, 
tension between her and her memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Chappell admits she was intimidated at first. "All my life I wanted to play 
Blanche and always thought I would," says Chappell, "but when I reread the 
play, I said, 'I can't do this. I don't know who she is.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She read the play twice more, then rented the film. "When I read the play, I 
could hear Vivien Leigh's voice. After watching the movie (in which Leigh 
played DuBois), it was even more in my head. That's a definitive performance. I 
had to force myself not to use her inflections."  
</P>
<P>
 But reading the play and watching the film are about all Chappell did by way 
of preparation, she admits. "I'm not bragging. Often, I think more should be 
done. Some people work by intellect, but I work by instinct. I will read a line 
a certain way, and often the director says, 'What is she thinking? What is she 
after?' and I'll say, 'I don't know. It just seems right.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Most of her work happens in the rehearsal process, Chappell explains, 
something which becomes abundantly clear during a visit to the basement 
rehearsal rooms at South Coast Rep where she and her colleagues are shaping 
"Streetcar." There, Chappell works off her script as she meticulously asks -- 
and generally answers -- question after question about how her character gets 
from the dressing table to her trunk and back again.  
</P>
<P>
 The actress asks Jeff Meek, who plays Stanley, not to move at one point while 
she is speaking, saying: "I just want that line to land." She also suggests 
Meek grab her hand, not the perfume atomizer she is holding, then calls out to 
director Martin Benson, asking: "How does that look?" (Benson liked it.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meek describes Chappell as "sort of a blocking maven," and "Streetcar's" 
assistant stage manager Julie Haber says some of the crew affectionately refer 
to Chappell as Dame Bossy. "Within two days of rehearsal, people who don't know 
me ask, 'Have you ever thought of directing?' " quips Chappell, "because I just 
tell everyone what to do."  
</P>
<P>
 Chappell says she doesn't resort to "arm wrestling" for all her staging ideas, 
but colleagues contend she's generally on target, particularly about her own 
characters and particularly when it comes to deciding where she should be at 
any given time. And director Benson volunteers that the actress has a "genius 
for blocking." 
</P>
<P>
 "She just has an instinct for the stage, the way a tennis player has for the 
dimensions of the tennis court," says Benson, who is also South Coast's 
artistic director. "She seems to know where to be, and she knows which foot to 
move first." 
</P>
<P>
 Chappell is the first to admit she builds each performance on a solid 
technical base. "I always compare myself to a pointillist painter," she says. 
"I work in tiny little dots. The way I pick up a glass, the way I walk, what I 
wear -- everything is a dot for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes when I'm in the middle of it, I can't see the picture. And 
sometimes the people I work with can't see the picture. They say, 'Who cares if 
the glass is here or there?' Well, for me the glass is a dot. When you get back 
to where the audience is sitting, I hope there is a portrait of a very real 
person and a very full person."  
</P>
<P>
 She says all of this in a soft, almost self-effacing voice, drawing imaginary 
dots on the restaurant table as she speaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "She couldn't be further from a diva," Elizabeth Dennehy, playing Stella 
Kowalski, observes later. "Sometimes people just want to take care of 
themselves and how they look. Kandis is most interested in serving the play and 
the playwright and not just a star turn."  
</P>
<P>
 Everyone talks about her like that, including her dressers and stage managers. 
They tell how she bakes cookies (ginger snaps) for the cast, organizes parties 
and party games, is amenable to scheduling complexities. "I'm afraid to say too 
much about her," stage manager Haber says at one point, "because we'll lose 
her. I wish her a wonderful career, but I want it to be here."  
</P>
<P>
 Chappell lives in San Diego, where she grew up and where she was a prop girl 
at the Old Globe when she was 16. She has a degree in theater from San Diego 
State University where former classmate Elisa Goodman recalls Chappell "was the 
Meryl Streep of San Diego State. She was the lead in everything. She was just a 
legend there." 
</P>
<P>
 The actress did summer stock in Bemidji, Minn., then graduated from San Diego 
State in 1975. She did her first show at the Old Globe that same year, got her 
Actors' Equity card in 1978, and a year later, moved to the Bay Area to work 
with California Actors' Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Chappell worked at such places as San Jose Repertory Theatre, 
Berkeley Repertory Theatre and Seattle's Intiman Theatre. It wasn't until 1986, 
she says, that she saw her first play at South Coast Rep and -- before fate 
intervened -- decided to audition there.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a place I should work," Chappell says, "so I asked a close 
friend to introduce me to Martin (Benson). We met at a dinner party. We both 
just looked at each other and were interested immediately, and instead of my 
coming to audition for him, we started dating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within a month, an audition came up for a show he was directing, but we felt 
it too soon to work together. Nothing really came up again until 'The 
Crucible,' which was nearly 2 1/2 years after we started going together. He 
didn't want it to look like he was bringing his girlfriend in, and neither did 
I. I knew I was a good actress, and that I could establish myself here on my 
own credentials." 
</P>
<P>
 She did exactly that in "The Crucible," which in 1988 won her her first L.A. 
Drama Critics Circle award, then soon headed off to New York with "Rumors." It 
wasn't until three years later that she was back at South Coast working with 
Benson on "Heartbreak House," and by that time, the two had separated. 
</P>
<P>
 Both acknowledge the difficulty of doing "Heartbreak House" just months after 
they'd separated, but both also speak of themselves as close friends who work 
well together. "It's all behind us now," Benson says. "We can say anything to 
each other because we have a history and closeness and know each other so 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 That's good, because work is everything to Chappell. She says she has little 
life offstage these days -- no significant other, no family. "My life style is 
dictated by my career," she says, "and I lead a life in the theater. I don't 
even get to live at home very often, traveling from theater to theater, doing 
these parts." 
</P>
<P>
 When she was performing "Shadowlands" last year at South Coast, for instance, 
she was also rehearsing "King Lear" at the Old Globe. For two weeks, maybe 
more, she was rehearsing for five hours, performing for three, and traveling 
another two or three hours each day.  
</P>
<P>
 Chappell spent a couple years on the road in "Rumors," taking over for 
Christine Baranski on Broadway, then touring (including a stop at Hollywood's 
Doolittle Theatre). She had originally come in as the reader for West Coast 
auditions, explains New York-based casting director Jay Binder, but she was so 
good that after five days of auditions, playwright Simon and director Gene Saks 
insisted she stay with the show as an understudy. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a classic old-fashioned breathtakingly talented actress," Binder says. 
"I think if she lived in New York, she'd be playing major roles at Lincoln 
Center or the Manhattan Theatre Club. But there's a comfort playing great roles 
at South Coast and the Old Globe."  
</P>
<P>
 Chappell appears to agree. "I sometimes think of going to New York," she says. 
"What stops me from going is time. I am now, I think, in my prime, and I am 
playing great, great parts. If I go to New York, I would have to spend two 
years knocking on doors, and that is two years of time that I wouldn't be 
playing great parts."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite playing the Doolittle during the "Rumors" tour, she says she has never 
been called to audition at either the Mark Taper Forum or the La Jolla 
Playhouse. She doesn't know why, she says, but admits she's never called them 
either. She doesn't want to do a "cattle call" audition, she says, "and I 
almost always have a job. So I don't need to do that."  
</P>
<P>
 She seems to feel likewise about film and TV. She's appeared in just one film 
-- "Another You" in 1991 -- and two TV episodes. While she keeps an apartment 
in Los Angeles and has spent time here on and off dutifully seeking TV or film 
work, she sums up her efforts saying, "Nothing's clicked." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of her problem is her versatility, offers O'Brien. "She has so many 
facets that people who want to merchandise her don't know who she is. Stockard 
Channing and Marsha Mason were like that in their early work. If you're not 
able or willing to merchandise yourself in a special mode, TV and film both are 
bored with you. They want to know what flavor of Chiclet you are, quick. They 
need consistency, not chameleons."  
</P>
<P>
 They won't get it in the future either. Coming up soon for Chappell, for 
instance, is her portrayal of the actress in Molnar's 1910 comedy, "The 
Guardsman," for Boston's Huntington Theatre. Next June, she will play the 
aristocratic Madame Ranevskaya in Chekhov's "The Cherry Orchard" at South Coast 
Rep.  
</P>
<P>
 When asked, Chappell responds that she's "on the verge of directing. It's just 
a matter of the timing -- the right project and the right moment." And, also 
when asked, she says she doesn't regret where she is now. 
</P>
<P>
 But she admits to some regrets. "I was working with a director who went to 
Juilliard (in New York), and she said, 'If you had gone to a school like 
Juilliard, you'd be a Broadway star now.' I said I didn't know about a place 
like Juilliard. I was a very naive kid in San Diego; I went to my local school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had gone to to Juilliard or Yale or something because that opens 
doors. I feel that I'm at a very exciting place professionally, on a par with 
people who went to those places, but it could have happened 12 years ago 
instead of just a few years ago. I very much took the back route -- the long, 
hard road." 
</P>
<P>

Tues.-Sat ., . 8 p.m. , Sunday, 7:30 p.m.; Saturday -Sunday, 2 :30 pm. Tickets

PERFORMING ARTS; HANG ON TO YOUR SOULS, HE'S BACK; THE DEVIL HAS RETURNED, BUT 
FRANK CORSARO'S STAGING OF 'FAUST' IS DIFFERENT. IT'S THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
VERSION -- A FITTING TIME FOR OL' MEPHISTOPHELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lewis Segal, Lewis Segal is a Times staff writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
 On an indoor basketball court near Echo Park, all the principals, chorus 
members and supernumeraries in the Los Angeles Music Center Opera "Faust" are 
rehearsing the complex Kermesse scene that ends Act I in the production opening 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The supers all wear name tags that list the multiple roles they play in 
Charles Gounod's lyric adaptation of Goethe: a body snatcher in one scene, a 
priest in another, a malevolent monk in a third. And those tags reveal that 
this is no ordinary production. 
</P>
<P>
 What, for instance, is someone tagged an "industrialist" doing in the classic 
tale of a medieval scholar who sells his soul to the devil? And why are the 
townswomen labeled "factory workers"? 
</P>
<P>
 Holding the answers: a jaunty, purposeful, silver-haired veteran stage 
director named Frank Corsaro, dressed today in a loose, blue short-sleeved 
shirt and green shorts (no shoes). 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens in this scene is that Mephisto acts as a puppet master," he 
tells the cast. "Everyone will freeze in the action and then resume again just 
before they sing." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving from group to group, giving people an idea of motivation and placement, 
the 69-year-old self-styled maverick of American opera breaks the bustling, 
chaotic scene into specific action units -- even demonstrating a drunken little 
dance for a line of men. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the weakest scene in the opera dramatically," he will later tell an 
interviewer. "I've always found it the least satisfying because it's 
essentially decorative. The story literally stops." 
</P>
<P>
 To keep that story moving, he's taking the emphasis away from what he calls 
"the good old merry peasants, fire-eaters and dancing dwarfs" and placing it on 
the crucial brother-sister relationship of Valentin and Marguerite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they become part of the action and enrich it," he explains. "So when he 
turns on her later, there are many more resonances." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Corsaro has changed the Kermesse scene -- and much of the action 
of "Faust" as a whole -- into a grand-scale theater game controlled by 
Mephistopheles -- making it literally the opera from hell. 
</P>
<P>
 This may not be a new idea in opera staging, but it serves to make all the 
human characters appear trapped and helpless. Not only does Mephistopheles have 
the power to suspend the action at will (those freezes that Corsaro is 
rehearsing), but this devil-may-care manipulator has turned the celebrated 
dance tune that ends the scene into a veritable Mephisto waltz. 
</P>
<P>
 To this end, Corsaro spends part of the rehearsal dividing the big waltzing 
chorus into small groups and making their motion increasingly demonic. 
Dissatisfied, he then suggests that many of them stay offstage and sing into 
microphones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will (conductor) Larry Foster scream?" he asks rhetorically, telling an 
interviewer later that Foster is willing to at least try the idea. In Corsaro's 
sixth staging for this company, traditional chorus deployment and opera 
technology are clearly nothing sacred. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although this Corsaro "Faust" will receive its world premiere at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion, many of its most provocative staging concepts will already 
be familiar to Music Center audiences. From 1968 through 1979, the New York 
City Opera performed another Corsaro production of "Faust" on this same stage. 
And he has incorporated a number of its innovations in the new version. 
</P>
<P>
 In the prologue, for example, we'll again find old Faust in a laboratory 
experimenting with cadavers -- one of which suddenly becomes Mephistopheles. In 
the church scene, Marguerite is once more both visibly pregnant and haunted by 
hooded clerics led by the devil in disguise. Mephistopheles will also fill his 
wine cup from a bleeding statue of St. Sebastian -- perhaps an even more 
horrific image in this age of HIV than it was back in the low-risk 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were strong ideas and I thought they were worth preserving," Corsaro 
says. "I think if you work on something and believe in it, you should keep 
developing it. For the new production I've re-examined the opera, and I think 
I'm defining its dramatic structure more clearly." 
</P>
<P>
 The most controversial moment in his New York City Opera "Faust" came during 
the finale -- normally a sequence in which Marguerite prays for forgiveness for 
having murdered her baby and then mounts a stairway to heaven, summoned by a 
chorus of angels. Corsaro, however, sent her upstairs to her execution. 
</P>
<P>
 She'll again have a date at the gallows in his new version -- with 
Mephistopheles as executioner -- but Corsaro promises a genuine apotheosis this 
time around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, at the very end, the place will be blazing with light, and, for the 
first time, the devil will be confounded," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly there is a moment when Mephisto has the contract (for Faust's soul) 
in hand and, faced with this display of light, he drops it to the ground. It's 
his only gesture of defeat, but it indicates that there is hope, that there are 
forces that even he cannot foresee." 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest difference between the two Corsaro "Faust" stagings may lie in 
the new one's shift in period to the 19th Century: the composer's own era and 
the dawn of industrialization. Set designer Franco Colavecchia recalls Corsaro 
mentioning 1835 or 1840 and saying that the opera "is sort of a horror story, 
it has a 'Frankenstein' quality about it." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I thought of the period," Colavecchia says, "I immediately remembered 
the Industrial Revolution, a time of child labor and extreme cruelty in the 
factories. You think of phrases like "dark Satanic mills" from (Romantic 
English poet) William Blake. That puts another aspect onto the opera -- gives 
it another point of reference." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to find some way to move this story far forward (in time) and yet 
preserve all of its values," Corsaro says, "to allow us to see it in a fresh 
perspective. I thought that this extra element would give the opera a 
pertinence and a pungency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of seeing Marguerite at her spinning wheel during her song, the image 
is of her at the loom in the factory. She's forced to go there, and I thought 
that's a useful metaphor for a world primarily dominated by workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Valentin is a foreman -- he literally trades in his lunch box to go to war. 
And when he returns later -- bedraggled, beaten, wounded -- he's given back his 
old occupation and a gold lunch pail as a reward." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the protests of the purists, Corsaro issues a statement that 
sounds like a warning: "We cannot subvert our sensibilities when we're dealing 
with a play or an opera. We're alive today, and we're appreciating this opera 
in terms of our awareness of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing for me is its subtextural resonance, and -- living 
today and recognizing how this material resonates in our lives -- I try to find 
a kind of outpost, in terms of environment and culture, that can assimilate the 
values in this work and in that sense expand its possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Colavecchia, a longtime collaborator with Corsaro, proposed setting the entire 
production inside a giant factory or warehouse -- "already in hell somewhat," 
he says. "In a practical sense, I considered how to move the opera swiftly and 
economically. By doing 'Faust' in one space, you get rid of a lot of long scene 
changes with curtains coming down and then rising for another set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank and I have done many opera productions where the scenery moves along 
with the music. And I quite like working this way -- in trapped spaces." 
</P>
<P>
 Colavecchia's only previous Music Center Opera project was Rossini's "La 
Cenerentola" (directed by Corsaro) in 1987. He says that he has never known 
Corsaro to approach any production in a traditional way, but "always has me or 
whoever he's working with search for that terrible word concept . I like 
working with him because he allows me to go off and invent without many 
constrictions. He offers a great deal of creative freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Back on the operatic basketball court, creative freedom indeed reigns and a 
Kermesse within the Kermesse has developed. 
</P>
<P>
 While Corsaro works with chorus members, those supers not needed in the scene 
check the company bulletin board, where they find notice of a canceled 
rehearsal -- and somebody's annotated list of films to see. (The top three: 
"Forrest Gump," "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" and "The 
Lion King.") 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing at least two pairs of baggy shorts and a faded green T-shirt, Rodney 
Gilfry compares his Goethe Cliff Notes to another singer's. The tall, magnetic 
Gilfry, who is cast as Valentin, worked previously under Corsaro in his 1988 
Music Center Opera staging of "Les Contes d'Hoffmann." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilfry says he likes working with Corsaro because "he makes a nice rehearsal 
-- the atmosphere. He doesn't have any pretensions, he doesn't have an attitude 
problem. He's very casual but very direct. So far, every rehearsal we've had, 
he's had no shoes on. So he's very approachable." 
</P>
<P>
 But the barefoot nonchalance can be deceptive. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's kind of disarming in a way," Gilfry continues. " 'Hoffmann' ended up 
being very intense, but his approach to it (during rehearsals) was, 'Let's try 
this, just do it.' He doesn't give you time to think, and you kind of bypass 
your circuits that would evaluate it before you do it. And that's really good 
because it helps you discover new things about your own abilities and about the 
character. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a very logical person and usually when I do something I try to reason it 
out. And all of this self-criticism and evaluation isn't necessarily helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kermesse is scarcely Marguerite's big scene, but Veronica Villarroel 
rehearses her pantomime duties with great sunniness, wearing an elegant, gauzy 
floor-length black dress studded with tiny carnation blooms. 
</P>
<P>
 She, too, has worked with Corsaro before -- at the Juilliard School in New 
York about six years ago just after she left her native Chile. Corsaro had 
become artistic director of the Juilliard Opera Center not long before. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very hard time for me," Villarroel remembers. "I didn't know 
English, first of all. I was very shy and afraid to express my feelings. I 
looked at (Corsaro) in a very special way when I was a student -- I respected 
him very much -- but I was always afraid of doing something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Villarroel recalls being coached by Corsaro for "some gala concert (at 
Juilliard), and I worked certain scenes with him and arias. His class was about 
taking the feelings from your life into your singing. Then it didn't make so 
much sense to me, because I was very young and experimenting with things, but 
now I know what he meant, what he wanted to tell me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had sung one aria of Liu in 'Turandot.' Then he asked me to take a seat and 
try to remember some period in my life when I was very sad. And I remembered 
when I left Chile for the first time and that brought tears to my eyes. And 
then he made me sing with the tears -- with my throat closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when I sang the aria that time, feeling like that, he told me, 'That is 
what I want, this is it, this is the feeling you have to bring out in the aria 
when you are singing it.' And that's what I try to remember each time I do my 
work -- to bring my experiences in the work that I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Corsaro was born in New York, studied at the Yale Drama School and made his 
operatic debut as a director in 1958 with Carlisle Floyd's "Susannah" at New 
York City Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 He married a singer with that company, Mary Cross ("Bonnie") Lueders, in 1971. 
They have one son and live in New York. His Broadway (non-operatic) directing 
credits include "The Night of the Iguana" and "A Hatful of Rain." But he also 
paints, plays the piano and occasionally acts. 
</P>
<P>
 If his approach to working with singers seems remarkably similar to the 
celebrated Stanislavsky Method, Americanized by the late Lee Strasberg at the 
Actors Studio in New York, it's no coincidence. Since 1988, Corsaro has been 
artistic director of that legendary theatrical institution -- a responsibility, 
he acknowledges, that has made him something of an operatic dropout. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last six years I have not done as much opera as I would have liked to 
-- or as much theater," he says. "I became the artistic director of the Actors 
Studio and the artistic director of the Juilliard Opera Center and could only 
work (on outside projects) when I had a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I have now gotten to a point where I feel I've established what I'm doing 
(at Juilliard and the Studio), and I intend to do more work in opera. I was not 
a dropout by design, just by force of circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
 His tenure at the Studio has not exactly been free of controversy -- 
especially after the recent announcement of a master of fine arts program to be 
run jointly by the Studio and the New School for Social Research. "The fact 
that we are going into a relationship with the New School makes a very big 
difference," Corsaro says, "one that will affect the whole future of the Studio 
because the Studio will be depending on the New School for funding." 
</P>
<P>
 Corsaro also has a vision of turning the Studio into the American national 
theater, where what he calls "the common language that has been developed 
between playwrights, actors and directors" can flourish in public performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "That language derives from the actor," he says. "The techniques derived from 
working with the actor are those that directors and playwrights employ." 
</P>
<P>
 He calls the Studio members who object to his plans and policies "those who 
wish to drag it back to an antediluvian morass. Most of the people who are 
complaining are perennial students. They'd rather remain students than take 
that work -- which I understand as well if not better than they do, having 
worked with Strasberg -- and really move it to what the work was intended for: 
professional theater." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: "You don't learn how to sing and then not use it as a 
performer. You don't learn to act unless you use it in performance." Coming 
from someone who's spent most of his career working with singing actors, the 
statement proves doubly conclusive. Vital Stats

ART; ARTIST OR PATRON: WHO'S IN DRIVER'S SEAT?; HIRO YAMAGATA TRIES TO 
TRANSFORM HIS IMAGE WITH A SHOW OF DECORATED VINTAGE MERCEDES-BENZES AT 
STRUGGLING MUNICIPAL ART GALLERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An advertising blitz for a wealthy artist known mainly for his phenomenal 
success in the commercial print business and for his philanthropic activities 
has raised eyebrows in the art world. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballyhooed on banners all over town and on a Sunset Strip billboard, Hiro 
Yamagata's "Earthly Paradise" opens to the public Sept. 13 at the Municipal Art 
Gallery featuring a series of fully restored 1950-52 Mercedes Benz Cabriolets 
whose exteriors are painted with tropical landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotional efforts are so out of whack with what usually goes on at the 
city-owned, poverty-stricken gallery that many art aficionados suspect a 
payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, according to the artist and exhibition curator Ed Leffingwell, who 
agreed to the show in 1991 when he was director of the gallery. Yamagata has 
given a $250,000 grant to a private support group that retains Leffingwell and 
supports exhibitions at the Muni and other local institutions, but that gift 
was made a year after his exhibition was booked, Yamagata says, and the money 
is being used for other projects. He is paying all expenses for "Earthly 
Paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 And how much is that? He throws up his arms and rolls his eyes in response to 
the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamagata, a 46-year-old artist who was born in Japan and has lived in Los 
Angeles since 1978, is an energetic, personable fellow who has lots of friends 
in high places but appears quite guileless. Without prompting, he readily 
admits that he hasn't been taken seriously by art people who matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have tried to show my work in museums, but everyone says, 'You are too 
commercial' or, 'You are a shopping-center artist,' " he lamented during a 
recent interview in his Malibu studio. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his well-connected promoters, notably dealer Fred Hoffman, say that the 
show is an attempt to transform Yamagata's image as an artist. He has made a 
fortune by producing wildly popular prints for Martin Lawrence Limited Editions 
Inc. Galleries. Indeed, he was the firm's hottest seller until 1990, when his 
contract expired. But the deal confined him to commercial publishing, Yamagata 
said. "It was a Catch-22, or maybe a Catch-44."  
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he has emerged as a generous philanthropist who supports the 
arts, education and AmFAR's campaign for AIDS research. Priding himself on 
taking quick action while others only talk about problems, he has garnered 
admiration in rarefied circles of politics, society, show business and even at 
Los Angeles' Museum of Contemporary Art and New York's Museum of Modern Art, 
where he has funded major exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Yamagata hopes that "Earthly Paradise" will change the image of his 
work in the art world. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with a splashy private party on Friday night (honoring Elizabeth 
Taylor for her contributions to AIDS research), the show is being promoted as 
Yamagata's "first major American museum exhibition." A worldwide tour including 
sites in America, Europe and Japan is in the planning stages. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind the lushly painted cars is to merge beautiful examples of 
technology with the presence of nature, Yamagata says. "I'm not talking about 
'Back to Nature' or 'Save the Earth.' " Instead, he asks viewers to pay 
attention to wonders of nature that are all around them -- in drops of water, 
rainbows, skies and gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the point, he and about 20 assistants are painting collage-like images 
-- mostly derived from photographs Yamagata has taken in Fiji -- on vintage 
automobiles that he has salvaged and restored. Eight cars -- six fully painted 
and two in process -- are in the Muni exhibition, but ultimately he plans to 
complete two dozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamagata credits art patron Stanley Grinstein with making the connection that 
led to the Los Angeles show. They met through a mutual friend, the late 
composer John Cage, according to Yamagata, and worked together on a local 
presentation of an Andy Warhol documentary film. Grinstein -- a longtime member 
of the Directors of LAX: The Los Angeles Exhibition, a private group that was 
founded to support the Muni but currently has no formal connection to the 
gallery -- suggested that Yamagata take his exhibition proposal to Leffingwell. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went nuts," Yamagata says, recalling Leffingwell's response to models of 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Confirming that he accepted the show on its aesthetic and conceptual merit, 
Leffingwell says: "I'm always interested in the interface between popular 
culture and fine art." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, he says, "Earthly Paradise" is "in the lineage of other car 
shows," such as past exhibitions at MOCA and the Laguna Art Museum. 
</P>

Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery, Barnsdall Art Park, 4800 Hollywood Blvd.

POP MUSIC; LEARNING TO DEAL WITH SMASHING SUCCESS; FROM THE RECORDING STUDIO TO 
LOLLAPALOOZA, THE PRESSURE ON BILLY CORGAN -- ESPECIALLY THE SELF-IMPOSED KIND 
-- JUST NEVER LETS UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For the first time in Lollapalooza's four-year history, the headliner this 
summer hasn't been upstaged by one of its support groups -- a la Nine Inch 
Nails' eclipsing of Jane's Addiction in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Smashing Pumpkins -- who were bumped into the headline slot after 
Nirvana pulled out of the tour shortly before Kurt Cobain's suicide -- have far 
exceeded expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Billy Corgan, the soft-spoken leader of the Chicago quartet, has never 
been one to brag about the success of his band. Even after the group's 1993 
album, "Siamese Dream," went platinum, the low-key singer and guitarist still 
talked often about his doubts and insecurities as a songwriter -- and 
downplayed the importance of the Pumpkins altogether. (Virgin Records will 
release "Pisces Iscariot," a collection of rare or previously unreleased 
Pumpkins material, on Oct. 4.) 
</P>
<P>
 As the tour wraps up with shows today and Monday at Cal State Dominguez Hills' 
Velodrome, Corgan, 27, spoke about the effect of "Siamese Dream" and 
Lollapalooza on the band. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What's it like coming on at the end of a 10-hour Lollapalooza 
concert? Is it hard trying to energize the audience after such a long day? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Absolutely. We initially wanted to play the second-to-last slot, but 
it just worked out that we were headliners, so we had to adjust our thinking. 
But even though we're the headliners, we know we're not the main attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you consider to be the main attraction? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The whole show overall. I don't think we've (reached) the kind of status 
that would define the whole Lollapalooza thing. That's why we didn't want the 
last slot. You need more well-known songs to pull that off, where we only have 
two that people might know. It's been daunting. I feel like we've had to fly by 
our wits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: From audience and press reactions, though, it seems you have been pulling 
it off. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, that's the challenge. You just have to go on doing what you're doing, 
even if it's not gonna be easy -- and do it in such a strong way that it 
doesn't leave a lot of doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Which band has impressed you the most on the tour?  
</P>
<P>
 A: To me the most impressive has been Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds because 
they're so damn good under such terrible circumstances -- 3 o'clock in the 
afternoon . . . playing in front that whole empty-seats kind of thing. They 
really define greatness because they just refuse to suck. I've also enjoyed 
Flaming Lips (a second-stage band earlier in the tour) -- and L7 have been good 
as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are some of the specific elements you look for when listening to other 
people's music? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There's plenty of good music out there, but a lot of it's so bland and 
unoriginal, and it seems so uninspired. Like these days, I'm working harder and 
harder to find real inspiration. It's like there's so many Stone Temple Pilots 
that basically take what's already been done and just do a decent job of it. As 
there's a greater proliferation of grunge-era bands it's harder and harder to 
find any original intent or point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Last year, you talked a lot about the pressure and weighty expectations you 
felt in between your first album, "Gish," and "Siamese Dream." It really seemed 
to stress you out. Are those pressures still part of your life?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I feel more an artistic pressure than a commercial pressure. Not to sound 
snide, but I feel I could always make a record that could sell, but it's not 
about that for me anymore. Back then, I felt this pressure that if we weren't 
successful that we would just be passed over. I had a lot of my own personal 
insecurities involved there too. Can I write the three-minute pop song? It 
really seems trivial to me now after everything I've been through in the past 
year. I'm old enough now to just want to define myself artistically. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So what are some of those changes you are referring to that you experienced 
in the past year?  
</P>
<P>
 A: While doing the last album, I had to come to grips with a lot of things -- 
the way the band interacted, my own feelings about myself and what I wanted out 
of my music. I just found I really want to pursue what I want artistically. I'm 
more comfortable in the role of enigmatic, difficult artist that makes good 
music than I am as the guy who writes three-minute pop songs that will change 
the world. It strengthened my intent, because I was kind of wishy-washy there 
for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Lollapalooza '94 will be over Monday. What is the first thing you are going 
to do when you get home?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I usually lay in bed for three days. That's pretty much typical post-tour 
mode. I still have to do something musical though . . . so I'll probably make 
tapes off my favorite albums. Then after that, I'll slowly start picking up the 
guitar and start all over again. I plan to make a double CD after that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's your relationship with the rest of the band like now? It was a 
little bumpy there for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's all right. I just completely readjusted my thinking and kind of laid 
off them. I've stopped looking to everyone to help me get what my mind's set on 
-- in other words, sitting around waiting for other people to write songs and 
pull an album together. I just now accept that I'm gonna write every song. It's 
no longer a me versus them. I just take it upon myself to accept most of the 
responsibilities and not be bitter or passive-aggressive. It's not the 
situation I always want to be in, though. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the ideal band situation, then? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Where I would just be the singer and the guitarist and wouldn't have all 
these other responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can you realistically do that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, that's a question everyone asks, including me. Vital Stats

 A recent exchange at a big electronics chain store in Hollywood went like 
this: 
</P>
<P>
 Customer: Do you repair turntables? 
</P>
<P>
 Salesperson: Is it more than 5 years old? 
</P>
<P>
 Customer: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Salesperson: Was it bought here? 
</P>
<P>
 Customer: No. 
</P>
<P>
 Salesperson: Then we don't repair it, because the parts are too hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
 Customer: How about new turntables -- do you still carry those? 
</P>
<P>
 Salesperson: Yes, but we only have two brands. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sound familiar?  
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, this scenario has played out time and again. With CDs all but 
replacing vinyl, the turntable industry has gone into decline. Many 
manufacturers have shut down and parts often aren't available. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite ominous predictions from the audio world, vinyl and turntables 
have not gone the way of the dinosaur. The market has shrunk drastically, to be 
sure, but like some stubborn and elusive marsupial that has made its peace with 
evolution, analog has clung on and refuses to die. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was tremendous shakeout and the industry hit rock bottom around the 
late 1980s, but now we're seeing it edging back," says Ivan Berger, technical 
editor for Audio magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 While record sales are minuscule compared to the hundreds of millions sold 
during vinyl's heyday, they did increase 80% in the first six months of 1994 
compared to the same period in 1993, climbing from 500,000 to 900,000 units, 
according to the Recording Industry Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Some turntable manufacturers also report modest increases. After years of 
stagnant sales, Technics says, sales are up slightly. Audiophile Systems, which 
imports Linn Hi-Fi turntables from Scotland that run from $600 to $6,000, says 
sales this summer rose between 10% and 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's surprising," admits Gary Warzin, president of Audiophile Systems, "and 
we don't have a good clue as to why it's happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the CD industry needn't worry: In 1993, 20 million CD players were 
sold, compared to only 300,000 turntables, according to the Electronics 
Industry Assn. But today's analog customers can choose from 41 manufacturers 
turning out more than 100 turntable models, according to Audio magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 They range from $100 for a bottom-of-the-line Pioneer PL-203AZ to $30,000 for 
a Rockport Technologies Sirius Limited Edition model. Technics, which sells 
more than 30% of the turntables on the market, says that its most popular model 
is the classic SL 1200 Mark II, which has been around for almost two decades 
and costs about $500. 
</P>
<P>
 The turntable is especially popular with deejays and, according to a study 
done by Technics, the United States has 6 million amateur deejays. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still a large number of people out there who are avid vinyl 
collectors, and this customer doesn't want a $50 turntable. They want a $500 
turntable," says Andrew Nelkin, assistant general manager of Technics, which is 
based in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Those looking for the most complete guide to audio can consult Audio 
magazine's equipment directory published each October. The 1994 edition, which 
is just going to print, illustrates what happened in analog since last year: 
Turntable manufacturers jumped from 34 to 41. There are now 112 models to 
choose from, up from 110 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more and more companies in the field and the people who have stayed 
in are finding it's a nice little moneymaker," Berger says. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Andy Payor, chief designer and owner of Rockport Technologies in 
Rockport, Me., which makes the most expensive turntable on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he sold 25 of his top-of-the-line models, which retail for $30,000; 
audiophiles on a budget may want to consider Rockport's $20,000 turntable. 
Payor sold just 12 of those. 
</P>
<P>
 "If cost is not an issue and you want the best possible performance, this is 
generally where you end up," Payor says. 
</P>
<P>
 Those looking for a lower-end turntable can try chains like Adray's, 
Robinson-May, Circuit City, Broadway and stores like Ametron-American 
Electrical Supply Inc. in Hollywood, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Customers willing to pay for better sound patronize stores like Brooks Berdan 
Ltd. in Monrovia, which stocks up to 30 different brands of new and used 
turntables that range in price from $700 to $15,000. The store also repairs 
high-end turntables. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks Berdan, the owner, probably knows as much about the turntable business 
as anyone around today. He says there are lots of bargains to be found in used 
models since people began replacing their analog systems with digital 
equipment. Brands such as VPI, Rega, AR, System Deck, Linn and Oracle -- some 
of which cost thousands of dollars new -- can be purchased for between $100 and 
$400 and still provide years of listening pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 When buying a used turntable, Berdan suggests replacing the cartridge or 
taking it to a good shop to make sure everything is calibrated and in working 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 Even better deals are available for those willing to haunt garage sales and 
thrift shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can go to garage sales and pick up classic turntables of the 1960s and 
1970s for nothing, for $5 or $10; people are getting rid of them like they're 
cancerous," says Michael Fremer, senior music editor of Absolute Sound, an 
audiophile magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Some good buys: models by AR (Acoustic Research) and Dual 1019 and 1219 
turntables. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding parts for existing turntables can be more tricky. Adray's, for 
instance, stocks an $8 Sony turntable belt but no cartridges. Radio Shack, on 
the other hand, carries cartridges. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular cartridges is a Stanton 681, which costs less than 
$100 and has a stiff cantilever that deejays can use to scratch and back-cue. 
For the connoisseur, there are also exotic cartridges handmade in Japan, which 
can cost more than many people's entire sound system. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Berdan's store, other places that repair turntables include the 
Panasonic Technics Quasar Repair Center in Canoga Park and Ametron in 
Hollywood. Some mom-and-pop electrical shops also repair turntables, but those 
with expertise in the technology are getting harder to find. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs can take a week or more, depending on the availability of parts. 
Ametron, which charges $45 per hour for labor, says it repairs all the models 
still being manufactured and some that aren't, provided it can scrounge up 
parts. That can be tough for models more than 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 But analog fans say that the search is worth it. Loretta Milazzo, a paralegal 
from Eagle Rock who owns both a turntable and a CD player, grumbled at the 
price but recently spent $75 for a new cartridge rather than junk her turntable 
and get rid of her records. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many people want to drop their entire record collection? It's like 
getting rid of your childhood," Milazzo says. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over analog versus digital has raged since the CD first began 
usurping market share from the LP, Peter Goldmark's plastic creation developed 
at CBS Labs in 1948 as an alternative to less durable 78-rpm records. 
</P>
<P>
 M any audiophiles say that re cords have a warmer sound, although CD buffs 
disagree. Some also talk wistfully of the rituals that accompany vinyl. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an aesthetic pleasure in cleaning a record, in handling the LP, that 
was missing from the 78 and CD," Berger says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The artwork is big and bold and easy to read. The cardboard feels much nicer 
on your fingers than plastic. The liner notes are all there in the back, you 
don't have to turn page after teeny little page. There's pleasure in holding a 
12-inch disc carefully by its edges that's simply not there when you pop a 
button." 
</P>
<P>
 That hasn't been lost on those who market music. Blue Note Records, which 
stopped releasing LPs in 1990, changed its mind this year and reissued classic 
jazz recordings by Ornette Coleman, Wayne Shorter and Bobby Hutcherson on CD 
and vinyl to attract deejays, audiophiles and collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The vinyl subculture also includes grunge rockers. Pearl Jam sold 50,000 
copies of its latest album on vinyl. Sub Pop Records in Seattle issues 
everything on vinyl and many smaller labels have never stopped putting out 
dance, rap and alternative rock on LP formats. 
</P>
<P>
 Analog is certainly cheaper than digital: Garden-variety records cost about $9 
each these days, compared to $5.99 or $6.99 in the early 1980s. But CDs cost an 
average of $14 to $16. 
</P>
<P>
 With the renewed interest in records, Fremer of Absolute Sound says he wants 
to write a handbook to teach young people how to handle records and turntables. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, because each cartridge has its own configuration, installing it 
incorrectly makes for music that "is like seeing a movie out of focus," Fremer 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, kids getting into this have no idea where to turn. They go to 
Radio Shack and the kid working at Radio Shack has no idea where to turn," he 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now's the time to show them how to do it right, because the (vinyl) knowledge 
is being lost. Otherwise this is going to be a short-term fad."

 Laguna Beach, long dormant in the PCL race, broke a 17-game league losing 
streak against Estancia last year. The Artists, with more experience than 
usual, may finally have a chance to surpass the break-even mark in league. 
Still, they must compensate for the graduation of Pat Wood, who passed for more 
than 1,500 yards, and develop additional speed and strength. Pivaroff had five 
interceptions last year and has been an all-league defender the past two years; 
he moves to QB from wide receiver (21 catches, 15.8 average). Weenig was a 
second-team all-leaguer a year ago. In their 60th year, a playoff appearance 
would be a nice touch for the Artists. SCHEDULE

 Laguna Hills loses a rival with Trabuco Hills (7-3, 4-1) moving into the South 
Coast League, but it may find an easier path to the PCL title. The Hawks are 
the perennial favorites, though Costa Mesa and Trabuco Hills battled for the 
Southern Section championship last year. Laguna Hills' physical strength should 
be an asset. Zolikoff was an all-leaguer and Zadeh and McGraw were 
second-teamers. Zolikoff and McGraw have the potential to be all-county type of 
players, and McGraw is being recruited heavily. The Hawks are a little short on 
experience, though. SCHEDULE

 Jahid attempted only three passes last year and it's unlikely the Eagles' 
offense will take flight through the air. The strength of the team is in its 
offensive line and Candlish, Muro, Johnson and Herman. The offense should be 
able to advance the ball with Backy Gonzalez, who is a real talent; he averaged 
4.4 yards per carry in six games after being summoned from the junior varsity.

</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa reached a Southern Section championship game last year with only 21 
players, and the Mustangs will face similar prospects this year. But Miller has 
shown he can win with only a handful of players, and like last year's team, 
this one is athletic. Reeves is a lot like Crenshaw and Chatman, and Miller 
says he has four players who are in the 4.6-second 40-yard dash range. Like 
Crenshaw and Chatman, Weir was named All-Southern Section. Crenshaw averaged 
7.9 yards per carry and scored eight touchdowns in the regular season. He was 
also a defensive terror. The problem is that the team is small, with only one 
player over 240 pounds (Weir), and seven players are going both ways--Crenshaw, 
Chatman, Weir, Reeves, Taylor, Herzog and Morin. A couple of injuries could 
really wreak havoc. However, if a team is going to be small in size and numbers 
and still contend for the league title, this is the league to do it in.

<P>
 The Wolverines open their first varsity campaign as a member of the Pacific 
Coast League, but the second-year school isn't opening with a clean slate. They 
actually played one varsity game last year, a 42-0 loss to Calvary Chapel. It 
could be tough again--there are only six seniors on the team that went 5-5 
against junior varsity competition in 1993. There is some hope for the future, 
though, because the freshmen were 8-1. SCHEDULE

SPLASH HIT MAGIC NUMBER IN REGULAR-SEASON FINALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty victories. There is something about the number that is important to 
Splash Coach George Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash beat the Arizona Sandsharks, 10-6, Saturday before 8,336 at The 
Pond and closed out the regular season with record of 20-8.Only the Dallas 
Sidekicks (23-4) have as many victories in the Continental Indoor Soccer 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (20 victories) puts us above and beyond everybody else," Fernandez said. 
"It gives us a little more respectability and gives us a two-game lead (over 
San Diego), so people can't say we were fortunate to win the division." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rod Castro, whose two goals gave the Splash a 5-3 lead after trailing, 
3-1, said the team's attitude going into next Saturday's playoff game against 
the Sacramento Knights (15-12) at The Pond is important. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we can go in on a roll and concentrate on our opponent," Castro said, 
"rather than worry about what we're doing wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash did little wrong, scoring five consecutive goals in a 17-minute 
span, beginning late in the second quarter, to take a 6-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Sandsharks (10-17) pulled to 7-6, the Splash closed it out with 
three consecutive goals, including Paul McDonnell's third and Denis Hamlett's 
second of the night -- both with Arizona using a sixth attacker.

BUHLER RUSHES FOR 248 YARDS, FIVE TOUCHDOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California Christian running back Ken Buhler rushed for 248 yards and 
five touchdowns in a 42-0 victory over Maui Kaahumanu Hou late Friday at Maui 
War Memorial Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Buhler, a senior running back, carried 12 times and scored on runs of 30, 12, 
8, 72 and 16 yards. His five rushing touchdowns were one short of the Orange 
County record shared by SCC graduate Mike Jacot, who did it in 1991 against 
Capistrano Valley Christian. Quarterback Steve Schinhofen scored the Flames' 
other touchdown on a one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 SCC (1-0) outgained Kaahumanu Hou (0-2) on the ground, 360 to minus-seven. Ron 
Wood rushed six times for 74 yards and Jeremy Smith had two carries for 48 
yards.

<P>
 Georgia's district attorneys and superior court judges may be in danger of 
seeing their credit ratings erode after the U.S. Postal Service managed to lose 
1,000 state paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say the checks, addressed to some of Georgia's most powerful 
residents, vanished last week after a postal worker picked them up at a 
downtown office building. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the intended paycheck recipients are the state's 46 district attorneys, 
142 superiors court judges and some members of their staffs, all of whom are 
paid only once a month.

E. HORNSBY WASSON; FORMER HEAD OF PACIFIC TELEPHONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 E. Hornsby Wasson, former president and chairman of Pacific Telephone & 
Telegraph Co. and Bell Telephone Co. of Nevada, has died. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasson, who headed the utility from 1965 until his retirement in 1970, died 
Aug. 27 in Chattanooga, Tenn., where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 He also served one term as chairman and many years as a member of the board of 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasson's career with the telephone company spanned 44 years. He began in 1926 
as a salesman for Southern Bell Telephone Co. in Chattanooga and worked for 
that division in four other states. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1950, Wasson was named vice president for public relations at Northwestern 
Bell Telephone in Omaha and two years later moved to New York City as a vice 
president of American Telephone & Telegraph Co. He was president of New Jersey 
Bell from 1959 until 1965, when he moved to San Francisco to assume the Pacific 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Educated at McCallie School and the University of Tennessee, both in 
Chattanooga, Wasson served as a trustee of both and in 1977 was named the 
university's outstanding alumnus. He also served as chairman of Stanford 
Research Institute International. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasson was a board member of several major companies, including Standard Oil 
of California, which named a supertanker in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Widowed twice, Wasson is survived by a son and a daughter, three sisters, two 
grandchildren and one great-grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the Hospice of 
Chattanooga, 165 Hamm Road, Chattanooga, Tenn. 37405.

P. DE DOMINGO; SINGER, OPERA STAR'S MOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pepita Embil de Domingo, known as Mexico's "Queen of the Zarzuela" and the 
mother of opera tenor Placido Domingo, has died in Mexico City. She was 76. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Embil de Domingo, who was born in Spain but lived in Mexico for 40 years, 
died Aug. 28 of a liver ailment, the opera star's publicist Nancy Seltzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her late husband, Placido Domingo Ferrer, were stars of the zarzuela, 
a three-century-old form of opera in which music is intertwined with dialogue. 
They toured the world promoting it as an art form. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Embil de Domingo, a soprano, began singing with a Basque choral group in 
Spain and met her husband, a baritone, when both were asked to sing "Sor 
Navarra." They fell in love with Mexico City and moved there permanently in 
1946. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple founded an 80-member operetta company and performed many zarzuelas 
written especially for them. She also was host of a Mexican television program 
called "Anthologia de Zarzuela." 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband, who died in 1987, encouraged the young Placido to take 
piano lessons, and guided his musical education and early career. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter, Mari Pepa Sanchez, and 
several grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to Friends of Mexican 
Development Foundation, Lerma Housing and Clinic Project, 165 East 72nd St. 
Suite 1B, New York, N.Y., 10021.

BARBARA AVEDON; 'CAGNEY & LACEY' CO-CREATOR, PEACE ACTIVIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbara Hammer Avedon, who co-created the popular television police 
partnership of two women, Chris Cagney and Mary Beth Lacey -- cracking the 
stereotype that a series had to have male heroes to be successful -- has died 
at the age of 64. 
</P>
<P>
 A family spokesman said she died of cancer Wednesday in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Avedon also was a founder of Another Mother for Peace, organized in 
Beverly Hills during the stormy days of the Vietnam War protest movement. The 
longtime screenwriter and political activist was among the first to find a 
voice for her feminist views on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 The motto of Another Mother for Peace, "War Is Not Healthy for Children and 
Other Living Things," became a byword for war protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 With Barney Rosenzweig and Barbara Corday, Ms. Avedon created single, 
ambitious and attractive policewoman Chris Cagney and played her off Mary Beth 
Lacey, a dedicated police officer, wife and mother. "Cagney & Lacey" was set in 
the grand tradition of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and other 
male-dominated action epics, and until "Thelma and Louise" came along it was 
considered a singularly successful sample of women as both caring and 
cantankerous friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The series ran from 1982 until 1988, with Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless in the 
lead roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Avedon also helped write two Cagney and Lacey movies of the week: "Cagney 
& Lacey Together Again" and "The Return." Another of her television movies was 
"This Girl's for Hire" in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 She began as an episodic writer for "The Donna Reed Show," "Father Knows Best" 
and "Bewitched." 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include a son, Joshua Avedon, and brother, Bruce Hammer.

MUDSLIDE BLOCKS INTERSTATE 70, TRAPS CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heavy rain sent mud, rocks and charred debris pouring from a burned-over 
mountain and across a highway, injuring at least two people and blocking the 
road in both directions. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 cars were trapped in as much as six feet of mud on Interstate 70 
until snowplows scraped it away Friday, Garfield County officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mudslide came down Storm King Mountain, where 14 firefighters died in July 
fighting one of the deadliest fires in U.S. Forest Service history, county 
spokesman Dale Hancock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cari Howard, 28, of Rifle and Kevin White, 20, of Glenwood Springs were 
hospitalized in fair condition, a nursing supervisor at Valley View Hospital in 
Glenwood Springs said.

SCOTT HARRIS: AT 80, SHE'S STILL GETTING HER ACT TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An actor's resume always features a bushel of credits. A listing of Estelle 
Busch's television work includes parts in "Thirtysomething," "The Patty Hearst 
Story," "Divorce Court," "General Hospital" and "Busty Dusty." 
</P>
<P>
 Busty Dusty?  
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, that," the actress says, laughing. "That was for the Playboy Channel! It 
was a raunchy thing!" 
</P>
<P>
 Something about "Busty Dusty" reminded Estelle, still laughing, of another 
production, another role. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh! I did a scene with O.J.!" 
</P>
<P>
 Not just a scene, but a love scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it was disappointing to learn that Estelle was not O.J.'s love interest. 
But then, Estelle just celebrated her 80th birthday and this wasn't a remake of 
"Harold and Maude." But if you happen to attend an O.J. film festival someday 
and catch the obscure cable production "First & Ten," pay attention to the 
scene in which O.J. and his paramour seek romantic refuge in the women's room. 
The lady in the stall who can't help but eavesdrop -- that's Estelle. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that these may not be the roles of a lifetime, but then Estelle 
Busch's first love is the stage, not TV or film. And while it's also true that 
her name may not be as familiar as, say, Jessica Tandy's, Estelle Busch has 
just as surely lived a life in the theater. After 72 years acting, directing, 
producing and teaching -- as well as a considerable amount of agitating -- 
Estelle may qualify as a grand dame of Equity waiver theater, those humble, 
no-frills productions that under union rules may play before no more than 99 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 16 years, she's presided over the operations of the Synthaxis 
Theatre Company, a North Hollywood-based group known for staging youth-oriented 
and women-oriented works. She is now busy planning for the day when Synthaxis 
moves into the expanded Lankershim Arts Center, in the heart of the NoHo arts 
district, which radiates from the crossroads of Lankershim and Magnolia. 
Synthaxis teamed with the Road Theatre Company, the Martin Dancers and the Los 
Angeles Printmaking Society to form a coalition selected by the City Council 
over other applicants to occupy "the Lankershim" to provide service to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next few months, the Lankershim will remain occupied not by artists, 
but by construction workers who are renovating the interior of this landmark, a 
prime example of streamline moderne design. The renovation includes the 
remodeling of bathrooms and the addition of an elevator to enable people with 
disabilities to reach the second-floor theater -- Synthaxis's future home. 
</P>
<P>
 When we met at the Lankershim the other day, Estelle provided me with a stack 
of letters showing how, 15 years ago, she was active in the campaign for the 
City Council to designate the building a historic landmark. Even then, 
Synthaxis was hoping to move in. 
</P>
<P>
 "So now, here we are," she says. "We've come full circle." 
</P>
<P>
 Patience paid off. Estelle, who first took the stage at age 8 in New York's 
Yiddish theater, seems to take the long view. She is an ardent, relentless 
promoter who exhibited the energy of someone 40 years younger as we walked up 
and down the long staircase at the Lankershim and then strolled up to Eagles 
coffeehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Estelle, who was widowed in 1970, also looks much younger than 80. Although 
she basks in the compliments, her youthful appearance isn't always an asset. 
Her agent sends her to audition for little old lady roles -- but Estelle is 
usually cast as someone in her 60s. She may have to wait until she hits 100 to 
get those roles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, one solution is for Estelle to cast herself. The Lankershim's 
upstairs theater is a small space -- Estelle envisions seating for 48 -- but it 
will do fine. She envisions community acting workshops and a variety of 
productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Next spring, Estelle anticipates stepping back on stage in "A Woman's Place," 
the one-woman show in which she portrays seven prominent women in U. S. 
history. She suggests that this play, created with her longtime friend Alice 
Josephs, may represent her finest work. She glows describing the response "A 
Woman's Place" has received since its premiere in Scotland in 1979 at the 
National Festival of Women's Theatre. Another point of pride is "Window Panes," 
an examination of the lives of five older women amid today's youth-oriented 
society. Josephs collaborated on that work as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Offstage, she has made many contributions. She was instrumental in organizing 
the Pact Theatre in 1969, the Los Angeles Theater Alliance (serving as its 
first administrator) and the group Women in Theatre. Synthaxis is a member of 
the Valley Theatre League. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the sort of career that inspired the City Council to recognize her 
birthday by presenting Estelle with one of those handsome framed documents 
heavy with calligraphy and the word whereas . 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution commends "this extraordinary and uniquely creative individual 
for her lifelong commitment, keen professionalism and numerous contributions to 
culturally enriching our lives and enhancing the quality of life in the City of 
Los Angeles."

 Bird Walk--A guided birding tour of the Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve 
will be offered Saturday at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Fall is a great time to spot large populations of wintering shorebirds and 
waterfowl, as well as a variety of land birds. Birders should expect to see 
terns, grebes, gulls, egrets and herons. Birds also sighted in the area, but 
tougher to spot, include belted kingfishers, northern harriers, California 
gnatcatchers and ospreys. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a time of year when shorebirds can be difficult to identify, so an 
expert birder will be on hand to help experienced people sort out the 
combinations of summer, winter and juvenile plumages. A second expert will help 
beginning birders identify species. 
</P>
<P>
 Those wishing to participate should wear comfortable shoes and bring 
binoculars, a field guide and a scope, if possible.  
</P>
<P>
 The tour is free and lasts three to four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 To get there take Jamboree Road either north from East Coast Highway or south 
from Corona del Mar Freeway or San Diego Freeway. Turn northwest on San Joaquin 
Hills Road toward the bay. Go right on Backbay Drive past the big curve to the 
parking lot on the left, where the tour will begin. Information, (714) 
640-6746.

SOME SEATTLE HOMELESS GO JOY RIDING ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY; COMPUTERS: 
THE DOWNTOWN LIBRARY ALLOWS THE PUBLIC FREE HOOKUP ON INTERNET, AND THOSE WHO 
HAVE NOTHING BUT TIME SPEND HOURS TINKERING ON THE WORLDWIDE NETWORK. 
</P>

<P>
 By night, 25-year-old Rodney Lindsey retires to his room in a homeless shelter 
at the old Pacific Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 By day, he explores the outer reaches of Russia, China, Germany, Switzerland 
-- wherever the power of Internet takes him. 
</P>
<P>
 As 9 a.m. approaches each day, Lindsey and a cadre of other homeless people 
can be found outside the downtown Seattle Public Library, waiting for first 
crack at one of about 35 terminals that will allow them free hookup to the 
global matrix of worldwide computer networks known as Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, short on money, long on time, down on luck, the Internet has become 
a safety net. It beats the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my high," Lindsey said, peeling himself away from the computer terminal 
one recent morning to talk with a reporter. "I don't do any drugs. I don't 
drink. I've got to have some high." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Seattle became the first major public library to provide public 
access to the Internet in July, 1993, some of the most avid users have been a 
group of homeless people who have come to be known simply as The Internetters. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't have physical addresses but can be reached in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
 Their numbers range from a dozen to two. Some spend an hour or two on the 
terminal, others the whole day. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey, a self-professed Internet junkie, boasts of once having spent 72 
hours straight on the net: When the downtown library closed at 9 p.m., he 
resumed his internetting at the University of Washington's computer science lab 
a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I did use the bathroom, but that was it," Lindsey said. "But I didn't 
sleep, I didn't eat. I just internetted." 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle Public Library offers direct Internet hookups to only about 10 
"gateways," such as the Library of Congress and White House News. But the 
Netters have figured out ways to hop out of the library's menu system and 
"telnet," or connect onto just about any other public terminal on the worldwide 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, they've discovered bulletin boards, databases, games, chat lines, 
MUDs (multi-user dimensions, a kind of computer-simulated environment), and 
e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
 They can play "Star Wars" with someone in Brazil, then drop a line to 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have gotten so adept that other Internet users often come to them for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have all day to explore you can become pretty expert, and that's why 
some of them are able to teach our staff or other patrons," said Jim Taylor, 
the library's coordinator for automated services. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey found himself on the streets after being booted out of the Navy in 
January, 1993, for reasons he wouldn't disclose. He uses Internet to explore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it as a bank vault, with no guards, trying to get in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am able to go anywhere and everywhere and mess with anybody. I can get into 
Russia, Japan, China, Switzerland, Germany, England, anywhere in the United 
States, Canada, Mexico. I'm unlimited." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Cooper, 41, uses the Internet to research witchcraft and to correspond 
with a Maryland woman he "met" through a bulletin board. The electronic 
conversations, he said, have been encouraging and uplifting. 
</P>
<P>
 "She gives me more of a positive attitude," Cooper said. "A lot of that rubs 
off on me through the computer." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper graduated from college in North Dakota with a degree in business 
administration. He worked for the Forest Service for 13 years and was a 
welder's assistant at a nuclear power plant in California. When he lost both 
job and wife, he found himself homeless in Seattle in February. 
</P>
<P>
 He's waiting for a hire call from Boeing Co. Meantime, he sleeps most nights 
on a cot in the basement of a church. 
</P>
<P>
 About the Internet system, he said, "I don't know about anybody else, but I 
need a little space that I can draw into. Otherwise, I'm going to go crazy. 
It's to keep my sanity more or less, to have someplace where I can feel 
comfortable and just learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank, an eloquent 25-year-old who left home at age 14, hooks up to 
interactive games on the net to kill time while looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you going to do? Are you going to sit on the curb and get a ticket?" 
he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to have a release, being able to escape and to get rid of that time 
that you really don't know what to do with, and then to come back and maybe use 
the knowledge that you've learned." 
</P>
<P>
 And on the net, Frank said, "nobody can see I'm black." 
</P>
<P>
 That sense of safety and anonymity may be what's attracting some homeless 
people to the net, says Nancy Amidei, a lecturer at the University of 
Washington's School of Social Work and coordinator of a homeless youth program. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're living on the streets or if you don't have a stable living 
situation, it's sometimes hard to connect with people in usual ways," Amidei 
says. "Anybody who's gotten themselves on e-mail or on the Internet knows once 
you get hooked in you find yourself with more friends than you can possibly 
imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nor can your correspondent see how you're dressed or where you are. It's 
classless. It's genderless. It's raceless." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's free. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the public library's missions is to provide everyone equal access to 
information, be it printed or electronic, said Craig Butold, deputy city 
librarian. Homeless people, he said, "are clearly a group that would not have 
access otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 3% of the more than 9,000 public libraries in the United States 
offer public access to the Internet, according to a June report from the U.S. 
National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. 
</P>
<P>
 Libraries from across the world have contacted Seattle for advice on setting 
up Internet access. Butold tells them to expect the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 Some patrons complain that some of the homeless people are hogging the 
terminals and making too much noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The library staff and the Internetters met to discuss the problems, and both 
sides amiably agreed to some time-use guidelines. The library also set aside 
some terminals for patrons who just wanted to search the library's catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, things have been running smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey has spent so much time on the net that he says he should be hired to 
teach others how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm learning too much," he said. "Someone's bound to say, 'Hey, you know too 
much. I want you.' "

CAVE ART ILLUMINES STORY OF LONG-LOST WORLD; ARCHEOLOGY: DRAWINGS IN TEXAS AND 
NORTHERN MEXICO WERE CREATED 3,000 TO 4,000 YEARS AGO, SCHOLARS SAY. ROCK ART 
FOUNDATION IS WORKING TO FIND AND PRESERVE THEM. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shallow caves in the river canyons of southwest Texas and northern Mexico 
harbor ancient paintings that tell the spiritual story of a long-lost world. 
</P>
<P>
 Indigenous people, not known by any formal name, created the animal and human 
figures 3,000 to 4,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Archeologists aren't sure what happened to the artists, but their pictographs 
have endured. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the cave paintings are gaining wider appreciation as the public discovers 
them and the Rock Art Foundation works to identify and preserve them while 
exploring the world of the ancient artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The paintings are the one real key to their existence," said Jim Zintgraff, a 
professional photographer who became captivated by the cave art in the 1950s 
and has been documenting it ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The art can be found on private ranches in Val Verde County. It is most 
accessible to the public at Seminole Canyon State Historical Park off U.S. 
Highway 90, about 40 miles west of Del Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thoughts behind these paintings died with the people," park guide John 
Freeman told a mesmerized group of visitors who hiked into the depths of 
Seminole Canyon one hot summer morning to view the art. 
</P>
<P>
 Archeologist Solveig Turpin of the University of Texas at Austin has spent 
much of her career searching out and studying the rock art. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a while it gets you and it just starts telling you what it is," Turpin 
said. "I think it is probably one of the most exciting things for an 
archeologist -- to be able to look at the workings of people's minds." 
</P>
<P>
 The illustrations are of animals and humans with animal features, representing 
the perilous out-of-body voyages of a shaman, or spiritual leader, Turpin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The art indicates the painters had a unified "belief system" long before the 
days of Christ, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it ranks as one of the oldest religious systems in the New World," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The art itself may have been part of a communal religious ceremony, Turpin 
said, noting the height of some of the cave pictographs, which may have 
required assistance for the artist. 
</P>
<P>
 The pictures are done in black, white, red and orange paint created from 
minerals that are believed to have been heated and ground, then mixed with some 
type of binder, possibly animal fat. 
</P>
<P>
 The sites are located primarily in the part of Val Verde County where the 
Pecos River meets the Rio Grande. There are approximately 250 known sites, many 
of which contain three, four or five works of art. A number of rock art sites 
were covered by water when nearby Lake Amistad was created. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Turpin is expanding her work into Mexico, where far fewer sites have been 
discovered but where many are suspected to exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Later art works by native people also have been found in the river region, but 
the rock drawings of shamanistic rituals have become known to researchers as 
the "Pecos" style. 
</P>
<P>
 Ancestors of the rock artists are believed to have lived in the area as long 
as 12,000 years ago after migrating to the continent across the Bering land 
bridge in Alaska. Those early inhabitants lived at a time when mammoth and 
bison roamed the region. 
</P>
<P>
 A climatic change around 7,000 or 8,000 years ago turned the area into a more 
arid land -- much like it is today -- more suited for a hunting and gathering 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have dated the rock art at 3,000 to 4,000 years old. Turpin 
believes the painting lasted less than a thousand years. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly what became of the artists isn't known. Some speculate that they 
simply vanished, dying from disease or other natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Though that makes for a more mysterious story, Turpin theorizes the rock 
artists intermingled with other people who moved in from the north or that they 
migrated elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Native people rarely disappear," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Turpin, Zintgraff and other primitive art enthusiasts are pushing 
to educate others. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, they formed the San Antonio-based Rock Art Foundation, which has 
about 300 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Property donated to the foundation in 1993 contains a well-preserved 
pictograph of a white shaman, accessible to public visitors who are escorted 
onto the property by foundation members. 
</P>
<P>
 The group recently commissioned and unveiled a 16-foot-tall sculpture at 
Seminole Canyon State Historical Park by artist Bill Worrell to honor the area 
rock art. 
</P>
<P>
 A big concern of the foundation is vandalism, a decades-old problem that has 
damaged rock art across the Southwest. The International Rock Art Congress, at 
its recent annual meeting in Arizona, spent half a day discussing vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Zintgraff and Turpin say education is one of the best ways to combat it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they understand this isn't graffiti . . . but is as much a work of art as 
a church altar or the Sistine Chapel in its own sort of way, then people aren't 
as likely to deface it if they know what it is," Turpin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zintgraff also advocates safeguarding the art with tougher anti-vandalism 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a treasure," he said, "and it should be protected."

MCKINLEY EXPEDITION BACKS EARLY CLIMBER'S CLAIM; EXPLORATION: HIS PEERS SCOFFED 
AT DR. FREDERICK COOK'S CLAIM TO BE FIRST TO REACH MT. MCKINLEY'S SUMMIT. BUT 
CLIMBERS WHO RECENTLY RETRACED HIS PATH SAY IT LOOKS AS IF HE MADE IT AFTER 
ALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the early 1900s, Dr. Frederick Cook claimed to be the first person to reach 
the summit of Mt. McKinley and the first to reach the North Pole. His peers 
laughed and called him a fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 But a group of mountain climbers who recently retraced Cook's Mt. McKinley 
path say they found proof he got closer to the top of the 20,300-foot Alaska 
peak, North America's highest, than most historians have allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there's probably no way to prove or disprove that Cook made it all 
the way, the climbers say they're confident at least some of the mudslinging he 
endured to his deathbed was unjust. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what we did is reopen a closed book," said Scott Fischer of Seattle, 
a member of the eight-member team that returned from Alaska recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to call anybody a liar. The guy's been called a liar and we don't know 
that. Now there's some pretty good evidence that maybe he wasn't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, a physician who was an outstanding Arctic and Antarctic explorer in his 
time, said he scaled the summit in 1906. His problems started three years 
later, when he returned from an Arctic expedition and said he reached the North 
Pole in April, 1908. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. Peary, a Navy civil engineer, returned from the Arctic a few days 
after Cook did. He also reported reaching the North Pole. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over who was the first to discover the pole resulted in a smear 
campaign. Cook historians say Peary attacked Cook's McKinley claim as a way to 
discredit his North Pole claim. And there's evidence Peary's camp paid $5,000 
for an affidavit from Cook's McKinley climbing partner, Ed Barill, to discredit 
Cook's story. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook was eventually expelled from the influential Explorers Club, of which he 
was once president, for perpetrating fraud, according to news accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, most historians and mountaineers credit Archdeacon Hudson Stuck and his 
party as the first ones to reach Mt. McKinley's summit, in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
 Using Cook's 1906 diary and sketches, along with other recent finds, the 
modern-day team set out to put the Cook controversy to rest. The expedition, 
led by Seattle polar historian and mountaineer Ted Heckathorn, was funded in 
part by a grant from the Frederick A. Cook Society of Hurleyville, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Three climbers -- Fischer, Doug Nixon of Oak Harbor, Wash., and Vern Tejas of 
Anchorage -- scaled a ridge at approximately 11,500 feet. What they saw and 
took photos of from there matched Cook's descriptions and sketches perfectly, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their findings would have put Cook within 10 miles of route distance from 
McKinley's summit. Most of the evidence presented against him is that he never 
got above 6,000 feet or within 20 miles route distance from the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm following what this guy wrote and the pictures he drew and I matched 
him," Fischer said. "From the same spot, he says he sees a ridge that goes to 
the summit. I'm standing on a ridge that goes to the summit." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a good possibility he reached (the top) and we certainly 
demolished the evidence against him," Heckathorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook's personal papers indicate he left behind a brass tube under some rocks 
just below the summit. Organizing an expedition to find it might be a logical 
next step, but there will always be detractors no matter what is found, 
Heckathorn said.

SENDING ECONOMIC TRADE MISSION TO VIETNAM STIRS VIVID PASSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding the trade embargo poll: You have repeated a few times (that) the 
opinions of Vietnamese people in the local community agreed with President 
Clinton's decision on lifting the embargo. I strongly think that most 
Vietnamese worldwide still very much oppose this decision, for the reason that 
human rights must and should be applied in this country first of all. 
</P>
<P>
 I have met a lot of people here and understand why they still have their 
resentment toward the Communists. At my temple, many have expressed their 
feelings for those followers in Vietnam who are forced to accept the 
regulations from the government which are totally against their religious 
tradition. Indeed, the government secretly appointed their people into the 
denominations as leaders. I also witnessed a crowd of about 3,000 demonstrators 
on the main street of Little Saigon, showing their anger. So, in your survey, 
those 800 don't scientifically represent the whole community. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Vietnamese Americans don't have enough knowledge in dealing with the 
situation. I came to the U.S. just before the fall of Saigon. As a grown person 
there, I knew how the war was.

<P>
 * I am a silent Vietnamese American of the group of 54% Vietnamese people who 
favored the full diplomatic and economic relations between Vietnamese and 
American government in the recent Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 I have to break my usual silence because there has been a minor group of 
Vietnamese who are using the title of the whole Vietnamese community to cheat 
the public for their political purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 people demonstrated recently to oppose a seminar for trading and 
investing with the Vietnamese government. They called Dr. Co Pham and his 
colleagues liars and traitors. But who really are? Let the public answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 1975, the majority of Vietnamese were victims of both the Communist 
regime and the old corrupt South Vietnamese government, which contributed 50% 
to the downfall of South Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't support either of those, of course, including remnants who fled to 
the U.S.A. and continue trying to regain their previous power using dirty 
means, like the old South Vietnamese government, to denounce the other 
factions.  
</P>
<P>
 In a democratic country like the U.S.A., although everyone can have a voice to 
express political opinions, they don't cheat the public by claiming that voice 
as that of the whole community. 
</P>
<P>
 We support all Vietnamese leaders who bring jobs, democracy and improved 
living standards to homeland Vietnamese and also the Southern California 
Vietnamese community. We support anyone who reduces the gang and crime problems 
and brings jobs to welfare recipients and unemployed people, encouraging them 
to use their spare time for job training, not for noisy street demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the silent Vietnamese, I really appreciate the Times Poll, which 
showed that most Vietnamese in Southern California do not oppose trade and full 
diplomatic relations with the current Vietnamese government.

 * You drool all over yourselves with your gushy praise ("O.C. Legislator, Gun 
Lobby Duel Over School Violence," Aug. 29) of Assemblywoman Doris Allen's bill 
AB 2752 (which directs schools to punish pupils for racist hate crimes).

 Don't you understand that if this bill passes, a high school principal can

 The issue is free speech, Times.

 AB 2752 is a bad bill and should be defeated. It'll never stand up under the

NUCLEAR POWER'S COSTS ARE HIGHEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your article "San Onofre Proposal Generates Renewed Debate" (Aug. 21) 
addressed the current controversy regarding the proposal to close the San 
Onofre nuclear power plant. Although the article did an excellent job in 
presenting the various sides of this issue, there was one significant error 
which should be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sidebar to the article a comparison was made of the relative costs of 
different sources of electricity in 1993. This indicated that the cost of using 
natural gas to produce electricity was roughly 3 cents per kilowatt hour, 1.22 
cent/kwh for coal, and only 0.537 cent/kwh for nuclear power. This indicates 
that nuclear power was by far the cheapest source of electricity in 1993. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures cited in this sidebar only account for the fuel cost of producing 
electricity, ignoring all the other associated costs.  
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison's total cost for nuclear power in 1993 was over 8 
cents/kwh. SCE's comparable cost of gas-generated power was under 5 cents/kwh, 
as was the cost of electricity from coal resources. The incomplete values 
presented in your article present a misconception that nuclear generation is 
inexpensive. Rather than being a bargain, nuclear power is one of the primary 
reasons California has among the highest electricity rates in the country.

COUNTY'S WAR ON GRAFFITI MAKING ITS MARK; IN ADDITION TO REMOVAL, PROGRAM AIMS 
TO IMPROVE EFFORTS TO PROSECUTE VANDALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is refreshing at summer's end to learn that all the news from the 
anti-graffiti front in recent months has not just been hot air. The nation's 
radio talk shows turned themselves inside out over the incident of caning as a 
punishment in Singapore, and closer to home Assemblyman Mickey Conroy 
(R-Orange) got the Legislature stirring with his ultimately unsuccessful 
paddling bill. 
</P>
<P>
 But last month, the record for Orange County's anti-graffiti program after a 
year in operation was reported, and it was an impressive one. The county's 
Graffiti Abatement Program already has eradicated more than 800,000 square feet 
of graffiti, which amounts to a considerable swath of facade around the county. 
The county was able to report that it had removed graffiti on the average of 
2.8 days after it was reported, with a goal of reducing the time eventually to 
one or two days. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to removing graffiti, the program has aimed to improve coordinated 
efforts throughout the county, and to improve on efforts to prosecute those 
responsible. The worthwhile overall goal is to stop such vandalism from 
spreading on buildings, signs and walls.  
</P>
<P>
 One particularly worthwhile component of the program is to bring in people for 
the cleanup effort who are fulfilling court community service obligations. The 
program reports that more than 65 people completed nearly 5,000 community 
service hours painting over graffiti. We have suggested previously that an 
appropriate sentence for graffiti vandals is to put them to work applying their 
elbow grease to the task of removing graffiti. Here is one violation where 
restitution is easily designed so that the punishment fits the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the war on graffiti is not won easily. Accordingly, it is good 
that the county has agreed to spend $438,000 to continue the program. The Board 
of Supervisors is to be commended for its continuing commitment to this 
important work.

CRIME AND FAMALARO'S CHILDHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your Aug. 26 story, "Famalaro's Sister Wonders Where It Started" should 
cause us all, again, to examine the idea of prevention when examining crime in 
our society. I am sure that many read this story and viewed it as another 
defense ploy for this accused killer. This, of course, is a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 We must not, however, continue to disregard the impact of child abuse on 
criminal behavior. One does not have to have invested years in studying human 
behavior to conclude that when violence is used to discipline and "teach" 
children, the only lesson learned is that violence is a way to have power and 
control. We know that most juvenile and adult offenders were abused as 
children, yet we continue to build prisons, rather than spend a lot less to 
teach a generation how not to be violent. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as our money goes to treatment and punishment, we will continue to 
ignore prevention. If the task of nurturing children were given the same 
priority as crime in this society, imagine the difference we could make. 
</P>

 * Am I really expected to blame John Famalaro's mother for his problems? Or am 
I expected to pity Famalaro because he had an imperfect home life? In either 
case I don't. 
</P>
<P>
 If Famalaro did indeed murder Denise Huber then he is guilty of a crime! His 
actions require and deserve retribution regardless of his past, regardless of 
his sanity at the time of the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 In the real world there are consequences from every action (e.g. if I refuse 
to study, I flunk; if I speed, I get a ticket; if I murder someone, I go to 
jail). Sometimes blaming the past for pain and misfortune doesn't solve the 
problem. For the sake of Denise Huber and preventing the deaths of others like 
her, this is one of those times.

DISSOLVING DISTRICT ISN'T THAT EASY

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding your article about Tri-Cities Municipal Water District ("3 
Candidates Want to Vote Themselves Out of Jobs," Aug. 18): 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Local Agency Formation Commission is studying the spheres of 
influence for Orange County special districts as a prerequisite to possible 
consolidations in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedures and findings required by the California Government Code must be 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not a simple matter of a board of directors voting to dissolve a 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the consolidation committee, I have been working with the LAFCO 
staff to provide the necessary information. Tri-Cities is in discussions with 
adjoining districts on possible consolidation scenarios if a consolidation is 
recommended.

CHARTING A COURSE FOR TROUBLED YOUTH; SAILING PROGRAM HAS GIVEN SOME A WAY OUT 
OF GANGS; IT DESERVES CONTINUED SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It might seem far-fetched to try to get teen-agers to replace cocaine and 
alcohol with bowlines and halyards, but there is evidence that the experiment 
is working. A program called Sail for Life has the worthwhile goal of steering 
youths in trouble with the law onto a better path. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year-old aboard a 64-foot teakwood schooner sailing from Alamitos Bay one 
weekend last month said he embraced the opportunity to sail on Saturdays to 
avoid the gangs in his Anaheim neighborhood. He has gone to sea often enough to 
count his shipmates, not the gang members, as his friends. A young woman who 
said she never liked the ocean has been sailing often enough to change her mind 
and now is talking of a career as a professional sailor on a cruise ship or a 
yacht. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is the brainchild of Tom and Michelle Hancock of Huntington Beach, 
who volunteer their time and money to run the program. The Hancocks also have 
rounded up other adults as volunteer instructors and as people willing to 
listen to the problems of young people who have spent time at Juvenile Hall and 
are trying to go straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Hancock, 54, can also serve as a role model. Now he is a construction 
foreman and operator of an insurance agency with his wife. But he said he spent 
much of his time from age 11 to 21 behind bars for everything from stealing a 
horse to armed robbery. He credited a probation officer with showing him how to 
turn his life around, and he works with the Orange County Probation Department 
on Sail for Life. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the teen-agers sail because it is a chance to escape Juvenile Hall for 
a few hours. Others learn they enjoy watching the sails fill and steering a 
course. The Hancocks also are available to discuss whatever is on the minds of 
their apprentice sailors, a valuable assist to Probation Department counselors. 
The outings provide an example of another way of life and the chance to make 
new friends. Cheers for the program.

MIDDLE GROUND IS BEST FOR BOLSA CHICA; KOLL CO.'S PLAN OR NO DEVELOPMENT BOTH 
UNREALISTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tension between growth and new development and the preservation of the 
environment has played out dramatically in recent years in the fiercely 
contested debate over the future of the development proposed for the Bolsa 
Chica area in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal for a huge new housing development has some people believing that 
no development is the best plan of all. That's clearly unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 On the opposite side of the spectrum is the developer, the Koll Co., which has 
proposed a 4,286-acre development with a road transecting the area and a 
$20-million inlet connecting the wetlands to the ocean as part of a restoration 
project. It now appears that's really an unrealistic idea too. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes the county's Environmental Management Agency's approach. It has 
weighed in with a suggestion that two plans be considered, one that would offer 
3,200 homes and another with only 2,500.  
</P>
<P>
 While there were mixed reviews initially, it is somewhere in this middling 
range that reality must set in for the various parties. This is true if for no 
other reason than that the county's opinion counts so much in the process of 
review and approval. It must sign off on anything that is proposed, and it 
properly sees part of its role as balancing competing concerns of the 
environment and development. 
</P>
<P>
 The range of proposals that has existed on this project illustrates the 
difficulty in finding a viable middle ground somewhere on the broad spectrum 
between the extreme points of view. But the county, in the search for something 
that will fly in the overheated political environment, should be credited with 
recognizing the stakes for Huntington Beach and for taking the process of study 
and review as seriously as it has.  
</P>
<P>
 It has taken comment on its environmental impact report under advisement along 
with the extensive criticism it received from environmentalists. According to 
Thomas B. Mathews, director of planning for the agency, the county "determined 
that in order to develop a viable plan, we would have to substantially revise 
the document, so we decided to write a new one."  
</P>
<P>
 The new report gives evidence of a laudable commitment to find something that 
is environmentally sound, that respects the developers' rights and searches out 
politically viable ground for proceeding with development. 
</P>
<P>
 The question now is just what deal can be done, and the voice of the county 
necessarily must be a strong one at the table. Clearly, the developer is being 
sent a message by the county's experts that it had better be prepared to revise 
downward its expectations for the size of development. 
</P>
<P>
 The review process has moved into a 45-day period of comment. This is a 
crucially important project for the city of Huntington Beach and for the 
county. Since the hope of the agency is to "break the logjam," to use Mathews' 
words, all interested parties should use this opportunity to have their say.  
</P>
<P>
 One way or another, the county has made it clear that it intends to carve out 
some compromise territory, and that means it is reality check time for all the 
participants.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC HEALTH; WORKING TO INCREASE THE 
LEVEL OF AWARENESS OF TB AND ITS EFFECTS; A RECENT OUTBREAK IN A HIGH SCHOOL 
ILLUSTRATES NEED FOR RAPID DIAGNOSIS, APPROPRIATE TREATMENT AND PROMPT 
REPORTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGH F. STALLWORTH, Hugh F. Stallworth, M.D., is Orange County director of 
public health and the county's public health officer. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent accounts of tuberculosis in the news have brought considerable 
visibility to the increase in reported cases of tuberculosis in Orange County. 
Some of these reports undoubtedly have led to considerable concern and a number 
of questions on the part of county residents. As your county health officer, I 
want to be sure that you have the most accurate information regarding this 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The resurgence of tuberculosis is not only an Orange County problem but also a 
statewide and national problem. Tuberculosis in California has increased 54% 
from 1985 to 1992. California accounts for more tuberculosis cases than any 
other state (5,382 in 1992), and its rate of 17.2 cases of tuberculosis per 
100,000 population is the third highest in the United States. Santa Ana, San 
Francisco, Oakland and Los Angeles are among the 10 cities in the United States 
with the highest tuberculosis case rates. 
</P>
<P>
 What is tuberculosis? 
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial disease that most commonly affects the lungs. 
Someone with active TB can spread the disease to other persons through 
coughing, sneezing or singing. While tuberculosis is not easy to spread, it 
tends to be spread between people sharing a common air space for a prolonged 
period of time (e.g., home, dormitory rooms, classrooms, enclosed work space.) 
</P>
<P>
 The myth that someone testing positive with TB can spread the disease is 
false. The disease must be active within the lungs before it can be spread by 
an infected person. 
</P>
<P>
 TB is a very treatable disease. Therefore, it is important to recognize the 
symptoms and seek medical help. The symptoms include: prolonged cough (greater 
than two to three weeks,) night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, chest pain and 
coughing of blood. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent outbreak of tuberculosis in an Orange County high school illustrates 
the need for rapid diagnosis, appropriate treatment and prompt reporting. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, an Orange County high school student with tuberculosis was 
misdiagnosed. As a result, the student went untreated and unreported and 
consequently exposed classmates at the student's school. In 1992, a second 
physician diagnosed the student as having TB but did not treat it appropriately 
or report the case. When the patient's care was transferred to the county's 
Health Care Agency in 1993, we found a total of 17 active cases of TB in the 
school and 177 skin-test positive students. 
</P>
<P>
 The following factors contributed to this large outbreak: 
</P>
<P>
 * The original outbreak case had been symptomatic with an illness consistent 
with tuberculosis since January, 1991, but was not diagnosed with tuberculosis 
until February, 1992. This failure to diagnose tuberculosis resulted in 
prolonged exposure of contacts in the household, in the school and elsewhere in 
the community; 
</P>
<P>
 * Failure to promptly report the original outbreak case to the local health 
department resulted in inadequate isolation and delayed the contact 
investigation, further contributing to the spread of tuberculosis; and 
</P>
<P>
 * Inadequate treatments resulted in prolonged infectiousness. 
</P>
<P>
 As public health officials, we have the goal of maintaining and protecting the 
health of Orange County residents by organizing and coordinating both the 
public and private sector to prevent the occurrence and spread of disease, like 
tuberculosis. Specifically, public health officials apply preventive and 
treatment strategies to reduce disease and mortality rates. One way to address 
this goal is through the dissemination and sharing of information with the 
private health community. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to increase the level of awareness of tuberculosis and its 
effects, a tuberculosis communication plan has been designed to specifically 
identify target populations and audiences, messages to be conveyed to these 
groups, barriers to reaching the populations and specific plans to reach each 
group. The plan has been developed and its elements will soon be implemented by 
our public health staff. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the resurgence of tuberculosis, recent changes in legal 
reporting requirements concerning suspected and confirmed cases of tuberculosis 
by physicians have been enacted. The law requires physicians and other health 
care providers to report promptly to the local health officer when there is a 
reasonable suspicion of active tuberculosis, before discharge from a hospital 
or penal institution and when a person ceases treatment for tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, effective last Thursday, students entering Orange County's schools 
are required to present evidence of having been screened for tuberculosis. This 
includes all children entering first grade and those entering a school in the 
county for the first time. This policy applies to all public and private school 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 My hope is to strengthen our tuberculosis program as well as to enhance the 
flow of information between the public and private sector. Responsive, open 
lines of communication and increased community awareness are necessary to 
ensure an effective plan and a healthier community.

NO PROOF HEMP PLANTS WERE STOLEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding "Hemp's Half Acre" (Aug. 28), I would like to make some comments 
regarding my company. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece was a fairly well-balanced account of this significant and 
historical event involving the potentially premier fiber crop of the next 
century, our company and the state authorities this past summer. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the most disturbing (and predictable) assertion made by Imperial 
County narcotics officers that "local children were . . . stealing plants" is 
without any known proof. To our knowledge there are no police reports or 
complaints to substantiate this sensational claim. 
</P>
<P>
 In regard to the possibility of indictments issued against the participants in 
this experiment, we were told by the officers involved that there would be 
none. To say we are still under investigation by the attorney general's office 
is, to our knowledge, untrue. Our guess is the authorities hope this whole 
incident would just go away, rather than renew interest in legitimate, 
industrial hemp research and production. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, you omitted the fact that the Hempstead Co. was in fact founded by 
myself, David Martyn and Chris Boucher.

THE RIGHT TO SAY NO TO VACCINATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your story on immunizations ("Free Shots Offered to New Students," Aug. 15) 
states that vaccinations are required by schools before admission. In 
California as in many other states this is an untrue statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents would ask why wouldn't I want my children immunized? Information 
regarding both sides of the vaccination issue must be considered carefully. Get 
the facts about vaccines' safety, effectiveness and long-term effects on the 
immune system before you rush your children in for their shots. 
</P>
<P>
 California law clearly states that our children do NOT have to be vaccinated 
to attend school (public or private) if an exemption certificate is filed. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice to vaccinate or not is our right. To hear both sides is our 
responsibility as parents.

LINGERING DOUBTS ABOUT TAX HIKE, COSTLY RECALL ELECTION IN FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Mr. Marv Gonsior's contention that The Times' Fullerton recall editorial 
("This Recall Should Be Recalled," Aug. 8) was "seriously flawed" is itself 
seriously flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Gonsior obviously doesn't understand what representative government is. 
</P>
<P>
 What he calls "representative democracy" is an oxymoron. We have a system of 
government that is a republican (small r) form of democracy (small d). 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council of Fullerton would have been derelict in its duty had it not 
acted on the utility tax as a way of alleviating serious budget problems within 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, that's what we elected them to do, to represent us. 
</P>

 If every contentious issue were to be subject to a vote of the people, nothing 
would get done, ever, and there would be no need for city councils, boards of

<P>
 * The city of Fullerton has undergone a major political upheaval in recalling 
three of its five-member City Council. Because the city cannot operate without 
a quorum, the recalled members have remained on the council until an election 
can be held to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, with League of Women Voters support, urged that the special election 
be combined with the November general election. The council agreed, the recall 
supporters sued and (Superior Court Judge Donald E.) Smallwood ordered a 
special election, with the successful candidates serving a one-month term. 
</P>
<P>
 The league respectfully disagrees with the judge's reasoning. Our voting 
rights position encourages all citizens to vote, and we also support 
governmental responsibility to have regulations and procedures that encourage 
an informed and active electorate. Low voter turnouts at special elections are 
a barrier to participation. 
</P>
<P>
 We are pleased to know that such a special election cannot happen again. The 
Legislature has now changed the procedures for recalls in general law cities. 
When a recall election is held, the candidates to replace any seats vacated 
will run in the same election, eliminating the need for two elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The league also supports Proposition 183 on the November ballot to lengthen 
the time from certification of signatures for a recall election to 180 days, in 
order to consolidate it with a general election. This amendment only applies to 
state offices but, clearly, it is needed at the local level too.

 * In his letter (Aug. 21), recalled Fullerton Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin makes 
the points of excessive cost of the recall to the city of Fullerton and the 
reflection of the recall process on the principles of representative democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 That certainly puts the emphasis where it belongs, doesn't it? After all, if 
these people had shown any willingness to listen to the taxpayers they had 
sworn to represent, the whole expense of the recall could have been avoided. 
And though the clique completely disagreed with the citizens' objections, if 
they had been responsive enough to allow the tax issue on the ballot as a 
referendum, a lot of the expense could have been avoided. The total arrogance 
and unresponsiveness of this ruling clique is the factor that precipitated the 
recall and inflated the expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it certainly is expensive to maintain a representative democratic process 
when city officials fight the taxpayers every step of the way, but the 
taxpayers have the right to insist on a representative government and will pay 
the bill to keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 The unrepentant tone of Mr. Catlin's letter will convince anyone with residual 
misgivings that the voters did indeed pick the right option in passing the 
recall.

EDDIE MARTIN WILL BE REMEMBERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I'm afraid the item "Eddie Who?" (Newswatch, Aug. 29) may have left the 
wrong impression with many of your readers about the dedication of those of us 
at Martin Aviation to the memory of our founder, the late Eddie Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 No one, no group, and certainly no organization will be sadder to see the 
coming demise of the old Eddie Martin Terminal building than we.But we also 
recognize that the building is simply not capable of being restored for any 
kind of public use. Nor has there ever been any particular joy at Martin 
Aviation over the name change of Orange County Airport itself. However, it is 
not true that the only thing remaining in the memory of Eddie will be the 
display of Eddie Martin memorabilia at our headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the name Martin Aviation by itself is a tribute to Eddie and his 
brothers Floyd and Johnny. As for the name of the new Martin Aviation 
headquarters, that will continue to be known as Martin Aviation. Forget Eddie 
Martin? We wouldn't -- and couldn't dream of it.

DON'T PUT THE BURDEN ON THE VICTIM

<TEXT>
<P>
 * According to Jerome Greenblatt (Letters, Aug. 28), all that females in the 
work force have to do to avoid the type of sexual harassment imposed upon Robyn 
Boyd during her employment on the staff of Assemblyman Mickey Conroy is to 
simply change jobs. Women should continue to do this until they find an 
environment free of types such as Mr. Conroy. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenblatt doesn't offer any estimate of how many job changes this might 
require. He is putting the responsibility of finding an acceptable work 
environment upon the female employee. This is exactly the attitude which 
foments sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 No! Mr. Greenblatt, the responsibility is upon the employer and his 
administrative staff to create an environment free from grandfatherly, sexually 
sick individuals such as Mr. Conroy, who put up signs in their office stating 
that "sexual harassment will be graded" and who expect hugs and kisses from 
their female staff.

 * (Assemblyman Mickey) Conroy, of his recent private reprimand by the Rules 
Committee of the California Assembly for sexual harassment, says that since 
there was no malicious intent that it was not sexual harassment, and that he's 
such a nice guy he remembers birthdays, asks about grandchildren, etc. Phooey! 
</P>
<P>
 The essential ingredient of sexual harassment is inappropriate behavior, not 
malicious intent. Mickey may remember birthdays and grandchildren, but he is 
still a dirty old lecher, and Robyn Boyd lost her job because of it. Does 
Mickey think the rules do not apply to him?

CRIME, GUNS, ROLE OF POLICE DRAW CONCERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * This letter is in response to your article "More in O.C. Now Rate Crime as 
No. 1 Concern" (Aug. 28). The article states: ". . . But they want more police. 
. . ." Putting more police officers on the street would be like putting eunuchs 
in society and then wondering why the population did not increase. That is, we 
have essentially emasculated our police officers. We charge them with 
protecting us and then want to "micro manage" them; critique every decision 
they make. 
</P>
<P>
 Having been a police officer and now being a clinical psychologist who spends 
all day listening to the frustrations of police officers, I hear the same story 
from every officer from a wide range of departments: "I would love nothing more 
than to be able to perform the very job I was hired to do but am not willing to 
risk prison for doing my job." Granted there are a few "bad" police officers as 
there are "bad" employees in every occupation. However, the vast majority of 
police officers that I have seen in counseling -- hundreds of them from dozens 
of departments -- would like nothing more than to be able to go out and do the 
job that they swore to do: "protect and serve the public." 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that the vast majority of citizens want aggressive proactive police 
protection. However, to accomplish this, we must "un-handcuff" our officers and 
allow them to perform their job of protecting the public. 
</P>
<P>
 We do not need tougher laws; we need to provide adequate jails to house those 
convicted. We need to allow our officers to enforce the existing laws. If you 
doubt any of this, ask any "street" officer. 
</P>

<P>
 * Scott Hodge, federal budget analyst for the conservative Heritage 
Foundation, rudely shot down liberals' claim that the recently passed crime 
bill will "put 100,000 new cops on the street." His cost estimate of $70,000 to 
$80,000 annually per big-city cop on the street, counting salary, benefits and 
training, indicates we can really only expect about 20,000 new police. Liberals 
scoffed at Charlton Heston quoting this number in NRA-sponsored television ads 
opposing Clinton's crime bill. Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Joseph Biden 
gave a sarcastic retort: "I do not know how many of you hire your cops back 
home for $70,000 a year. I guess he is just used to being in Hollywood, where 
they pay a lot of money for those things." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, senator, Huntington Beach isn't Hollywood. However, the average police 
compensation -- base salary, estimated overtime, allowances for education, 
uniforms and, for some, cars, and the city picking up employees' pension 
contribution -- is just over $80,000. Add in other benefits, including life 
insurance, 12 weeks of sick leave, $7,812 in medical, dental and eye care, and 
Huntington Beach probably pays around $100,000 for each of our officers.

 Are their lives really diminished because they will no longer be able to buy 
an AK-47 or a Glock 45? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe my life is a little less rich because I can no longer snap up a Heckler

<P>
 I am a 4.0 graduate student at Cal State Fullerton and a member of the 
Historical Honor Society and a life member of the NRA. I believe I am 
intelligent and am certainly not a "kook." 
</P>
<P>
 Law-abiding citizens like myself use rifles like the Colt H Bar and 
Springfield M1a for lawful target shooting, competition and collecting 
purposes. Many lawful citizens also rely on these firearms to protect their 
families from crime and would also use them in the constitutionally mandated 
purpose of protecting themselves from the government should they ever need to. 
</P>
<P>
 I and many of my friends advised our local representatives to defeat the crime 
bill because of the gun ban. I applaud their decision to vote no. They took an 
oath to protect the Constitution when they assumed public office. By voting 
against the gun ban they attempted to protect a vital freedom from being slowly 
eroded away.

ROSCOE ELEMENTARY NEEDS A PATRON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Los Angeles Unified School District was an orphanage (and some would 
disrespectfully suggest that it is exactly that), Roscoe Elementary School in 
Sun Valley would be that needy and deserving kid standing in the corner who 
keeps getting passed over for someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if any school needed to be "adopted" by a firm, civic group, or other 
organization, as so many others around the district have been, it would be 
Roscoe.About now, its staff must be wondering whether someone is about to drape 
an albatross over the building. 
</P>
<P>
 This past summer, the school was robbed of its most precious equipment: its 
computers, television sets, facsimile machine, even its nurse's office 
wheelchair. It has suffered 15 break-ins in just the past year, according to 
Principal Ruth Bunyan. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, the LAUSD could afford to replace such losses. It cannot now. 
Worse yet, most the school's meager finances have had to be used to purchase 
intrusion alarms, window grills, and steel-clad doors for the added security 
needed to protect what remains at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Principal Bunyan is forging ahead with learning plans that include 
carefully structured, one-on-one instruction for so-called "at risk" kids for 
30 minutes each day for 12 to 20 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming school year, many adopted campuses will benefit from tutoring, 
mentoring, counseling, friendship, field trips, and donations from the members 
or employees of various firms and organizations. Roscoe Elementary deserves 
similar help.

THE CITY ITSELF IS A PUBLIC NUISANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your article, "Sylmar Cruising Spot Is Declared Public Nuisance" (July 29) 
refers to the La Rinda Plaza owners -- one group of many owners and operators 
of businesses throughout Los Angeles who have been targeted and declared a 
public nuisance by the city. Associate Zoning Administrator William Lillenberg 
said "this was the first time he used such measures to combat cruising." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, in the last two years, the city has had a lot of firsts -- using (or in 
my legal opinion misusing) the Municipal Code in an attempt to control and 
combat liquor stores, minimarkets, motels and more recently a laundromat, a 
doughnut shop, a parking lot and now "cruisers." 
</P>
<P>
 The law says that in order to be considered a public nuisance, the actual 
operation or maintenance of the property itself must "constitute" the public 
nuisance. On the contrary, most of the businesses that have been cited and 
declared a nuisance (and had costly conditions imposed against them) have done 
absolutely nothing wrong except just to be there in a "bad" neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles crime is everywhere: public intersections, public parks, public 
buses, public schools and public streets -- just to name a few places owned, 
operated and maintained by our own good city. Drug dealers, prostitutes, 
drunkards, gang bangers, graffiti taggers and, yes, "cruisers" find their way 
onto all of these public places. Obviously, public property attracts the scum 
of the city as much, if not more, than the private businesses that are being 
targeted. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has made it a regular practice to declare any kind of legitimate 
privately owned business to be a public nuisance simply because uninvited 
undesirables choose to patronize them. 
</P>
<P>
 If the loose standards for nuisance-abatement currently employed by the city 
were to be applied to governmental agencies and public properties, the city 
would be required to declare itself a public nuisance and mandate these exact 
same conditions on itself!

STATE BREAKING UP A HAPPY HOME; LAWS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR COUPLE, DISABLED 
FRIEND TO LIVE TOGETHER IN PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Life has not been easy for Tracy Grimes, 32, who suffered a brain stem 
hemorrhage in 1987 that left her paralyzed and partly blind. She cannot move 
her wheelchair, use the bathroom or dress without assistance. Grimes' mother 
cannot care for her; Grimes' son lives with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, however, Grimes' luck changed. She was befriended by the Hannas of 
Chatsworth. Eventually, Grimes and Gabrielle and Frederick Hanna grew so close 
that the Hannas invited her to move in with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, she lived with people who loved her and cared for her. She had her 
own room, and was able to be near children during the day. It was just about 
perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the state stepped in, and screwed everything up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hannas could not qualify for funds from California's In-Home Supportive 
Services program because such monies are only available for disabled persons 
who are still living in the home they occupied at the time they became 
disabled. For the Hannas to care for Grimes, the state regulations said, their 
home would have to be licensed and remodeled to meet state regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Hannas took such steps and had their home licensed, they still 
would not be eligible for those In-Home program funds. That's because this 
money only applies to home care, and not to licensed facilities. Meanwhile, 
because the Hanna family home did not have a community care facility license, 
the state ordered Grimes to leave, threatening the Hannas with $200 in fines 
per day as long as she remained there. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a classic example of a bureaucracy that was incapable of bending the 
rules even slightly. Grimes was shipped out to another board-and-care facility 
where she had no privacy, and no one well enough to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
 She may yet win the right to live with the Hannas, however. A Superior Court 
judge has granted a preliminary injunction, saying that the home did not have 
to be licensed for Grimes to live there. The judge also ruled that the Hannas 
could not be denied state funds to care for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Our readers put it best. One, for example, asked: "Who is the bureaucratic 
idiot who ordered Grimes removed from a home where she was well-cared-for, 
happy, and loved?" 
</P>
<P>
 The state isn't protecting Grimes. It's making her life miserable.

TIME FOR GLENDALE TO TASTE REALITY; CITY MUST PLAN CAREFULLY FOR ALEX THEATER 
AND EXPECT TO PROVIDE A SUBSIDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Lancaster Performing Arts Center had been running for a year, and the 
books showed an operating deficit of $400,000, city officials weren't worried. 
It was, in fact, about what they had expected. They knew that there is no such 
thing as a major municipal facility for the performing arts that is not heavily 
subsidized by tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster officials didn't mind, though, because they saw benefits that went 
far beyond packed houses and an impressive calendar of events. It was part of 
the cost of doing business at a time when private enterprise in California 
seemed to be doing little more than fleeing the state, much less choosing to 
settle here. 
</P>
<P>
 "This can only be good for us," Lancaster City Manager Jim Gilley said at the 
time, "If we bring in the president of some corporation that is considering 
putting a plant here, imagine what it will do for us if we can bring him into 
(the performing arts center) and show him what is available in this city. This 
building is not just for entertainment. It's an investment for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the city of Glendale should have viewed the historic and newly 
restored Alex Theater in the same light -- as something that was going cost the 
city some money, but that might make up for that cost in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, just eight months into its first year, the Alex Theater's management 
company is no longer running the place. Gone, too, is the money the company 
collected from 11,000 now-irate subscription ticket holders. 
</P>
<P>
 The lessons here are manifest for any jurisdiction hoping to have a sizable 
municipal performing arts center within its boundaries. We also need to point 
out that the Alex Theater can be saved, if the city of Glendale bites that 
reality sandwich and gets on with a more level-headed plan of what can be 
accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first indications of trouble for Glendale officials came when their 
nationwide search turned up just one company interested in running the 
1,500-seat theater. When the next search is conducted, it must be extended -- 
repeatedly perhaps -- until the city has a credible list of options. 
</P>
<P>
 The one company that was interested had successfully operated a 700-seat 
theater in Pasadena. But as Times reporter David Colker points out, this is not 
as simple as moving from a mid-size car to a full-size one. At twice the size 
of the Pasadena facility, The Alex's operating costs would be much higher and 
productions would be substantially more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Pasadena theater company promised the absurd: an incredible calendar 
of events that was to come at no cost to Glendale taxpayers. The Pasadena 
company would provide everything needed to operate the Alex, including all 
maintenance and box office staffing. That would have made it the first major 
municipal performing arts center in the nation without a subsidy. It wouldn't, 
and didn't, happen. Moreover, the city of Glendale had no monitoring system in 
place to keep an eye on how things were going at the Alex. It ought to have a 
checks and balances system in place the next time around.  
</P>
<P>
 After all these promises, it came as quite a bombshell when city officials 
were told that the Pasadena company was broke, even though it had sold 11,000 
subscriptions. The big shows that had been put on were cut-rate productions. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst of it was that Glendale officials believed that a company could do 
it on its own, even though a steady stream of advisers and consultants had said 
that a hefty, annual city subsidy of about $450,000 would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the city has shelled out $600,000 just to keep the theater afloat for the 
rest of the year. That was the proper, if very expensive, thing to do. It will 
help to shore up some of the trust and confidence that the ticket-holders had, 
and lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a search must be made for a management company that will not be in over 
its head running a theater the size of the Alex. And the city of Glendale and 
the board that oversees the Alex have to decide just how much of this 
enterprise they are willing to pay for on an annual basis, because a subsidy 
will be necessary if they want the Alex to be a major performing arts center. 
Chances are, if they do it right this time, it won't cost $600,000 a year.

TAX DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE MARRIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It's time we demanded family equality and eliminated the joint income tax 
return. If Richard Katz thinks unmarried couples deserve all the benefits of 
married couples, something has to give. 
</P>
<P>
 Either I want to have my cake and eat it too or people who live together 
should start paying a larger share.  
</P>
<P>
 Those perceived rights these people think they have come at a price. At this 
point, a price that's being picked up by those unfortunate enough to be married 
and file a joint return. To the tune of $3,000 for my family, that's how much 
we would have gotten back had we been allowed to file separately, not including 
what we had to pay. That's $3,000 that will help pay the benefits to the 
unmarried couples who will pocket their individual tax returns.  
</P>
<P>
 I've got news for you people who are cheering this on the sidelines. Don't 
think that I'm the only one aware of this. How long before Mr. Katz puts forth 
a bill to make you pay your fair share? It's probably already written, just 
waiting for all of you to be signed up. Otherwise, it will open the door to a 
massive class action suit against the government, based on discrimination 
against married couples. An open and closed case, I might add.

ROSENTHAL AS SENATOR IS NOT FOREGONE CONCLUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Thanks to Times reader M. Stephen Sheldon for exposing the Westside 
political machine that has been running the Valley for over two decades -- 
leading to a loss of jobs, rising crime, an influx of illegal immigrants and 
falling home prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately Mr. Sheldon has concluded that Westside resident Herschel 
Rosenthal will become our next state senator and the plundering and 
mismanagement of the Valley will inevitably continue.Rosenthal's victory is not 
a foregone conclusion, and Valleyites should start looking at the candidates 
closely instead of voting a straight party line. Although mostly Democrats, the 
majority of Valley residents do not accept ultra-leftist Rosenthal's 
philosophy. He has advocated giving free syringes to drug addicts and other 
misuses of public resources. The Republican candidate, Delores White, who 
actually lives in the Valley, has a long record of facilitating economic growth 
-- not chasing it out of the state.

A 'WHACKO' SOCIETY LEGALIZES VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I can understand your disturbance over the "whackos" who killed two abortion 
providers and a guard ("An Anxious Time for Family Planning," Aug. 25).  
</P>
<P>
 What I consider incommensurately more "whacko" however, is a society that 
legalizes the murder by dismemberment and poisoning of its most innocent 
children -- the unborn -- by the millions, and then has the gall to complain of 
a rise in violence.

CANOGA PARK WANTS TO KEEP TOPANGA PLAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a resident of the San Fernando Valley for 18 years, I am enthusiastic 
about Councilwoman Laura Chick's efforts to revitalize the central valley.My 
concern is the Topanga Plaza Shopping Center's efforts to associate itself with 
the Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel Topanga Plaza's efforts to desert the community of Canoga Park are 
shameful and counterproductive to the revitalization process. Topanga Plaza is 
not now nor has it ever been a part of the Warner Center. It is a vital part of 
Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope community members and Councilwoman Chick's office will join in asking 
Topanga Plaza to change its signs and advertising from Warner Center to Topanga 
Plaza at Canoga Park.

BILL WOULD KEEP INMATES FROM CHANGING NAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Recently, the Los Angeles Times reported on the impending parole of 
convicted child molester Kyle Hochstraser ("Convicted Molester Freed on 
Parole," Aug. 18). As many of your readers know, Mr. Hochstraser legally 
changed his name while he was an inmate.However, allowing inmates to legally 
change their names has resulted in numerous instances of harassment. Your 
readers deserve an update on how the state Legislature is addressing this 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a year ago, I participated in a special hearing of the state Assembly's 
Committee on Public Safety which addressed this very issue. As I listened to 
victims testify about being harassed by prisoners who legally changed their 
name, I felt compelled to find a solution. Therefore I introduced Assembly Bill 
2782, a measure that would prohibit a person who is incarcerated in state 
prison from legally changing his or her name. Just this week this bill was 
overwhelmingly approved by the state Assembly and Senate. I expect this bill to 
be signed into law by Gov. Pete Wilson in the very near future. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing an inmate to repeatedly harass law-abiding citizens is outrageous. 
Victims should not be forced to be victims for a second time and child 
molesters and other criminals should not be allowed to hide behind a new 
identity. This simple measure will prevent any future examples of outrageous 
inmate harassment.

BURBANK RESIDENTS CELEBRATE SUCCESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The voters of Burbank will continue to hold our community leaders 
accountable even without Sharon Woodson-Bryant's help. We will continue to 
participate in maintaining the positive values of a clean, safe, family 
oriented community.We are doing this with residents who take pride and 
responsibility in our churches, our schools and our politics. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Woodson-Bryant who missed the point of a diverse society. I did not 
celebrate Black History month this year and probably won't next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But I did celebrate with quiet pride a boy's graduation from high school this 
year. He is going to a major university with high academic standing and an 
athletic scholarship. I met him 10 years earlier. I don't know if he would have 
failed in another community, probably not. But I know he succeeded here in 
Burbank. He succeeded while getting all the bumps and bruises that life choose 
to give him.

THINGS ARE LOOKING UP FOR LIBRARIES IN THE VALLEY; THE LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL 
HAS EARMARKED $300,000 FOR MORE STAFF TO REACH INTO SCHOOLS. IT HAS ALSO ADDED 
$2.9 MILLION TO THE MAYOR'S BUDGET FOR TWO NEW FACILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

New York University.

<TEXT>
<P>
 San Fernando Valley libraries are having a good year, after decades of budget 
starvation. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Proposition 13 passed in 1978, if Los Angeles needed more money for 
libraries, it raised property taxes. Since Proposition 13, the city has cut 
inflation-adjusted funding for libraries every year, according to Joyce Sloss, 
a city budget analyst. Libraries were also hurt by the 1990 city government 
hiring freeze. And the Northridge earthquake closed all 17 Valley libraries. 
Some opened in a few days; a few are still closed. 
</P>
<P>
 But things are looking up, at least somewhat. This year's overall budget is 
again down in real dollars, but the Los Angeles City Council rejected Mayor 
Richard Riordan's proposal for deep cuts. Sloss said the council earmarked 
$300,000 to pay for library staff to reach into schools at all levels, some of 
which don't have their own librarians. The citywide program, designed to 
educate young people about books and libraries, involves librarians traveling 
to schools and students traveling to libraries. It has three more staff people 
in 1994 than a year earlier, because of the council action. 
</P>
<P>
 Librarian visits to schools should increase by at least 25%, according to 
Carmen Martinez, director of branch library services. 
</P>
<P>
 More significantly, the council also added $2.9 million to the mayor's budget 
for increased library staff. Some will go to the recently enlarged Central 
Library Downtown. But the money is also for two new libraries opening in the 
West Valley, Sloss said. The Platt branch on Victory Boulevard in Woodland 
Hills will open this fall. The second, the Mid-Valley Regional branch on 
Nordhoff Street in North Hills, will open in the spring of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The libraries are benefiting from a "thawing" of employee positions frozen 
since April 1, 1990. Library services took a dive due to decreased staff, and 
the libraries' hours of operation dwindled. Although the overall hiring freeze 
is still in effect, the City Council has granted a library request to be 
allowed to fill 80 positions. "The council wants to maintain six days of 
service at all facilities," Sloss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Navarro, senior librarian at the West Valley Regional Branch, who has 
worked in the library system for 18 years, said that with the opening of 
positions, opportunities for promotions now exist and gaps in smaller libraries 
can be filled. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, some city libraries have profited from the Northridge 
earthquake. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has funded about 90% of the 
earthquake-related repairs, according to Nina Wilson, the West Valley regional 
manager. The earthquake-relief money left many of the libraries with better 
facilities than they had before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Valley regional branch in Reseda -- the largest of the West Valley 
libraries -- had never had carpeting before the quake. Since its reopening on 
June 27, the library boasts carpeting, air conditioning, a new ceiling, 
built-in lighting and a new exterior and interior paint job, according to 
Navarro. "A lot of the other branches will also get improvements," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge branch, which reopened July 11, did not have carpeting before 
the earthquake either. It now not only has new carpeting, but new computer 
tables, a new reference desk, new interior paint and a new ceiling, according 
to its librarian, Margaret Foulks. The Chatsworth branch, which reopened on 
July 25, is enjoying similar aesthetic and seismic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake also helped accelerate automating the libraries. While the West 
Valley regional branch was closed, the staff had time to equip the books with 
bar codes. The library now plans to be fully automated by the end of the 
summer, Navarro said, while many of the city's branch libraries will not be 
automated until the middle of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The speeding up of automation is more than welcome to librarians. With 
computerization, library staff can have "more instant knowledge of what is 
going on," said Pat Kiefer, department manager for general library services. 
</P>
<P>
 Librarians will be able to determine more quickly and easily if books are 
overdue or lost. Automation will also put the branch and Central Library 
collections on-line, eliminating the outdated card catalogues. With all this 
automation and library renovation and new staff and new libraries, we Valley 
residents won't have to drive to Beverly Hills anymore just to go to the 
library.

THE DEFICIT: BRINGING FEDERAL SPENDING UNDER CONTROL; UNDER CLINTON'S 
LEADERSHIP, RED INK HAS BEEN REDUCED AND THE ECONOMY HAS MOUNTED A STRONG 
RECOVERY. BUT HEALTH CARE INFLATION COULD SCUTTLE THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE.

By ANTHONY C. BEILENSON, Incumbent Democrat Anthony Beilenson has been a 
congressman since 1977. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times has invited the two leading candidates in the hotly contested race 
for Congress in the 24th District, which includes the southwest San Fernando 
Valley, to write on several issues before the election.  
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Democrat Anthony Beilenson has been a congressman since 1977. 
Republican Rich Sybert was state director of planning and research from 1991 to 
1993.  
</P>
<P>
 For this article they were asked if the federal budget deficit is a 
significant problem, and if so, what should be done to attack it.  
</P>
<P>
 Congress and the President have been struggling for some time now to reduce 
the huge budget deficits of the 1980s. We made a modest amount of progress 
during the last two years of George Bush's presidency, but our greatest success 
came just last year when Congress passed President Clinton's five-year, 
$500-billion deficit-reduction act, the largest such measure in history. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 Budget Act has resulted in several very significant accomplishments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Budget deficits have been slashed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Budget Act, which cut $225 billion in spending, will result in a drop in 
the federal deficit from its record high of $290 billion in 1992 to $167 
billion next year -- $136 billion lower than the deficit would have been if 
Congress had rejected the President's plan. By next year, for the first time in 
over 40 years, the federal deficit will have declined for three years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Measured in terms of the size of our economy, the news is even better: The 
1992 deficit equaled 5% of our nation's gross domestic product. Next year's 
deficit will be just 2.5% of GDP. And by 1998 it will have dropped to 2.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Federal spending is under tighter control. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough new budget rules require us to reduce discretionary spending (spending 
for virtually all government functions except payments for benefits and 
interest on the debt) by about $100 billion over the next five years. By 1998, 
the percentage of our nation's GDP represented by all discretionary federal 
spending will drop from its 1992 level of 9% to 6.7% -- its lowest level in 46 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget rules adopted in 1990 also prevent Congress from expanding government 
benefits or tax breaks unless compensating cuts or revenue increases occur. 
Only in cases where the President and Congress agree that a true national 
emergency exists, such as the Northridge earthquake, can Congress spend 
additional funds without making compensating cuts or raising revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 When the House of Representatives considered annual spending bills this year, 
we cut 395 programs below their previous year's levels -- and we eliminated 36 
programs entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 * The number of federal workers is falling dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of federal civilian employees is being cut by more than 250,000 
over the next six years. By 1998, we will have fewer than 2 million federal 
workers for the first time since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty billion dollars of the savings which will be realized from eliminating 
these jobs will be used to finance the new crime-fighting initiatives before 
Congress so that no new taxes will be needed to cover those costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tax relief was provided for working families of modest incomes and made 90% 
of small businesses eligible for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The income tax increases in the deficit-reduction act will be paid only by the 
wealthiest 1.2% of Americans, who earn more than $180,000 a year -- the people 
who benefited the most from tax cuts throughout the 1980s. The other 98.8% of 
Americans will either pay the same, or less, in income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Economic growth is strong and steady -- job creation is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates dropped dramatically in early 1993 on the expectation that 
Congress would pass a major deficit-reduction bill. That drop fueled a national 
economic recovery which is now exceeding the predictions economists made only a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, 1993, the economy has generated 4 million new private-sector 
jobs -- double the number created in the previous four years. Jobs in 
manufacturing, which had been on the decline for several years, have been 
growing over the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Other signs of economic health -- industrial production, retail sales, 
business investment, housing starts, consumer confidence -- are all rising. 
Interest rates, while up slightly, are still at their lowest level in 20 years. 
And inflation is being held in check. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Southern California experienced a deeper recession than other parts of 
the country, recovery was bound to take more time here. But even in our region, 
the unemployment rate has been declining and other positive trends are finally 
emerging. 
</P>
<P>
 Although we are making significant progress on reducing the deficit, much more 
needs to be done. While spending for most federal programs is now declining, 
spending for entitlement programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid, is 
continuing to surge. Unless the underlying causes of health care inflation are 
dealt with, federal deficits will begin to rise again starting in 1997. That's 
one critically important reason for ensuring that any health care reform bill 
passed by Congress has effective provisions for controlling health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The President has appointed a high-profile commission to recommend proposals 
for reducing the costs of federal entitlement programs. The panel's report, due 
in December, is expected to lead to congressional consideration of program 
changes that will further reduce federal spending. 
</P>
<P>
 As we proceed with efforts to make further cuts in the deficit, the most 
important ingredient we will need is support from the public. Americans need to 
make it clear that they want their elected officials to place a higher priority 
on balancing the budget than on cutting taxes or increasing spending. If the 
political will to solve this problem exists, the solutions will be achieved.

 Costa Mesa won its first outright league football title in its 32-year 
history. The last time it shared a league title was 1978. The Mustangs lost the 
Southern Section championship game to Trabuco Hills, 44-6. Offensive 
lineman/linebacker Bryan Luxembourger was the league's most valuable player, 
and running back Binh Tran (1,499 regular-season yards) shared the offensive 
player of the year award with Laguna Hills' Fred Kim. The championship victory 
was sweet revenge for Trabuco Hills, which had lost, 13-3, to Costa Mesa 
earlier in the season in its worst showing of the year. It was a splendid 
goodby--Trabuco Hills moves to the South Coast League and is making the jump 
from Division VIII to Division I. Three quarterbacks combined for 18 touchdowns 
and only two interceptions during the regular season for Trabuco Hills; 
cornerback Geoff Beckham was the defensive player of the year. Laguna Hills had 
two of the league's most highly touted offensive players in running back Fred 
Kim and quarterback Justin Vedder. Kim rushed for 1,339 yards and 17 
touchdowns, and Vedder came on toward the end of the season to finish with 17 
touchdown passes against six interceptions. Laguna Beach broke a 17-game PCL 
losing streak, stopping a two-point conversion attempt in the final moments of 
a 28-27 victory over Estancia.

 Robert Rice of Lakewood completed a perfect night by taking the checkered flag 
in the feature race. He also won the six-lap trophy dash and the eight-lap fast 
heat race. 
</P>
<P>
 Phipps, who finished the night 33 points ahead of second-place Dave 
Blankenship of Reseda with one night of racing left this season, joined 
Valencia's John Schultz, who captured the Street Stock championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The final leg of the six-race Sportsman Championship Series also was decided, 
but results were unavailable by press time due to lengthy delays following an 
accident two laps into the 75-lap event involving several cars, including 
series points leader Ron Daniels of San Bernardino and Mark Wilson of 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels entered the race having only to finish within 10 positions of Wilson 
and Pat Mintey Jr. of Quartz Hill, who were tied for second. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Daniels or Wilson returned to the track once racing restarted. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz clinched the points championship despite finishing fourth in the final 
25-lap oval main event of the season. In fact, the Valencia resident had 
already wrapped up the title by winning the four-lap trophy dash, which moved 
him 27-points ahead of second-place Kirk Miller of Alta Loma. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller wound up winning the oval main event, pulling away for his sixth 
feature win of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In other racing action, Sal Rose broke the Sportsman qualifying record with a 
one-lap time of 15.99 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Mintey Jr. of Quartz Hill held the previous record (16.06) set on April 2, 
opening night this season. RON STAPP

 Mike Kirby, 29, of Lomita went wire-to-wire to win his fourth Sprint Car 
Racing Assn. victory in the 30-lap main event at Ventura Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent SCRA program at Ventura, Kirby finished second when Tempe's 
Ron Shuman passed him on the final lap. This time, Shuman was off racing a USAC 
Silver Crown event. 
</P>
<P>
 The race was marred by six caution flags, three of which occurred before one 
lap was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Cucamonga's Gary Howard finished second after earning his way into the 
feature with a victory in a 12-lap semi-main. J. J. Yeley, 17, of Phoenix was 
third after starting 17th in the 18-car field. DARIN ESPER

 LIBRARY RETURN: When Eugene Wright of Perris recently lost his purse at the 
Santa Ana Library -- with $304 inside -- police gave him a 1% chance of ever 
seeing it again. But it showed up in his mail -- with $300, and a note from 
Mary V. Napolitano of Santa Ana. She wrote almost apologetically that she 
shorted him the $4 -- to cover postage to mail it back to him. . . . She said 
she grabbed the purse to keep someone else from stealing it. She declined his 
reward offer: "I didn't do it to get anything back."

 SERRA FACE LIFT: Serra Chapel is California's oldest church and the only 
remaining structure in which Father Junipero Serra said Mass. . . . This month, 
work crews resume renovation of the 216-year-old chapel at Mission San Juan 
Capistrano. Gerald Miller, the mission administrator, said one of the chapel's 
features, adobe, has also been its bane. "Adobe structures are constantly 
absorbing moisture and deteriorating." Care will be taken, he said, to protect 
delicate wall motifs that are original drawings.

 REBOUND: The year didn't start out too well for Lonnie Lardner -- she lost her 
Studio City house in the earthquake. Now things have turned around. Lardner has 
joined the studio lineup for Fox's NFL pregame show, which debuts today. . . . 
"Lost my house, totaled my car, and changed jobs," says Lardner, who had been 
an entertainment editor for KTTV-TV in Los Angeles. "It was quite a year." 
</P>
<P>
 NEW YEAR: Jews really know how to pack the house for Rosh Hashanah, which 
begins Monday night. So some Valley synagogues must conduct services in strange 
places -- Warner Center Marriott in Woodland Hills, Airport Plaza Hotel in Van 
Nuys, and Pantages Theater in Hollywood (B1). . . . Wherever you go, you can 
expect to hear the story in the Torah of God asking Abraham to sacrifice his 
son.

 CACTUS FACTS: It may not be everyone's idea of a snack, but California Native 
Americans used it for food after removing the prickly hairs. It is opuntia 
basilaris (above) -- the beavertail cactus -- and can be found locally in the 
Mojave Desert in and around the Antelope Valley (Valley Briefing, B2). . . . 
The plant's magenta and white flowers bloom in late spring.

 THE OPEN ROAD: For the first time since the Northridge earthquake, all five 
westbound lanes of the Simi Valley Freeway are open for business in Granada 
Hills, two weeks earlier than expected. . . . Construction crews, who worked 
around-the-clock for months to repair the freeway, were bid adieu with relief 
by neighbor Peggie Roach. "Thank God. It's been a nightmare," she said of the 
noise (B4). 
</P>
<P>
 DESERT TALKS: Business leaders in Palmdale and Lancaster are cautiously 
exploring the idea of merging the two cities' chambers of commerce into one 
large group representing the Antelope Valley. . . . But history stands in their 
way: The rival groups have operated on their own for more than four decades 
(B18).

FINANCE CHIEF IN BRAZIL QUITS OVER REMARK 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brazil's finance minister has resigned following media reports of a 
conversation in which he admitted slanting economic data to help the 
government-backed presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 President Itamar Franco on Saturday accepted the resignation and said he was 
"shocked and perplexed" by the comments, Globo television reported Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero made his indiscreet remarks Thursday in what 
he thought was a private chat with a Globo television reporter. But their 
conversation was picked up by network microphones and inadvertently transmitted 
to customers with parabolic antennas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no scruples. What is good, we take advantage of. What is bad, we 
hide," Ricupero said according to transcripts of the conversation reprinted 
Saturday by newspapers throughout Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso's popularity has risen steadily since May, in part because many 
Brazilians credit him with bringing inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest poll shows Cardoso with the support of 45% of the electorate, 
well-ahead of leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's 23%, a month ahead of Oct. 3 
elections.

SIERRA CLUB SUIT PUTS DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS TO THE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Sierra Club lawsuit aimed at shrinking a massive Thousand Oaks housing 
project could help ensure that cities statewide do not bargain away their legal 
obligation to protect the environment, government and legal analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed recently against Thousand Oaks, says that the city signed a 
deal allowing developers to build 2,350 homes on the rolling hills overlooking 
Newbury Park before it had fully considered the project's potential for 
environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Club attorneys argue that part of the 4,500-acre Dos Vientos Ranch 
development would seal off a critical wildlife corridor and could endanger 
dozens of plant and animal species in the surrounding Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 If the environmental group prevails, the ruling would force Thousand Oaks -- 
and perhaps all California cities -- to perform more comprehensive 
environmental reviews before signing development agreements, government 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, it would demand that cities enforce, as part of their deals with 
developers, contract provisions that say a project's size can be reduced if it 
threatens residents or the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state law says you need to look before you leap," said Stephan Volker, a 
Sierra Club attorney. "I think the risk inherent in the development agreement 
process is that the city will grant approvals before they have all the facts. 
That's what happened in Thousand Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Development agreements -- contracts between government and builders -- have 
been legal in California for 15 years. Thousand Oaks city officials say they 
are valuable tools, since they guarantee builders that when local political 
winds change, the requirements for their projects will not. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were several cases where developers sank millions of dollars into a 
project, they received tentative approvals from the city, and a couple years 
down the line, a new council came along and said no," Thousand Oaks City Atty. 
Mark Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Developers wanted a way to be certain that once they started down the road, 
they would not be forced to turn back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for the guarantees, the developers typically offer cities 
lucrative packages that include cash, land and promises to build schools, parks 
and other public amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Thousand Oaks agreed to allow construction of the Dos Vientos 
development in exchange for $12 million, 1,000 acres of open space and a host 
of other public improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 But enticements create the risk that cities such as Thousand Oaks will rush to 
sign the deals without thoroughly examining the potential for violating state 
environmental laws, the Sierra Club's Volker argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that risk, he said, the public needs stronger assurances that the 
environment will be protected. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks officials said that the lucrative Dos Vientos deal in no way 
kept them from performing proper reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not building for dollars," said Mike Sangster, city deputy planning 
director. "The environmental concerns were thoroughly examined well before we 
signed the agreement." In fact, the city and the public reviewed the project 
well before the development agreement was signed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchased in 1982 by Pasadena-based Operating Engineers, the developer first 
wanted to build 3,900 homes. Six years later, after dozens of public hearings 
and a two-volume environmental analysis, the City Council conceptually approved 
2,350 homes.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the final compromise agreement was signed in 1990, construction of about 
400 homes in two other Dos Vientos subdivisions has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, however, the city issued a new environmental report on a third Dos 
Vientos subdivision, because the original analysis was more than five years 
old. The report identified several new problems with the 220-house project. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said some of the new houses would be too close to an earthquake 
fault and to power poles, findings disputed by the developer as baseless. It 
also said the project would have a greater impact than previously thought on 
noise, traffic and native plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing the report, council members agreed to take some steps to 
reduce risks from the earthquake fault and power poles but decided not to cut 
the number of homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason that was not proposed is because, under the agreement, the city is 
legally obligated to allow that density," Sellers said. "We can do a number of 
things to help mitigate problems with the development, but we can't go back and 
change the major points of the agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Club attorneys say Sellers is wrong. They argue that the city is 
required by state environmental law to consider all possible solutions, 
including density reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, explained Ventura planning analyst William Fulton, is that state 
laws allowing development agreements and state laws designed to protect the 
environment appear to conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is a sticky situation," Fulton said. "If you go back and adjust the 
density, you would lose the certainty that the developer received by signing 
the agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 "The question then becomes, which one of these conflicting laws is more 
important," Fulton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles attorney Carla Ryhal, who specializes in development agreements, 
said their intent is to provide certainty that the city will not sway from its 
original contract. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1993 amendment to state environmental law includes a section permitting use 
of a "master environmental impact report," so developers and the city can 
evaluate a project at the outset, rather than years into it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That amendment confirms the legislation's intent that a development agreement 
is meant to provide the global framework to allow developers to take those next 
steps without risk," Ryhal said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, they are saying they want developers to be able to evaluate the 
entire project at the point of the development, not in pieces as a project 
proceeds," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other attorneys said the issue is not clear-cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is fairly common that an initial (environmental impact report) will fail 
to raise important environmental issues," said Jim Moose, a Sacramento attorney 
who specializes in environmental law. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be some element in a development agreement which will allow 
environmental issues to be addressed later on," he said. There is such a 
provision in Thousand Oaks' Dos Vientos agreement, but the city and Sierra Club 
disagree on whether it could legally have been invoked. 
</P>
<P>
 What this lawsuit may clarify, Fulton said, is exactly what a city can and 
cannot do to enforce laws after they have signed a development agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times in recent years, cities around the state have grappled with the 
issue, Volker said. But until now no one has brought it before a judge, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is because cities and developers have been pleased with the arrangement 
created by the contracts, said Fulton, who publishes a statewide newsletter 
that tracks trends in planning law. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are popular and are frequently used because both sides get something 
they want," he said. "The cities get things they never could ask for without an 
agreement, and the developer gets the assurance his money won't go down the 
drain." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a lawyer for the Dos Vientos developer said he has always 
believed such prearranged deals help the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe development agreements have been supported by environmental groups 
for years," attorney Wayne Jett said. "These agreements provide the mechanics 
for greater certainty that mitigation, which is often extensive and expensive, 
will be performed." 
</P>
<P>
 Volker said he does not want the Thousand Oaks case to end use of development 
agreements, but the Sierra Club is fighting now because such a contract has 
been misused. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we're asking is that the developers be confident that all the 
environmental variables have been fleshed out before the contract is signed," 
Volker said, "so that they don't find out later that something like a major 
wildlife corridor is on the land." 
</P>
<P>
 "If they did that," he said, "the process would hold little risk."

DOCTORS AND PATIENTS FEEL SQUEEZE FROM HMOS; HEALTH: NEW MANAGED-CARE APPROACH 
HAS DISILLUSIONED SOME, BUT BOTH GIVERS AND RECEIVERS OF TREATMENT TRY TO FIND 
WAYS TO ADAPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN and MARY F. POLS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The letters arrived in mailboxes across Ventura, quietly heralding the latest 
wave of health care reform in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Four popular family practice doctors had sold their practice to a health 
maintenance organization's medical group, but they assured patients they were 
busy negotiating to hold on to all their current patients. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, Bob Barber had the opposite problem. He was trying to hold 
on to his doctor, the one he credits with saving his life after a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 His insurance plan included his cardiologist on its list of doctors. But 
Barber said his insurer refused to give him an appointment with the specialist 
and tried to send him to a less expensive physician. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as health care reform stalls in Congress, changes are taking hold across 
Ventura County and California -- driven by rising costs and by sheer dread of 
what could happen if the White House plan succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The marketplace itself is reforming the system in California very rapidly," 
said David Langness of the Hospital Council of Southern California. "Give us 
two to three years in California, and we'll be where the Clinton health plan 
wanted us to be." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the marketplace reforms do nothing for the roughly 140,000 county 
residents without health insurance. Unlike Clinton's universal coverage, the 
hurly-burly California market offers the uninsured no recourse. 
</P>
<P>
 But of those who do have insurance, 85% are now covered by some sort of 
managed care plan, which scrutinizes the level of care to keep down medical 
bills. That compares to 10% covered by such a plan a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a revolution in the way health care is practiced in California," 
Langness said. 
</P>
<P>
 Health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred providers organizations 
(PPOs), individual physician associations (IPAs) -- an alphabet soup of 
health-care arrangements -- have overtaken the old-fashioned doctor who ran his 
own practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the MDs haggle with the MBAs over how much money they receive for each 
patient and how much care they give them. The doctors who cling to their 
independence watch their patients' charts flow from their file cabinets to 
other doctors' offices. All physicians say they no longer make the money they 
once did. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors are increasingly working in larger groups, forming business 
organizations capable of wielding more power in price negotiations with HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the HMOs and insurance firms that once existed simply to pay 
the bills for health care are now hiring doctors to provide medical care. 
Increasingly, they are buying up doctors' practices, such as the Ventura family 
practice group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting harder to remain an independent doctor," said Edward J. Banman, 
45, a Ventura physician who chose not to accept an HMO group's offer to buy his 
family practice. "Private, solo, individual practice is shrinking in urban 
California, and there are no replacements, no troops coming up that want to do 
what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 For the patients, health care reforms can mean limits on what doctors they see 
and when they see them. In extreme cases, health managers have been accused of 
denying needed tests and expensive treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard attorney Mark Hiepler recently opened a new law firm to intervene in 
such cases. Hiepler decided to focus on this area of the law after he won an 
$89-million verdict against an HMO that denied a bone marrow transplant to his 
sister. She subsequently died of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 A more common complaint is that of Bob Barber, who had to fight a physicians 
group, called an individual practice association or IPA, to continue seeing his 
cardiologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone flips through those directories looking to find their doctor," 
Barber said. "It looks like you have a lot of choice, but in reality the IPAs 
are telling the primary care physicians to direct patients to only some 
specialists. They're funneling the business." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not what the Clinton Administration had in mind when it proposed a 
seamless health care system to care for all Americans, said Dr. Sam Edwards, 
medical director of Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing integrated about this," Edwards said. "This is a whole bunch 
of independent people trying to get as much money as they can. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to realize what's going on here. These numbers are so big. This is a 
trillion-dollar industry. It's totally marketplace-driven. They're giving less 
care to the patients, and they're giving less money to the doctors and the 
hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Dodge sees his decision to sell his practice to an HMO as a way to 
give more time and attention to patients. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 1, Dodge and his three partners ceased being the Brent Street Family 
Practice and became Foundation Health Medical Group. 
</P>
<P>
 They sold their thriving business to a group created by one of the state's 
largest HMOs; the physicians then became salaried employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, what we do best is we practice medicine," said Dodge, 42, running his 
hand over his short reddish-blond hair. "If you talk to most physicians, that's 
their expertise. We're not businessmen." 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, the family practitioner found himself dealing with lab 
certification agencies, workplace safety inspectors, employee relations and 
mounds of paperwork required by various insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot believe the hassles and the forms," he said. "It just takes you 
away from medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 His status as a "primary care physician," rather than a specialist, put him in 
demand. All managed care plans require patients to get approval from the 
general practitioner before surgery or specialized treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Dodge found his income dropping as insurance companies offered him 
and his partners less and less reimbursement for their work. 
</P>
<P>
 That did not change the payments they had to make on their office space. The 
four physicians -- Dodge, Robert Garrison, Fran Larsen and Geoffrey Loman -- 
moved into the building across from Ventura's Community Memorial Hospital two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 All around them, primary care doctors were rushing to form even larger groups. 
Ventura's largest medical group, Buenaventura Medical Clinic, was considering a 
merger with a statewide doctors group. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Foundation Health offered to buy Brent Street Family Practice this 
spring and take over the business side of medicine, the partners agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement also made sense for Foundation Health Corp., the 
530,000-member HMO that launched the new medical group that bought out the 
Ventura practice and is shopping for others, said spokesman Kurt Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started the medical group because we found that primary care physicians 
were leaving private practices and joining other groups that are not 
necessarily aligned with us," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sacramento-based HMO won a contract a year ago to provide services for 
Ventura County government employees. Officials plan to build a doctors' office 
near the county government center. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodge and his partners will remain in their Brent Street offices, but be 
available to patients through the HMO's medical group. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent that we've got the best physicians in a community, we certainly 
hope that attracts more members," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe that drawing new patients is the chief motivation behind these 
new HMO-sponsored medical groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, health insurance and HMO plans were sold to individuals, with 
salesmen sitting at card tables in shopping malls or holding bridge parties at 
trailer parks. Then they moved on to employers, who could deliver the health 
care plan to large groups of workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, some are hiring the most popular doctors and hoping the patients will 
follow, Edwards said. The doctors receive a lump sum for their practice and 
then collect an annual salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctor thinks it's wonderful," Edwards said. "Everyone does, except the 
poor old patient who gets the letter and has to go somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Dodge and his partners say they hope to keep all the patients in their 
practice, not just those affiliated with Foundation Health. Already, several 
insurance companies have signed contracts with the new medical group. 
</P>
<P>
 Aetna Health Plans, for instance, should have no problem with the arrangement, 
said Kurt Hoekendorf, a regional director. "We're not threatened at this 
point," he said. "If, for some reason, they start trying to take the employer 
groups from us, then we might step in." 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross, however, does not plan to keep the doctors on contract. "They now 
belong to our competitors, and it wouldn't make good business sense to use 
them," said Ferial Bahremand, a California Care Health Plan's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross plans to hire doctors and set up its own clinic in Santa Barbara in 
1995. "The rationale is to create a stable network of doctors for our clients," 
Bahremand said. "We've had some unstable contractual arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance firms and HMOs may have another motive for switching from paying 
for health care to delivering it, said Langness, from the Hospital Council of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton health care plan, as initially drafted, leaves no role for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The middleman is going to be cut out of the process," Langness said. "What 
insurance companies and HMOs are trying to do is link up with doctors and 
hospitals."  
</P>
<P>
 Bob Barber never gave health care reform much thought until his heart attack 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
 He was taken to Los Robles Regional Medical Center, where Dr. Irving Loh was 
his attending physician. After keeping him in the intensive care unit for five 
days, Loh recommended a rehabilitation program, which he could do at Los 
Robles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Oak View Medical Group, his IPA, would only approve the physical therapy 
program if Barber did it at Westlake Comprehensive Cancer Center. 
</P>
<P>
 IPAs are loose affiliations of doctors who group together, often as a means of 
providing service as similar to traditional private practices as possible. Like 
all managed-care plans, they assign a primary care physician who then clears 
the way for patient visits to specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber initially won his fight to do his rehabilitation at Los Robles, but 
soon after he received a letter from Oakview saying they were switching him to 
a new cardiologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no intention of changing cardiologists," Barber said. "This guy saved 
my life." The battle continued until Barber switched to a different IPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Kaiser, 63, of Thousand Oaks had a similar problem when she wanted to 
visit Dr. Loh. 
</P>
<P>
 When her husband chose a new HMO plan, she specifically sought Oakview's IPA 
because it included the doctor who had helped her through 10 years of heart 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it was time for her annual heart exam last October, she could not get 
approval to go to Loh. Without approval, the health care plan does not have to 
pay costs for the visit. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of calling the IPA, she was told in early March that she had an 
appointment for an echocardiogram -- but with a different cardiologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really upset me," Kaiser said. "My only reason for picking the group was 
that I wanted to see Dr. Loh." 
</P>
<P>
 She too switched to another IPA, but does not understand what happened. "These 
doctors are in these groups, so why the heck can't we have our own doctors 
back?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh is ready with an answer. He said IPAs often negotiate with certain 
specialists to limit how much they charge and then steer patients their way. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the arrangement, a specialist agrees to a fixed monthly rate per patient 
that does not vary, whether the patient sees the doctor five times a month or 
not at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he said he signed on with the IPA, Loh said he never agreed to be 
limited to a fixed rate and thus his patients were directed to other 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "These groups do it to save money," he said. "It's cheaper for them to send 
the patient to another cardiologist."  
</P>
<P>
 Loh and three other doctors in the Los Robles cardiac unit who had contracts 
with Oakview recently demanded to be dropped from its list of specialists 
because of repeated complaints from their patients that they could not get in 
to see them. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Loh believes that IPAs wanted him on their lists because he is 
well-known and might attract new patients, which they could dispatch to other 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they are doing is perfectly legal," Loh said. "But in my estimation it's 
not ethical." 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators at Oakview refused to comment, though one employee, who would 
not give her name, gave several possible reasons for the confusion. "It could 
have been an error on the patient's part," she said. "An HMO directory could 
have been printed wrong. It could have been a book that was five years old." 
</P>
<P>
 An official from another IPA said that specialists are flattering themselves 
if they think their names are enough to attract patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't use doctors' names to get new patients," said Harris Wasser, 
medical director of Briarwood Medical Group. "That's almost comical. It's more 
imagined than reality." 
</P>
<P>
 The real problem, he said, is that specialists have seen their patient loads 
drop with the advent of managed care, and as a result, they are looking for 
scapegoats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, if you are a neurosurgeon and people have to jump through a hoop 
to come see you, you aren't going to be happy," Wasser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some say that Ventura County has 25% to 50% more specialists than it 
needs. Managed care simply takes fewer doctors, according to American Medical 
Assn. statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The old, traditional insurance program required 224 doctors to treat 100,000 
people. Managed care takes only 120 doctors per 100,000, according to the AMA. 
</P>
<P>
 The specialists have already begun to feel the pinch, said Gosta Iwasiuk, a 
surgeon who heads the Ventura County Medical Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tremendous amount of pressure," Iwasiuk said. "The HMOs are 
squeezing down the amount of money they'll pay for each patient, for each 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The insurance company, the third party who pays the bill, has taken a very 
active part in making the decision about who is treated. The authority of 
doctors is being eroded," Iwasiuk said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It drives me crazy."

AGENCIES READY BIDS FOR CRIME BILL MONEY; LAW ENFORCEMENT: VENTURA COUNTY 
SHERIFF AND POLICE FEAR THEY MAY BE OVERSHADOWED BY URBAN AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police departments in Oxnard, Ventura and Santa Paula are scrambling to retool 
old federal grant applications so they can get in line for a share of President 
Clinton's $30-billion anti-crime package. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Sheriff Larry Carpenter is also studying how to grab a portion 
of the huge pot of money that federal officials promise will boost police 
staffing 18% to 20% nationwide by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The $13.45-billion Cops on the Beat program aims to make good on Clinton's 
campaign promise of putting 100,000 more officers on the street -- which 
Ventura County police chiefs hope could replace officers bled away by the 
county's faltering economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carpenter and local police chiefs worry there will be little left for them 
once Cops on the Beat hires new officers to fight the horrendous crime in the 
nation's larger cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that urban areas with high crime rates are probably going to 
get the lion's share of this money," said Carpenter, whose agency polices half 
the county's 10 cities and all of the unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Police Chief Harold Hurtt is also concerned about the competitive 
disadvantage of local police agencies. "We're probably going to be punished 
because of our low crime rate in the county," Hurtt said. "There's an awful lot 
of agencies around the country that are in worse shape than we are." 
</P>
<P>
 But U. S. Justice Department officials brushed these doubts aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Police agencies of all sizes will have an even shot at the money, said 
Caroline Adelman, a Justice Department spokeswoman. She said the grants will be 
doled out according to a variety of factors, including high crime rates and a 
need for community-based police patrols to prevent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone has a plan that this much money's going to the Northeast 
and this much to the Southwest," she said. "We're very aware that when you pop 
a whole bunch of police into one area, crime can spread into correlating areas. 
. . . I don't think that because Los Angeles gets a whole bunch none of the 
surrounding areas will." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who met last week with officials from all 
the county's police agencies, said: "(The) Justice (Department) has assured me 
that this is going to be a fair shake. It's not all going to go to the urban 
areas like Los Angeles and Detroit and New York City." 
</P>
<P>
 And Gallegly pointed out that with a faltering economy and persistent gang 
problems, Ventura County also needs the kind of crime-prevention programs the 
crime bill offers in addition to Cops on the Beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Justice Department offered a similar program to help police 
departments hire more officers. But the program only promised to pay for half 
of the costs of equipping, training and paying the officers.  
</P>
<P>
 This time around, Adelman said, the Justice Department will start by kicking 
in 75% of the cost of new officers, with local agencies paying the rest. The 
federal share shrinks year by year until 2000, when the police departments must 
find state or local funding to cover the salaries and other costs of new 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, departments that lost bids for last year's grants will be 
considered first this time, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the first in line will be Ventura County's largest city police force and 
one of its smallest -- Oxnard and Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 With barely one officer per 1,000 residents, the Oxnard force is one of the 
nation's leanest and busiest for cities of its size, Chief Hurtt said. He is 
not pleased that the force's average response to emergencies has slowed in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reduces our flexibility to respond to problem areas," Hurtt said, "like 
areas with high rates of burglaries or areas where drugs are being sold on the 
street. We don't have a ready pool of people that we can assign to that for a 
long-term basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Oxnard applied for a $1-million slice of the $150-million federal 
allotment for new officers, hoping to boost its 164-member force by another 16 
officers, Assistant Chief Tom Cady said. The bid was turned down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, while asking for extra officers, the department also will seek 
money to support anti-crime programs such as the Police Activities League, the 
Boys & Girls Clubs and a midnight sports league touted in the Clinton crime 
bill as a way to keep youths off the street and out of trouble, Cady said. 
</P>
<P>
 An influx of new officers would free community-policing supervisors to work 
full time with neighborhood leaders, Hurtt said. Also, he said, 
crime-prevention grants would give police a head start with youths at risk of 
becoming criminals, Hurtt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to realize we need to start extending programs to prevent people from 
committing serious crimes, and we need to do that through education," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula police say they face an even tougher situation, given that the 
city's police force has dropped to 29 officers, the level it was at 22 years 
ago. In that same time period, the city's population has swelled from 19,000 to 
27,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, police lock the dispatchers inside the station house after hours because 
officers cannot be spared to staff the front desk, said Chief Walt Adair. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has put off maintenance on the building. The D.A.R.E. program 
was shut down in the first half of the year. And with officers spending most of 
their time handling crimes against people, there is no time to follow up on 
smaller crimes such as minor burglaries, Adair said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Santa Paula police applied for a $287,000 federal grant under the 
U. S. Attorney General's Police Officer Hiring Program, promising to match it 
with $287,000 in city money to hire three new officers. The bid was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're providing basic law enforcement services," Adair said last week. "An 
18% to 20% increase in the department would make a world of difference in what 
we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, the city's 117-officer Police Department also sought federal aid 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura police asked for nearly $1 million to extend the tenure of nine 
officers who were about to be laid off due to city cutbacks, said Robbie 
Robinson, administrative assistant to the city's police and fire chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the City Council restored six of the positions and extended the 
other three until next July in hopes that the department could come up with the 
funding, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said he will apply for federal aid to retain the remaining three 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Sheriff's Department was the only Ventura County law 
enforcement agency to win any of the grant money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department awarded the sheriff $300,000 -- which the county met 
with matching funds and augmented with money for new equipment and supplies -- 
to open a storefront police station in Fillmore, said Chief Deputy Kenneth 
Kipp. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kipp and Sheriff Carpenter scoffed at promises that the crime bill would 
increase their ranks by 18% to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got 700 sworn officers in this department," Carpenter said, working the 
math. "That's 140 deputies somebody's got to write a check for. Does that make 
sense? That's huge ." 
</P>
<P>
 Kipp added: "I think that's probably optimistic political rhetoric. Just based 
on past (grant) attempts, where this money is going to is certainly not cities 
in Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Carpenter said Kipp has already registered the department's 
intent to apply for the grant with federal officials. "My hope is that it 
works," the sheriff said, "but I think an 18% to 20% net increase is dreaming." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the county's other police departments -- Port Hueneme and Simi 
Valley -- said they too will be looking for ways to apply for the crime bill 
money. So will the county's Department of Corrections Services and the district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department will issue its grant application forms in November and 
formalize what criteria will be needed to win grants, Adelman said. Until then, 
she said, it is impossible to determine who will get how much. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Honberger, a lobbyist for Ventura County in Washington, said he 
estimates the federal government will allot enough money to hire 10,000 
officers in California. But he said that local police are right to worry that 
Los Angeles' police agencies will overshadow them when payout time comes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they would be foolish not to apply," Honberger said. He noted that the 
crime bill also had money for local governments in a section called the Local 
Partnership Act. The county and city governments are in line for about $3 
million, according to congressional sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Honberger advised that the police agencies gear their grant proposals toward 
beefing up existing police programs with extra officers rather than simply 
hiring more line officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow lobbyist Tom Walters predicted that agencies that recycle old 
applications from last fall's appropriation could have new officers in as short 
of a time as six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly vowed to press for as much money as possible for the county, but he 
warned police departments not to wish for too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's never going to be enough money to go around to satisfy all the 
needs," Gallegly said. "There may not be 100% of what Santa Paula needs or what 
Oxnard needs. But there should definitely be enough money in this bill to 
provide some assistance." One Small Slice 
</P>
<P>
 The Local Partnership Act, one segment of the $30-billion crime bill, gives 
$216 million to local governments in California. Cities and counties may spend 
the money on education, drug treatment or jobs programs. Here's an estimated 
breakdown of local shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo: $23,514 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore: $49,603 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark: $47,474 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai: $18,950

 Oxnard: $1,183,897

<P>
 Port Hueneme: $113,404 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula: $116,554 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley: $96,394 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks: $28,434

COASTWALKERS HIKE 36 MILES ON PRINCIPLE; OUTDOORS: GROUP ENVISIONS A SHORE 
TRAIL FROM OREGON TO MEXICO. WALK IS STAGED TO EDUCATE PUBLIC ON BEACH ACCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Leo Carrillo State Beach parking lot firmly in her sights, 67-year-old 
Hazel O'Donnell finally slowed her stride. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After five days of walking, her straw visor was adorned with five sea gull 
feathers, her knapsack was full of sand, her new hiking boots had become old 
friends, and Coastwalk, a journey down the Ventura County coastline, was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to see if I was fit enough to do it," the Newbury Park resident 
said, coming to a halt with a smile of satisfaction. "I guess I am. I feel 
great." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, O'Donnell had breast cancer and a mastectomy. She refused to quit 
her job as a waitress in the Agoura Hills Denny's, because she says, she hates 
having nothing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, she used that energy to promote a rather utopian cause, Coastwalk's 
dream of a coastal trail running from the Oregon border to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental group based in Sonoma has staged walks in various Northern 
California counties since 1983. But this is the first year the group has 
organized walks the entire length of California's coastline and the first time 
Ventura County has been tackled. 
</P>
<P>
 The premise was simple: Learn about the coast by covering its length a step at 
a time. But executing the challenge was far more complicated, and exhausting, 
than any of its participants expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with 20 others, ranging in age from 5 to the mid-70s, O'Donnell plodded 
across sandy beaches, over slippery rocks, on city streets, and all too often 
on the dirty shoulder of Pacific Coast Highway, traveling about 36 miles in 
five days. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastwalk tries to educate the public about its rights to access to the 
California coast, or at least to the beach below the high-tide line as put 
forth in Article 10 of the state constitution. The treks are part political 
statement, part educational venture, and part hard work -- as O'Donnell and her 
companions found last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although miles of sandy beach along Ventura's coastline reach out invitingly, 
the Coastwalkers, as they called themselves, found numerous obstacles, man-made 
and natural, to continuous oceanfront walking. 
</P>
<P>
 High tides and no-trespassing signs at the private communities of Seacliff, 
Faria and Solimar stymied the trekkers up the coast from Ventura, sending them 
into vans to shuttle to the next point of coastal access.  
</P>
<P>
 Getting around the Port of Hueneme Harbor involved a long detour through the 
Port Hueneme Naval Base. Farther down the coast, they were turned away by 
barbed wire fences that surround Point Mugu Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 They did what they could, sticking as close to the water as possible, often 
getting drenched by rogue waves in the process. They shuttled cars every 
morning so they would be ready to drive around the man-made barriers. They 
helped each other over the rocks and up the hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight of the Coastwalkers were senior citizens, three were children. Many were 
not terribly fit and most unfamiliar with camping. Several were in the midst of 
divorces and were looking for peace of mind along the trail.  
</P>
<P>
 The leader was a 70-year-old man whose hearing aids were in the shop (they 
rusted after he flipped a kayak a few months back). But all of them were 
remarkably patient and surprisingly tough. DAY 1: CARPINTERIA BEACH 
</P>
<P>
 Adjusting the unfamiliar weight of backpacks and tightening laces on their 
hiking boots, the group of 21 Coastwalkers set out fresh on Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hot and clear, with only an edge of fog visible, far beyond the oil 
platforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Leader Tom Maxwell, a 70-year-old with the legs of a man half his age, pointed 
out a few curious seals popping their heads out of a kelp bed near the pier. 
The Coastwalkers headed down a precarious edge to the sand and rocks below. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't walk too close to the edge or it might cave in," Maxwell said, blithely 
ushering the first walker under a strand of barbed wire. 
</P>
<P>
 The coastal trek was laced with lessons, under the leadership of Maxwell, a 
retired Cal Lutheran anthropology professor with a vast store of knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is oil," he said, pointing to a natural seep in a patch of rocks 
glistening with an black sheen. A trickle of viscous black goo dripped onto the 
sand. The walkers looked worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, this shale is naturally full of oil," he said. "It isn't leaking out of 
those Chevron tanks." 
</P>
<P>
 The same tarry glop on the rocks was once used by Native Americans to caulk 
their canoes, Maxwell explained. 
</P>
<P>
 The group soon broke into twos and threes heading across Carpinteria State 
Beach, then Bates Beach. The older Coastwalkers politely averted their eyes on 
the nude section of Bates Beach while the children stared openly. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell stopped to mop her brow with a damp cloth. "I'm only doing this to 
prove a point to myself," she said, sweat beading up on her fair skin, "to 
prove I could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 She confides she hasn't slept in a tent in 25 years. To train for Coastwalk, 
she walked four or five miles at a stretch around her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're coming into Ventura County now," said Maxwell, as the group passed the 
county-line marker, a wooden pole tilting a little in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Where a small group of posh houses curve around Rincon Point, Mary Fink, a 
73-year-old Sonoma woman, discovered a dead bird. She found a small metal band 
encircling one of the bird's legs. Tiny numbers were barely visible. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, you should always look at the dead birds on the beach," Fink told the 
walkers. "That metal band means someone has been tracking this bird and they'll 
want to know what happened to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking out her penknife, Fink sliced off the bird's leg and stashed it in her 
pack, telling the others she would send the band to federal wildlife officials. 
Fink is something of a Coastwalk expert. She has been on every walk since 1983. 
This summer, she began at the Oregon border June 12 and hopes to reach Mexico 
on Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 A few yards away, the beach ends abruptly. The waves crash against a rock wall 
at the base of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall provided a perfect backdrop for a political speech for Richard 
Nichols, Coastwalk's statewide coordinator.  
</P>
<P>
 "The enemy is the freeway," said Nichols, a middle-aged environmental activist 
with a walrus mustache. "There is no beach here anymore because the waves bang 
up against the freeway and pull all the sand out." 
</P>
<P>
 High tides again trapped the group just north of the Cliff House Hotel and 
Rincon Island, forcing the group onto the shoulder of the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Single file, with 10 feet between people," Maxwell said. "That way they can 
only take out one of us at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 The little parade marched down the Ventura Freeway, drawing swiveled heads 
from the occupants of cars and trucks whizzing by. 
</P>
<P>
 The exclusive seaside communities of Seacliff, Faria and Solimar presented 
another barrier to coastal access. 
</P>
<P>
 The public can walk along the beach during low tide. But when the ocean rises, 
the beachfront houses, many protected by concrete seawalls, block the way to 
the beach. And homeowners post no-trespassing signs, showing no ambiguity about 
what they think of visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 So the group boarded vans, drove along Pacific Coast Highway and hunted for an 
entry point to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "How about there?" Elaine Kendrick of Ventura said. "Oh no, it's gated. Keep 
going. We'll just drive until we get access." 
</P>
<P>
 The vans finally stopped at the southernmost edge of Rincon Parkway, just past 
the row of RVs parked in front of the seawall. The group tumbled out, ready to 
walk the rest of the way to camp at Emma Wood State Beach Campground, less than 
two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastwalk had arranged for dinner to be waiting at the campsite, and the 
hungry walkers fell on barbecued chicken, baked beans and cans of cheap beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite complaints of sore legs, sunburned shoulders and blistered feet, the 
Coastwalkers were obviously pleased by their first day of hiking. By the time 
they gathered around the campfire, nearly everyone was boasting a clean, new 
Coastwalk T-shirt, dug out from a cardboard box in the back of Nichols' van. 
DAY 2: EMMA WOOD BEACH 
</P>
<P>
 The morning begins with groans, pancakes, and a heavy fog chilling the air. 
Between the trains on the ocean side of the campground and Ventura Freeway 
traffic on the other, few hikers slept through the night. 
</P>
<P>
 By 7:48 they had torn down their tents and stuffed them into a station wagon 
bound for the next night's campground. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading out to the beach, Kelsey McCalla, a 10-year-old from Simi Valley 
hiking with her aunt, stopped to search the train tracks for the pennies she 
had left on them the night before. Clutching the flattened coins, she climbed 
over the rounded rocks that line the shore at Emma Wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am an adventuress," she proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 The mouth of the Ventura River was dry, but littered with the carcasses of 
five sea lions, in various states of decay. The walkers also found three dead 
birds and something that looked like it had been a cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Camille Ahmadzai poked at a can lying in the sand. "This is a dead animal too, 
of the Budweiser species," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group used a sandbar to make a dry crossing and followed the bike path 
beyond Surfer's Point, winding its way into Ventura.  
</P>
<P>
 In front of the Holiday Inn, Nichols posed the group for pictures with the 
Coastwalk banner. "We call this a 'name it and proclaim it' ceremony," he said. 
"You may think that we're providing these walks for pleasant beach strolls, but 
what we're really doing is promoting the idea of a continuous trail down the 
coast." 
</P>
<P>
 On San Buenaventura State Beach, Maxwell discovered a sea hare. He picked it 
up, watching it elongate in his hand. He described the way it inks the water to 
camouflage itself from predators, then gently put it down on the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess that's what attracts people to the ocean," mused septuagenarian Dan 
Hirtz of Santa Rosa, rolling his pants up to wade in the surf. "You never know 
what you're going to find, whether it is a bird or a sea hare or something." 
</P>
<P>
 At Marina Park, True Heitz of Ojai was waiting with a pickup truck filled with 
kayaks. She had volunteered to lead a small fleet of kayaks across Ventura 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Coastwalkers had never been in kayaks before. A few, including 
Shelley Sharp, her 5-year-old son Tyler, and O'Donnell decided to take Heitz's 
truck instead. "I'm not a water rat," O'Donnell said firmly. 
</P>
<P>
 But 16 Coastwalkers did put to sea, experimenting with paddling techniques and 
bumping into each other like rubber ducks in a bathtub. They waited for several 
fishing boats to go by, then shot across the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 A sea lion sunning itself on the dock barked at the flotilla of kayaks going 
by, then flopped into the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was great," Nancy Kellogg of West Hills said as she pulled herself up on 
the dock and then checked to make sure her niece and nephew made it across. 
"Where can we rent some if we come back?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Watts, a 70-year-old Thousand Oaks retiree who said he keeps busy climbing 
the highest peaks in the Sierra, sat down on the wall at the entrance to the 
Channel Islands visitors center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wouldn't take too much to become a beach bum," he observed, resting back on 
his elbows to dry his shorts in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 By 5 p.m. the group began moving at a fast clip down the beach toward McGrath 
State Beach Campground, wading through the Santa Clara River toward the promise 
of showers -- 25 cents for two minutes of hot water -- and lasagna from 
Maxwell's wife, Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
 With the day almost over, some of the walkers become reflective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really impressed by Ventura," Hirtz said. "I always thought it was a dump 
before. The beaches are beautiful, and anyone can come to the beach; you don't 
have to be rich." 
</P>
<P>
 Anup Bhowmik and his son, Ajit, 14, both of Westlake Village, were dragging 
behind the others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ajit wants to be in the water, not walking by it all the time," Bhowmik 
explained. "Coastwalk is a little too much of a cause for me." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kellogg interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the cause," she said. "It feels good to be participating in something 
that might actually wake people up to the fact that we're losing our coast." 
DAY 3: MCGRATH STATE BEACH 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday was the longest day, more than nine miles of hiking punctuated by 
several unsurmountable obstacles: two harbors, one decidedly not scenic Navy 
base and another base protected by razor wire and signs warning to keep off the 
U.S. Government property. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike began at McGrath Lake, with a discussion of how last December's oil 
spill affected wildlife and vegetation. Then the group moved on along the beach 
to the Mandalay Power Plant, where Heitz swam across Edison Canal while the 
rest of the Coastwalkers took the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the power plant and Mandalay State Beach, homes press up against the 
wide swath of sand at Oxnard State and Hollywood beaches. They stack up on both 
sides of man-made Channel Islands Harbor, tucked in between Hollywood Beach and 
Silver Strand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure wish the move to save the California coastline had started in the 
1940s," groused Nichols, stepping onto the asphalt path around the harbor. 
"We're about 30 years too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Any development made Nichols grumble. But for most, walking on paved streets 
instead of soft sand was a relief for the Coastwalkers. 
</P>
<P>
 They walked down Victoria Avenue and passed through the gates of the Port 
Hueneme Naval Construction Battalion Center. The group was getting tired and a 
mini-mutiny almost broke out when Nichols ordered Coastwalkers into a 
crosswalk, accusing them of acting like 5-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me, who's the 5-year-old?" mumbled Shelley Sharp, reluctantly 
backtracking to find a crosswalk with the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Once out of the base, they stopped at the Port of Hueneme, appealing to port 
officials to let future Coastwalkers cross the mouth of the harbor. A bridge? A 
tunnel? A Chunnel? 
</P>
<P>
 Port official Kam Quarles laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll keep you in mind," he said. "But I don't think the Hueneme Golden Gate 
or Chunnel is going to happen any time soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for the Coastwalkers on the edge of Port Hueneme Beach was Al Sanders, 
a Sierra Club member and self-appointed guardian of Oxnard's endangered sea 
birds, the least tern and snowy plover. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other than Camp Pendleton, this is the best nesting site for least terns in 
Southern California," Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
 The birds nest along the Hueneme Lagoon, an estuary behind the beach. At the 
far end of the lagoon is Halaco Engineering Co.'s aluminum recycling plant. An 
enormous pile of metal tailings sits next to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The wide stretch of white sand at Ormond State Beach was deserted, except for 
brown pelicans, sea gulls, terns and the steam-belching Ormond Beach Power 
Plant. 
</P>
<P>
 A mile later, the security fence around Point Mugu Navy base came into sight 
through the late afternoon mist. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials rejected a request by Coastwalk to walk the base's four-mile 
sandy coastline. They offered instead to ferry some of the group by bus, but 
wouldn't take the children. 
</P>
<P>
 So Maxwell decided to bypass the base altogether. He was also told the public 
is not allowed even on the seaward side of the high-tide mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me we'd have to stay at the surf line and if we washed ashore 
they'd arrest us," Maxwell said. "I don't understand why this excellent beach 
has to be kept in a state of secrecy." 
</P>
<P>
 The base's 10-foot barbed wire fence extends into the surf. Reaching it, 
Maxwell climbed a few feet upward, then turned to bellow about the unfairness 
of the military. 
</P>
<P>
 The group peered through the fence and then walked inland to the waiting vans, 
putting aside talk of military injustice in favor of anticipation of that 
night's feast: seafood enchiladas, Caesar salad and chocolate mousse. DAY 4: 
MUGU ROCK 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it only 8:30? It seems like I've been up for hours and hours," Camille 
Ahmadzai said with a yawn. She looked around at her fellow Coastwalkers 
gathered in a damp group next to Mugu Rock. "Come to think of it, I guess I 
have been up for hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran geology professor Bill Bilodeau had come to speak to the group 
about the geological history of the coastline. But the days of politely 
listening to the invited guest speaker, or at least pretending to, were long 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
 As Bilodeau explained why the Santa Monica Mountains run east-to-west, the 
Coastwalkers shifted on sore feet and gazed longingly down the beach toward the 
county line, still a day away. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind Mugu Rock, giant slabs of Old Pacific Coast Highway lie on the rocks 
below. Some sections of it still stand, though almost completely undercut by 
waves and weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the years I've been coming by here and I've never gotten out and walked 
around," Jim Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Bilodeau pointed to a fossilized clamshell embedded in the damp rocks, a 
wave crashed over the group, soaking Watts and several other Coastwalkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazel O'Donnell decided to opt out of the day's hike, which wound eight miles 
into Point Mugu State Park to look at the aftermath of November's wildfires. 
Instead, she and several of the older women decided to stick to the coast, 
ambling down two miles of sandy beach to the Sycamore Canyon Campground. 
</P>
<P>
 The others strapped on backpacks and climbed 863 feet up the Chumash trail, 
just north on the other side of Pacific Coast Highway. Botanist Milt MacAuley, 
author of several books on regional wildflowers, led the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail has been in use for 7,000 years, he said, giving passageway to 
Chumash making their way from camps in the La Jolla Valley down to the ocean to 
collect food. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chumash Trail connects to the Backbone Trail, which runs throughout the 
Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere along the eight-mile trek through dust and dirt, the 10-year-old 
cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired," Kelsey said, tugging on the hand of her aunt. "Too much walking. 
How much farther?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the relative cool of Sycamore Canyon, she ducked her blond ponytail under a 
faucet and emerged restored, leading the rest of the pack into camp where the 
beach walkers were waiting, along with a batch of ravioli and another throng of 
hungry mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 miles down and only about six to go. DAY 5: SYCAMORE CANYON 
</P>
<P>
 "Today you're going to have to have a little patience," said Jim Watts, the 
morning's hike leader. "We're going to be bouncing back and forth like a 
Ping-Pong ball from the beach to the road." 
</P>
<P>
 But patience was not a problem. To reach the Los Angeles County line, the 
group had just under six miles to travel. The terrain was relatively easy, and 
followed what is arguably Ventura County's most spectacular coastline. The 
Coastwalkers were positively lighthearted. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols took up the sweep position in the rear, armed with a SLOW sign for the 
benefit of traffic whipping around the curves along Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Watts broke stride along the shoulder during a break in the traffic, looking 
at the swirling blue-green water below. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so quiet when the cars thin out, isn't it?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just then a line of brown pelicans, nearly matching Coastwalkers in numbers, 
flew by, headed up the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got six bug bites," Kelsey told her Aunt Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all?" said Kellogg. "I've got 37." 
</P>
<P>
 They laughed together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kelsey and I have decided we're going to quit our jobs and school and just go 
on Coastwalks," Kellogg told the group behind her. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after 10 a.m., Watts spotted a place to get down off the highway and onto 
the beach, the patch of sand too small to appear on any map. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of it, boulders took over the coastline, and once again the 
Coastwalkers were forced back to the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled at the beginning of the next beach are about 10 homes, lined with 
decks and huge windows. Using the fence of a house as a guardrail, the 
Coastwalkers edged down to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder what kind of jobs they have," said Shelley Sharp, looking up at the 
homes from under the weight of son Tyler riding on her shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Another rocky point and the Coastwalkers emerged onto the beginning of County 
Line Beach, filled with wet-suited surfers who stared at the bedraggled group 
trudging through the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 A cluster of homes known as Malibu Village sits in the middle of the beach. A 
seawall stands solidly at the end of the development, protecting the homes from 
the onslaught of wind-driven waves. 
</P>
<P>
 With no-trespassing signs visible, the Coastwalkers kept going. Surfers bobbed 
on gentle waves, children screeched from boogie boards and sunbathers dozed on 
blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is why people come to Southern California," Watts said, gesturing at it 
all. "I don't care how bad the economy gets, the weather and the beaches will 
always draw people here." 
</P>
<P>
 Along that stretch of beach, just after 1 p.m., the Coastwalkers slipped past 
the unmarked boundary into Los Angeles County. They had reached their 
destination but were too busy striding down the beach to notice. 
</P>

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SUSPECT WOUNDED BY NON-LETHAL WEAPON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura man was in fair condition Saturday after being shot by Ventura 
police officers, who for the first time used non-lethal soft projectiles filled 
with sand, said Sgt. Carl Handy of the department's Special Enforcement Team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 100% convinced (that) if we hadn't used this device, the suspect would be 
dead now," Handy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Pickett, 36, was shot about 10 p.m. Friday after lunging at officers with 
a knife, Handy said. He was in police custody Saturday at Ventura County 
Medical Center recovering from injuries sustained after being hit several times 
in the chest with the non-lethal sandbags, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sandbags measure 2-by-2 inches, Handy said, and are used by other police 
departments nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers had responded to a report of a domestic dispute and found Pickett 
with a six-inch steak knife in the carport of a residence in the 1100 block of 
Acadia Place in Ventura, Handy said. When officers attempted to arrest Pickett, 
Handy said, he lunged at them with the knife. 
</P>
<P>
 "We emptied two containers of (pepper) spray on him to no effect," Handy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Roger Nustad finally leveled a shotgun loaded with the soft projectiles, 
hitting Pickett five times in the chest, Handy said. The sandbags are meant to 
incapacitate the assailant with blunt trauma. The bags travel about 380 to 400 
feet per second, whereas a normal shotgun round travels about 1,200 feet per 
second, Handy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickett was arrested on suspicion of assault on five officers and possession 
of crack cocaine. No officers were injured in the incident. SCOTT HADLY

 Despite clear skies and warm temperatures, lifeguards at Ventura County 
beaches reported uncrowded conditions Saturday, the first day of the Labor Day 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot busier weekends this summer," said Scott Parrish, a Ventura 
State Beach lifeguard.Parish expected bigger crowds today and Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters are predicting early morning and late-night fog but otherwise 
sunny weather with beachside temperatures in the 70s and inland temperatures 
reaching 90 degrees, said Stuart Ceto, a weather specialist with the National 
Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a fatal accident on the 101 freeway in Santa Barbara County, the 
local California Highway Patrol reported no major accidents or incidents Friday 
night or Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP has boosted patrols over the holiday weekend, reporting a lower than 
average number of drunk-driving arrests for the first night of the holiday.

TIMES VENTURA EDITION WINS 46 AWARDS FOR COUNTY COVERAGE; HONORS: STAFF WRITERS 
AND PHOTOGRAPHERS CAPTURE 16 OF 17 FIRST-PLACE PRIZES. THE COMPETITION 
ATTRACTED ABOUT 200 ENTRIES.

 The Ventura County Edition of the Los Angeles Times has won 16 of 17 
first-place awards given by the Ventura County Press Club for excellence in 
daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Times captured 16 first-place honors for its local coverage, in categories 
ranging from best news story to best photo page. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, the Times won 46 of the 56 prizes given to daily newspapers and in 
nine categories swept every award. Ventura County Newspapers won six prizes, 
and the Los Angeles Daily News won four awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest drew about 200 entries and was judged by members of the San Diego 
Press Club. It is the first time that the Ventura County Press Club has held a 
journalism contest since the 100-member group formed in 1990, said club 
President Jeff Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very gratified by the turnout," Mitchell said. "It shows that 
journalists in Ventura County have a high competitive edge and believe in 
supporting journalism education." 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the contest and awards banquet will benefit the club's newly 
formed journalism scholarship fund, Mitchell said. Keynote speaker at the Oct. 
7 awards dinner at the Wedgewood Banquet Center in Ventura will be Van Gordon 
Sauter. He is president of the news division of the Fox Network and former 
president of the news division of CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staffer Daryl Kelley won the most individual awards, picking up seven 
prizes -- including every honor given for investigative journalism. Kelley won 
first-place awards in two categories, best investigative reporting and best 
environmental story. Kelley's piece on questionable tax breaks given to some 
Ventura County property owners under a state farmland conservation law earned 
top honors in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Simon, also a staff reporter for the Ventura County Edition of The 
Times, won the most first-place awards, with four top honors. Simon's series 
"60 Acres of Hope," which follows the progress of one local farming operation 
for a year, won first place for best news series. 
</P>
<P>
 Another agriculture story, on the economics of farming, won Simon first place 
for best business story. She also won first place in the category of best 
feature story for "Diary of a Disaster," which chronicled the effects of the 
Northridge earthquake in the week following the disaster. And Simon was the 
lead reporter and writer in the team news reporting category for coverage of 
the funeral for Alan Winterbourne, the Ventura man shot down by police after 
killing four people. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Times staffers and correspondents taking first-place wins were: Mack 
Reed, best news story by a single reporter; Jeff Fletcher and Aaron Curtiss for 
best sports news story; Steve Henson for best sports feature story; Maia Davis 
for best military story; Bill Locey for best arts and entertainment story; 
Phillip Brandes for best arts and entertainment review; Carlos Chavez for best 
news photo and best photo page or series; Wendy Lamm for best feature photo, 
and Anne Cusack for best sports photo. 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen Magee, a staff writer for Ventura County Newspapers, won the 
first-place prize for best education story for her reporting on a revenue deal 
between the Rio Elementary School District and discount chain WalMart and 
Shopping at the Rose. 
</P>
<P>

FALL ENROLLMENT DIPS AT VALLEY COMMUNITY COLLEGES; EDUCATION: DECLINE IS BLAMED 
ON THE LOSS OF POTENTIAL STUDENTS FORCED TO MOVE BECAUSE OF DAMAGE FROM THE 
JAN. 17 QUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a continuing decline that officials blame on the lingering impact of the 
Northridge earthquake, initial enrollments are down again this fall at all 
three San Fernando Valley campuses in the Los Angeles Community College 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce College in Woodland Hills suffered the largest drop of the district's 
nine campuses. Pierce's day-to-day enrollment totals are running 6% to 7% below 
corresponding days a year ago, district officials said, despite the naming of a 
new acting president last spring whose goal was to increase enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollments at Valley College in Van Nuys last week, the second of the 
semester, were running about 4% below last year's levels. The numbers at 
Mission College in Sylmar were down 1% to 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Total district enrollment as of Tuesday was down 1% to 101,461, its lowest 
level since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 District Interim Chancellor Neil Yoneji blamed the 6.8 magnitude earthquake on 
Jan. 17 for the weak showings of the Valley colleges. Because the quake wrecked 
many Valley area homes and apartments, it forced potential students for the 
three colleges out of the area, Yoneji said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Los Angeles riots, which damaged mostly businesses, the earthquake 
caused extensive damage to residences in the Valley that may result in a dip in 
enrollments through this and the next school year, Yoneji said. 
</P>
<P>
 George Prather, a senior research analyst for the district, predicted that the 
final districtwide enrollment for the fall semester, calculated later this 
month, will remain slightly less than last year's. Without the quake, he said, 
total enrollment would have risen slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, district officials said they were heartened at the relatively 
small districtwide loss, especially coming on the heels of an 11% drop in the 
fall of 1993 and a nearly 2% decline in the fall of 1992 after state fee 
increases. This summer, the Legislature kept community college fees at $13 per 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Tuesday, Pierce's enrollment was 15,077, its lowest fall level since 
1969. The college, which once had the district's largest enrollment, now ranks 
fourth after declines in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley, now ranked first in enrollment, had 16,004 students last week. This 
fall's decline, after drops in the past two years, has brought the college's 
enrollment to its lowest level since 1966, district records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission, now ranked eighth of nine district colleges in enrollment, had 5,814 
students last week, its lowest level since 1990. The college had been growing 
rather steadily until last fall, when it suffered an enormous 18% drop in 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Among enrollments at the district's other campuses, East Los Angeles is up 
about 8%, West Los Angeles is up about 3% and City is up about 1%. Harbor is 
down about 1% and Southwest and Trade-Tech are down about 4%, according to 
district records.

<TEXT>
<P>
 I appreciated the story headlined "Teamsters Target Sam's Club in Fullerton" 
(Aug. 8). 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a news story that actually adheres to the old 
who-what-when-where-and-how rule of journalism. The lead paragraph actually 
summarizes the story; the subsequent paragraphs are in descending order of 
importance. It's reassuring to see a news story written in the traditional 
manner. It actually imparts information clearly and concisely. What a change 
from the all-too-frequent "cutesy" leads and filler paragraphs that divert 
readers' attention from the facts.

DELTA SITUATION NEEDS A BETTER APPROACH

<TEXT>
<P>
 How much is an empty building worth? Is there a tenant with 900 jobs just 
waiting to move into scarce space? 
</P>
<P>
 At less than $1,000 per job, retaining the current rent would be a bargain for 
the economic well-being of Los Angeles ("Delta Workers Wonder Where They'll 
Land," Aug. 8). 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder other countries and states laugh at us and steal our economic base, 
when we approach decisions as described in your article.

HOT PROPERTY: A HOUSE CALL FOR 'DR. QUINN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 JANE SEYMOUR, an Emmy Awards nominee for her starring role in the CBS series 
"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman," and her husband, James Keach, who directed the 
Emmy-nominated performance, are putting their country house in England up for 
lease at $10,000 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've owned it for almost 12 years now," Seymour said by phone from her Malibu 
home, "and I do miss not going there this summer." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, married about a year ago, has been busy with their children, 
charities and work. When not with her own two children and two stepchildren, 
Seymour has been assisting Child Help USA and City Hearts, for abused and urban 
youths. A watercolor and sketch artist, she produced a series of note cards to 
benefit the nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Seymour is getting ready for a new season of "Dr. Quinn," while 
actor/director Keach has been doing post-production work as director of "The 
Stars Fell on Henrietta," a comic drama about the early days of wildcat oil 
drilling, starring Robert Duvall. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the series and James' work, we were in a dilemma over whether we should 
sell it or lease it out until we can use it again," Seymour said about their 
country home, St. Catherine's Court, which is on about 13 acres near Bath. "We 
decided to rent it out to people who want a British experience that they can 
only get by living in a house such as ours." 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-bedroom house was built primarily during Henry VIII's reign, though 
parts date back to about 950, when a Benedictine monastery was there, Seymour 
said. The house, which has been refurbished, has five reception rooms, a 
ballroom with near-perfect acoustics and an Elizabethan-style dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are also Elizabethan grass steps, 500 trees, terraced gardens. And the 
house is covered with white roses," Seymour said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Wachtel of Overseas Connection in Sag Harbor, New York, is handling the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 The Calabasas house that JOSE and KITTY MENENDEZ were building when they were 
murdered in their Beverly Hills home in 1989 will be sold at a probate hearing 
at 3 p.m. Thursday in the Beverly Hills Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an accepted offer on the property, and overbids may open at 
$1,391,750, according to public records. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly 8,000-square-foot mansion, which is on 14 acres, was last listed at 
$1,925,000. It was originally on the market before the murders at more than $3 
million, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds will go to heirs of the estate. If acquitted, either or both of the 
Menendezes' sons, accused of killing their parents, will be the heir or heirs; 
if both are convicted of murder, Jose's mother and Kitty's stepmother will be 
the heirs. However, liens and loans against the property total about $1 
million, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose and Kitty Menendez paid about $1 million for the estate and put an 
additional $500,000 into upgrades, which Kitty was supervising at the time of 
her death. The house, where the couple had planned to move but then decided to 
sell, has seven bedrooms, five fireplaces, a guest house, tennis court and 
plans for a par-three, six-hole golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Goldberg of Spierer and Woodward, Redondo Beach, is the attorney 
handling the sale. The home has been listed with Bernie Uechtritz of RE/MAX 
West Realty, Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedian YAKOV SMIRNOFF -- who plays a pilot on the N.Y. Skyride, a virtual 
reality theater debuting this fall in the Empire State Building -- has 
re-listed his Pacific Palisades home, which he first put on the market in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Smirnoff, who moved with his family to Branson, Mo., last December, took his 
ranch-style house overlooking the Riviera Golf Course off the market for awhile 
but has just listed it at $2.15 million, or $6,900 a month to lease. He was 
asking nearly $2.3 million in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Smirnoff performs regularly in Branson and participated, with Johnny Cash and 
Barbara Mandrell, in the special "Star-Spangled Branson," which aired July 3 on 
the Family Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 His 3,300-square-foot Pacific Palisades home has three bedrooms plus maid's 
quarters and is listed with Jackie Fronen and Raquel Kaufman at Nourmand & 
Associates, Beverly Hills.

EXPO HAS TIPS ON QUALIFYING WITH 5% DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A growing number of banks, S&Ls and other commercial lenders are promising to 
loosen their requirements for low-down payment loans. This could be good news 
to strapped borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Learn how to qualify for loans with as little as 5% down at the first Los 
Angeles Times' Low-Down Home Loan Expo from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 
24, at the Burbank Hilton Convention Center, 2500 Hollywood Way, Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lenders are offering low-down loans that don't require private mortgage 
insurance (PMI) and permit borrowers to tap a generous relative or parent who 
is willing to give them the entire 5% down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannie Mae's Community Home Buyers Program, which is originated by private 
lenders, allows first-time buyers with little cash to obtain 95% financing. And 
borrowers may put down only 3% of their own money, with the remainder permitted 
in the form of a gift from family members, a government program or nonprofit 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the all-day consumer education event is $5, but clip the discount 
coupon in the ad in today's Real Estate section and save $2. 
</P>
<P>

YOUR MORTGAGE; SHOULD LENDERS OPT FOR ON-LINE APPRAISALS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's real estate appraisers want home buyers and sellers to get 
involved in a dispute they've just kicked off with major mortgage lenders: 
</P>
<P>
 Whether lenders should use electronic databases on home values as substitutes 
for traditional appraisals performed by real, live human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 The appraisers, not surprisingly, want mortgage companies to keep relying on 
them for property valuations needed for the millions of home loans made every 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders, by contrast, say they can increasingly come up with "alternative" 
valuations quicker and far cheaper by accessing on-line tax assessments, 
multiple listing services, and proprietary resale and appraisal data. 
</P>
<P>
 So who's right? More to the point, should you even care who's right? After 
all, appraisals exist to serve the lender's need for solid collateral to back 
the mortgage. Why should you care how the lender comes up with the magic 
number? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you should. For starters, you shell out the money for the appraisal. The 
bill often comes to $300, $400 or more. Second, the appraisal not only governs 
the size loan you can get, but could well determine the selling price of the 
house itself. Big bucks are involved here. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate target of the appraisers' wrath is a little-publicized but 
potentially far-reaching organization called the National Property Data Service 
Work Group (NPDS). The executive committee of NPDS reads like a Who's Who of 
American mortgage finance with representatives of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, 
Countrywide Funding, GE Capital Mortgage Insurance, Norwest Mortgage Corp., PMI 
Mortgage Insurance Co. and Household Mortgage Services. Another 21 large firms 
are listed as members of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the organization, according to its own description, is to form 
a nonprofit, cooperative "single source" of electronic appraisal, real estate 
and public records data covering all 50 states. For annual subscription fees, 
lenders and other participants will be able to tap into a vast data pool of 
prior appraisals conducted for member lenders, home resale prices, local tax 
data and other information relevant to making decisions on valuing properties. 
NPDS is still at the formative stage, having sent out its first letters to 
potential database suppliers in late July. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to the service, say its proponents, will be that most or all of its 
data will be available on a real-time basis: With the proper software and 
codes, participants will have virtually instantaneous access to it through a 
personal computer. Rather than waiting for days -- or even weeks -- to get 
appraisal results, lenders should be able to obtain at least rough valuation 
numbers in minutes on their laptops. The decrease in time, paperwork and 
physical effort should save everybody money -- the consumer and the lender. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's wrong with that? Potentially plenty, says Douglas C. Brown, 
president of the Appraisal Institute, the industry's principal professional 
trade organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you start limiting the role of the professional who has the expertise to 
go out and value properties," Brown says, "then you're going to get into 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the all-electronic database envisioned by NPDS wouldn't pick up 
short-term environmental or market changes that might drastically reduce a 
property's value. Local newspaper readers -- and appraisers -- might know that 
underground contamination was discovered near a subdivision and threatened to 
pollute houses' water supplies, says Brown, but the computer-derived appraisals 
wouldn't tell a regional lender about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, argues Brown, a homeowner in a tract who had made extensive 
improvements far beyond the neighborhood norm -- worth tens of thousands of 
dollars -- might be denied a higher sales price "because the (NPDS) machine 
says, well, the typical house here is worth this amount, and therefore your 
house is worth the same" for mortgage lending purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and other appraisers concede that NPDS worries them in part because it 
could cut down sharply on the need for appraisers. "That's part of it," he 
says, "but the fact is that appraisers add real value to the (home financing) 
process. Consumers and lenders stand to lose that." 
</P>
<P>
 Hogwash, say NPDS members. "Appraisers have nothing to fear," says Lewis J. 
Allen of GE Capital Mortgage Insurance Co. "This is going to help them" because 
much of the information available on-line will be grounded on appraisals 
contributed by participating lending firms and government agencies. The 
efficiency and accuracy of everyone in the business -- appraisers included -- 
should be improved by pooling huge quantities of currently scattered property 
appraisal data for quick retrieval and analysis, according to Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is," said a prominent mortgage executive who asked not to be 
identified, "that (traditional) appraisals now cost too much and often don't 
tell us a whole lot that we didn't already know. Making buyers pay $400 for 
someone just to validate the purchase price is a waste, given the data we 
already can access electronically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Appraisers," he said, "are going to have to join the move to high-tech, or 
get run over by it." Stay tuned.

RENT WATCH: WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET NOTICE TO PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I had so many bills to pay this month that I could not come up with 
my entire rent on time. The landlord gave me a three-day notice "to pay or move 
out." Immediately, I left a message on his answering machine, explaining the 
situation and that I would pay the rent within 10 days. But just a few days 
later, someone brought me court papers saying that the landlord is suing me for 
rent, and that he wants me to move out. Can he do this? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: As a tenant, you are legally obligated to pay your rent on time. Any 
time rent is late, a landlord may serve a three-day notice for the tenant to 
pay rent or to move out of the unit, unless some other arrangements are worked 
out between the tenant and the landlord. Since you could not pay, and did not 
want to move out, you should have met with the landlord in person to try to 
make arrangements for payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, landlords are willing to work with tenants, especially if the tenant 
had a good payment record in the past. Had the landlord agreed, the plan should 
have been put in writing, with the landlord specifically agreeing not to take 
any legal action based on the three-day notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Your message on the answering machine was not sufficient; not only can a 
message be erased, forgotten or misunderstood, but even oral agreements are 
easily disputed. Because legal action was started, you need to contact an 
attorney for advice immediately; you have five days from the day you were 
served to file your answer in court. If you cannot afford to pay for an 
attorney, check with Legal Aid to see if you qualify for their free services. 
Your local bar association may also help. You may still be able to settle 
without a trial, although your landlord will probably expect you to pay for all 
or part of the legal costs. He may be willing to accept a payment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 If you lose in court, not only will you owe the legal costs, but there will 
also be a judgment recorded against you. Judgments usually remain on all credit 
reports for seven years if they are paid, and for 10 years if they are not 
paid. Having a judgment on your credit report makes it more difficult to obtain 
loans, credit cards or rental housing. How to Best Handle Emergency Repairs 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The water heater in my duplex burst. I called several plumbers and got 
estimates to replace the heater. When I told my landlord, he said to go ahead 
and have the plumber do the work, and that he would reimburse me. When the 
plumber with the lowest estimate arrived, she said that because the water 
heater is located in the garage, it had to be raised 18 inches to meet current 
building codes, and the pipe fittings also had to be replaced. Her price went 
up by another $100. 
</P>
<P>
 I was unable to reach my landlord for approval of the higher price, but 
because we needed the heater, I authorized the work. The landlord wasn't very 
happy about the outcome, but finally did reimburse me for the bill. Can you 
suggest a better way I could have handled the situation? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Under the circumstances, you handled the situation reasonably well. For the 
future, your landlord should provide you with a 24-hour emergency phone number, 
or the name of an agent that can authorize repairs in the landlord's absence. 
Because the additional expense was required to bring the installation up to 
code, it was appropriate for your landlord to pay the higher bill. If you have 
not already done so, include a copy of the repair receipt with your next rent 
payment to the landlord. Is Rent Due Ahead When Moving Out? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I paid my rent on the first of this month, and gave my landlord notice that 
I plan to move out of my apartment on the tenth of next month. Now, my landlord 
demands that I pay him the rent for the 10 days of next month immediately. My 
rental agreement states that rent is due on the first of each month. He said 
that my notice to move out would not be valid unless I paid all the rent in 
advance. Is my landlord right? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. Rent is due when specified in the rental agreement, and it covers one 
month at a time. The notice you gave your landlord informs him of your 
intention to move out. Your notice allows the landlord to advertise the unit 
and to try to find a new tenant as soon as possible. While you are still 
required to pay rent on time, your rental payment has nothing to do with the 
validity of your notice to terminate your tenancy. You will owe only 10 days of 
rent for next month, which you should pay on the first of that month.

HOME AFFORDABILITY IMPROVES DESPITE MORTGAGE RATE RISE 
</P>

<P>
 Housing affordability in California has improved slightly compared to three 
years ago, despite the recent increases in mortgage interest rates, TRW REDI 
Property Data reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The average mortgage payment in California consumed 43.9% of the average 
annual income in the state in the first half of 1994, according to TRW REDI 
Property Data. This compares to 46.5% in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Affordability has improved because income levels have risen in California over 
the last three years, albeit only marginally, and mortgage rates are still low 
compared to historical standards, TRW said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the average size of a loan for a home purchase has remained almost 
unchanged in California since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The TRW study's ranking of affordability by counties shows that the San 
Francisco Bay Area is the least affordable region of the state, with more than 
54% of the average income going toward mortgage payments. But this is a 
significant improvement over the 63% recorded 3 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The most affordable housing markets in the state are among the northern 
counties where mortgage payments represent less than one third of average local 
income levels. California Affordability Index 05,10,09,10,12,10 Year Average

HANDYMAN Q & A: FIND STUDS TO SECURE A BATHTUB GRAB BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By POPULAR MECHANICS, FOR AP SPECIAL FEATURES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I had a company out to install a bathtub grab bar, but they could 
not successfully locate the studs. They recommend some other methods of 
installing a grab bar instead of attaching it to studs. What method do you 
recommend? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: The only method that I recommend for securing a grab bar is to fasten 
it to the studs. A person can exert considerable force on a grab bar, and if 
the bar is not adequately fastened, it will probably pull right out of the 
wall, rather than being loosened. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people mistake the washcloth rail on a ceramic soap dish as a grab bar. 
It is not designed for this. In our opinion, the only grab bar suitable for a 
bathtub is one made of stainless steel and secured to the studs. There are 
instruments that can be used to locate studs. How to Repair Older Garage Door 
Opener 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My daughter has a 10-year-old garage door opener that needs repair, but the 
repairman says the manufacturer told him replacement parts are no longer 
available. Can you help? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Even if the parts were available, the repairman might not want to install 
them, because the door does not meet current safety standards. The garage door 
opener does not comply with recent guidelines established by Underwriters 
Laboratory (UL Standard 235). This is important because between 1982 and 1988, 
48 children between the ages of 2 and 14 died from being trapped under garage 
doors operated by automatic openers. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law mandated that as of Jan. 1, 1993, all new residential garage doors 
must comply with UL 235. This requires that garage door opener assemblies 
include a photo electric sensor or other device that will reverse the door if 
it comes in contact with someone or something as it is closing. It also 
requires apparatus to automatically disable the opener should the sensor 
malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no federal restrictions on repairing older residential garage door 
openers, but several states require these older devices be brought into 
compliance with UL 235 at the time repairs are made to them. What's Best 
Cleaner for Aluminum Siding? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We have been unable to find anything that will clean the accumulation of 
dirt and other particles on our aluminum siding. It seems the siding is clean 
from about 4 to 5 feet down from the eaves. Above that, the siding seems to 
have a rough or granular surface which will not wash off with a sponge and 
laundry detergent. What is the best way to handle this problem? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Stubborn soils start at the bottom and work up. This keeps hard-to-remove 
dirty streaks from running down the wall below the dirty under-eave area. After 
cleaning and washing, it's important that the siding be thoroughly flushed with 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 Special siding cleaners, available at your local hardware store can help. 
Mildew, which appears as black spots, usually shows up in areas isolated from 
rainfall. Try using a solution of one quart Clorox, one-third cup of 
non-abrasive detergent and two-thirds cup of trisodium phosphate. Rinse the 
area with your garden hose after washing it.

PROGRAM HELPS BRIGHTEN BLIGHTED ANAHEIM AREAS; IMPROVEMENT: CITY-SPONSORED 
EFFORT CLEANS OUT CRIME, CLEANS UP TARGETED COMMUNITIES WITH ASSISTANCE OF 
RESIDENTS, POLICE AND OTHERS.

 When Yvonne Fernandez moved from the Guinida Lane neighborhood two years ago, 
she thought she was gone for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug dealing was so rampant in the three-block area that Fernandez, 32, was 
afraid to walk outside and feared for her three children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was bad," Fernandez said. "It was really bad. You couldn't walk in the 
street without being offered drugs or asked for money." 
</P>
<P>
 When Fernandez returned for a visit three months ago, she was amazed by the 
transformation. Gone were the drug dealers, transient crack cocaine users, 
panhandlers, and much of the graffiti. Ultimately, she moved back. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is one of five in the city that is currently going through the 
"Neighborhood Improvement Process," a city program aimed at rejuvenating 
battered communities through code enforcement, drug sweeps and neighborhood 
cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, begun in 1989 in the city's Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood, attempts 
to bring together residents, landlords, school employees, businesses and 
churches that have a stake in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, city officials say, is to improve the quality of life for residents 
who had come to accept the crime and blight that surrounded them. In all, 24 
neighborhoods in Anaheim have been targeted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first step in the Guinida Lane area was a series of undercover drug sweeps 
conducted over six months. More than 100 buyers and sellers were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "A crack cocaine epidemic had taken over the area and we attacked it," Officer 
Richard Trujillo said. "At the same time, we put up lights, brightening up the 
street and making it less attractive for the bad element. So, when these drug 
pushers get out of jail, they say, 'Wait a minute, this isn't the same area.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the first six months of 1993, there were 1,022 calls from the area to 
police. In the first six months of this year, there were 381. The number of 
robberies, burglaries, assaults, car thefts and other crimes were down 
significantly, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of this can be attributed, residents say, to the presence of Trujillo, 
who has been assigned exclusively to the neighborhood since last October. He is 
part of the Police Department's community-oriented policing team, a personal 
approach that is part of the Neighborhood Improvement Process. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of some of the 49 apartment buildings have been encouraged by the drop 
in crime and are taking a more active role in improving and maintaining their 
properties.  
</P>
<P>
 Landlord Jerry Taylor, 62, who bought a four-unit building 20 years ago, said 
he tried to maintain his property but had felt he was fighting a losing battle 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt hopeless," Taylor said as he trimmed branches from a tree on his 
property. "I'd come here every week, paint out graffiti and pick up trash and 
replace broken windows. I'd come back a week later, and it would be the same 
thing all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 But Taylor said things have improved dramatically in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "A year ago, there was drug dealing out in the open and shooting, and nobody 
seemed to care," he said. "But the city and the police really got in here and 
cleaned it up, and everyone is working real hard to make this turnaround." 
</P>
<P>
 The program is funded by the city, with county, state or federal grants, and 
through partnerships with apartment owners, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city really needs to be proactive in these neighborhoods, because the 
alternative is that things get worse," said Steven E. Swaim, the city's 
community services superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Patsy Tafolla said she had been trying to unite parents to clean up 
the area for years, with little success. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as the city manager's office and the police stepped in, things 
started moving really fast and in a much more efficient way," Tafolla said. 
</P>
<P>
 The elementary school, where parents hold monthly meetings about the 
neighborhood, also served as headquarters two weeks ago when the city organized 
a neighborhood cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of tenants and their children, apartment managers and landlords 
canvassed the area along with city officials, carrying trash bags, 
paintbrushes, rakes and brooms. They spent the day weeding, picking up trash 
and painting over graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing this not only brings us together but it also makes us feel safer," 
Tafolla said during the cleanup.  
</P>
<P>
 Elfriede Striet, who has managed an apartment building for 23 years, said when 
she "came here, this neighborhood was like Anaheim Hills. Now, it's Skid Row." 
</P>
<P>
 But she is encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were prisoners who couldn't walk out our front door without being 
harassed," Striet said. "We complained so much and we just kept complaining, 
and they have taken some action and cleaned it up a lot. It really gives you 
faith in the system." Steps to Safe Streets 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim's program for transforming crime-infested enclaves into safe 
neighborhoods combines efforts of police, social services, property owners and 
tenants. Here are the steps: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Analyze neighborhood demographics and crime statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Organize meetings among police, residents and owners; formulate improvement 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Involve local businesses and social groups to finance and organize the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Implement neighborhood improvement plan; increase police patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Evaluate goals to ensure plan is maintained through life of neighborhood.

LEARNING ABOUT COLLEGE; ADVISER GROUPS EASE TRANSITION TO HIGHER EDUCATION FOR 
FAMILY 'FIRSTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Victor Baez never gave college a thought until his senior year at Westminster 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when a teacher asked students in his class how many of them were 
planning to attend a university -- and Baez was one of the few who didn't raise 
his hand.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody in my family went to college," said Baez, 21, whose mother and father 
emigrated from Michoacan, Mexico. "My parents didn't go to what's considered 
high school in Mexico, but my mom noticed here that school is very, very 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Baez is in his third year at Orange Coast College, studying to be a doctor 
and planning to transfer to a major university. He and hundreds of other 
students around Orange County are the first members of their families to seek 
college diplomas, becoming pioneers for younger family members to follow on the 
higher-education trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, a survey shows the number of freshmen whose parents never went to 
college is decreasing; but as Southern California becomes more ethnically 
diverse, local university officials say their numbers are growing here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our estimate in spring 1989 was that 24% of our students were 
first-generation attendees at college," Cal State Fullerton spokeswoman Paula 
Selleck said. Since then, "we believe the number has grown." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 11% of freshmen at University of California schools in 1993 had 
fathers who did not finish high school, according to UC statistics. More than 
13% of them had mothers who did not finish high school. 
</P>
<P>
 These students have drawn the attention of educators, who say the students 
often have different needs. To track them, officials in the California State 
University system will begin asking about students' family educational 
background on college applications for fall, 1995. The UC system began asking 
for similar information several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Adviser groups for needy minority students -- many of whom are the first in 
their families to attend colleges and universities -- have been forming for the 
past three years at campuses such as Orange Coast College and Irvine Valley 
College. Groups such as Orange Coast's Transfer Opportunity Program and Irvine 
Valley's Making Transfer Easy become forums for students to share their common 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who are the first to go to college "don't have the family support of 
siblings who have gone there," said John Licitra, counselor and founder of 
Making Transfer Easy. "We're like a family providing a role model." 
</P>
<P>
 National programs such as Upward Bound have tried to attract these students to 
colleges since the 1960s. But students say it's usually their own drive -- not 
the urging of a program -- that makes them take a chance and go to college. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case of UC Irvine senior Ralph Meza.  
</P>
<P>
 Meza, of Santa Ana, said he went to work full time processing loan papers at a 
mortgage lender after graduating from Saddleback High School.

 "I was there maybe 2 1/2 years, and I knew I had to do something else," said 
Meza, 26. He took a few classes at Orange Coast College, while picking up a 
second job at a music store to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Going to college full time started to make sense to Meza, but it wasn't easy 
to persuade his cash-strapped parents. "Mom flat-out told me I was being 
selfish," Meza said. "I never really took it to heart, even though we had huge 
arguments about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he's looking at getting a master's degree in counseling, Meza said, 
his parents are more understanding about his goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents were always in debt, and they see a son or daughter as someone to 
contribute," Meza said. "It's not that they didn't want something better for me 
-- they do -- but they can't see the benefits (of college) because they never 
had it for themselves." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 His parents, both Orange County-born former fieldworkers, helped him by 
providing a room when he started classes as a UCI psychology and 
social-behavior major. They also did not push him, and he credits his mother 
for giving him "mental toughness." 
</P>
<P>
 Students' access to education depends on whether their families can pay for 
college, or if they grew up in families where college was stressed -- not just 
whether they're Latino, white, black or of another ethnicity, said Meza. "It 
depends on individuals. My parents just couldn't afford it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a 1993 University of California survey, about 20% of Mexican 
American applicants to UC schools had fathers who had gone to college. More 
than 54% of Asian American applicants had fathers who had attended college, and 
nearly 74% of white students' fathers had college experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey shows that income is a factor. The median income levels of the 
parents of Mexican American UC freshman applicants was $29,000 a year; the 
median income of Asian American applicants' parents was $38,000, and that of 
white applicants' parents was $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 National statistics also indicate that students' enrollment in college is 
related to their parents' income, although scholarships are available to many 
low-income students. About 26% of U.S. college freshmen in 1993 had parents who 
make between $20,000 and $39,999 a year, according to a national survey. But 
only 17% of enrolled students have parents who make $19,999 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Money was tight for Craig Harris, 27, when he got out of Santa Ana High 
School, but he knew he wanted to go to college anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw my brother graduate, and he didn't know what he wanted to do, so he 
just went off to work and became a manager at a Taco Bell," Harris said. "He 
was working really hard, and I said, 'I don't want to do that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Harris went into the Air Force and became a weapons technician on F-16 
aircraft to get college money and started at Irvine Valley after he completed 
his stint. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students could go to their parents or instructors for help, Harris said. 
Since he couldn't, he took study-skills classes and did a lot of reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your parents don't know how to help you study," said Harris, whose mother and 
father are divorced. "They just tell you to study hard and study long." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is considering Pitzer and Pomona colleges in Claremont to study social 
psychology ("My mom thinks it's like the greatest thing in the world," he said) 
and he would like to counsel high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to tell them that college isn't necessarily an ivory tower that's 
really difficult," Harris said. "In high school they make it sound like you 
have to be a god to survive, but you don't." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Cal State Long Beach family counseling student April Harrell, 22, said some 
students with no family college background are deterred from college by myths 
as well as their parents' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrell, a student assistant with Orange Coast's Transfer Opportunity Program, 
frequently talks to confused students about financial aid. Many students do not 
know about loans and grants that could help them succeed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents play a role , Harrell said: "One girl here had parents who discouraged 
her and wouldn't pay for her to come -- they wanted her to be at home and get 
married." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of Harrell's parents had more than a high school education, but she 
said she grew up knowing she would go to college. Her pastor urged her to go, 
she said, and her parents told her: "Don't do what we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Baez said he was afraid of starting college without the advice of 
parents or siblings. But he found help from counselors at his high school, 
Orange Coast College and a doctor at a local hospital where he used to work as 
a clerk -- who became his mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 Baez lives at his parents' home, pays them rent with money he makes from a 
side job at State Farm Insurance and helps out around the house. But sometimes, 
he said, mom and dad don't realize he needs time to study. He has a younger 
brother and sister, and his parents often ask him to baby-sit when he needs to 
study for physics tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, he's come a long way. It wasn't too long ago that Baez was just 
another high school kid who didn't know he had to take the Scholastic Aptitude 
Test to get into a major university. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I know, so I tell my cousin to take the SAT and look into a prestigious 
school," Baez said. "I'm encouraging her to get good grades and hang around the 
right people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really enjoy helping her, because I didn't have somebody like that." 
College Now More a Family Trait 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, the percentage of entering college freshmen whose parents have a 
high school education or less has declined sharply during the last decade. 
Orange County colleges say they are seeing more first-generation students as 
the county becomes more ethnically diverse. Percentage of freshmen nationwide

BARGAIN HUNTERS HIT CITY'S STREETS; COMMERCE: MERCHANTS DO BRISK BUSINESS ON 
THE FIRST WEEKEND OF SANCTIONED GARAGE SALES IN SANTA ANA. THE NEXT OF SUCH 
EVENTS WON'T BE UNTIL DECEMBER. 
</P>

<P>
 You could almost hear the money changing hands at the corner of Shelton Street 
and McFadden Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 An old exercise machine goes for $40. Cha-ching! 
</P>
<P>
 A battered kitchen stove goes for $15. A new mother carts off a baby's 
changing table for $10. And 2-year-old Jorge Rodriguez walks away with a 
sparkle in his eye and a slightly battered red fire engine, well worth the 
$1.50 his mother laid out. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first weekend of city-sanctioned garage sales, Santa Ana residents on 
many streets and boulevards were hawking and hunting bargains on items ranging 
from toilet plungers to prom shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 While business was indeed brisk, the new city garage sale ordinance, which 
restricts sales to four weekends a year, wasn't popular with household 
merchants who complained that government had once again found a way to put its 
collective nose where it didn't belong. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just so damned inconvenient," said one man who identified himself only 
as Tran. "If I decide I want to clean out my garage, I should be able to sell 
the junk whenever I want. It's silly." 
</P>
<P>
 Said another driveway merchant about the elected officials: "They ought to 
shoot all them. According to their law, if grandma dies tomorrow, I can't sell 
her stuff on Monday. It's unconstitutional." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign to restrict the sales grew out of other residents' complaints 
that the yard sales had become unsightly junkfests that were actually small 
businesses operating regularly out of driveways, lawns and parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the City Council in May approved the ordinance restricting sales 
to the first weekend of the month in March, June, September and December. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really an issue of aesthetics," said Joe Vielma, a Riverview West 
Neighborhood Assn. member who supported the new code. "People were leaving a 
lot of trash and junk after the sales and the area was looking very cluttered. 
Since the city began enforcing the law, things have improved." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Police Sgt. Ken Ice said Saturday that before the passage of the 
ordinance people complained that sales were taking place virtually every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were upset because there were clothes piled on front lawns," Ice said. 
"There was a lot of noise and congestion on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday there was heavy traffic on sidewalks and streets, but Ice said there 
had been no disturbances or complaints to police. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the larger crowds gathered on Juan Escobedo's front lawn at Shelton 
Street and McFadden Avenue, where multicolored signs were tacked to telephone 
polls and street signs directed customers to garage sales throughout the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Escobedo family's white fence, blouses and slacks of all sizes hung 
neatly, catching an occasional early-morning breeze. Children's clothing was 
displayed on the grass, as were toys and a variety of household tools and 
knickknacks, including a book titled "Who's Who of Beverly Hills 90210." 
</P>
<P>
 "The ordinance doesn't really hurt us," Escobedo said. "We do it just because 
we have a lot of junk we want to get rid of." 
</P>
<P>
 But with the new law, he said, "what's happened is that everybody ends up 
having theirs the same day. I don't think there is anybody at the mall today." 
</P>
<P>
 Escobedo said he opened his front gate for business at 7 a.m. Two hours later 
there was a steady stream of customers picking through clothes, all priced to 
sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can buy a blouse here for 50 cents, but at the store it's going to be 
several dollars," said Maria Rodriguez, who gave her son the fire engine. "He 
really loves the toy." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, Maria Lopez was displaying her clothing on tree branches 
and in stacks piled along the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city was concerned that some people were trying to sell things 
for high prices," Lopez said. "We don't do that. People who come here probably 
don't have enough money to go to the stores. Most people are looking for 
clothes for work or for the children. I think these sales really help the poor 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a black money belt, Lopez's helper, 11-year-old Adrianna Barrera, said 
she had planned to cut the price on her collection of three Barbie dolls so 
that one little customer could afford a new toy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kids really don't have the money," Adrianna said. "I'm trying to make 
some money so that I can buy my brother some new tennis shoes for his 
birthday." 
</P>
<P>
 And there is money to be made too. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran, whose sale items included framed posters of professional basketball and 
football teams for $10, work boots for $7, surfboards for $10 and the popular 
Power Ranger figures, priced at $5 each, said he had done pretty well by late 
Saturday morning, even though his sale was competing with neighbors on both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a shopping center out here. Everybody's doing it."

ATTACK ON 2 TOURISTS IS PROBED AS A HATE CRIME; INQUIRY: ONE OF THE VISITORS TO 
LAGUNA WAS BEATEN, THE SECOND MAN ROBBED BY THREE ARMED ASSAILANTS. NO ONE HAS 
BEEN ARRESTED. 
</P>

<P>
 Police are investigating an attack on two tourists as a hate crime, based on 
an anti-gay slur by one of three armed robbers who fired two shots before 
taking $700 from one of the men and beating the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Brown, 31, and Steven Marsocci, 32, of Salt Lake City, were accosted on a 
stretch of beach off St. Ann's Drive about 3 a.m. Friday by three attackers. It 
is unclear whether the attackers, who remained at large Saturday, were firing 
into the air or at the victims, police said. No one was hit by the gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 After firing the shots on a dark stretch of beach, the robbers ordered the men 
to lie down in the sand and demanded money, according to a police report. The 
victims did as ordered and handed over their wallets, containing about $700, 
before one attacker asked: "Are you fags?" The men told police they did not 
respond, but one attacker went on to kick Marsocci in the mouth before fleeing 
with Brown's money. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack occurred as the victims were returning to their room at the Capri 
Laguna hotel after buying cigarettes, Laguna Beach Police Sgt. Doris Weaver 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The beach is not near an area of gay bars that has been the site of past hate 
crimes, including the January, 1993, beating of a 55-year-old man who was 
nearly killed when his skull was impaled on a rock on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made in Friday's attack, but police have done a composite 
drawing of one suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims told police that the assailants, one of whom wore a black bandanna 
over his lower face, appeared to have a rifle and handguns. Police did not find 
any expended bullet shells on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims -- who declined medical treatment from authorities -- returned 
home Friday to Salt Lake City, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack, which the men told police lasted about two minutes, was being 
investigated as a hate crime because of the slur by one assailant, Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
 While police said stepped-up beach patrols have resulted in a relatively 
crime-free summer, Weaver urged caution among late-night beach-goers in the 
wake of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 According to recent statistics from the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission, gays and lesbians were the most-targeted victims of hate crimes 
last year in Orange County. In 1993, there were 33 reported incidents against 
gays and lesbians in the county, the commission found. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most widely publicized incidents involved the Laguna Beach attack 
in which the 55-year-old man was beaten so badly that his face was virtually 
unrecognizable. 
</P>
<P>
 Two young men who authorities said were looking for gays to fight pleaded 
guilty to charges arising from that attack. One received a 10-year prison 
sentence and the other received one year in jail and five years of probation. 
</P>
<P>
 In another incident two months later, a man shouted anti-gay remarks and 
hurled a Molotov cocktail against the outer wall of a Newport Beach bar as he 
drove by, causing minor damage. The man, who police say had a lengthy 
psychiatric history, was committed to an institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusty Kennedy, the commission's executive director, said Saturday he knows of 
no other violent hate crime against gays in Laguna Beach this summer, but that 
hate-related activity against gays and other groups throughout the county 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no corner of our county that is immune from hate-related activity," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach City Councilman Robert F. Gentry said the January, 1993, incident 
showed that "Laguna Beach can be a target for people with hate in their heart. 
It's very, very frightening. . . . People know where to go to look for gay 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing about Friday's incident, Gentry said he feels certain it was not 
simply a robbery but a targeted hate crime. "If you're gay, you know when 
something like this occurs if they liked your jewelry or they hated who you 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 Gentry said the city can't prevent hate crimes from occurring, but it can 
report and prosecute them and track when and where they happen for police 
patrol purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 And, perhaps most importantly, Gentry said, the city needs to educate gays and 
lesbians, especially tourists, on being careful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oftentimes I think gay and lesbian tourists might come to Laguna and let 
their guard down a little bit," Gentry said. "These guys probably had no idea 
that walking on that stretch of beach at that time of night is dangerous."

INTERNATIONAL FARE ADDS FLAVOR TO ORANGE FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Three hours after his grandparents brought him to the Orange International 
Street Fair on Saturday, 10-year-old Ben Thomas was toting a five-foot balloon 
and rubbing his stomach with a big smile, recounting his culinary conquests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bratwurst, Indian fried bread, teriyaki, Danish doughnuts." Even as he spoke, 
Ben was nibbling on steak tacos. 
</P>
<P>
 "He eats everything," said Ben's grandfather, Bob Smith, who came from 
Riverside with his wife and the youngster to attend the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't their first trip. "In the last 10 years, we missed maybe two," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the wide variety of dishes was unquestionably the main attraction, the 
22nd annual fair also featured nine outdoor stages and more than 73 crafts 
booths in downtown Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Entitled "A Family Affair," the event, which began Friday night, is expected 
to draw as many as 500,000 people and raise between $1.5 million and $3 million 
for nonprofit service groups before it ends at 10 this evening. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Solee, president of this year's event, said it is the main fund-raiser 
for many organizations, which use the proceeds for purposes ranging from 
equipping school baseball teams to operating shelters for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who browsed along the rows of food booths Saturday still remembered the 
aromas of cooking in the foreign land where they were born. Others came with a 
craving for delicacies passed down through the generations here. 
</P>
<P>
 On "Greek Street," Tom Peters was raising funds for St. John the Baptist Greek 
Orthodox Church in Anaheim by selling "loukoumathes," a light pastry ball 
drenched in a mixture of lemon and honey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously my parents changed their name when they came here," said Peters, 
whose Greek ancestors bore the name Dimitrakapoulous. "Just try to fit that on 
an American Express card," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a Greek community in Orange County, but it usually goes unnoticed, 
Peters said. "We keep a low profile, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
 Same goes for the Danes, said P.K. Egense, 74. He arrived in Southern 
California 38 years ago from Odense, Denmark, the town where writer Hans 
Christian Andersen was born, he noted proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 Egense recalled how difficult it was for his family to obtain an immigration 
visa. "It took 18 months," he said, "while our background was investigated." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Egense was in charge of the food booth run by the Viking Club of 
Orange County. Its Danish pastries, with powdered sugar and raspberry jelly, 
were so popular that the club ran out of dough Friday night and had turned 
customers away while waiting to be resupplied the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was a day for people to be adventurous, to try something new. "What is 
spumoni?" asked a man at the Sons of Italy ice-cream booth. He soon enjoyed his 
first taste of the fruity treat. "Really, Italians were the first who created 
ice cream," said Gary Winkler, who was doling out the treats. 
</P>
<P>
 Tippi Uprmai of Irvine, a restaurateur who created a Thai food booth for 
boosters of the Tustin High School baseball team, acknowledged that because 
Thai food is generally too spicy for American tastes, "we mixed in Japanese 
tempura and Chinese egg rolls." 
</P>
<P>
 Uprmai said it took a month to prepare all the food for the booth. 
</P>
<P>
 By early afternoon, Bob Spidell, 60, wearing a straw hat to protect himself 
from the hot sun, was on his second helping of bratwurst. His son, 29, 
suggested their zest for the dish reflected their German heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spidell was dubious. Pointing to the paunch under his plaid shirt, he 
confessed, "Actually I like all kinds of food, as you can tell."

BILL BOYARSKY: RESPONSE TO COURT DEFEAT SHOWS MTA'S HYPOCRISY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There doesn't seem to be any limit to the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority's hypocrisy and backwardness. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, that's how I felt after reading about the MTA's response to its 
embarrassing defeat in federal court Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 It couldn't have ended much worse for the agency. Federal Judge Terry J. 
Hatter Jr. temporarily blocked a 25-cent bus fare increase and the abolition of 
passes. He ordered a hearing Sept. 12 on whether the higher fares would 
discriminate against the poor, a substantial number of whom are African 
Americans, Latinos and Asian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 After this setback, I was astounded at the statement made by one of the MTA 
board's most powerful members, Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre. He 
said he was "ecstatic" about the court decision. "I didn't believe we had to 
impose a fare increase and do away with passes because of the disproportionate 
impact it had on transit-dependent people in the inner city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What was odd is that it was Alatorre who muscled through a $123-million 
appropriation earlier in the year for his pet project, a proposed Blue Line 
rail extension from Downtown Los Angeles through his district to Pasadena. Of 
this, $50 million came from discretionary funds. The bus rider groups fighting 
the fare increase contended in court that this money could have been put into 
the bus system, eliminating the need for higher fares. 
</P>
<P>
 What's especially maddening is that nobody has any idea where the rest of the 
$841 million for the Blue Line extension will come from in this era of 
impoverished federal, state and local government treasuries. That's why the 
MTA's chief executive officer, Franklin E. White, had opposed Alatorre's 
original plan to expand the Blue Line. But White was no match for the MTA 
board's pork barrel politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA's bureaucratic backwardness compounded the problem. The agency's 
attorney, Richard Katzman, insisted that the MTA couldn't shift money from rail 
to bus -- an issue that will be debated in the upcoming federal court hearing. 
And he said the agency had done everything possible to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By chance, just after I'd read Katzman's comments, the mail brought me an 
article by Geoffrey S. Yarema, an attorney with the Los Angeles firm of 
Nossaman, Guthner, Knox & Elliott. Yarema is an expert in government finance 
who has been vainly trying to interest the MTA in a plan that could earn the 
agency up to $40 million a year, enough to eliminate the need for the fare 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of Yarema's plan is the new elevated portion of the Harbor 
Freeway running 13 miles south from around the USC area. 
</P>
<P>
 The elevated roadway is for high-occupancy vehicles, anything from car pools 
to buses. The idea is for them to speed along, above the usual Harbor Freeway 
traffic jams. Those wedded to the traditional Southern California 
transportation mode of one person, one car, would be banished to the slow 
ground-level lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yarema proposed allowing single-occupant vehicles on the new road too -- but 
charging a toll. This would permit a person in a hurry to speed along above the 
Harbor Freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Yarema suggested a rush-hour toll of at least $1.50, with the proceeds used by 
the MTA for improving bus service and keeping fares down. 
</P>
<P>
 When I talked to him Friday, he said his idea was not revolutionary, 
</P>
<P>
 He has helped put together a number of similar toll road projects around the 
country, most notably Orange County's San Joaquin Hills, Eastern and Foothill 
toll roads. 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal approval would be needed, but there would be no construction 
cost to speak of, he said, because "the four-lane facility under construction 
is fully funded and would not require significant changes to be adopted for 
use" as a toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the first time the MTA has heard this idea. It's called "congestion 
pricing," and it is a concept gaining favor among transportation experts 
ranging from the conservative to the liberal. In the simplest terms, it means 
that one person driving in one car would pay the costs of road wear and tear, 
air pollution and highway congestion.  
</P>
<P>
 It's one of several practical ideas floating around that haven't stirred much 
interest at the MTA. Vans, operating like the Super Shuttle, to bring commuters 
from their homes to main line transit routes is one. Another involves small 
transit vehicles operating in neighborhoods -- jitneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Such concepts could bring in more revenue and improve transportation in both 
poor and more affluent neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we have gridlock, not only on the streets but in the minds of the 
politicians and bureaucrats who run the MTA.

LEARNING THE HARD WAY; FLEDGLING INSTRUCTORS TRY TO EASE STAFFING SHORTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are artists without studios, scientists without labs or housewives eager 
for a career. 
</P>
<P>
 But because they speak Spanish, know math or are willing to work with disabled 
children, they have found jobs this fall in the hardest to fill teaching posts 
in the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, about 2,000 of these neophyte instructors, all without full college 
teaching credentials, will take charge of public school classrooms packed with 
squirming youths. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 of the new hires gathered last week for a mandatory workshop in 
classroom survival skills. For many, the two-day crash course will be their 
primary source of teacher training. 
</P>
<P>
 At the close of the sessions, some were writing their first lesson plans in 
brand new books, and everyone was looking for any tidbit of information that 
could help them in their first solo classroom encounters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't eat too much for lunch," advised one veteran mentor teacher. "You can't 
be feeling lethargic, especially in the afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 Lourdes Enriquez, who has taught in a year-round kindergarten classroom in the 
inner city since July, said her first week was the worst.  
</P>
<P>
 "Discipline didn't exist. They were fighting, wanting to go to the bathroom, 
running around," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her method for reining in the little ones? 
</P>
<P>
 "I bribed them with cookies," she said, adding that she recently learned 
through her mentor teacher to identify and compliment good behavior rather than 
doling out treats as a way to teach discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the cram session went a long way toward easing their 
first-day-of-school fears, some educators are concerned that the increasing 
number of such "emergency credentialed teachers" does not bode well for the 
quality of public education. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame, isn't it?" said Jeannie Oakes, assistant dean at the UCLA 
Graduate School of Education and Information Services. "Even though you have 
good intentions and your heart is in the right place and you care about kids, 
it can be a very bruising experience to be on your own without any background, 
experience and support. . . . There are skills that are needed, especially when 
working with kids who have difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the teacher supply does not meet the high demand in several specialty 
areas -- bilingual education, math and science classes and special education -- 
district officials say they are backed into a corner and have no choice but to 
hire teacher wanna-bes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could hire every fully credentialed bilingual teacher coming out of 
college and still fall short," said Michael Acosta, administrator of employee 
operations. "It's the same for math and special education." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A fully credentialed teacher not only has earned a baccalaureate degree, but 
has received 30 post-graduate units from state-accredited college or university 
schools of education. Typically, this includes a semester learning about the 
latest teaching methods and the principles of human learning and another 
semester of closely supervised student teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, all that is needed under state education codes to obtain an 
emergency credential is a bachelor's degree, passage of a state basic skills 
exam and a tuberculosis test, and proof that the teacher is taking at least six 
units a year toward the full credential. 
</P>
<P>
 They are investigated to determine if they have criminal records, and teachers 
can be dismissed for felony and other convictions that include drug abuse, sex 
offenses, violent crimes and grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 At last week's training seminars -- organized by United Teachers-Los Angeles 
and the district -- many of the teachers-to-be said what they lacked in 
experience they make up for with an enthusiasm about their new vocation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love kids, I like helping people," said Alejandro Ornelas, fresh out of Cal 
State L.A. "Seeing the children change, seeing them learn, makes the job all 
worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the district does not keep detailed profiles of its pool of emergency 
credentialed teachers, officials say it is rare for one to be hired without 
classroom experience. Most, they say, have been teacher's aides or substitute 
teachers, part-time jobs that propelled them to seek out the profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't all just fresh off the pavement," said Wendy Oakford, 42, who has a 
Utah teaching credential and is returning to the profession now that most of 
her children are grown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because you have an emergency credential doesn't mean that you are not 
qualified to teach," said Kathryn DeSensi, 42. "And having a credential teacher 
doesn't necessarily mean you are a quality teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tough realities of teaching, however, tend to quickly wear down their 
ranks. Nearly half are likely to resign within five years, far higher than the 
rate of fully credentialed teachers, said Thomas Killen, district administrator 
in charge of personnel research. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, the numbers of emergency credentialed teachers in the 
district has almost doubled from 1,083 in the 1991 school year to 2,051 in 
1994, a trend that university education experts say reflects the fact that they 
cannot attract and churn out enough qualified teachers these days. 
</P>
<P>
 The high numbers in the emergency corps, said Carolyn Ellner, dean of the 
school of education at Cal State Northridge, "mean that many of the children of 
Los Angeles are being shortchanged. . . . We know that there is a direct 
correlation between good teaching skills and the ability of children to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly worrisome to UCLA's Oakes is that the most challenging of 
teaching posts are being filled with the least experienced instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that some children can be thrown away educationally by not having 
well-trained, well-qualified teachers, and we seem to tolerate it," she said.

LEARNING THE HARD WAY; EXODUS OF 2,100 TEACHERS HAS L.A. UNIFIED SEEKING 
ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Ask Lauren Hartford why she quit teaching in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District and she gives two answers. The first is the official one -- her 
commute was too long. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Second comes the unofficial version -- the district is too mired in annual 
labor strife and bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hartford tells the unofficial story, she is at turns regretful and 
passionate. Here she is, a bilingual teacher at San Fernando Elementary, a 
product of local schools, quitting in frustration after seven years to take a 
job in another district. 
</P>
<P>
 She says the Los Angeles district has cut money for supplies, increased class 
sizes and refuses to make the classroom the priority in budgetary and other 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like if I had stayed with this district, I would have just burned out 
on my profession," she said. "And I love teaching. But the way L.A. city 
schools are now, I wouldn't send my daughter there." 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford is one of more than 2,100 teachers -- 8% of the teaching force -- who 
quit or retired this year. More teachers left the system this year than in any 
of the past seven years, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the teachers resigned, a trend that the school district and teachers 
union say is disturbing. Of the 2,127 who left the district, 1,452 quit and 675 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Although district officials find the numbers worrisome, they said this year's 
exodus was expected. The earthquake and the sluggish economy forced many to 
move, and the teaching staff is getting older and closer to retirement age, 
officials said. Those factors, along with the 10% pay cuts instituted two years 
ago, all contributed to the departures, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Board of Education members said they had anticipated even more 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected a huge turnover this year," said board member Leticia Quezada. 
"But even 2,000 is a lot, and as long as we're in these economic conditions, it 
would take a miracle to turn this around." 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders say the teacher turnover does not bode well for reform efforts 
at local schools. "We have to keep starting all over again every year," said 
Helen Bernstein, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles. "Every year they're 
retraining and indoctrinating teachers. The district could provide adequate 
wages and some stability so people think they have some reason to stick 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 The turnover leaves the school district struggling to fill classroom 
vacancies. The district expects to have nearly 2,000 openings, despite 
projections showing that about 1,500 fewer students are expected to enroll this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of substitute teachers are expected to fill vacancies this fall. In 
the subjects that are hardest to staff -- such as English, special education, 
math, science and social studies -- officials said long-term substitutes could 
be assigned until permanent teachers are hired. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Irene Yamahara, who oversees the personnel division, says the 
district is recruiting teachers, particularly in the so-called shortage fields. 
But she said not enough teachers are leaving graduate schools to fill the 
vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers such as Hartford are hot commodities. Hartford is a fully 
credentialed bilingual teacher; the district needs 234 more teachers like her 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty much, teachers like that can go anywhere," Yamahara said. "They can 
write their own ticket." 
</P>
<P>
 But by far the greatest need for teachers is in special education classes, 
where the numbers of students are swelling. The district anticipates needing 
more than 300 special education teachers and probably will have substitutes 
fill most of those positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual labor disputes with the teachers union are hampering efforts to 
attract teachers to the system, union and district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitter and protracted contract talks culminated two years ago with teachers 
taking a 10% pay cut, narrowly averting a strike. This year, the union again 
threatened to strike if teachers' pay was not restored. 
</P>
<P>
 But under a new contract proposal, negotiated last weekend, the district is 
offering teachers an 8% restoration of the 10% cut. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has set a strike vote for Sept. 13-14, when teachers will decide to 
either accept the contract offer or walk out. Union leaders have recommended 
teachers accept the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last few weeks, district personnel offices received numerous calls 
from prospective applicants asking about the labor situation and whether they 
should sign contracts or even interview at school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 District spokesman Bill Rivera said he believes the latest salary offer could 
entice teachers to the district. If the offer is accepted, a teacher without 
any experience would make $29,131 this year, up from $26,573 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And a teacher with 25 years of experience could make $53,003, up from $48,349 
last year, according to district data. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why go somewhere else when you can make as much or more here?" Rivera said. 
"The salaries will be higher." 
</P>
<P>
 But the ongoing labor dispute led many teachers, from the newest to the more 
experienced, to leave the system this year. Pat Hillis, the librarian at 
Pacific Palisades High for 24 years, said she would have liked to retire later, 
but she believed that she could no longer work for a salary that had been cut 
to help subsidize the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "If working conditions had been better, I would have liked to have stayed," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillis and the 674 other teachers who retired this year were eligible for a 
onetime 10% bonus negotiated with the teachers union two years ago, designed to 
help restore the salary cut. But to the surprise of the union and the district, 
fewer teachers than expected took advantage of the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Many said that the money turned out to be negligible, and had little, if any, 
effect on their retirement pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Lauritzen, a math and computer science teacher at Canoga Park High, said 
he is considering retiring in the winter, when he still would be eligible for 
the retirement bonus. Nonetheless, Lauritzen said that although he wants to 
return to school in September, there are few incentives to keep him at the 
campus where he has taught for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not giving me any motivation to stay," Lauritzen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even teachers who feel they were treated well say the pay cut and the 
continuous labor strife have led to job dissatisfaction. "I think most teachers 
are just saying, 'Enough is enough,' " said Don Palmer, who retired recently 
from Madison Middle School in North Hollywood. "I enjoyed the school; we've had 
good administrations, and I always felt I could walk into their offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we've certainly had our problems, and I can't help feeling -- and many of 
the teachers feel this way -- that there's tremendous mismanagement in the 
district. It's just increasingly frustrating dealing with the district."

CONDO CAT FIGHT HAS SOME PURRING, OTHERS FLEEING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All was quiet Saturday at the Lakeside Condominiums in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 But then it's always quiet at this complex, where you enter through a guarded 
entry, only to be greeted by a posted inquiry: "HOW LOUD IS YOUR CAR RADIO?" 
</P>
<P>
 There are no barking dogs and no squawking birds (though quiet birds are 
allowed). And there were few openly disgruntled homeowners complaining about 
Friday's California Supreme Court ruling that had its small but incendiary 
beginnings in a battle between a Lakeside homeowner and the condominium 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court ruled Friday that homeowner associations such as Lakeside's 
could ban pets from owners' units. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that I dislike animals," says Aurora McNally, a Lakeside homeowner 
of only two months. "It's just the fleas." 
</P>
<P>
 But in her first-floor condo, Natore Nahrstedt, the devoted owner of three 
cats, is hardly quiet. It was her fight against a $25 citation from her condo 
association that escalated into the court case that ended up in the state 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed in their decision, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to 
campaign to have it overturned in the Legislature," says Nahrstedt, a 
47-year-old entertainment business manager. As she speaks, two of the offending 
felines, Boo-Boo and Tulip, hunker down near her. Dockers, too shy to appear, 
hides under her bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nahrstedt (who pronounces her first name "Nature") contends that not a soul 
would get fleas from her cats, who she says get regular baths and never venture 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a barrage of phone calls in support from people who are devastated 
by the ruling," says Nahrstedt. "People in the building, in Culver City, 
someone from Arizona. (My lawyer) got phone calls from the Animal Hospital 
Assn. -- they wanted to donate money and time and see if there's anything we 
can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Boo-Boo rolls over on her back, all four paws hovering in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Nahrstedt, who began fighting with the condo board nearly six years ago, does 
not share Boo-Boo's easygoing demeanor . 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been diagnosed with asthma, a heart condition, insomnia and extreme 
exhaustion," says Nahrstedt, who maintains that the real estate agent who sold 
her the condo told her the pet restriction was rarely enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 Nahrstedt contends that she has been harassed by condo board members and 
employees of the association and will soon leave the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd get rid of Lakeside before I'd get rid of the cats," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of Nahrstedt's neighbors support the no-pet policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I concur completely," says longtime resident Joe Winston. "This place was 
constructed with tissue-paper walls. We have a hard enough time adjusting to 
our neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 But they are loath to report a pet-owning neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must confess I know pet owners and I wouldn't snitch or turn them in," 
Winston says. 
</P>
<P>
 Another outlaw cat owner agrees. "I'll be out watering my plants and people 
will say, 'You have a beautiful cat,' " says the woman, who asked not to be 
named. "Most of the people who live here don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 Some sympathetic neighbors simply chafe at the litany of rules governing life 
in the Lakeside Condominiums, a complex of 14 low-slung buildings landscaped 
with lush shrubs, crew-cut hedges and even tiny babbling streams. It's a 
pastoral -- if controlled -- environment where every building has a captain (to 
pass out news of the condo association meetings) and no bikes or barbecue 
grills are allowed on balconies. (Though this rule is largely ignored.) 
</P>
<P>
 The local cable Channel 8 serves up chatty news and gentle admonishments: "We 
are getting better, but some of us are still speeding on Summertime Lane," 
reads one video flash across the silent screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like a lot of the board members have nothing to do but set 
restrictions," said Ninfa Abarquez, who disagrees with the no-pet rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, in a complex with 530 units, for every opinion there is bound to be 
a dissenting voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one of the buildings we had a flea infestation," says Frankee Lund, who 
like other neighbors, chalked up the problem to surreptitious cats. "Previously 
we had a very loose board and they didn't enforce the (rules). Now, they really 
impose the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Few understand Nahrstedt's zeal at fighting those rules. She has spent $50,000 
in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought she could have bought a place for that," mused one neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one thing Nahrstedt and her neighbors agree on. 
</P>
<P>
 "In retrospect, if I had to do it again," Nahrstedt says, "I'd buy a house and 
get out."

REPAIRED COLISEUM PASSES TEST WITH EASE; QUAKE: SOME FANS SAY THEY CAN'T SEE 
ANY DIFFERENCE. BUT THAT'S JUST THE POINT, SAY PROUD PARTICIPANTS IN THE 
HISTORIC STADIUM'S REBUILDING PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 54,000 fans showed up Saturday for the first game at quake-repaired 
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and for the builders it was a day of faint 
praise from those who did not notice much difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe they spent $60 million," said Tommy Nunn, a fan attending the 
USC-Washington game reopening the stadium. "Except for a new paint job, it 
looks like nothing has changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Such remarks did not bother Frank Kishton, regional director of the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, which provided most of the funding to restore the 
Coliseum. That fans thought nothing had changed "means the job was done well," 
because a major effort was required to preserve the historic features of the 
stadium, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coliseum project director Don C. Webb said: "That's the PR challenge -- to 
prove we did need the $60 million." 
</P>
<P>
 If the evidence of the reconstruction work was not obvious to all, it was 
probably fine with most USC fans anyway. Their team beat Washington, 24-17. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherie Raidy of Glendale, standing in the upper concourse at halftime, said: 
"It's the $60 million you can't see, but it's here." 
</P>
<P>
 A former Coliseum commissioner, Dominick Rubalcava, paused to recall what the 
concourse looked like after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right where we're standing," he said, "a gigantic crack had opened up between 
the concourse and the rest of the Coliseum, and that crack ran all around the 
stadium. The whole concourse had to be excavated 18 feet to get the equipment 
in. Then they had to drill, sinking 120 pilings into the ground 90 feet, and 
seismically reinforce the upper levels with 56 huge concrete and steel beams. 
</P>
<P>
 "That took months, and when it was done, they had to pour cement to re-create 
this concourse. So today, where all these people are buying beer and hot dogs, 
it looks as if nothing much has been done. But we are on the site of a classic 
rebuilding project, and it was all done in just a few months." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mike Hill, accompanying Rubalcava, quipped: "For this kind of money, they 
should have gotten air conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
 Pride dominated the day among the people who had worked on the project, and it 
was especially evident at Webb's office, another pregame party in the Coliseum 
Commission's office, and a pregame brunch hosted by USC President Steven B. 
Sample across the street on the university's campus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Webb and prime Coliseum contractor Ron Tutor, a USC alumnus, were showered 
with congratulations at the USC affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never shared in a project that so galvanized the city," Tutor said. 
"Instead of the usual obstructionism, everyone got behind it and pulled." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said he would always remember the dedicated workers, as many as 1,200 at 
a time and 2,000 in all, who toiled at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "All work should show a special purpose," the project director said. "That's 
the reason I believe we're on the planet. Work should be dignified, but too 
often it's not. We saw that dignity here in recent months, the workers feeling 
this was not just a job, but had a purpose to it, rebuilding a grand old 
stadium and serving a great city." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, USC had a short ceremony on the field honoring Webb, Tutor, 
architect Terry Miller and others who were instrumental in the Coliseum repair. 
The Olympic torch burned atop the peristyle end of the stadium throughout the 
game, as it had since the rededication Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 One Coliseum commissioner said that despite all the work done, he remains 
dissatisfied with the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still not the stadium we promised the Raiders it would be," said Sheldon 
Sloan, referring to plans to eventually put luxury boxes on the Coliseum rim. 
</P>
<P>
 The only major item that was not working at the start of the game Saturday was 
the new scoreboard, installed in the last week by Display Solutions. A new 
video board performed excellently. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the things at the Coliseum that had not changed were concession prices, 
including $4.75 for not too large a beer and $3 for an iced tea that sells in 
most markets for $1 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way I can justify it is that that's what beers are sold for at 
Yankee Stadium and the Meadowlands," Lynch said. "Hell, you've got to get it 
(concessions income) when you can get it. That's not a philosophy. It's just 
the way it is."

THE PITCH; LITTLE LEAGUE CORPORATE SPONSORSHIPS HAVE SOME CRYING FOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 During a break in the Little League World Series, league President Creighton 
J. Hale, 70, was talking about a world where young ballplayers from Israel, 
Jordan, China and Poland can chew huge wads of gum, pound their gloves and 
promote global harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale's vision is brought to you by K mart. And Gatorade. And Bubblicious gum, 
Canon Camcorders, Band-Aid and Ponderosa Steakhouse, to name just a few of the 
businesses whose names appeared throughout last weekend's Little League World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
 At the series, televised last weekend just in time to help ease the painful 
national withdrawal from major league baseball, the pitchmen seemed to have 
become as much a part of the Little League action as the pint-sized pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 While commerce and sport are hardly strangers, capitalizing on the dreams of 
12-year-olds presents a paradox: Part of Little League's appeal is its 
apple-pie purity, which could be lost if the sport becomes over-commercialized, 
critics say. Others complain the national organization shares too little with 
regional and local groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Breen saw how things have changed since he coached a Northridge team 
that went to Williamsport for the 1975 World Series. He doesn't like the 
commercialism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recall the media maybe doing a story or two. I don't remember microphones 
in the faces of the players every day," he said. "I don't recall seeing 16 
different sponsors on the scoreboard in 1975 like I did this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Breen, like many people, questions the fiscal priorities of Little League's 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see the money going into the week of the World Series, the headquarters," 
Breen said. "I see it going into gold leaf and trimmings. I would think that 
money could pour back to the leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hale and other leaders said commercialization is necessary to fund a nonprofit 
organization that depends on the work of more than 1 million volunteers. 
Critics say Little League is selling out. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it was founded in 1939, Little League has symbolized the grass-roots 
thrill of a shoestring catch made on a ball field maintained on a shoestring 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990s, that image has become a magnet for corporations looking to 
project innocence by association. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got an international flavor, yet it's an all-American sport," said Shawn 
Kahle, a spokeswoman for K mart, the official sponsor of the Little League 
World Series. "It's a family activity. Everyone is going to load in the 
minivan, go out to the ballpark and root for the team. That's the kind of image 
K mart wants as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Specialists say the profit potential is large. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody's making a buck there. They're making more money than ever," said 
Andy Woolf, vice president of World Class Sports, a Beverly Hills sports talent 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolf and other sports marketing professionals questioned why the money made 
from the Little League World Series doesn't find its way back to the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who need it most never see it," he said. "How much money is going 
for entertainment for the adults; how much is going back into the ballpark? It 
should be going into mitts and balls and jerseys and shoes for the ones who 
really need them." 
</P>
<P>
 Hale acknowledged that while the league's international headquarters here 
benefits from the sponsorship, there is no direct trickle-down effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fund programs that benefit local leagues," Hale said, "but none of the 
cash goes directly to the league and district level."  
</P>
<P>
 Hale noted that anti-drug and tobacco programs, and the development of safety 
equipment, originate from Little League headquarters. Hale personally holds the 
patents on some of that equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The league invests primarily in two areas: improvements to facilities in 
Williamsport and at five regional centers, and toward realizing Hale's vision 
of "cutting edge" Little League diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale attended a Little League game in Guangzhou, China, two months ago that 
marked the first time an athletic team of any kind from Taiwan had been allowed 
to compete in mainland China. The crowd in the bleachers included former Major 
League Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn and Peter O'Malley, Dodger owner and 
president of the Little League Foundation, an advisory council. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the national organization continues to prosper, the Northridge team 
that provided the drama during this year's series is hurting financially. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge coach George Saul said his league is trying to raise money for 
about $20,000 in earthquake repairs, but has received no offers of corporate 
sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I understand they have a lot of money," Saul said, referring to 
headquarters. "The Little Leagues are the ones that provide the basis for it. 
They are the whole reason the World Series exists. Little League definitely 
should give some back." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to come out ahead," said Paul Mort, a Northridge Little League 
official. "Disneyland gave $5,000. We got $1,000 from Marge Russo, at Russo 
Realty. Northridge mall gave us $300." 
</P>
<P>
 Saul said that beyond quake repairs, the playing fields need work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are primarily looking to improving fields," he said. "We have to get 
bigger water pumps and re-plumb fields. We might want to re-sod fields." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the 55-acre headquarters in Williamsport is a showplace, a 
small-town shrine to Little League. It includes a 40,000-seat lighted stadium, 
practice fields, administrative offices, dormitories and a Little League 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Little League is a nonprofit corporation. Its financial condition can best be 
described as robust, with $20 million in assets, Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
 At headquarters, the message on the topic of commercialism is mixed: While 
Hale voices concern about commercial exploitation, stacked beside the toilet in 
the men's room are Fortune and Forbes magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to be alert to the possibility of commercialism creeping into Little 
League," said Hale, whose annual salary tops $100,000. "Dozens and dozens of 
companies want to sponsor Little League and we are very selective. We don't 
want to turn into the Indy 500." 
</P>
<P>
 The previous day, K mart Family Footwear had sponsored a breakfast honoring 
various Little League volunteers. A marketing director took the podium long 
enough to remind everyone present that they had a friend in K mart. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of a booming Little League were everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The game is played in 84 countries with more expansion planned. Team 
dormitories built in 1992 in Williamsport can accommodate 16 teams, and the 
World Series soon will double from its current eight-team format, Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Challenger Division for youngsters with handicaps has gained significant 
momentum in the past five years, and a softball program started in 1974 now 
includes 300,000 girls. 
</P>
<P>
 And Little League is launching local leagues in urban areas, such as Los 
Angeles, where the league, Rebuild LA and Hilton Hotels are planning to build 
five fields along Martin Luther King Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional headquarters that include stadiums similar to the one in Williamsport 
are planned for Poland and China. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could not afford to do these things without corporate sponsorships," Hale 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Little League employs only about 100 worldwide to serve 2.8 million players. 
The organization relies on an extensive network of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Volunteers are the key to Little League," said Hale from his suite that 
overlooks the stadium in Williamsport. "That will always be true." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not all Williamsport residents share Hale's global vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get upset at old Creighton Hale," said Tim Tompkins, 38, a Williamsport 
native who hasn't missed a World Series since 1968. "It's a money thing now. 
Little League is probably the most profitable nonprofit organization in the 
world."  
</P>
<P>
 Regulation XIII of the official Little League rule book addresses 
commercialization. The first sentence states, "Exploitation of Little League in 
any form or for any purpose is prohibited." 
</P>
<P>
 Hale, caretaker of a dream, said the rule will protect the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I'm in charge, TV will not call the shots," he said. "And as long 
as I'm in charge, any corporate assistance will be carefully weighed against 
the benefits it provides kids."

RELIGION / JOHN DART; NEW SITES FOR HIGH HOLY DAYS RITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What do the Pantages Theater, Airtel Plaza Hotel and Warner Center Marriott 
Hotel, Shepherd of the Hills Church and three Mormon churches have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 They will all resound to the call of the shofar, or ram's horn, blown at Rosh 
Hashanah services on Monday evening and Tuesday morning to signal the beginning 
of the Jewish year 5755 and the start of the High Holy Days. 
</P>
<P>
 Several synagogues in the San Fernando Valley area -- as well as Jewish 
congregations elsewhere -- are not spacious enough to seat everyone who wants 
to take part in the opening and closing services of the prayerful 10 days of 
moral self-examination. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen S. Wise Temple, whose more than 2,900 families make it the largest 
synagogue in the Western states, will hold services in four locations this year 
-- two at its Bel-Air complex off Mulholland Drive, one at Bel Air Presbyterian 
Church and a fourth at a new venue, the Pantages Theater in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen S. Wise Temple had conducted additional High Holy Days services for 30 
years at the Scottish Rite Masonic Temple, but the closing of that Wilshire 
Boulevard landmark forced the Reform congregation to find another site to serve 
the Jewish community living east of the Beverly Hills area. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Rabbi Isaiah Zeldin will lead Rosh Hashanah services at 8 p.m. Monday 
and 10 a.m. Tuesday at the Pantages. Yom Kippur services will also be held in 
the theater at those times on Sept. 14 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The shofar, a hollowed-out, foot-long ram's horn, is blown repeatedly during 
Rosh Hashanah evening and daytime services and was compared by the medieval 
Jewish sage Maimonides to a moral wake-up call for Jews. One long blast on the 
horn ends the culminating Yom Kippur service. 
</P>
<P>
 Synagogue attendance reaches its yearly peaks during Rosh Hashanah morning and 
on Yom Kippur, also called the Day of Atonement -- at both the evening-before 
services and at the series of culminating services on the final day. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kol Tikvah, a Reform congregation in Woodland Hills, for instance, 
Executive Director Florence Klatzko said Friday that she expects a total of 
about 3,000 worshipers at those times for two services in the grand ballroom at 
the Warner Center Marriott Hotel and a third service at the synagogue on 
Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple Ner Maarav, a Conservative branch synagogue in Encino with about 500 
member families, is using the ballroom at the Airtel Plaza Hotel near the Van 
Nuys Airport as well as its own building for three services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seats might still be available in our social hall, but not at the hotel and 
not in our sanctuary," Senior Rabbi Aaron Kriegel said late this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Some synagogues, such as Temple Beth Hillel in Valley Village, contain High 
Holy Days services entirely within their own place of worship -- but barely. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're maxed out, filled up," said Paul Kipnes, an assistant rabbi at the 
Reform synagogue led by Rabbi James Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, popularly known as the Mormon 
Church, is making at least three facilities available for Jewish services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Temple Beth Torah of Granada Hills, a Reform congregation, is holding both 
Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur services at the Mormon church in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 * Temple Beth Haverim of Agoura Hills, a Conservative synagogue, will be 
worshiping in the newly built Mormon center in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Valley Outreach Synagogue, an independent congregation, will hold all its 
High Holy Days services at the Mormon center in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly named Shomrei Torah Synagogue -- the 700-family product of a merger 
of Congregation Beth Kodesh and Temple Beth Ami -- will not hold any High Holy 
Days services at its facility in West Hills. Instead, Senior Rabbi Eli Schochet 
will lead the largest services for Shomrei Torah at Shepherd of the Hills 
Church in Porter Ranch, and Rabbi David Vorspan will lead rites at the former 
Temple Beth Ami sanctuary in Reseda. A third service -- for non-members -- will 
be held at the Vineyard Church in Reseda, a representative said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Temple Beth Emet of Burbank, a congregation in the Reform tradition and led by 
Rabbi William M. Kramer, who also is a historian, will observe its 36th High 
Holy Days at the nearby Pickwick Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley-based Makom Ohr Shalom, a synagogue emphasizing the 
mystical-meditative side of Judaism, normally meets in an Encino church, but 
will hold its High Holy Days services at UCLA's Ackerman Hall.

VALLEY BRIEFING: DESERT FLORA; HOW THEY SURVIVE THE HARSH CONDITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Life in the high desert hinterlands can be cruel. High temperatures in the 
summer, little water and sparse shade make it hard on animals and people. But 
several members of the plant world have adapted to these harsh conditions and 
even thrive in them. Their superficial root systems, water storage capabilities 
and waxy leaves allow them to survive through high and low extremes. In 
Lancaster, for example, the average high temperature is 98 degrees in July. In 
January, the average low is 29 degrees. Here's a look at some of the plants in 
and around the Antelope Valley, that make their home in the western Mojave 
Desert. Beavertail Cactus ( Opuntia basilaris )  
</P>
<P>
 Only one of two native cacti to the western Mojave Desert, the beavertail 
cactus -- with its distinctive magenta or white flowers -- gets its name from 
the shape of its pads. Water is stored in the pads and it reproduces with 
seeds. The stomata, surface pores which carry out photosynthesis, open only at 
night when humidity is higher and the plant is less likely to lose precious 
water. Its skin is waxy to reduce water loss, but fleshy inside. Instead of 
long needles or leaves, the beavertail has small bunches of short spines that 
reduce water loss. It grows 6 to 12 inches high and 1 to 6 feet in diameter. 
Joshua Tree ( Yucca brevifolia )  
</P>
<P>
 Rigid leaves covered by a waxy surface help the Joshua tree survive in the 
desert by being able to resist wilting and water loss. Its widespread roots are 
about 3 feet deep. Water is stored in its trunk and leaves. The plant is 
pollinated mainly by the yucca moth and reproduction of the plant occurs when 
its black, flat seeds are scattered in the wind or when underground stems 
sprout near the parent tree. Joshua trees don't flower every spring. This 
flowering is also tied to weather. Joshua trees produce few flowers after a 
warm winter, more after a cold one. A large Joshua will be about 30 feet tall, 
although there is one 58 feet tall in Lancaster that is estimated to be 1,000 
years old. Bigelow's Coreopsis ( Coreopsis bigelovii ) 
</P>
<P>
 While Joshua trees and cacti grow very slowly, this wildflower survives in the 
desert by growing quickly. The reason: Its leaves can only store small amounts 
of water. An annual, it germinates in the fall, blooms in the spring and dies 
off in summer, sitting out the hottest months. Some years are better than 
others for the Bigelow's coreopsis. The seeds will only germinate when soil 
temperatures are low and moisture content of the soil is high. Found more 
commonly in the western Mojave Desert, they grow 6 inches to 2 feet tall. Rain 
Catchers 
</P>
<P>
 When it doesn't rain very often, water doesn't have a chance to soak deep into 
the soil. As a result, cacti have shallow, wide-ranging root systems allow them 
to grab as much rainfall as possible. The roots have tiny hairs that help them 
collect water. The plants often grow spaced out because of stiff water 
competition below the surface.

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
LIBERTARIAN LISTS REASONS WHY HE MAY WIN RACE IN 69TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spoiler's race?: Arguing that he should not be so easily dismissed in the 
upcoming race to fill the 69th Assembly District seat being vacated by Democrat 
Tom Umberg of Garden Grove, Libertarian candidate George Reis lists the 
following arguments: 
</P>
<P>
 "No incumbent. Only 80,000 registered voters. The Latino community leaders 
currently (are) recommending a 'no vote.' " (Some Latino activists are at war 
with the Democratic Party leadership that is backing Democrat Mike Metzler, the 
Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce president. The Republican in the race is Anaheim 
businessman Jim Morrissey.) 
</P>
<P>
 Reis, a photographer for the Newport Beach Police Department, also notes that 
while Democratic voter registration is now 21 points higher than for 
Republicans -- a three-point increase since the June primary -- turnout is 
expected to be low because this is not a presidential election year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, (Libertarians) get 6% of the vote and come back two years later and 
do the same thing. With that history, I would ignore us too," Reis concedes. 
But this year will be different, he vows. "At best, we could win this race. At 
worst, we will be the spoiler." 
</P>
<P>
 One Republican activist who did not want to be quoted by name says there is 
merit to Reis' argument. He says voters who are against issues like mandatory 
helmet laws, gun control and the "Save Our State" anti-illegal immigrant 
initiative could be drawn to Reis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most compelling reason for Democrats and Republicans to break ranks is 
that "they are upset with the Democratic and Republican parties' king-making 
attitudes that exclude activists from the decision-making," the activist says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Non-endorsement: Westminster Councilman Tony Lam, who became the first 
Vietnamese American elected to public office in the country, has been heavily 
courted for an endorsement by Democratic candidate Mike Farber, who is trying 
to unseat Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) in the 46th Congressional 
District in central Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't given him any endorsement yet," says Lam, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan is not likely to get Lam's endorsement either. (Dornan never requested 
it, the councilman says.) 
</P>
<P>
 Since the council seat is nonpartisan, Lam says he has decided to stay out of 
the fight. "I better stay neutral because I don't want to upset my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gutsy candidate: State Treasurer and Democratic gubernatorial candidate 
Kathleen Brown was welcomed to Orange County last week with news that the Board 
of Supervisors had endorsed Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. Supervisor Roger R. 
Stanton says it was "gutsy" for Brown to visit the GOP stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, however, says she can take the county. "It's not too hard to be here," 
she told a luncheon audience last week. "I am doing all right. I have done all 
right here before." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Democratic Foundation Chairman Wylie Aitken told her not to 
worry, contending that whenever the supervisors agree on something, they wind 
up losing. Their endorsement "is a little bit like the kiss of death," Aitken 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 GOP campaign strategy: During Brown's visit to Orange County, the Wilson 
campaign paraded New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman before reporters to 
preview an attack on Brown: that the middle-class theme of her campaign comes 
right out of a strategy memo written by President Clinton's pollster, Stanley 
Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown campaign says Whitman's charge was ridiculous. Brown has been 
talking about middle-class issues since the start of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Wilson folks looked like they stole a page from the U.S. Senate 
campaign of Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara). Days before Brown came to 
town, the Huffington campaign also accused Democratic rival, U.S. Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein, of "cribbing her campaign strategy" from the Greenberg memo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he needs a map: Had state Assemblyman Thomas M. Hannigan (D-Fairfield) 
acted any sooner, there surely would have been hell to pay hundreds of miles 
away in Lake Forest. Tacked on to obscure state legislation sponsored by 
Hannigan were guidelines for membership on military base redevelopment agencies 
in regions where bases are scheduled for closure. According to the new 
geographic rules, Lake Forest would have been eliminated from membership on the 
El Toro Reuse Planning Authority's nine-member governing board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who would exclude Lake Forest just doesn't understand how this process 
works. We are the closest community to that base," Lake Forest Mayor Marcia 
Rudolph says. 
</P>
<P>
 But she can breathe easier. The new rules don't apply to existing base 
redevelopment agencies. UPCOMING EVENTS 
</P>
<P>
 * Wednesday: A $250-per-person reception will be held for Marilyn C. Brewer, 
the Republican candidate in the 70th Assembly District race, at 2920 Cliff 
Drive in Newport Beach, from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thursday: A debate on the proposed airport initiative for El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station will be held during a meeting of the Orange County division 
of the League of California Cities at the Turnip Rose, 300 S. Flower St. in 
Orange, beginning at 7:15 p.m.

 An 86-year-old motorist was killed Saturday when he ignored warning barriers 
and attempted to beat a locomotive across train tracks in the San Gabriel 
Valley, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelo Gramrosa of San Gabriel died when his car was thrown 80 feet in the 
impact with a Southern Pacific engine that was traveling about 50 m.p.h., 
authorities said.

<P>
 He was the sole passenger in the car and was pronounced dead at the scene of 
the accident, which occurred about 11:40 a.m. The rail crossing is near the

SIMI VALLEY FREEWAY UP, RUNNING; REPAIRS: THE LAST MAJOR BOTTLENECK CAUSED BY 
THE JAN. 17 QUAKE IS HISTORY WITH THE REOPENING OF FIVE LANES OF TRAFFIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't quite in time for the Labor Day weekend rush. But five new westbound 
lanes of the Simi Valley Freeway reopened soon enough for Todd Burns, who 
slipped away on them Saturday, his fiancee by his side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great! Beautiful! I love it," said Burns, who was headed for a weekend in the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway had been narrowed to three lanes in each direction since the Jan. 
17 earthquake. But with the opening early Saturday of new decks on the San 
Fernando Mission Boulevard and Bull Creek overpasses, the last major freeway 
bottleneck left by the quake became history. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more lanes on the eastbound side are expected to be reopened by Wednesday. 
Unlike other post-quake freeway projects, the California Department of 
Transportation offered no special incentives to construction crews to speed up 
work on the Simi Valley Freeway because the route remained partially open to 
traffic. Nonetheless, the work was finished 16 days ahead of schedule, said 
Frank Latham, the project's resident engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The only quake repairs still in progress on the region's freeways are two 
ramps of the Antelope Valley Freeway at the Golden State Freeway interchange. 
When those reopen Nov. 5, the last quake-related freeway repairs will be 
complete, said Jerry Baxter, Los Angeles district director for Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews had kept three lanes open each way throughout the repairs on the Simi 
Valley Freeway by routing traffic to whichever side was not being fixed. But 
freeway commuters said the work led to frequent backups nonetheless.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was havoc," said Burns, who lives in Canoga Park and travels the freeway 
to work each day. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake crumpled the eastbound deck of the freeway and caused the 
westbound side to sag several feet, Baxter said. Workers temporarily shored up 
the sagging deck so traffic could pass, then tore down the collapsed bridge and 
ground it to gravel. Both sides were then rebuilt from the ground up. 
</P>
<P>
 The work cost about $24 million in federal earthquake restoration funds. 
Altogether, Caltrans has spent close to $250 million fixing Los Angeles' 
quake-battered freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Peggie Roach, whose home sits in the shadow of the northbound on-ramp at 
Woodley Avenue, was among those most relieved to see the construction crews go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God," she said. "It's been a nightmare." Roach's windows are still 
coated with the fine white dust the construction work kicked up. And her family 
has endured months of machinery noise at all hours, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kelly Gladstone, who also rode the freeway Saturday from Simi Valley, the 
completion of work was a boost to morale, more than anything else.  
</P>
<P>
 "It means things are almost back to normal," she said. "We are finally getting 
there."

CAMPAIGN '94: ISSUES AND ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two candidates are running in the Nov. 8 election to represent the 67th 
Assembly District. They are Democrat Jonathan Woolf-Willis of Huntington Beach 
and Republican Doris Allen, the incumbent, from Cypress. Here's where they 
stand on four issues. "Three Strikes" Crime Law 
</P>
<P>
 Woolf-Willis: "The concept of 'three strikes' is good. It prevents violent 
felons from hurting more victims. But the law must focus on those who commit 
violent felonies. If we do not combine 'three strikes' with alternative 
programs for nonviolent offenders, we will overcrowd our prisons and bankrupt 
our state. Here are several additional programs of smart prevention and tough 
enforcement that I propose: more police on the street, community-based 
policing, early intervention, a ban on automatic weapons, prisoner work 
programs to compensate victims and pay for room and board, expanded drug 
treatment programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen: "Although there are always alternatives that may prove effective in 
dealing with crime, I have always been a staunch supporter of 'three strikes' 
legislation. When fully implemented by the judicial system, these laws put an 
end to the repetitive nature of felons. If you are not on the street, you can't 
commit crimes against society. The people of California called for real time 
for real crimes, and I agree. What needs to be watched now are the liberals' 
attempts to weaken the law by inserting exemption clauses on felonies that 
otherwise would be included in 'three strikes.' This circumvention could render 
one of the toughest crime deterrents in the state impotent." Measure to Curtail 
Benefits to Illegal Immigrants 
</P>
<P>
 Woolf-Willis: "Illegal immigration is wrong. It needs to be stopped. I support 
what is being called a 'citizenship based' immigration policy. It combines 
support for cutting the flow of illegal immigrants with measures to assist new 
immigrants in becoming citizens and acculturating. The three key aspects of 
this policy are: tough enforcement of immigration laws, assimilation of 
newcomers and re-examination of current immigration policies. 'SOS' is not an 
intelligent response to the problem because it makes our doctors, nurses, 
teachers and social workers do the job of federal law enforcement. These 
professionals should not be the ones interrogating and arresting illegal 
immigrants -- that's like something out of Nazi Germany in the 1930s." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen: "The cost of services for illegal residents in California is enormous. 
Unless something is done to curtail this, it will bankrupt the state. While it 
is clear that something needs to be done, the jury on the 'Save Our State' 
initiative is, in my mind, still out. It is unfortunate that the public has had 
to use the initiative process to resolve this legislative issue. While there 
were many attempts to address this matter legislatively, certain interests 
successfully stymied those efforts. Any negative impact on the health and 
safety, as well as any unanticipated future costs to the legal residents of 
California, needs to be seriously and thoroughly scrutinized before a vote on 
this serious ballot measure is cast." Single-Payer Health Initiative 
</P>
<P>
 Woolf-Willis: "I have two objections to the plan. First, it is funded 
primarily by a business payroll tax at a time when businesses are leaving 
California for other states where there are less taxes and less regulations. 
Secondly, health care is a national problem. Reform should come on the national 
level. Most Americans want a universal health care program of some type. That 
need transcends partisan politics. I am hopeful that the current bipartisan 
efforts in Congress will result in a plan that will have the least impact on 
small businesses, while meeting the pressing need for reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen: "The idea that the government can supply the people of California with 
a better and more affordable health plan is a fallacy. California currently 
offers some of the best health care in the world. Forming a huge government 
bureaucracy to implement health care would neither lower costs nor improve the 
quality of services available, and it would be an incredible strain on the 
state's already fragile economy. What is needed is less governmental 
involvement, not more." Future Uses For El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
</P>
<P>
 Woolf-Willis: "The future use of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station is the 
most important regional decision that will be made in Orange County this 
decade. The appointed commission should finish its job and make its 
recommendations on the highest and best use for the property. One concept that 
deservess more study is converting El Toro into a mixed-use sporting facility, 
including a first-class professional baseball stadium for the California 
Angels. That would permit a complete renovation of Anaheim Stadium as part of 
our community's efforts to keep the Rams. Youth sports and Olympic training 
centers could also be combined with the stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen: "I have always believed in the process of government responding to the 
people. The issue of the potential development of a commercial airport at El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station will be before the people on the November ballot. 
The wishes of the voters should be the single most important factor in deciding 
the future use of this great resource for Orange County. The question before 
the Orange County electorate is whether the county will choose to aggressively 
move into the international arena or to continue the status quo."

SEASONAL LIFEGUARDS VOTE IN FAVOR OF UNION NEGOTIATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's seasonal lifeguards, appropriately hooking into the Labor Day 
weekend theme, voted unanimously Saturday for union representation in their 
dealings with Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 On one of the year's busiest beach weekends, 71 of the city's 103 summer 
lifeguards turned out at the Huntington Beach lifeguard headquarters to sign up 
with the newly formed Surf City Lifeguards Employee Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Silber, an attorney representing the seasonal lifeguards, said that 
after a week of intense lobbying, the lifeguards "rode the big, high wave" in 
becoming the first group of summer lifeguards in the state to form a union and 
have it recognized by their employer. 
</P>
<P>
 "SCLEA enthusiastically enters the ranks of organized labor," Silber said. "An 
impossible dream of less than two months has become a reality for Surf City's 
seasonal lifeguards." 
</P>
<P>
 Silber said Saturday's results were certified by the California Mediation and 
Conciliation Service and are binding upon the city. Deputy City Administrator 
Richard Barnard earlier said if a majority of all seasonal lifeguards voted in 
favor of the union it would become their exclusive bargaining representative. 
</P>
<P>
 Seasonal lifeguards, many of whom attend school in the off season, currently 
have no fringe benefits, work for lower pay than year-round lifeguards and are 
not paid at a higher rate for overtime.

BLACK STUDENTS PROTEST WHITE TEACHER'S HIRING; CSUN: A RALLY IS HELD OUTSIDE 
THE WOMAN'S CLASSROOM. SHE INSTRUCTS TWO PAN-AFRICAN READING AND WRITING 
COURSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Black Student Union members at Cal State Northridge have protested the 
appointment of a white woman to a part-time teaching position in the 
Pan-African studies department because they say they want an African American 
to fill the post. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher, Katherine Komis, started work Monday. She teaches two sections in 
remedial reading and writing in the Pan-African studies department, and one 
section in the English department. 
</P>
<P>
 Equipped with a bullhorn, students led a rally outside Komis' classroom 
Wednesday, and on Friday, a few of them met with CSUN President Blenda J. 
Wilson and Pan-African studies faculty to voice their concerns, said CSUN 
spokeswoman Carmen Ramos Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students would like to have black mentors in these classes," said Leslie 
Small, an African American graduate student and last year's president of the 
Black Student Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Small said the students were concerned that Komis would be teaching 
beginning-level students. These students, in particular, need black mentors, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a race issue," Small said. "The issue is whether she has the 
cultural background." 
</P>
<P>
 Small said the students have no quibble with Komis' qualifications, and added 
he doesn't think she should be fired. "She's just not the person we need in 
that position," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, the campus spokeswoman, said the administration had taken no action 
regarding Komis as of Saturday. She said she expects further meetings on the 
issue to take place this week. Officials are not considering removing Komis 
from her job, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they remove her based on race, that's discrimination, and that's against 
the law," Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler added that Komis was teaching white and Latino students, as well as 
African American students. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Komis -- the only white to teach in Pan-African studies in recent 
memory -- nor Wilson, could be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who is African American, was unavailable because her father was taken 
ill last week, Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part-time faculty at CSUN are selected by each department. A faculty committee 
compiles a list of top candidates, and the department chairman makes a final 
selection. In Komis' case, former Pan-African studies Chairman Selase Williams 
made the appointment earlier this summer. Williams has since departed CSUN for 
another job and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Pan-African studies political science professor James Dennis said the 
appointment has been questioned by some faculty members, and added that he too 
found Komis' hiring "kind of a new experience."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis has been with the department since it was created in 1969 in the wake 
of a rash of student protests. Asked whether he thought Komis should have been 
hired, he replied that he feels there is a dearth of African American teachers 
in other CSUN departments. "The burden of a mixing faculty ought to fall on all 
of the departments that have not mixed faculty before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis said the Pan-African studies department did not have enough African 
American applicants to fill all the open part-time teaching positions this year 
partly because some instructors were not returning. The Jan. 17 earthquake, 
which severely damaged campus buildings, has made retaining part-time 
instructors more difficult, he said.

EX-CYA INMATE IS HONORED; CORRECTIONS: TEN YEARS AFTER SHOOTING A RIVAL GANG 
MEMBER, THE VAN NUYS RESIDENT HAS TURNED HIS LIFE AROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eric Jones was a 14-year-old dropout making $1,500 a week in a Los Angeles 
rock house when he gunned down a rival gang member from about 10 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 For Jones, 10 years have passed since the 1984 drive-by killing, seven of them 
behind bars. He says he can read now. He has a family. He works. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-year-old Van Nuys resident has been hailed as an "outstanding alumnus" 
of the federally funded Job Training Policy Council, which helped ease Jones' 
return to society. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have peace of mind now," said Jones, who was raised by his grandparents in 
South-Central Los Angeles and heartily supported by his grandmother, 
64-year-old Ellen Jones, during his years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer does he "have to look over my back any more," he said of his stay in 
the California Youth Authority, which moved him from facility to facility 
because of "fighting, breaking the rules, all that." No longer is he told when 
to eat, when to sleep, when to talk, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very, very proud of him," said Lolina Talili, vice president of 
operations for Tomkinson & Associates, a JTPC-funded organization that tutored 
Jones at the Ventura School of the CYA in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jones' parole in 1992, the Oxnard-based organization placed him with his 
employer, Victory Retreads in Lake View Terrace -- and his new life began. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially hired to work in the firm's production department, Jones now manages 
it. He lives with his girlfriend and her two children, 12 and 3, in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "They depend on me a lot," Jones said, and he beamed at the thought that he, a 
former gang-banger, would have a job and a family. 
</P>
<P>
 "All it took was for us to point him in the right direction," said Camarillo 
resident John Powell, co-partner of Victory Retreads. "He lost a lot of his 
years, his growing-up years . . . (so) we have to be father figures when he 
rebels." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who gave much of the credit for his rehabilitation to Powell and his 
partner, Vic Clegg, said: "I slacked a few times. But they just talked to me 
and said you have to walk before you run." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the rival gang member he killed, he added, "I got a second chance. He 
didn't and it's something that I think about. . . . I'd say I'm sorry, but it's 
not like the guy's going to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 While a youth in Los Angeles, he worked for a drug dealer who paid him $1,500 
a week -- considerably more than he makes now -- for what Jones described 
simply as "watching the window." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have buddies that I see, street buddies making easy money," he said. "But I 
don't want to do that again. It doesn't last long."

ARSON SUSPECTED IN TARZANA FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire that caused more than $100,000 damage to a blue jeans company Saturday 
was intentionally set, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty firefighters responded to the blaze at K.C. Jeans, in the 18000 block of 
Topham Street, at 5:47 a.m, said Jim Wells of the Los Angeles City Fire 
Department. The fire was put out a little more than an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials would not say why they believed the fire was the result of 
arson. There are no suspects in the blaze, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-story building sustained $100,000 in structural damage and $15,000 in 
damage to its contents, Wells said.

WOMAN IS REUNITED WITH MISSING SON; ARCADIA: MOTHER JOINS HER 2-YEAR-OLD IN 
LONDON. HER ESTRANGED HUSBAND HAD TAKEN THE BOY TO IRAQ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Arcadia woman and her 2-year-old son were reunited at Heathrow Airport in 
London on Friday, six weeks after her estranged husband had taken the boy to 
Iraq and demanded that she join him, according to the woman's family. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with the FBI and Scotland Yard, Michelle Al-Nasseri duped her 
estranged husband, Haitham Khalid Al-Nasseri, 33, into meeting her in London, 
said Michelle's mother, Liz Pollinger. Agents arrested Al-Nasseri and returned 
2-year-old Laith Adam Al-Nasseri to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really, really thrilled to death," said Liz Pollinger, 50, of Temple 
City. "The worst part about it was being so frightened we'd never see him 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Al-Nasseri, a paralegal, had filed for divorce May 23 and was awarded 
custody of the child, Pollinger said. The couple had been married 1 1/2 years 
but had been together for five years. They grew apart as Al-Nasseri insisted 
that Michelle and the child go to Iraq, where he grew up, Pollinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama began July 21, when Al-Nasseri took the child on what he said was to 
be a three-day camping trip. When he did not return, Michelle Al-Nasseri went 
to his condominium and found bank receipts showing he had withdrawn large 
amounts of money, travel agency paperwork, and receipts indicating that he had 
bought seeds, which are in demand in Iraq because of the food shortage, 
Pollinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Al-Nasseri contacted Arcadia police, who notified the FBI. Meanwhile, 
her sister saw a TV show that featured a story on Corporate Training Unlimited, 
a group of former Green Berets based in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 When Michelle Al-Nasseri contacted her husband in Iraq, he told her she would 
never see her son again unless she came to Iraq, Pollinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ex-Green Berets helped Michelle concoct the ruse to meet her husband in 
London for a meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure if he was naive or just self-confident to think that he could 
come into the country not realizing that the FBI would have a hand in this and 
rescue the child," FBI Supervisory Special Agent Stephen Steinhauser told the 
Pasadena Star-News. 
</P>
<P>
 Al-Nasseri is scheduled in court Monday for an extradition hearing, Pollinger 
said, and Michelle and the baby are expected to return to the United States on 
Tuesday.

 Forty men were arrested after soliciting undercover female police officers for 
sex in a prostitution sting on Harbor Boulevard between Gisler Avenue and 
MacArthur Boulevard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The area was targeted Thursday night after complaints from local merchants and 
residents, police said. The sting, which lasted from 7 p.m. to 1 a.m., was the

DORMITORY OFFERS A CLEAN, SOBER OPTION FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS; EDUCATION: 
DON'T BOTHER CHECKING INTO UC BERKELEY'S FREEBORN HALL IF YOU DRINK, SMOKE OR 
DO DRUGS. BUT IT IS NOT THE BORING PLACE MOST PEOPLE EXPECT, STUDENTS SAY.

 Residents of one UC Berkeley dorm have a message for their fellow students who 
like to light up -- anything. If you tune in and turn on, or even smoke 
cigarettes and drink beer, you have to drop out of Freeborn Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 About 230 students -- many of them exasperated with the lifestyles of their 
fellow students -- have secluded themselves in the campus's first 
substance-free dormitory, which opened this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Freeborn Hall pledge not to bring or use alcohol, tobacco or 
illegal drugs in the building -- a renovated high-rise two blocks south of 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other Berkeley dorms, students of legal age are allowed to smoke and 
drink in their rooms. Illegal drugs are prohibited, but in a city where many 
people have not ended their trip through the psychedelic '60s, and the City 
Council orders police not to enforce marijuana laws, drugs are easy to come by. 
</P>
<P>
 As in many campus settings, moderation is not the rule. Students tell stories 
of beer kegs stored in closets, pot parties that last till dawn and cigarette 
smoking stopped only for sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 The dorms have also harbored a few drug dealers. In April, university police 
closed in on one student who had 180 hits of acid and small amounts of 
marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms in his room.  
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is, for students not interested in mind expansion, the regular 
dorms can be one big hassle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived above three chain smokers and next to two more. I would open the 
window for fresh air, and have to shut it right away. It was like living above 
a chimney," said Gbenga Ajilore, 19, of Pasadena. Ajilore, another student and 
a member of the housing staff persuaded the school to create Freeborn Hall to 
escape not just smokers but substance abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd find my friends passed out outside the building. I'd have to bring them 
in and take care of them," Ajilore said. 
</P>
<P>
 He now works in the building checking students' ID cards as they enter the 
dorm, but he lives off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as Martina Estrada-Melendez, 18, of Los Angeles and Edwin Tang, 
18, of New York City, want to avoid dealing with the late-night disturbances 
and the vomit that often accompany weekend drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students choose to live here for a variety of reasons," said Aaron Anderson, 
the residential life coordinator who came up with the idea for the dorm. "Some 
have already experimented with alcohol and drugs and they've had terrible 
experiences; some are serious students, and some choose it because of their 
religion. There are others who come from families where maybe a parent . . . 
was an alcoholic," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 230 students who live there make up a small percentage of the 5,200 
undergraduate and graduate students living on campus. But there were more than 
400 requests to live in the dorm, and more have come from students who have 
experienced their first week at school in the real-world dorms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students come up to me all the time and ask how they can get in here," said 
Corinna Monzon, 21, a residential adviser who has lived in both types of dorms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is not the boring place most people expect, Monzon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from different preferences, students in the substance-free dorm are 
hardly distinguishable from their counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 They blare music, talk in the halls until the wee hours of the morning and 
cram for exams. 
</P>
<P>
 The dorm has chosen the questionably hip 1980s as its theme for throwing 
parties -- meaning they play Culture Club music and applaud Velcro-trapped gym 
shoes. They also have "mock tail parties," take tours of San Francisco and the 
campus late at night, and are known for impromptu dance parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is still noise, just not drunken noise. It's not like a whole other 
world," said 18-year-old Nichelle Hines, a freshman studying English and drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Crizella Wallace, an 18-year-old from Paramount, said she has never had a sip 
of alcohol or smoked a cigarette. She said she lives in the dorm because she 
suffers from asthma, bronchitis and emphysema and must stay away from smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's Jessica Morales, 18, otherwise known as Miss Teen California 
1993. Morales, who chose to come to Berkeley to study integrative biology 
instead of running for the national title, said she is sick of watching drugs 
destroy people's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen so many friends get torn up on acid, speed and Ecstasy. I've had 
two friends killed and another two critically wounded (in a car accident) when 
they left a teen 'rave' party where they could get anything from LSD-laced 
lollipops to nitrous balloons." 
</P>
<P>
 Students who live elsewhere tend to scoff at the dorm and its residents -- at 
least until they visit and see how clean and upbeat it is, Monzon said. Then 
they start reconsidering. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeehat Kasubhai, who lives in another dorm, conceded that she may have been 
too quick to dismiss Freeborn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted more of a live environment," Kasubhai said. "I guess I stereotyped 
the place."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PALMDALE, LANCASTER CHAMBERS TO MULL MERGER; 
COMMERCE: GROUPS WILL MEET TO DISCUSS JOINING FORCES ON SOME PROGRAMS, AS WELL 
AS POSSIBILITY OF UNITING INTO SINGLE ENTITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Chamber of Commerce leaders in Lancaster and Palmdale are opening talks aimed 
at ripping a hole in the "cactus curtain," a mythical barrier that divides the 
rival high-desert cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks could lead to a merger of the Palmdale and Lancaster chambers, 
creating one large regional group representing businesses throughout the 
Antelope Valley, some local leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
 If that occurs, it would be a dramatic change for the area because the two 
chambers were founded long before Palmdale and Lancaster were incorporated as 
cities. Today, both chambers remain active -- independently promoting 
businesses and sponsoring civic events in their respective cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, that could end. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Louis A. Mendoza, president of the Lancaster chamber, invited his 
counterparts in Palmdale to begin discussing joint programs and services -- and 
a possible merger. On Sept. 22, representatives of the two chambers will hold 
their first meeting on these issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will push a lot of people out of their comfort zone," Dave Aaker, 
executive vice president of the Palmdale chamber, said of the upcoming talks. 
"It's like a wheel with thousands of spokes. There's so much to digest. It 
would be unfair if I had a preconceived notion as to whether it will fly." 
</P>
<P>
 Some business people are expected to resist any efforts to blend the chambers, 
arguing that each city needs its own group to lobby the local government and 
organize events specifically for its city. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mendoza hopes chamber officials will approach the talks with an open mind 
and a wider view. "I think the biggest hurdle will be getting the leaders in 
the communities to embrace the regional concept," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancaster chamber, founded about 90 years ago, was the community's most 
influential organization before the city was incorporated in 1977. Before then, 
Los Angeles County officials relied on the chamber to speak for Lancaster. It 
was the chamber that lobbied for new parks and organized local parades. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Lancaster chamber, with about 1,200 members, is trying to put more 
emphasis on business education and promotion programs. At the same time, it is 
seeking to shed full responsibility for local parades. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palmdale chamber, founded in 1941, has about 760 members and also sponsors 
a mixture of community events and business-related programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber merger proposal surfaced, in part, because local shoppers and 
business owners have been paying less attention to municipal boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you threw a dart at a retail store anywhere in the Antelope Valley, and 
you opened that merchant's cash register, you would see checks from all over 
the Antelope Valley," said Aaker, who manages the Palmdale chamber office. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he is president of the Lancaster chamber, Mendoza also attends 
Palmdale chamber meetings because his employer, First Valley National Bank, has 
offices in both cities. Aaker estimates that about 200 members of his 
organization also belong to the Lancaster chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 One rationale for a regional chamber would be to eliminate the need for such 
businesses to pay double dues. In addition, education programs could be 
organized for business people from both cities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sold on the idea that the Palmdale and Lancaster chambers of commerce 
need to be doing things together," said Palmdale chamber President Bernie 
Longjohn. 
</P>
<P>
 But Longjohn, who runs Los Angeles County Raceway, is not sure the two 
chambers need to become one organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like two gas stations on the corner, an Arco and a Shell," he said. 
"They can be friends, but they also each have a business to run." 
</P>
<P>
 Longjohn fears that small mom-and-pop businesses could receive short shrift in 
a massive regional chamber. He also said some business people simply prefer a 
group that represents only their city. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Fryer, marketing director at Lancaster Community Hospital, also believes 
the two chambers can join forces on certain programs without becoming one 
mega-chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than merge the two chambers, maybe we need to look at regionalizing some 
of the services we offer, so we're not duplicating our efforts," said Fryer, 
past president of the Lancaster chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 The current chamber presidents, Longjohn and Mendoza, said they hope the 
upcoming talks, at the very least, will lead to better communication and 
cooperation between the two business groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster Councilman Michael Singer, who proposed merging the entire cities of 
Palmdale and Lancaster during his election campaign last spring, believes the 
chambers are moving in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were ever to join the two cities together, the chambers would have to 
be done first," Singer said. "It would get people thinking in terms of regional 
community instead of isolated feudalistic communities." 
</P>
<P>
 But the councilman also conceded that "there are some people who feel that 
their community should be the only game in town. I don't discount that. It's 
just that it has become obvious that we must begin thinking regionally in order 
to maintain control of regional issues."

IT'S BUDDY BALL TIME IN ANAHEIM TODAY; RAMS: RYAN SAYS IT WILL BE 'NO PICNIC' 
PLAYING HIS ARIZONA CARDINALS AND THEIR 'TOMBSTONE DEFENSE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some kind of excitement. Maybe 30,000, even 35,000 people in the stands. NFL 
opening day, Buddy Ryan's Arizona debut, and possibly the Rams' last season in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals haven't had a winning season since 1984, the Rams since 1989. 
The Cardinals are 20-44 over the last four years, the Rams 19-45. The Cardinals 
have lost three of their last four opening-day games, the Rams four straight. 
And today, none of that matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The playoffs are still in reach, the Super Bowl isn't out of the question, all 
of Phoenix is in a lather over Buddy Ball, and Chris Miller has yet to be 
sacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "A very, very important game," said Anthony Newman, Ram safety and defensive 
team captain. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be one of the most important games I have ever been involved in as 
a Ram. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to come out with something very positive. We have to win this game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, 0-4 in exhibition play, understand they lack credibility. They have 
done nothing to excite the local population, and if this contest is to capture 
any national attention, it will be because of Ryan, his "Tombstone Defense," 
and the body bags fans intend to display for every sack registered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no picnic to play us," said Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan employs intimidation, and has been accused of posting a bounty on the 
opposition's starting quarterback. Call it a coincidence, but someone in the 
Cardinal organization this week noted on the team's bulletin board that Miller 
has a history of knee problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to get him to come here," Ryan said of Miller. "But you all made him 
a better offer than I could, so he went to your place. I wanted a backup 
quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is the Rams' starting quarterback. He has undergone surgery on his left 
knee twice in the last two years and has not played in a regular-season game 
since last September, but the rust has worn off in three exhibition starts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' success this season undoubtedly will rest on Miller's continued 
soundness, but so far the team has been unable to protect him. The shuffle 
continued along the line last week when starting guard Bill Schultz was cut and 
Keith Loneker moved into Schultz's spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly feel like we're in for a severe test," said Jim Erkenbeck, Ram 
offensive line coach. "It will tell us where we are and give an indication of 
where we're going. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of defense tries to fool you, not necessarily beat you with 
mismatches. I do know this, having been involved with Buddy while he was in 
Chicago, having been involved with him when he was in Philadelphia and Houston, 
it certainly can be done." 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston Oilers last year employed Ryan's "46 defense," named for former 
Bear safety Doug Plank's jersey number, and the Rams tore it up, 28-13. 
</P>
<P>
 The 46 makes it tough to run -- Jerome Bettis and Cleveland Gary were held to 
56 yards in 26 carries -- but it's a defense that can be hit hard by pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jim Everett, who later was dispatched to New Orleans for a 
seventh-round pick, completed 19 of 28 passes for 316 yards and three 
touchdowns against Ryan's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good about our team," Miller said. "And the best scenario in the world 
would be for us to go out and beat Arizona. Then we can look at all (reporters) 
and say, 'What did we do in the preseason? What was the preseason all about? 
Who cares.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, the NFL's No. 1 in-your-face talker, has a different agenda. Hired to 
replace Joe Bugel, he has recruited some of his former defenders -- end Clyde 
Simmons, linebackers' Seth Joyner and Wilber Marshall and safety Terry Hoage -- 
to lift Phoenix from its funk. 
</P>
<P>
 "You play against this defense and you feel like you're in a war zone the 
whole game," Miller said. "They just bring heat on you all day. You expect to 
take more hits, but then at the same time you expect to have more opportunities 
to make big plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "They leave guys uncovered, banking you won't find them or the rush is going 
to get there before you get the ball out. They play a lot of man-to-man, so 
there is an opportunity on the corners if you get the ball up quickly. It's a 
defense that does present protection problems, so you definitely have to be 
flawless in execution to get those big plays." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals' offense, guided by quarterback Steve Beuerlein, features 
running back Ron Moore and a trio of troublesome receivers -- Gary Clark, Ricky 
Proehl and Randal Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows we need a win," Ram Coach Chuck Knox said. "We need to come 
out and show something, and I think we're going to play well. This is a good 
football team we're playing, but we just need to find a way to win."

JIM MURRAY: JUST HOW CREEPY CAN BASEBALL BE?

 Headline: "No Game Today On Account Of Pain! Baseball Strikes Out!" 
</P>
<P>
 We take you now to the Radio City office of our old friend, C.B. 
Culturevulture, head of sports programming for the Calculated Broadcasting 
System. 
</P>
<P>
 You will remember old C.B. as the entrepreneur who rose to network executive 
on the strength of owning the only all-gorilla band in history that could ride 
bicycles and play Beethoven at the same time. Smashed all records on the old Ed 
Sullivan show, even out-polling the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 The network decided he was a sports figure when, as a publicity stunt, he 
entered one of his musicians in the Tour de France. The big ape got 
disqualified when he tried to take the mademoiselle from Armentieres and climb 
the Eiffel tower with her. 
</P>
<P>
 As we look in, C.B. is busy with negotiations with labor: i.e., he is trying 
to talk his secretary into going to the Virgin Islands with him for the 
weekend. He is interrupted when his assistant, Watt A. Creep, comes in. The 
Creep is agitated.  
</P>
<P>
 Creep: Boss, I've got some bad news for you. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B. (irritated): Not now, Creepy, I've got some urgent company business to 
attend to. I'm trying to get Miss Oklahoma 1993 here some overtime. Keep the 
help happy, eh? Besides, I'm working on the baseball playoff schedules for next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Creep (unhappy): That's exactly it, sir. There'll be no playoffs. The jerks 
won't play. They've gone on strike. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B. (astonished): Who's gone on strike? The umpires? The parking attendants? 
The hot dog vendors? 
</P>
<P>
 Creep (unhappily): The players, sir. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B. (turning purple): The players? You're kidding! What do they think they 
are -- the United Mine Workers? The Teamsters, for cryin' out loud? You're not 
talking about all those crummy left halfbacks, goalies or point guards and 
things? 
</P>
<P>
 Creep: The left fielders and shortstops and second basemen. Baseball has gone 
on strike. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: Wait just a darn minute! You're joking. You mean all those guys who get 
7 mil a year for two hours' work a day, six months a year? They're striking? 
</P>
<P>
 Creep: That's right, Boss. Walked off the job. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: But you strike for better wages, hours, working conditions! What do 
these guys want, four-inning games? One-month seasons? A mil a game? 
</P>
<P>
 Creep: It's not that simple, Boss. They're striking against a salary cap. They 
don't want one. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: A salary cap? What's that? 
</P>
<P>
 Creep: Well, that's where you have a limit on the amount of money you can 
spend for labor. The owners want one. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: You mean they don't already have one? Somebody makes them pay more for 
services than they want? More than they can afford? 
</P>
<P>
 Creep: No, sir. They want the players to let them put one in place. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: That's crazy. Why don't they just put in their own salary cap, like 
every other business? I mean, do we in this business have to ask Dan Rather to 
agree to how we pay out our money? We just offer him what we want. If he 
doesn't want it, we get Connie Chung. Why don't they just get together and work 
out their own salary cap? 
</P>
<P>
 Creep (clearing his throat): They did once and it was ruled collusion. Cost 
them hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: "Wait a minute! I don't have to collude to stop spending more money than 
I'm taking in. A simple meeting with my accountant will do it. Don't these guys 
have their own accountants? Their own cap? 
</P>
<P>
 Creep: They'd exceed it. You see, Boss, ever since Colonel Ruppert bought Babe 
Ruth and built him a ballpark and founded a dynasty, every owner figures 
there's another Babe Ruth out there who will win everything for him. That's why 
they give 7 mil to a player like Barry Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: Who? 
</P>
<P>
 Creep: Barry Bonds, sir. A very good ballplayer. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: For very good, you don't give 7 mil. For Babe Ruth you give 7 mil. Barry 
Bonds is not a candy bar. Barry Bonds is just a nice kid with an earring. Babe 
Ruth you give 7 mil to. Willie Mays. Barry Bonds you give him what you have 
left over. 
</P>
<P>
 Creep (shrugging): You know that. I know that. But does George Steinbrenner 
know that? He wants to be another Colonel Ruppert. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: Tell him to buy a brewery. For a brewery you don't need a salary cap. 
Ruppert just bought the ball team to advertise his beer. Why don't these guys 
just say to the players, "You don't want a salary cap? OK, we won't have a 
salary cap." Then, have one. Who's gonna know? 
</P>
<P>
 Creep: Maybe the antitrust department. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: Baseball's outside the antitrust department. Some judge ruled the game 
was a sport, not a business. Boy, would I like to get that guy in a poker game! 
But why do they need a salary cap anyway?  
</P>
<P>
 Creep: Well, they say 19 franchises are losing money. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: I can believe it, the way they're throwing money off the back of trains 
at these guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Creep: They say they need revenue sharing to bail out the bankrupt teams. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: So, is revenue sharing against the law too?  
</P>
<P>
 Creep: No, it's just against their public policy. A team making 80 mil a year 
off its local television doesn't want to split it with a small-market team 
making 3 mil a year. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: Well, I can see why they won't go for that! That's socialism! 
</P>
<P>
 Creep: So they get the players to take up the slack. Pass on the cost to them. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: Now, that's more like it! That's fascism! 
</P>
<P>
 Creep: Well, the owners figure they're going to lose $140 million in the 
strike. Some ballplayers are losing 30 grand a day. What kind of "ism" is that? 
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: Bolshevism! These guys are Laurel and Hardy! As Ollie used to say, 
"Another fine mess you've gotten us into!" Are they going to get out of this 
mess? 
</P>
<P>
 Creep: Nope. Looks as if we'll lose the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: Lose the World Series? You're kidding! That's like motherhood, the flag, 
apple pie, hot-fudge sundaes, the Alamo, the Fourth of July! The World Series! 
There wouldn't have been a razor blade sold in this country for 20 years if it 
wasn't for the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, this is serious. This is against everything we've always held dear. Like 
money. Do you realize we've sold all the spots? Why, we'll lose millions! 
</P>
<P>
 How dare those guys trifle with the dreams of young boys? And account 
executives? Can't the U.N. step in here? Forget about Bosnia or Cuba for a 
week! Get busy on this! 
</P>
<P>
 Creep: Even the federal government can't help. It's up to Richard Ravitch for 
the owners and Donald Fehr for the players. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: I've seen them. They need a charisma transplant. Tell them to lighten 
up! That Fehr looks as if he's got a chronic stomach ache. In his contract he 
can't smile? If I got 750 grand a year just to say, "No salary cap!" I'd laugh 
all the way to the bank. Where's Jimmy Hoffa when you need him? John Gotti? The 
Gambino family? 
</P>
<P>
 Creep: Maybe if you sat down and talked to them . . .  
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: I'd rather go back to training apes. These guys all test positive for 
jerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Creep: How about if we just brought up minor leaguers? Hey, we could get "Air" 
Jordan in a Series! 
</P>
<P>
 C.B.: Yeah, they call him that 'cause that's all he hits nowadays!

MIKE DOWNEY: BRUINS ARE 75% GOOD, 25% BAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until the fourth quarter, UCLA was on its way to winning a season opener by 
shutout for the first time in 25 years. And the Bruins were shutting out 
Tennessee, a school that hadn't gone pointless against anybody in its last 156 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when a football game that began in 5 p.m. brightness turned dark and 
brought out the worst in UCLA. Collapsing inexcusably against a Tennessee team 
shorn of its starting quarterback and top receiver, the 14th-ranked Bruins 
luckily outlasted the 13th-ranked Volunteers in a contest Saturday night that 
didn't end a minute too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 So many of the good things that happened through three quarters -- the 
catching of Kevin Jordan, the running of Sharmon Shah, the resistance of UCLA's 
defense -- were undone by a final period that included lapses in concentration 
by certain players and at least one play call by the coaches that might have 
been practical but sadly lacked backbone. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahead by 10 points with little more than nine minutes to play, UCLA, an 
offense with the best receiver in the nation, had a third and five from its 21 
and ran a delayed handoff to James Milliner, who hadn't made a strong run all 
night. He didn't make one this time, either. 
</P>
<P>
 What a no-guts call this was. Rather than showing Tennessee what they were 
made of, the Bruins instead showed conservatism and concern, failed to land the 
first down and gave the Volunteers every reason to believe they could still win 
this game. You don't grind out the clock with nine minutes to play against a 
team like Tennessee. This isn't Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 Their players and loyal fans pumped up for the first time since the opening 
kickoff, Tennessee ran up 23 points in the fourth quarter and very easily could 
have won this game had UCLA linebacker Donnie Edwards not intercepted a pass in 
the final two minutes. The Volunteers scored 50 points in last year's opener 
and 62 in the final game of their schedule, so don't expect them to roll over 
and play dead. 
</P>
<P>
 A lesser team would have folded one series into the game. By then, quarterback 
Jerry Colquitt already had become a casualty and wideout Billy Williams was 
being helped off the field. Colquitt was the successor to Heath Shuler. And 
Williams was the latest model from Tennessee's factory for receivers -- Anthony 
Miller, Willie Gault, Alvin Harper, Tim McGee, Stanley Morgan, Carl Pickens and 
Sam Graddy, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 Next thing they knew, the Volunteers were spinning their wheels, going 
nowhere. They tried everything from Shuler's brother to Archie Manning's son to 
get their offense going. But UCLA, with linebackers Edwards, Rod Smalley and 
Shane Jasper making most of the stops, stuffed the visitors on play after play. 
</P>
<P>
 This game seemed in the bag. It was about to be Tennessee's worst experience 
on this coast since being shut out by USC in both the 1940 and 1945 Rose Bowl 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, everything the Bruins were doing seemed positive. Although 
their defense wasn't recording any sacks, the Volunteers sustained no long 
drives. UCLA's offense, meantime, was clicking, particularly Jordan, the 
flanker who more or less plays the John Taylor role to J.J. Stokes' Jerry Rice. 
Distracted by Stokes, the Volunteers got burned by Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 But far too often, quarterback Wayne Cook failed to drive the offense into the 
end zone. Field goals are fine, but as UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said: "You hate 
to get those threes when you're going after sevens." Particularly against a 
dangerous team like Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor gambles by Bruin defensive backs proved costly. And a breakdown on a 
two-point conversion made the score 18-16, meaning that Tennessee, pinned down 
a yard from its own goal by a punt, did not need to drive 99 yards for the 
game-winning score. All it needed to do was get in field-goal range, and UCLA 
could have been handed a humiliating defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the same kind of game the Bruins blew last season against Cal and 
Nebraska. Football players speak constantly of maintaining their "focus"; Bruin 
players had better speak about this a little more. 
</P>
<P>
 "To give up that many points in the fourth quarter was disappointing," Donahue 
said, choosing too weak a word. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that for three periods, UCLA looked very much the top-15 team 
it purports to be. Cook was adequate and accurate, though he has looked better, 
and Stokes was there when they needed him until the end, when nagged by an 
injury. Stepping up spectacularly was Jordan, who had more than half of UCLA's 
receiving yardage, and Shah, who looked in midseason form. 
</P>
<P>
 All things considered, the Bruins played a very fine game against a very 
strong team. But they can play better.

IT'S A FRESH APPROACH TO THE RUNNING GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a day for Washington, and not the University of. 
</P>
<P>
 For 60 minutes Saturday, freshman Delon Washington put the "T" back in 
Tailback U and made right what had been, of late, Student Body Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, not even listed on USC's flip card, came off the bench to dart and 
dash for 109 yards in 10 carries to spark USC's 24-17 victory over Washington 
at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like "The Natural,' " USC Coach John Robinson said. "I was going to 
call him Robert Redford." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, 18, was playing his first game since high school only because 
backup Leonard Green suffered a pulled hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Washington said. "It could not have gone any better." 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, who ranked eighth in conference rushing last season, gained 165 
net yards on the ground (232 gross). Shawn Walters gained 91 yards in 26 
carries and scored two touchdowns. Washington did the rest. The 5-foot-11, 
185-pounder from Dallas added a different gear to the USC running game. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson cautioned that Washington is not the second coming of Marcus Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's premature to talk in those terms," Robinson said. "Shawn is still the 
starter, but Delon Washington certainly had an impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington became the first true USC freshman to rush for a 100 yards or more 
since Ryan Knight gained 100 against UCLA in 1984. Washington became only the 
fourth true USC freshman ever to top the 100-yard mark. 
</P>
<P>
 He not only averaged 10 yards per carry, but had one of the game's most 
important runs in the third quarter, when he broke free for 34 yards on third 
down to keep alive what turned out to be the score-tying drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington acknowledged that he was scared before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of jitterbugs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he hit the huddle, he said the fear left him. He said he felt as if he 
was at Kimble High again, before those Texas-sized prep school crowds of 
13,000. Washington said he ran like the wind, the way his late brother, Benny, 
taught him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about him every day," Washington said. "He's inside of me, enjoying 
himself, he's above me. I pictured him in the crowd, yelling, telling me to 
stay inside or go outside." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Benny who convinced Delon that USC was the place for his brother; Benny 
who was convinced John Robinson would restore the Trojan tailback tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Benny who, Jan. 27, was standing in his Dallas neighborhood when a car drove 
past. Someone shouted his name from the window, then fatally shot him in the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen minutes after Delon learned of his 27-year-old brother's death, he 
phoned USC and committed to attending the university. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to get rid of everything," he said. "I just wanted to get it 
out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 His brother's killer soon turned himself in, but justice has been slow. 
</P>
<P>
 "They let him out two weeks later, and keep pushing the trial back," 
Washington said. "It was supposed to be July 18, but was postponed. Now it's 
Oct. 18." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington hopes to have gained a 1,000 yards by then. Benny saw USC as 
Delon's ticket to the top. He believed Delon could start a new tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was part of it," Washington said. "I hope to have a Heisman too." 
</P>
<P>
 It was difficult to tell who was happier Saturday, Washington or Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The run is back," Robinson said. "The run has got to be back for us. It's not 
a question of yardage, it's a question of belief and the will to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington showed Robinson the will, and maybe the way. 
</P>

MIKE PENNER: MAYBE A BUDDY COULD HAVE SAVED THE RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As we all know, the Rams are not ready for this. No way on earth. They need 
more time, more practice, more talent, more depth, more fine-tuning. 
</P>
<P>
 What they really need, of course, is a bye. Till around 1997 would be good. 
</P>
<P>
 But the league office is a stickler about punctuality, and worse yet, it has a 
mean streak as wide as the vacant section on Anaheim Stadium's east side today. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is the league forcing the Rams to go through with this afternoon's 
game, but look at who the schedule-makers have rounded up as the obligatory 
visiting opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 The grumpy old man the Rams could have hired two years ago, when the franchise 
was at the proverbial crossroads, but passed, leaving the franchise to languish 
at the bottom of the proverbial tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams fans don't need this right now. It's enough that they are cold and lonely 
and treated like earthquake victims at social functions and family gatherings. 
You follow the Rams, you say? How awful for you. I'm terribly sorry. Worse 
still, their allegiance is unrequited by an owner who begins this season with 
Bekins, Allied and Mayflower on her personal speed dial. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams fans don't need to be reminded of how Ryan was eminently available in 
January, 1992, when the Rams were looking for a head coach and John Shaw was 
calling around about Buddy. They don't want to hear that Shaw phoned Don Shula, 
Mike Ditka, Norm Braman, Bud Carson and Jimmy Johnson, received mixed reviews, 
was about to press onward and had the background search aborted when Georgia 
Frontiere burst into the room and said she positively could not live without 
Chuck Knox. 
</P>
<P>
 So Knox it was and 11-and-21-and-all-but-out-the-door it has been ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Would it have been any different under Buddy? 
</P>
<P>
 Better, possibly. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 But different, you can bet your unopened season-ticket application on that 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 First off, Buddy would have never tolerated two years of Jim Everett. That 
alone would have made taking a shot with him worth it. Buddy never liked 
Everett much when he coached the Eagles, and as he lobbied for the Rams job 
late in the 1991 season, he crowed that the first thing he'd do would be to 
bring in Jim McMahon and put some pressure on that skinny No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett-McMahon would have been something to see. By September, 1992, 
Everett's crown had slipped, but no one yet was demanding the guillotine. 
Southern California still remembered McMahon as Dan Henning's folly in San 
Diego. The debate would have divided the players, the fans, the media. Tuning 
in to a Rams game every Sunday would be no different than clicking on the WWF. 
</P>
<P>
 This is precisely what Knox strained to avoid in 1992, which is why he propped 
up Everett as his unchallenged No. 1 and kept good soldier Mike Pagel far, far 
in the background. The end result, of course, was everything that Knox had 
feared, a quarterback controversy in 1993 that yielded no winners -- not 
Everett, not T.J. Rubley and certainly not Knox. 
</P>
<P>
 The post-Everett era would have started at least 12 months earlier with Buddy, 
who would have brought in the anti-Everett -- Phil Simms, perhaps, or Steve 
Beuerlein -- and sacrificed the occasional pretty 60-yard spiral for a set of 
gritted teeth in the face of a safety blitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy would have also brought along some of his old die-hards, as he does 
everywhere he roams. You know the names -- they'll be the ones on the backs of 
the red jerseys this afternoon. Seth Joyner. Clyde Simmons. Wilber Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe Richard Dent, or Keith Jackson. Or how about this one: Reggie White. 
Buddy may be bombastic, vain-glorious and a public-relations fiasco with a 
smoking fuse, but you have to like the friends he brings to the training table. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox has his loyalists, too, players who jumped at the chance to follow Coach 
down the coast from Seattle to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, they were named Jeff Chadwick, Travis McNeal, Derek Loville, 
Jim Skow and Blair Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 The ongoing knock on Buddy, of course, is his unblemished record of failure in 
the playoffs. Oh-for-three -- tough to argue with the facts. But Knox hasn't 
won in the postseason since 1984 and the Rams haven't been to a playoff game 
since the 1980s. Knox's most recent postseason appearance, with Seattle, is 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Poll Rams fans today and see if they'd settle for a first-round loss in the 
playoffs come January. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the word on Buddy was that he "wasn't right for Orange County." 
What exactly does that mean? That his teams win more games than they lose? That 
he knows how to draft? That he might curse during a postgame interview or knock 
over the cucumber finger sandwiches at Georgia's kickoff party? 
</P>
<P>
 Given the track records involved -- Buddy's, the Rams', the Angels' -- I 
suspect Orange County would be commissioning crystal statues of Buddy right 
about now. At worst, there would be lines at the ticket windows, as opposed to 
the scene outside Anaheim Stadium Tuesday afternoon, five days before the home 
opener. I spent a half-hour there and witnessed a total of three purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona Cardinals have doubled season-ticket sales, to more than 48,000, 
since the announcement of Buddy's hiring. The Arizona Cardinals, also known in 
previous years as the Rams of the Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Win or lose, lead with the left or with the right, Buddy drags bodies through 
the turnstiles. So what if many of them are the same ones who crane their necks 
at a six-car freeway pileup? They all look the same on the accounting ledger. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy could have been Save the Rams all by himself. Instead, he comes to bury 
them today. Maybe it's a good thing not many Ram fans will be there to see it.

POINT OF VIEW / BOB OATES: THE THREE NATIONAL PASTIMES; MANY AMERICANS WITH 
SPORTS INTERESTS ARE LIKE THIS: THEY WATCH FOOTBALL, READ BASEBALL, RELAX AT 
THE BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the long, lazy days of summer, Californians head for the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a big league activity for most people, comparable with, though in a 
different world from, major league baseball and football. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the warmest days, lifeguards estimate, those swimming or lounging about 
number a million or more on the 31-mile circuit of beaches around Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The water is also a magnet in other states that border the Atlantic and 
Pacific oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Many U.S. residents live near an ocean. Most of the rest live near lakes, 
large or small, or rivers. And travel sources calculate that a lot of these 
individuals -- a good one out of three Americans, more than 80 million -- 
already have spent at least one day at the beach this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fun there, and it's fashionable. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a national pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 In U.S. legends, to be sure, baseball was for years the nation's pastime -- 
but the legends are well out of date. 
</P>
<P>
 Most late-century sports fans, tending toward multiple interests, are partial 
to one or more of three particular kinds of recreation. That is, modern America 
has not one but three national pastimes. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one for viewers, one for readers and one for doers: 
</P>
<P>
 * Pro football is the game that Americans prefer to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 * Baseball is what they like to read about, talk about, argue about -- even 
when the players are on strike. 
</P>
<P>
 * Going to the beach is what they want to do. ON THE SHORE 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, in a summer like this, the place to visit is the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there, scientists say, that life originated. 
</P>
<P>
 The first beings rose from the shore, they say, and, as the centuries rolled 
by, the quick and the lively got about the business of making a living. 
</P>
<P>
 But in their deepest inner consciousness, those surviving never forgot the 
oceans, the lakes, the rivers. On their days off, and especially on vacation 
days, in large numbers, they have customarily gone back to the water. 
</P>
<P>
 And they're still going back. 
</P>
<P>
 In California and Hawaii alone last year, "The Western (lifesaving) Assn. 
reported 163,294,662 beach visitors," Los Angeles' chief lifeguard Bob Buchanan 
said the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 national association count of U.S. beach-goers, Buchanan said, 
reached 267,624,205 -- in a country with a population of 250 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Doing the waterfront has become, clearly, a national pastime -- even though 
few sports fans would pay to watch it, or read about it, and even though, as an 
everyday hobby, it doesn't beat television. Nothing does. Jim Spring, the 
president of Leisure Trends, Inc., whose company researches American 
preferences, has found that TV viewing is still well ahead of any other form of 
entertainment. Reading is second. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, examining his most recent polls, Spring said, "After at-home activities 
that are easy to do, the No. 1 attraction for most Americans is going to the 
water -- or being on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gallup organization directs Leisure Trends polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't ask, 'Do you like golf or swimming?' " Spring said from his office 
in Boulder, Colo. "We ask open-ended questions such as, 'What do you really 
like to do?' " 
</P>
<P>
 And he considers it significant that from coast to coast, most respondents 
continue to volunteer a preference for the beach.  
</P>
<P>
 There's a good reason for that, according to Stephen P. Leatherman, who heads 
the Coastal Research Laboratory at the University of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beach offers a choice of two kinds of recreation, passive or active," he 
said. "You can lie in the sun or play in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't so many options in the mountains." 
</P>
<P>
 Leatherman, professor of geography and marine sciences at Maryland, enjoys 
what has been called one of America's best jobs. He is required to spend much 
of the year visiting the world's beaches, where he studies the interaction 
between people and the shore. 
</P>
<P>
 He has concluded the best beach for vacationers is Grayton Beach on the 
Florida Panhandle, the best for Westerners is Santa Barbara's, the best for 
campers are those in Oregon, and the best for nudists is Black's Beach in 
LaJolla. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest change (in beach-going) in recent years is that there are so many 
more things to do in the water today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be just swimming and surfing. Today there's everything from jet 
skiing, wind surfing and skim boarding to boogie boarding and ocean kayaking." 
</P>
<P>
 Leatherman, known as Dr. Beach to his Maryland students, or sometimes as the 
beach bum professor, prefers oceans to lakes or rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the air," he said. "The salt spray in the ocean air is like an elixir. 
It isn't good for auto bodies, but it's good for human bodies. For one thing, 
it's an allergy-fighter, knocking down things like pollen." 
</P>
<P>
 The sound of the waves is another beach plus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dynamic, ever-changing, mysterious, with an up-and-down crescendo that 
fascinates the average person," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beach, though, sunlight is no longer the principal plus, Leatherman 
cautions. Modern research has identified the sun, in an uncontrolled 
environment, as an enemy -- as a wrinkle-builder that can kill. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go to the beach, I wear a hat, sunglasses, and a high-level (usually 
No. 15) sunscreen," Leatherman said. "I go in the early morning, and I'm back 
by 10:30 or so for a cold shower and lunch, then I read a book till about 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go back out (to the beach) I'm meeting everyone else coming back in." 
</P>
<P>
 All summer, in truth, millions still spend all day in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they're taking more care now," lifeguard Buchanan said. "They're bringing 
more umbrellas and more hats." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, he said, the hot sun hasn't affected beach attendance. There 
seems to be no place else that Americans would rather be. ON THE FIELD 
</P>
<P>
 When choosing a spectator sport, Americans have shown a clear preference for 
one or more of four distinctive athletic values: action, artistry, strategy and 
harnessed violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Not more than one or two of these qualities are typically present in most 
sports. And hardly anything can offer all four. 
</P>
<P>
 Beach-going can't. Wall Street can't. Basketball can't. Jurisprudence can't. 
Baseball can't. Journalism can't. Soccer can't. 
</P>
<P>
 Football can. 
</P>
<P>
 Which accounts, in large part, for football's hold on the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Which didn't just happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Football was invented by Americans, for Americans. It was created in the 
second half of the 19th Century by groups of U.S. soccer players who wanted 
something more stimulating. 
</P>
<P>
 They got it by deliberately, and radically, changing soccer's rules. 
</P>
<P>
 It is of equal importance that major rule changes are still being made -- 
almost every year -- by NFL club owners, whose goal is to maintain the balance 
of artistry, action, strategy and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 And their ongoing attention works. The latest evidence that football has taken 
root as the national pastime for spectators is in the most recent Harris poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Those responding, asked to name their favorite sport, replied: football 31%, 
basketball 19%, baseball 17% -- with nothing else over 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics have suggested in late years that the nation's young people, who 
have a choice these days of so much to do, are beginning to draw away from NFL 
games in favor of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. youngsters in grades 6 through 12, polled in the most recent ESPN-Chilton 
survey on their favorite professional sport, replied: football 40%, basketball 
28%, baseball 18% -- with nothing else over 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Other critics frequently suggest that football is a man's game and that women 
hate it. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't seem to be so either. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent Simmons survey showed that women account for 41% of those 
watching NFL games on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate poll, ESPN-Chilton found that 39.4% of the NFL's female fans 
were more interested in pro football games last year than the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 No other sport showed such an upswing in fan support by either men or women. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, as an American spectacle, boxing alone has challenged pro 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest sports events of this century have been certain heavyweight 
championship fights (Dempsey-Tunney, Louis-Schmeling, Ali-Frazier) and Super 
Bowl games," veteran journalist George Kiseda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there have been only eight or nine such fights, he noted, along with 28 
Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 A Louis-Ali fight, if you could somehow arrange it, would doubtless beat 
anything. In the meantime, there's football. OFF THE FIELD 
</P>
<P>
 The great irony of major league baseball is that although there is so little 
to see, there is so much to say. 
</P>
<P>
 Even many baseball fans concede there is almost no action in a baseball game 
compared with that in basketball, or even football. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the morning after, how it all changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball then becomes, once more, the national pastime -- for readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing in any other sport compares with baseball's box scores, or with, say, 
the written record of the lifetime batting averages of the thousands of big 
leaguers active and gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Babe Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
 People who wouldn't be caught dead at Yankee Stadium remember that Ruth batted 
in the .340s lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 They remember it because they know it's phenomenal for anyone to hit home runs 
as regularly as Ruth did and at the same time bat .340 -- actually .342. 
They've been reading about baseball, and dabbling in baseball's statistics, 
most of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The most familiar number in the American language, in or out of sports, is 
doubtless .300. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of baseball's appeal is in the romance of the numbers," Kiseda said, 
mentioning 20 victories, 100 RBIs, .300 batting averages, 3,000 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball and football numbers, he said, just don't measure up. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in boxing, there's no real way to compare Louis and Ali. In baseball, by 
contrast, you can indefinitely argue player merits statistically. 
</P>
<P>
 It is simple to verify that Henry Aaron's home-run hitting shattered one of 
the most famous numbers in sports, Ruth's 714. But Aaron never hit 50 home runs 
in any year. Ruth hit more than 50 four times -- and once hit 60. Roger Maris 
once hit 61. But in no other year did Maris even hit 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Policinski, who doubles as editor in charge of USA Today sports and 
Baseball Weekly, said, "Every active baseball player takes the field against 
two opponents -- the guy he's playing against and everyone else whoever 
played." 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, that happens in track and field too. But there's a difference in 
baseball, which is a team sport that uniquely grades individual performance in 
as many ways as it measures team achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than any other sport, baseball is about history, about comparisons," 
said baseball fan Bob Costas. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence any change in baseball harms it. And more than that, changes in baseball 
tend to be useless. Given the nature of the game, no new baseball rule can make 
more than a minimal difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The American League's experiment with designated hitters is a transcendent 
mistake precisely because, in a nine-man sport, the DH position can make very 
little difference. 
</P>
<P>
 At too great a cost -- the collapse of so much history. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball's records date far back into the darkness of the 19th Century, when 
the game stood alone as the national pastime -- the descriptive phrase first 
used in 1857, when, according to Cooperstown, N.Y., historians, it was 
suggested by one Fred Ivor-Campbell, a writer in Warren, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivor-Campbell's little game isn't exactly the national pastime these days -- 
until the morning paper hits the sidewalk out front. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the year of a baseball strike, it is. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike has been Page 1 news frequently this summer -- on the news page as 
well as in sports. Indeed, considering that baseball is now wholly without 
action, media coverage has at times been overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 It's almost as if America's three national pastimes had all shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 History and tradition did that -- not designated hitters.

THE HIGH COST OF FAME; ONCE RAIDER ANTHONY SMITH GOT A BIG CONTRACT AND STAR 
STATUS, HE LEARNED THAT EVERYONE WAS SUDDENLY HIS NEW BEST FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a lifetime of climbing, he sits on top of the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 But he sits alone. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lifetime of dreaming, he has realized his fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
 But with them have come nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
 At 27, Anthony Smith has become the leader of the Raiders' defensive line and 
the owner of a new, three-story home high on a Playa del Rey hill, the city 
spread out before him. 
</P>
<P>
 He has gone from poverty to wealth, from obscurity to fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Last winter, he signed a four-year, $7.6-million contract with the Raiders. 
This summer, with the retirement of Howie Long and the release of Greg 
Townsend, Smith, who has 36 sacks in three seasons as a situational player, 
will finally get the starting job he has wanted since becoming a first-round 
draft choice of the Raiders in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 This should be the happiest time of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 So why is this man so disillusioned, so confused, so angry? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that Smith is ungrateful. He knows how far he has come from his home 
in a North Carolina ghetto. He's not looking for sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 A wife, a couple of kids, a few genuine friends and a chance to give back to 
society would suffice. Those would appear to be the most attainable of goals at 
this stage in his life. But they have proved to be the hardest. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has found, as have so many others before him, that happiness does not 
naturally follow wealth and success, that roses come with thorns. 
</P>
<P>
 He has found plenty of friends of both sexes, but few, Smith believes, are 
sincere. Too many are interested only in his fame and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I've seen people react to me, Anthony Smith the Raider, has been 
sickening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only too happy to share in the riches that have come his way, he has been too 
generous, too trusting, naive enough to serve as an easy mark for the city 
slickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've run into women who love the nice cars and the nice salary," Smith said. 
"That's what they're all about. They weren't about the real Anthony Smith. If a 
woman could love me as much for what I don't have as what I do have, I've found 
a good woman. But I have not found that. I have not met that creature yet. And 
right now, I'm not even looking. Right now, I don't even want a family. I'm not 
bitter toward family life. I'm bitter toward the people who have changed my 
attitude about good fortune." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his celebrity status, Smith has found no shortage of outstretched 
arms. But too many come with palms up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cruel," he said. "It's the only thing about my life I despise. This is 
not something that I just dislike. I have grown to despise it. Someone's desire 
to trick me or cheat me out of what I have, that makes me sick. After a while, 
I feel like saying, 'Just take the damn money and leave me alone.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Smith includes in that category everybody from those who have offered to do 
work on his new house to others who have simply come looking for a handout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really need a friend in my life now," he said. "Someone to care about me. 
It's tough to find, either male or female. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish sometimes that I could just go back to being the old me when nobody 
cared if I walked or breathed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got my first (big) paycheck, I started helping people out. Everybody 
came around and got their loans, everybody got their down payments on their 
houses, everybody got their cars. And do you know, not one, not one individual 
has paid me back for anything. My immediate family has asked for nothing. But 
friends of the family, other people I've known, have taken $450,000. That's 
money that I just gave away that I won't get back. That's my lesson, a $450,000 
lesson." 
</P>
<P>
 There was one old friend who really hurt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a guy I grew up with in my hometown (of Elizabeth City) in North 
Carolina," said Smith, declining to identify him. "I've known him for 25 years. 
I brought him home and he stole money from me. He was strung out on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith feels if his career, precarious as it is for a man who risks serious 
injury on every play, should end tomorrow, the ringing at his doorbell would 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The freeloaders) would then tell me, 'You are stupid for doing what you 
did,' " he said. "Yet, as long as I'm able to give, they are willing to 
receive. And that's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The one person Smith knows he can count on, for both friendship and guidance, 
is David (Deacon) Jones, the Hall of Fame defensive lineman (1961-74) and 
long-time Ram star recently voted to the NFL's all-time team. Jones, now an 
analyst on Ram broadcasts, serves as a mentor to Smith for his life both on and 
off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Having been through some of the same problems himself, Jones shakes his head 
knowingly at the problems in Smith's personal life. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. is a tough town to play in," Jones said. "It's a tough town to do 
anything in. This town will swallow you alive. The same people who were coming 
around when I was playing, to see what they could get, are coming around (other 
players) now. Only now, because of the big money involved, they're bringing 
their whole family with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Smith) is a nice young man. So nice, I wonder if he really is a defensive 
end." 
</P>
<P>
 Even his charity work, in which he takes even more pride than he does in his 
accomplishments on the playing field, Smith has been burned. His kindness and 
concern are well known throughout South Central L.A., where he is a familiar 
figure, helping youngsters cope with the stress of daily life. He has devoted 
himself to aiding kids who remind him of his formative years. But when he has 
brought some of them home with him, he has later discovered, on occasion, that 
they have robbed him . 
</P>
<P>
 "After games, I've seen kids on corners and I've taken them home," Smith said. 
"I've taken them to the Raider dinners and tried to make them part of my life, 
only to have them steal from me, take from me." 
</P>
<P>
 But in these instances, Smith is not bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't blame them," he said. "Because those kids are saying to themselves, 
'Well, this is my one time here. I got to get what I can.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Smith has learned another lesson. "You can't allow people in your 
house," he said. "I don't do that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones thinks Smith has adopted the right policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to separate the game and your work from your life," Jones said. 
"You can't be all things to all people. You can't feel sorry for everyone's 
problems. There were poor people long before Anthony Smith came around, and 
there will be poor people long after he is gone. It didn't start with him. If 
you were to help 999,000 poor people, how many would still be left? You've got 
to live your own life. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't take anybody home with you. How many are you going to take? It's 
just going to frustrate you. You work in volume. You work with programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "But your home has got to be your sanctuary. That's where you go to refresh 
yourself. Then, you go out and help the neighborhood. You want to help kids? 
Fine, but there has to be a method to the madness. You've got to find a happy 
medium or you'll go stark raving mad." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when he has followed Jones' advice and worked in the neighborhood, Smith 
has not been able to avoid being hurt -- not because of what any of the kids 
have done to him, but because of what has been done to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give my life to these kids," Smith said, "only to find out a month later, 
two months later, that they are dead. So many drive-by shootings. I can look at 
200 some-odd obituaries from the seven or eight programs I've dealt with. Take 
your pick. All of those kids are special to me." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he gets to the point where he hesitates before getting emotionally 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid I'm going to lose them," Smith explained. "I felt at one time like 
I was bad luck to the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite all the frustrations and heartbreak, Smith isn't about to create a 
moat around his castle and give up on mankind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all," he said. "What I want to do is help people who want to help 
themselves. If someone comes to me needing financial help, the first thing I 
want to know is whether they can pay it back or not. If they can't pay it back, 
I'm not going to worry about it. I'll just give it to them. If they are able to 
pay it back, that's when I'm going to break out a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any organization needing a dollar? If they write me, they've got a dollar. 
I've given to an Amish organization, to a Catholic, Hispanic and Jewish. I went 
when I was the only black guy in there. People say I shouldn't feel my place is 
there. My place is anywhere I can bring a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've grown more this year than I have at any other time in my life. This city 
can chew you up in a minute. But as much bad as this place has, there's more 
good. There's Little Leagues, basketball leagues and football leagues. There's 
schools that are taking the initiative to teach kids how to think as opposed to 
what to think. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot going on that is positive."

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; O'MALLEY ON OUTSIDE LOOKING IN, THANKS TO SELIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask Peter O'Malley, the Dodger owner, to describe his relationship with acting 
Commissioner Bud Selig and he chooses his words as if negotiating a minefield. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask him -- as keeper of the family legacy and the only owner whose income has 
been and continues to be derived solely from baseball -- if he thinks he has 
been properly and respectfully included in the planning and orchestration of 
management's course through this bargaining stalemate and work stoppage, and he 
says of the fading season: 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be very sad if the season is canceled, but I'm not going to blame 
(negotiators) Don Fehr or Dick Ravitch." 
</P>
<P>
 If that points a damning finger in the direction of Selig, there is always 
more to what O'Malley doesn't say than what he does. 
</P>
<P>
 There is always more between the lines. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley cautiously works the minefield, saying: 
</P>
<P>
 "Bud has a very difficult job. He's trying very hard, but he's in an 
impossible position as a stockholder of the Brewers, chairman of the Player 
Relations Committee and acting commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows that for two years I have been pushing for the election of a 
full-time, outside, independent commissioner, but Bud has surrounded himself 
with owners he's very comfortable with. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he were to ask me to join the (negotiating) committee, I'd be happy to 
help. All 28 owners cannot be on the committee, and I agree that a small, 
representative group (Selig chose 12) is the best way to identify a long-term 
agreement enthusiastically embraced by both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 With the season about to go down, the perception is that O'Malley, with more 
to lose, perhaps, than any other owner because of his economic reliance on 
baseball, has been forced to the outside looking in -- and deserves better. 
</P>
<P>
 The perception is that the mystique of National League superiority and the 
power once wielded by his father, Walter -- still in place under Bowie Kuhn -- 
has slowly eroded under Peter Ueberroth, Fay Vincent and now Selig, the 
Milwaukee Brewers' owner. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley addresses the perceptions obliquely. What he says and what he does 
not say is: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Selig has other owners with whom he is more comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their relationship -- seconded by Selig, who also left it at that -- is 
professional, or in other words: distant, detached, dispassionate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Yes, he is on the outside and thinking Selig might be wearing too many hats 
and is too closely tied -- this comes from others -- to Chicago White Sox owner 
Jerry Reinsdorf, the power broker Walter O'Malley once was, and a small-market 
clique comprising Tom Werner of the San Diego Padres, Carl Pohlad of the 
Minnesota Twins and Doug Danforth of the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley was an ally of Selig and Reinsdorf in the push that led to Vincent's 
resignation as commissioner in September of 1992. But it is a measure of his 
disenchantment with the current leadership that he apologized to Vincent for 
that at the recent Three Tenors concert at Dodger Stadium, saying, in effect, 
that if he knew then what he knows now, he wouldn't have joined that effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember exactly what I said, but it was probably words to that 
effect," O'Malley said. "As I've been saying for two years, baseball has needed 
a strong, outside, independent commissioner." 
</P>
<P>
 Where does all of that leave O'Malley now? 
</P>
<P>
 He was co-chairman of the committee that restructured the still vacant 
commissioner's office. He was chairman of the committee that selected Leonard 
Coleman as National League president. He is not on the Player Relations 
Committee, was not one of the 12 owners and club executives selected by Selig 
to meet with the union in New York and is not on Selig's executive council, 
which includes Werner and Pohlad, who are in the process of leaving the game 
but first attempting to increase the value of the clubs they are selling by 
supporting a new compensation system. Nice conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley supports that system. At least publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the scenes, it's a little hazy. Behind the scenes, he seems to be part 
of a high-revenue group attempting to shake up last-ditch support for a 
bargaining compromise and resumption of the season before the Sept. 9 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Angelos of the Baltimore Orioles is part of that movement. The New York 
Yankees and Mets, Toronto Blue Jays and Colorado Rockies are definitely in on 
it, but it might be too late. 
</P>
<P>
 There is widespread anger among the 28 owners regarding the union's refusal to 
respond to the salary-cap proposal. The chance to unilaterally implement may be 
the closest they ever get to total victory over the union. Cancellation of the 
World Series is suddenly a small price to pay for some. 
</P>
<P>
 What's shaking? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," O'Malley said. "I'm not on the committee. Bud has conference 
calls that are nice and polite, but I have no knowledge of what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a sad state complicated by the voting rule that awards power to the small 
and middle markets and has further frustrated the bigs. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one of the 28 clubs have to approve a settlement. This was another coup 
for consensus builder Selig on the lines of 1) delaying election of a 
commissioner so that there would be no interference in the negotiations, 2) 
influencing the big markets to share revenue with the small, 3) maintaining 
owner unanimity in support of the salary-cap proposal that might cancel the 
World Series for the first time, and 4) canceling this week's owners meeting in 
Detroit to thwart the possibility of dissent and a full-scale high-revenue 
attack on the unanimity. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig insists that the voting rule was changed from majority approval of a 
settlement to three fourths because "the clubs unanimously felt there was merit 
to what we were doing" through the salary-cap proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The change was first discussed at a January owners meeting in Florida that 
O'Malley couldn't attend because of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a done deal, he said, by the time he reached Cincinnati for the June 8 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was announced as unanimous, and we'll leave it at that," O'Malley said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added he did not think the voting requirement will be an impediment to 
an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get close to a deal, the overwhelming number of clubs will support it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no indication a deal is close. As the clock ticks away the remaining 
hours of the 1994 season, a disconsolate club executive said the owners and 
players appear to be "jumping off the bridge hand in hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Will O'Malley and Selig be holding hands as they jump? Doubtful. They'll keep 
polite distance as always. Professional to the end. BUILDING BRIDGES 
</P>
<P>
 The informal effort by Jerry McMorris, owner of the Colorado Rockies, to 
establish ongoing communication with the players' union will not produce a 
settlement in itself, but it could be a small first step toward the partnership 
the owners have talked about but never really pursued -- if, in fact, the 
owners and players ever achieve peace. 
</P>
<P>
 'The most appalling and discouraging thing I've encountered in my two years in 
baseball is that I never fathomed that the level of mistrust (between owners 
and players) was so deep," McMorris said. "I mean, it's kind of a mystery to 
me. The players turn over more frequently than the owners, but the seeds of 
distrust keep growing." 
</P>
<P>
 There is continuity to the union leadership, of course, and if it's not Fehr 
reminding the players what they've accomplished through unanimity, it's Marvin 
Miller returning from retirement. It's also the owners continually attempting 
to abridge player rights or withholding a pension payment or colluding against 
free agents, stiffening the players resolve and deepening the mistrust. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all new to McMorris, who runs the nation's largest privately owned 
trucking firm and has never been shut down by a strike or had a union sanction 
filed against him in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Trust, confidence and mutual respect are the keys to that record, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players and owners have to get on the same page economically so that they 
have a selfish reason to pull together," he said. "Of course, if my freight 
handlers threaten a strike, I can walk down the street and find replacements. I 
can't do that with major league ballplayers, and the players know it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies, of course, were headed for another attendance record, and 
McMorris was firmly against revenue sharing if it meant the small markets were 
simply treating it as welfare and not putting it back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 He ultimately decided that increased sharing linked to both a cap and payroll 
floor that forces the small markets to reinvest in players is in the industry's 
best interest, although the Rockies and Florida Marlins, as the new kids, will 
be excused from revenue sharing for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can probably survive under any system," McMorris said of the Rockies. "But 
from a competitive standpoint, we're only as strong as the teams we're playing 
are, and six to eight truly consider themselves to be on a death watch." 
</P>
<P>
 With all of that, McMorris remains a moderate loosely tied to a high-revenue 
coalition that favors compromise and resumption of the season. If the World 
Series goes down, he said, it will be an "embarrassment to everybody in the 
game." He spent four hours with Fehr on Wednesday night looking for a 
conceptual approach that could keep the process alive but came away thinking 
that the union has "stonewalled every attempt" to sustain dialogue on the issue 
of cost certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 His attitude, according to sources, was exemplified by an incident during a 
recent owners' meeting in New York. McMorris was greeted by noted hawk 
Reinsdorf, who said: "Don't you just love all this politics and behind the 
scenes stuff, Jerry?" 
</P>
<P>
 Replied McMorris: "No, Jerry, I'd rather be watching baseball." FREE AGENTS 
</P>
<P>
 There are 192 players who approach the end of the season eligible for free 
agency and no longer sure what that means. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: Jack McDowell, Larry Walker, Gregg Jefferies, Paul O'Neill, Jay 
Buhner, Jim Abbott, Kevin Brown, John Franco, Danny Jackson, John Kruk, Jeff 
Blauser, Bill Swift and 10 Dodgers: Brett Butler, Jim Gott, Kevin Gross, Chris 
Gwynn, Orel Hershiser, Roger McDowell, Cory Snyder, Jeff Treadway, Tim Wallach 
and Mitch Webster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the very best players will still be OK, but there's a lot to be 
worried about because no one knows what system will be in place," veteran agent 
Tom Reich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Players eligible for free agency usually start filing on the day after the 
World Series, but there may not be a World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 If the owners unilaterally implement their new system, salary arbitration 
would be eliminated, directly affecting players who hold free-agent repeater 
rights. If not offered arbitration within five days after the end of the World 
Series, those players become unrestricted free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Unilateral implementation would also change the free-agency rules. Fourth- and 
fifth-year players would become eligible for free agency, but their current 
clubs would have the right of first refusal. A sixth-year player would remain 
an unrestricted free agent.

 MAYBE HE STILL LIKES DISCO AND WEARS BELL BOTTOMS 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best rushes during the UCLA-Tennessee game at the Rose Bowl came 
from a fellow in the stands. One of the best tackles from security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all part of a prank by Gabor Fabian, 21, who paid homage to the '70s by 
streaking during the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabian, who told police he was a UCLA student, was booked on a misdemeanor 
count of trespassing after being captured at the 50-yard line by security 
guards. If convicted, the fine would probably be less than $1,000, said Gary 
Bennett, Pasadena police commander. NOW THIS WAS REALLY GRAPHIC VIOLENCE 
</P>
<P>
 Washington tailback Napoleon Kaufman of Lompoc has become accustomed to people 
misspelling his name. Oftentimes, he will see his first name as "Napolean." 
Saturday, ABC put a new twist into things when the opening kickoff graphic 
showed him as Nepoleon Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
 Wonder how Peter Jinnings would feel about that? IT HAD THE MAKINGS OF THE 
PROBATION BOWL 
</P>
<P>
 The Southeastern Conference opened the 1994 season with two of its finer 
representatives -- Auburn and Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn is serving a two-year NCAA probation for rules violations exposed by 
Eric Ramsey, former Tiger defensive back. Coach Pat Dye, who was football coach 
and athletic director when the scandal broke, resigned after the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, allowed on television for the first time since 1992, defeated 
Mississippi, 22-17. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi is being accused by NCAA investigators of everything from illegal 
booster-funded prospect entertainment to questionable scores on entrance exams. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Billy Brewer, the coach, was fired and Warner Alford, the athletic 
director, resigned the next day. THEY MAKE 11 O'CLOCK NEWS FOR SOMETHING 
POSITIVE 
</P>
<P>
 And down in scandal-plagued Tallahassee, Fla., the Florida State Seminoles 
were quite happy to face a football opponent instead of another in the mounting 
NCAA allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Kanell passed for 330 yards and four touchdowns as the defending 
national champions crushed Virginia, 41-17, although playing without seven 
suspended players, including All-American linebacker Derrick Brooks and three 
offensive linemen who were penalized for accepting illegal gifts from agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the whole team was really excited to get on TV for something other 
than scandal," Kanell said. INTERFERENCE CHARGED IN TEXAS A&M INVESTIGATION 
</P>
<P>
 A Texas A&M football booster who was forced to disassociate from the school 
said officials urged him to stonewall the NCAA's investigation into a summer 
jobs scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Gilbert Jr. told the Dallas Morning News that Coach R.C. Slocum, former 
vice president Robert Smith and others convinced him not to meet with 
investigators. Gilbert said university officials ultimately portrayed him as a 
lone violator of NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas businessman paid nine football players for work they didn't do 
between 1990 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 According to NCAA rules, evidence that school representatives have been 
untruthful during a probe can be grounds to reopen the case and sanction those 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, called the allegations a lie. "There are 
documents showing the efforts of both (Smith) and the school to get this guy to 
cooperate," he said. THIS LOSS LEAVES HIM AT A LOSS FOR WORDS 
</P>
<P>
 From a confused Fisher DeBerry, Air Force coach, after the Falcons lost to 
Colorado State, 34-21: 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense played a heck of a second half, but I don't know what happened to 
them in the first half." 
</P>
<P>
 And: 
</P>
<P>
 "Our offense moved the ball in the first half, but I don't know what happened 
to them in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, then, who does? OREGON CAN'T LIVE UP TO THIS PREGAME HYPE 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Brooks, Oregon's coach, used to be a UCLA assistant. So, it is apropos 
that he was sounding like the Bruins' Terry Donahue before the mighty Ducks met 
the Vikings of Portland State. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brooks: "It could be disastrous. I mean, if we lose, it's all over. We'll 
be crucified. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not as big a difference as people think between the top quality 
Division II teams and the Division I teams. If we don't play well, Portland 
State will come down and hand us our lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon 58, Portland State 16. MASCOT DIES AFTER RUNNING INTO WALL 
</P>
<P>
 While former mascot riders were in the stands celebrating their 40th reunion, 
Texas Tech's mascot, a black quarterhorse named Double T, died during the Red 
Raiders' game against New Mexico at Lubbock, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 The horse threw its rider, Amy Smart, ran across the playing field and slid 
head-first into a cement wall. STARTING FROM SCRATCH IN FOOTBALL'S HINTERLAND 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Walton, former New York Jet coach, returned to the sidelines as Robert 
Morris -- a school, not a player -- won its inaugural football game with a 
24-19 victory over Waynesburg in Waynesburg, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 The business college in Corapolis, Pa., took 73 years to start a football 
program. It took Walton a New York minute to accept the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Since losing his job as offensive coordinator for the Pittsburgh Steelers in 
1991, Walton, 58, was doing public relations for a moving company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting bored," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he has little time to waste in starting up the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started, we had no chin straps, no tape, nothing," Walton said of the 
Division 1-AA non-scholarship program. HE THREW IN A SURPRISE FOR HIS COLLEGE 
DEBUT 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Henning is another NFL refugee -- and there are many in the college ranks 
today -- who made his debut with the '94 season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Henning's Boston College team led No. 12 Michigan, 12-0, before the Wolverines 
rallied for a 36-24 victory before 105,936 -- the largest crowd to watch Boston 
College play. 
</P>
<P>
 Henning is enjoying his new status as college coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the pros, you walk on eggs, worried about upsetting high-priced players," 
said the former coach of the San Diego Chargers and Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 Henning's team came out throwing like the pros with a big play in the first 16 
seconds that led to a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 When was the play selected? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was between the continental breakfast and the pregame meal," 
Henning said. IT HAS BEEN A GAME OF CHANCE ALL THIS TIME 
</P>
<P>
 Football simply is a big guessing game, said Johnny Majors of Pitt, who became 
the fifth active coach to participate in 300 games. 
</P>
<P>
 After calling for an ill-fated pass on a two-point conversion that could have 
tied No. 19 Texas in a 30-28 loss, Majors said: 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have made a lot of calls there, but what might have worked there 
we'll never know." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, that's something we knew. NOTEWORTHY

SEASON ENDS ABRUPTLY FOR COLQUITT; VOLUNTEERS: QUARTERBACK SUFFERS TORN KNEE 
LIGAMENT AFTER WAITING FIVE YEARS TO BECOME A STARTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Colquitt waited five years to become Tennessee's starting quarterback, 
but his season lasted only seven plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Colquitt tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee when his leg 
stuck in the turf after after he was hit by UCLA free safety Paul Guidry in the 
Volunteers' season-opening 25-23 loss to UCLA Saturday at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was there when it happened, and when he was on the ground I saw a look of 
pain on his face," Tennessee tight end David Horn said. "He got back up and was 
going to get in the huddle. I knew it had to be something serious for him to go 
out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Peyton Manning also was shocked. 
</P>
<P>
 'I can't believe that happened," he said. " That's the worst thing I can 
imagine, because Jerry's the hardest-working guy on this team and nobody 
deserves success more than he does." 
</P>
<P>
 His left leg in a plastic splint, Colquitt hobbled onto the field on crutches 
at the the start of the second half. With a look of disgust, he took a seat on 
the Tennessee bench as TV cameramen and newspaper photographers engulfed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the worst thing in the world for Jerry to go down," backup 
quarterback Todd Helton said. "Quarterbacks are like a small family, and for 
him to go, it was awful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was expecting to play a few series at most, and when he went down it was a 
shock to us all. It was hard rebounding, but we knew what we had to do and we 
tried to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Colquitt left the Rose Bowl and went back to the team hotel with his father to 
escape the media and was not available for comment after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer tried to console Colquitt at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just went in at halftime and hugged his neck and told him how sorry I was 
and that we all loved him," Fulmer said. "And I do love him. He had been 
tremendously patient. It's a tragedy, it really is." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA quarterback Wayne Cook, who suffered a season-ending knee injury in the 
Bruins' season-opening win over Cal State Fullerton in 1992, can empathize with 
Colquitt. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in his first start 
at UCLA and missed the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel for the guy," Cook said. "I know what he's going through. It's sad. I 
didn't see him after the game, but I'd tell him to rehab hard and you can come 
back as good as new." 
</P>
<P>
 Colquitt's injury disrupted Tennessee's offense as the 13th-ranked Volunteers 
fell behind, 18-0. Tennessee used three other quarterbacks after Colquitt was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton replaced Colquitt, but he was unable to generate any offense and Fulmer 
employed freshmen Branndon Stewart and Manning, whose father, Archie, played 
quarterback for the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Manning and Stewart were among the nation's most highly recruited 
players, they too were unable to get anything going and Fulmer put Helton back 
into the game with 13:06 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton engineered two touchdown drives to rally the Volunteers to 18-16. He 
completed three consecutive passes for a total of 45 yards to set up fullback 
Mose Phillips' one-yard touchdown run with 11:12 remaining. He then connected 
with flanker Billy Williams on the two-point conversion pass to cut UCLA's lead 
to 18-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Courtney Epps on 
Tennessee's next series and connected with split end Joey Kent on a two-point 
conversion pass to make it 18-16. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Helton may have cost Tennessee the game when he turned over the ball 
on the Volunteers' next series. UCLA linebacker Donnie Edwards intercepted a 
Helton pass at the Tennessee 33 to set up Daron Washington's 30-yard touchdown 
run three plays later. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was my fault all the way," Helton said. "One of the rules is when you're 
scrambling, don't thrown back across the field, and I broke the rule."

NEWSWIRE: KIDD SIGNS WITH MAVERICKS FOR $60 MILLION

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dallas Mavericks signed guard Jason Kidd to a nine-year, $60-million 
contract Saturday, hailing it as a gift to the city that for two years has had 
the worst team in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd, 21, was the first of the top eight 1994 draft choices to sign. He was 
selected second overall in the June draft after playing two seasons for 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The team would not divulge the contract's worth. But the 6-foot-4 Kidd, when 
asked about reports the deal was worth $60 million, said, "It's close." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks, with only a total of 24 victories in the last two seasons, said 
the contract forced them to renounce their rights to unrestricted free-agent 
forwards Tony Campbell and Randy White and guard Fat Lever. Auto Racing

 Race car driver Ernie Irvan advanced another step in his recovery from last 
month's crash when doctors at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich., 
upgraded his condition from serious to fair. Irvan suffered a brain injury and 
bruised lungs when his car slammed into a wall during practice at Michigan 
International Speedway on Aug. 20.

 Mark Martin scored the fifth victory in his last five starts at Darlington 
Raceway when he won the rain-shortened Gatorade 200 at Darlington, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Jarrett finished second, followed by Mike Wallace. Martin took the lead 
on lap 8 and held it for 102 of the next 104 laps before rain brought the race 
to a close after 111 of the scheduled 147 laps. 
</P>

 Robby Gordon earned the pole position for today's Vancouver Molson-Indy ahead 
of Nigel Mansell and Michael Andretti. Gordon's best lap was 109.049 m.p.h.

 Michael Jordan went hitless in four at-bats Saturday night, striking out twice 
to finish the season with a .202 average for the double-A Birmingham Barons. 
Jordan didn't start Friday night to ensure that his average would remain above 
.200. 
</P>
<P>
 After suffering a sprained left rotator cuff diving for a fly ball, Jordan 
went 12 for 40 (.300) over the final three weeks of the Southern League season. 
Jordan, who struck out 114 times in 436 at-bats, hit three home runs and drove 
in 51 runs. He stole 30 bases in 48 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons' parent team, the Chicago White Sox, have petitioned the Arizona 
Fall League to let Jordan join the Scottsdale Scorpions for the season that 
runs from Oct. 6 to Dec. 1.

 Yashin, 20, is entering the second year of a five-year contract worth $4 
million. He wants $14 million for the final four years of the deal after 
leading the Senators with 30 goals and 79 points as a rookie.

 The NHL is investigating former Hartford Whaler coach Pierre McGuire over a 
possible breach of contract, according to the Ottawa Citizen. The investigation 
followed protests by the Whalers that their former coach might have breached 
his contract in testifying for the Edmonton Oilers in an arbitration hearing. 
McGuire, now a part-time pro scout with the Ottawa Senators, denied any 
wrongdoing. Soccer

 U.S. national team midfielder John Harkes said it was an "insult" for 
England's Football Assn. to have offered the U.S. soccer team a $25,000 bonus 
if the Americans win their game against England at Wembley Stadium on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The remark came amid reports in an English newspaper that officials from the 
U.S. Soccer Federation and the F.A. were trading barbs over the origination of 
the bonus idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we need to be offered some cash sum to come out and play," said 
Harkes. "I think it's more or less an insult for us to be offered money." 
</P>
<P>
 When the F.A. announced the bonus last week, it said the money was an 
incentive for the Americans to make the game more competitive, adding that the 
bonus idea came from U.S. officials. That claim was denied by USSF spokesman

DUCKS HAVE THEIR TEAM IN A ROW FOR CAMP; HOCKEY: WITH KEY PLAYERS SIGNED, 
ANAHEIM CAN FOCUS ON PREPARING TO MOVE UP IN THE PACIFIC DIVISION STANDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With one black cloud pushed aside by the signing of Paul Kariya, and another 
looming on the horizon in the form of a possible lockout, the Mighty Ducks 
assemble today for the opening of training camp at The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 Players will pose for pictures, take physicals and meet new teammates, 
including Kariya. The taxing stuff won't begin until 11 a.m. Monday, when the 
Ducks conduct three, two-hour practice sessions that are open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday marks Kariya's first appearance on Pond ice, although it's uncertain 
which session he will participate in. Kariya, who said he was ecstatic to have 
signed a three-year contract worth $6.5 million, became a Duck 14 months after 
he was drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 With Coach Ron Wilson, General Manager Jack Ferreira and Assistant General 
Manager Pierre Gauthier predicting great things from Kariya, there is a 
heightened sense of excitement in camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's skill level, spotty last season, has increased dramatically, and 
not only because of Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks bolstered their defense by acquiring Tom Kurvers from the New York 
Islanders and Robert Dirk from the Chicago Blackhawks and signing rookies 
Nikolai Tsulygin, a second-round pick in 1993, and Oleg Tverdovsky, a 
first-round pick in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 And they signed winger Valeri Karpov, their third-round pick in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Kariya's signing marks a turning point in the young franchise's 
history. This week the Ducks will see whether they have the second coming of 
Wayne Gretzky or merely a younger Lonnie Loach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guys can step on the ice and in three shifts they can adjust to the 
competition," Ferreira said. "Paul has that type of ability." 
</P>
<P>
 Dismissing the notion the Ducks were determined to hold down costs and were 
unwilling to part with big bucks to sign an untested rookie, Ferreira said: "We 
have an obligation to put the best product on the ice." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, presumably daydreaming for 14 months about what to do with Kariya once 
he was in the fold, can't wait to team the Canadian Olympian with Anatoli 
Semenov. The third member of the line will most likely be a grinder such as 
Garry Valk or Todd Ewen. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is not overly concerned about Kariya's defensive skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got the puck all the time," Wilson said, smiling. "Who needs to worry 
about defense? Isn't that the logic with Wayne Gretzky?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gauthier: "He's going to be a great player." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the newcomers are enough to send the Ducks to the playoffs in only 
their second season remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they -- and other NHL teams -- make it through training camp without 
being locked out also remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 The players have been without a collective bargaining contract since Sept. 15, 
1993, and Commissioner Gary Bettman last week received authorization from the 
league's Board of Governors to shut down camps if negotiations aren't 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, Bettman began a rollback of training camp benefits, prompting NHL 
Players Assn. Director Bob Goodenow to say, "It's a blatant economic attack on 
the players." 
</P>
<P>
 The regular season is scheduled to begin Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here are Wilson's comments on the Pacific Division: 
</P>
<P>
 "Vancouver has the most talent. They may struggle with their success in the 
playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Possibly the most improved team is Edmonton. They improved their talent and 
size. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (San Jose) Sharks will struggle to do what they did last year. Signing 
(Viktor) Kozlov (sixth overall pick in the 1993 draft) adds talent. But others 
need to step forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Kings can't possibly have as bad a season as last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (Calgary) Flames should be strong again. (Defenseman) Al MacInnis and 
(goalie) Mike Vernon are gone (to St. Louis and Detroit). They're relying on 
really young goaltending and they could stumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're improved." 
</P>
<P>
 So, is reaching the playoffs a realistic goal for the Ducks, who were 33-46-5 
last season? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is if we can improve 10 points," Wilson said.

COSTA MESA FULLBACK IS TEAM'S FRANCHISE; FOOTBALL: IN ONE YEAR, CRENSHAW, ALSO 
A STANDOUT DEFENSIVE END, HAS ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS PERHAPS THE LEAGUE'S BEST 
TALENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 DeWayne Crenshaw looks back on the incident now and laughs easily. 
</P>
<P>
 He was recalling his oft-repeated comment during Costa Mesa's Pacific Coast 
League title run last year, when he said, "We own Century" in anticipation of 
the following week's game and clinching the PCL championship. Instead, Costa 
Mesa escaped with a 7-7 tie -- the only blemish on its first outright league 
title in 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'll ever say anything like that again," Crenshaw said. "I run 
track, too, and Century has a couple of real fast guys. They said, 'Are you the 
one who said you own Century?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'I guess I am.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And they said, 'Here's a payback.' 
</P>
<P>
 "They really toasted me in the 100 (meters). I learned to keep it to myself." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been a lot of learning experiences for Crenshaw. As a troubled 
student at Edison who missed football his sophomore year because he was 
academically ineligible, he moved to Costa Mesa and has blossomed as a student 
and an athlete. Mustang Coach Myron Miller paid him some attention and helped 
him become eligible to play football, and Crenshaw has established himself as, 
arguably, the league's best talent. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time he carried the ball for Costa Mesa, he rushed for a 44-yard 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has raw power, tremendous power," Miller said. "He can power-clean 265 
pounds and he weighs 195. He can full-squat 400 pounds. He can vertically jump 
39 inches. He just has tremendous power." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, in one year, established himself as franchise player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had two kids transfer in last year (Crenshaw and Charles Chatman) and they 
made the difference between a 6-4 team and losing in the first round of the 
playoffs, at best, to playing for the section title," Miller said. "No one 
could do on both sides of the ball what DeWayne could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, a fullback, rushed 121 times for 930 yards last year. And when he 
played defense, he scared quarterbacks, recording 13 1/2 sacks from his 
defensive end position. 
</P>
<P>
 He also made his teammates better. Binh Tran was more effective his senior 
year, Miller said, because defenses had to be wary of Crenshaw. Tran rushed for 
2,303 yards. Together, Tran and Crenshaw combined for 3,233. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the raw power that Miller is so impressed with, Crenshaw also 
has a high tolerance for pain and a relentless attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Miller even holds Crenshaw out of some practice drills "because he 
does everything in practice full speed and it's dangerous to the other 
players." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw admits to one weakness, though. He doesn't catch the ball well, but 
if defenses can't catch him when he has the ball, it might not matter. 
</P>
<P>
 When he arrived from Edison, Crenshaw had completed a semester in which he 
received five Fs and a D on his report card, Miller said. Since then, his GPA 
has risen to the 2.3 to 2.5 range. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he came from the other school, I don't think he saw himself as a college 
athlete," Miller said. "Now I think he sees himself as a college athlete and 
he's very motivated." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, he is. He has received letters from San Diego State, Colorado, 
Washington and USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go to college," Crenshaw said. "When I first came to Costa Mesa (as 
a sophomore), everything was going bad for me -- things were pretty bad at home 
and at school. Coach (Miller) took me in. He showed some interest in me. 
</P>
<P>
 "He helped me get through my whole year and showed me that school was easier 
than I thought it was. Socially, it's easier to talk to people than I thought 
it was. And if you sit down and study, do your work and go to class, you can 
pass -- it's not that hard."

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; SHARPE LEAVES PACKERS -- THROUGH 
REVOLVING DOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sterling Sharpe staged one of the shortest walkouts in NFL history Saturday, 
leaving the team early in the day and then changing his mind hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe, the NFL's leading wide receiver the last two years, initially said he 
would sit out the season because he is dissatisfied with his present contract. 
</P>
<P>
 But he changed his mind a short while later and said he would play today in 
the season-opener against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Mike Holmgren said a representative of Sharpe and Packer financial 
officer Mike Reinfeldt reached accord after resuming talks. Details of the 
agreement were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is I talked to him this afternoon," Holmgren said Saturday night. 
"We had a good conversation. I was able to hook him up again with Mike 
Reinfeldt and Sterling's representative. . . . They got it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe was dissatisfied with terms of a 10-year deal he signed in 1991 worth 
at least $15.5 million. Including incentives, he was to earn about $2 million 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Saturday, Packer General Manager Ron Wolf said that weeklong efforts 
to satisfy Sharpe's contract demands had reached an impasse. Wolf said Holmgren 
was prepared to play the opener "and the remainder of the 1994 season without 
Sterling Sharpe," who caught an NFL record 112 passes last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe would have forfeited one-seventeenth of his $1.3-million base salary, 
or $76,471, every week he sat out. Presumably, Sharpe would like his contract 
to be in line with the Packers' highest-paid players. Quarterback Brett Favre, 
defensive ends Reggie White and Sean Jones and tackle Ken Ruettgers are paid 
more than Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receivers who make more than Sharpe are San Francisco's Jerry Rice (about 
$3 million), Tim Brown of the Raiders ($2.75 million), Denver's Anthony Miller 
($2.6 million) and New Orleans' Michael Haynes ($2.5 million). 
</P>

<P>
 The Minnesota Vikings re-signed former USC quarterback Sean Salisbury and 
waived 1989 Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware. 
</P>
<P>
 Salisbury, a former Trojan who was cut by Houston on Friday, will back up 
starter Warren Moon and Brad Johnson when the Vikings open at Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Salisbury split time as Minnesota's starter the last two seasons, in 1992 with 
Rich Gannon and in 1993 with Jim McMahon. The Vikings were prepared to make him 
their starter this season, but when he didn't immediately accept their 
$1.5-million contract offer, they broke off talks and traded for Moon instead.

MAJOR CHANGES IN THE MINORS; NEVER A DULL MOMENT ON BASEBALL'S NEWEST FRONTIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Step aside, Tim Fortugno. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the Cincinnati Reds' reliever has lived with the ignominious fact 
that as a minor leaguer he was traded for a gross of baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
 At long last, Fortugno may live it down. Dave Maloney, general manager of the 
independent Beaumont, Tex., Bullfrogs of the first-year Texas-Louisiana League, 
last month traded three-dozen baseballs and a 35-inch bat for a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 This undoubtedly qualifies as wondrous news for Fortugno and Maloney, but not 
necessarily for Zack Raney of San Francisco, the pitching chattel in question. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Raney) had the 10th-lowest earned-run average in the league," Maloney said, 
gloating openly. "It was a great trade." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheel and deal, scratch and claw. Independent teams like the Bullfrogs, 
seeking a place in the minor-league milieu, are doing whatever it takes and 
then some to remain afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating without funding from major league organizations, independents are 
breaking out the bells and whistles in an effort to fill the stands. In many 
regions, legions of fans are turning out to view the offbeat, novel product. 
</P>
<P>
 For independent players, the leagues mean, well. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Never a dull moment," said Pete Kuld, a Chatsworth High graduate who plays in 
the independent Northern League. 
</P>
<P>
 Independents are an amalgamation, a hybrid. The Valley region could soon join 
the independent fray if the proposed Golden State League, which hopes to place 
a team in the Antelope Valley, comes to fruition next summer as organizers 
plan. According to reports, as many as nine independent leagues may be 
operational by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine leagues staffed by players with nine lives. Independent players, often as 
not, are hoping for one last shot at climbing an organizational tree. It begins 
in the independent bushes, where for many, it will end. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuld is an independent graybeard at age 28. But experience must count for 
something, right? 
</P>
<P>
 A catcher for the Thunder Bay, Ont., Whiskey Jacks, Kuld has walloped 26 
homers to obliterate the league record of 17 set in 1970, during the league's 
first incarnation. In fact, he has broken the minor-league short-season record 
and still has one game remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as any player, he personifies what the independent Northern League is 
all about: Reclamation and rejuvenation. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, fans buying tickets to see a minor-league affiliate are watching 
players on the ascent. The majority of those in the independent ranks have been 
jettisoned or bypassed because they didn't make an affiliated team's 
organizational grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuld played in four organizations and reached double-A with San Diego, Oakland 
and Texas. Yet he never played in more than 75 games in a season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I was never given a real opportunity in minor-league ball," he said. 
"I'm wearing this uniform because I still want to play in the major leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Kuld hit .228 for the Texas Rangers' double-A affiliate in Tulsa and 
was released on April 1, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 When he signed with Cleveland in 1987 after his junior season at Pepperdine, 
Kuld gave himself five years to make it to the majors. The itinerary has been 
severely modified. The ticket to the bigs is now open-ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can put this uniform on every day, I'll keep running around until they 
say I can't play anymore or my body breaks down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A break of a different sort would be welcome news. Independent players hope to 
be spotted by a big league organization, which sometimes will purchase the 
player's contract and breathe new life into an inert career. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuld has heard whispers that scouts from a couple of organizations, in dire 
need of help behind the plate, might be interested in his services. Nothing 
concrete, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Other career paths end here. Former Dodger Pedro Guerrero, who plays for the 
Northern's Sioux Falls (S.D.) Canaries, also wants to be picked up by a big 
league club. The free-spending Guerrero, who pays for his own plane tickets in 
lieu of taking the team bus, said he might be the only guy in pro ball who's 
paying for the privilege of playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Not necessarily. Northern League players earn an average monthly salary of 
$1,000, which doesn't go far, even in the Dakotas. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time you pay rent, food and all the things you need to survive, we're 
all paying to play," Kuld said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuld isn't the only area player who is making noise in a last-ditch effort to 
catch on. Mike Hankins, a Simi Valley High graduate, is playing at one of the 
northernmost pro outposts on the continent -- Winnipeg, Ont. 
</P>
<P>
 His batting average is among the northernmost, too. Hankins, an infielder for 
the Winnipeg Goldeyes who played triple-A ball for the New York Yankees, led 
the Northern League in hitting for much of the summer. Hankins is batting .326, 
third-best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Farlow's playing career began with a bang when he was chosen City 
Section 4-A Division player of the year as a sophomore at Kennedy High in 1985. 
Farlow, 25, a shortstop who played in the San Diego farm system, is in his 
second season at Sioux City of the Northern and is batting .276 with eight 
homers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have rookies who didn't get picked in the draft and they're hungry," said 
Farlow, a member of Cal State Fullerton's 1990 College World Series team. "Then 
you have guys like me, who had our taste of organized ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just out here to have fun and win a championship. We're here because we 
love the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Morales, 23, was one of the unwanted. Morales, a right-handed pitcher 
from Cal State Northridge, missed his senior year because of elbow problems in 
'93. Scouts were predictably disinterested. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales (2-1, 3.72) plays for St. Paul of the Northern League. Former 
Northridge teammate Greg Shockey, released by the Minnesota Twins, is batting 
.316 for Duluth-Superior of the Northern. Duluth-Superior's Mark Skeels, a 
catcher from Thousand Oaks, is batting .210. 
</P>
<P>
 Whle the independent ranks often represent the last outpost of baseball 
opportunity, there are reasons for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Infielder David Waco, a Chatsworth High graduate who played at UC Santa 
Barbara, is one of approximately 40 players who have used the Northern League 
as a stepping stone to affiliated baseball. Waco, 24, played alongside Guerrero 
last summer at Sioux Falls before he signed with the Philadelphia Phillies in 
the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Waco, for one, thinks the Northern compares favorably with affiliated Class-A 
leagues, including the South Atlantic, where Waco started the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was terrific," Waco said of his Northern experience. "The 
ballparks were great, the competition was good and so were the fans. I had a 
blast." 
</P>
<P>
 He hit a few blasts, too, a storied part of Waco's wild independent ride. 
Sioux Falls staged a promotion last year in which a grand slam hit during a 
predetermined inning meant a new car for a lucky fan. Waco came to bat with the 
bases loaded in the long-ball inning and turned to Guerrero, who was on deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going deep," Waco said. 
</P>
<P>
 He did, but the guy who won the $15,000 car didn't exactly dig deep to show 
his gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't give me squat," Waco groused. "The next day, he drove right by me. 
He practically ran over me." 
</P>
<P>
 Waco's reward came later. He earns $1,200 a month at Class-A Clearwater, Fla., 
roughly twice his salary in the Northern, he said. He is batting .322 with 24 
RBIs in 87 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 To say the least, independents are using every promotional trick in the book 
to put bodies in the stands. Former big-leaguers like Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd, 
Leon Durham and Guerrero dot Northern League rosters, but the real theatrics 
are saved for between innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northern's franchise in St. Paul, which boasts comedian Bill Murray as a 
part-owner, has a trained pig that brings baseballs to home plate. And you 
thought Schottzie was a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty famous pig," Kuld said, sarcastically. "It comes out and 
(messes up) the field and it's really great." 
</P>
<P>
 Predictable fare from team President Mike Veeck, son of the late Bill Veeck, 
who staged a few promotional doozies in his time. At Sioux Falls, players throw 
balls at the headlights of an auto from 90 feet. If a player shatters a 
headlight, a fan wins cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The spotlight, obviously, is on entertainment -- particularly since 
independents can trot out few legitimate big league prospects. So they dazzle 
'em with trinkets, baubles and atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this level, it's 90% promotion," Maloney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing beats the stunt pulled by the Sioux City Explorers of the independent 
North Central League, though.  
</P>
<P>
 In mid-summer, CBS talk show host David Letterman sent one of his neighbors 
from New York City, Mujibur Rahman, on a tour across the heartland. Somehow, 
Letterman's producers talked the Explorers into allowing Rahman to suit up. 
</P>
<P>
 He not only wore the uniform for one game, he was named starting pitcher, even 
though he'd never played ball in his life. Sioux City bullpen coaches gave him 
a crash course in pitching. When the starters trotted to their positions, 
Rahman, completely bewildered, ran to first base. 
</P>
<P>
 Redirected, he threw one pitch -- to the backstop screen -- and was mercifully 
relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 Maloney, who worked for the proposed Golden State League for six months before 
taking over Beaumont's front office in June, pulled a headline-grabbing stunt 
last month. Maloney scattered 750 baseballs across the outfield before a game 
and lined up 250 fans on each foul line. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere in the outfield grass was a ball autographed by Beaumont Manager 
Charley Kerfeld. The whistle blew and a frenetic free-for-all ensued. A 
17-year-old boy who found the autographed ball received a half-carat diamond 
pendant. Nice haul. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he gave it to his mom," Maloney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moms, dads, sons, daughters . . . and geezer relievers? 
</P>
<P>
 Former big league relief ace Juan Berenguer, 39, is player-coach for the 
Minneapolis Loons and leads the independent North Central League in saves with 
20. Imagine Berenguer walking to the mound to make a pitching change -- while 
wearing a mitt.  
</P>
<P>
 It lends new meaning to the coaching phrase, "Gimme the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 For Mike Teich, the credo was more like, "Give me a chance." Teich took a 
flyer on a league that didn't yet exist. 
</P>
<P>
 A left-handed pitcher, Teich was released by the Pittsburgh Pirates' 
organization after 12 appearances in 1993, despite a respectable ERA of 3.50 
and a 1-0 record. Late last spring, he got a call from Jason Felice, who like 
Teich attended El Camino Real High. 
</P>
<P>
 Felice was player-coach of a team in the first-year Great Central League, and 
he asked Teich to join. Teich agreed and became a member of the Regina 
Cyclones, one of two Canadian entries in the six-team Great Central, another 
independent league. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada, eh? Truth be told, Teich wasn't sure where he was going and couldn't 
even recall the name of the league when first asked by his father. He didn't 
know Saskatchewan from Sasquatch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew nothing about (the league)," Teich said. "A guy called, gave me the 
information, and I said, 'Why not?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I went into it totally blind." 
</P>
<P>
 He and his mates have opened some eyes in the league, which pays players 
around $1,000 a month, Teich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teich's teammates at Regina include former Birmingham High standout Danny 
Larson and Master's College pitcher Mike Smith.  
</P>
<P>
 Larson ranks second in the league in batting at .333 and Smith is second in 
victories with seven. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Felice hit a pair of homers in the season opener and leads the 
circuit with 15. He may be the hottest hitter in pro ball. Over 29 games of the 
second half, he has 12 homers and 50 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Felice, 32, is leading the league in the triple-crown categories with six 
games left. His closest competition comes from teammate Dennis Hood, who is 
right on his tail in batting average. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'll bench him," said Felice, who hopes to pursue a career as a 
manager. "I'll rig it so I win." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody from Regina's 22-man roster has been picked up by an affiliated club.  
</P>
<P>
 That's OK with Teich, an assistant baseball coach at Agoura High who will 
continue working toward a degree at Cal State Northridge at season's end. 
Unlike many in the independent ranks, he's actually looking ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the guys want to hook on, but I never really looked at it that way," 
said Teich, who is 5-2 with an earned-run average of 3.81. "I was just looking 
for something fun for the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Independent ball has been a hoot for players and fans alike in dozens of 
instances.  
</P>
<P>
 While the Northern has been the runaway winner in terms of notoriety and 
attendance, the eight-team Texas-Louisiana also has fared well.  
</P>
<P>
 The franchise in Mobile, Ala., has averaged a robust 3,105 and six of eight 
teams are averaging 1,400 or better nightly. Beaumont, the team Maloney was 
hired to resuscitate, is averaging 760. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's the heat. Beaumont is about 30 miles from the sweltering Gulf of 
Mexico. Such are the outposts of independent ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know it's humid when you step out of an air-conditioned car and your 
glasses fog up immediately," said Maloney, who worked for the San Diego Padres 
for 21 years. "You know it's humid when it's 95 degrees and raining." 
</P>
<P>
 The independent barometer fluctuates wildly in many respects. Some leagues 
aren't exactly noted for their first-class accommodations.  
</P>
<P>
 The Ohio-based Frontier League, in its second year, evidently is as Spartan as 
the name implies. 
</P>
<P>
 Said former Frontiersman Travis Barbary, who now plays for an affiliated team: 
"In the Frontier we had to drive our own cars. You were supposed to get money 
for gas, but they gave us coupons for Hardee's or something like it." Road 
hotels, which included a fraternity house, were "horrible . . . just terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 All things considered, life in the wild Frontier still beat the alternative: A 
9-to-5 job. Barbary's independent brethren undoubtedly would concur. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things like that made everyone pull together," Barbary said. "It was really, 
really fun. I had a great time."

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREVIEW; SYLMAR MIXES CONTROVERSY WITH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Sylmar High football. 
</P>
<P>
 The giant of the Valley Pac-8 Conference. Unbeaten in 32 consecutive league 
games over the past four seasons. City Section 4-A semifinalists the past 
three. The 4-A champion in 1992. Outscored league opponents, 333-40, last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar was placed on probation last year after Coach Jeff Engilman conducted 
an illegal practice on a holiday. The program is facing more disciplinary 
action for participating in an informal summer passing scrimmage against Pierce 
College, a violation of City rules. And what about those six transfers Sylmar 
will have this season? Are they all there legally? 
</P>
<P>
 A team that has enjoyed extraordinary success, emersed in scandal and 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Who better to comment on Sylmar's operation than the coaches that must face 
the powerhouse year after year? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really hard to say, because I like Jeff as a person," said Fred Cuccia, 
who has taken over the Monroe program after five seasons at Poly. "I think 
there are some things that are a little dark. . . . It's a little shady." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuccia's peers echo his sentiment almost verbatim. But one must wonder if 
Valley Pac-8 coaches are reserving harsher comment for fear of the retribution 
-- like, perhaps, in a few weeks when their team must face the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like making comments -- and (then again) I don't," Van Nuys Coach 
George Engbrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is certain, every coach is sure to choose his words carefully before 
commenting about Engilman and his program. 
</P>
<P>
 Most coaches are more upset with the leniency of the City Section than the 
teams that take advantage -- knowingly or otherwise -- of its vague guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent Sylmar scandal, Engilman said he did not realize that an 
informal scrimmage against a college team was a violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the incident, Barbara Fiege, the City Section Commissioner, 
issued a memorandum to all City schools advising that ignorance of a rule will 
not be tolerated as a defense. A committee will rule on Sylmar's violation 
Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one coach suggests that Sylmar should be banned from the playoffs 
this season for its latest infraction. Yet others would opt for leniency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm willing to bet that several coaches unknowingly have committed rules 
violations," North Hollywood Coach Gary Gray said. "I believe Jeff in this 
situation. I've (violated the rules) and didn't know it -- and I admit it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Engbrecht, who is in his third season at Van Nuys: "I don't think the 
district has the finances to investigate, and because of that, a lot of schools 
cut the edges on a number of rules. The problem is that coaches in general 
don't feel supervised." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar, of course, is not the only school to violate the rules. Taft Coach 
Troy Starr was under fire recently for recruiting junior high prospect Dante 
Clay, who is enrolled at North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 As was the case with Starr, City officials often look to school administrators 
of the offending team or coach to prescribe punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It always helps if you have an administration that believes that football is 
a very strong part of the school itself," Cuccia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Football is strong at Sylmar, that's for certain. The Spartans are looking at 
a fifth consecutive league title. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the blessing of the rules committee, the Spartans will be playing for 
their second 4-A title in three years. Valley Pac-8 Conference at a Glance

LOS ANGELES CITY HALL JOURNAL: A SUMMARY OF SELECTED CITY HALL ACTIONS IN THE 
PAST WEEK AFFECTING CENTRAL LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * BUSINESS DISTRICT: Authorized the Community Development Department to issue 
a $150,000 contract to Industrial Community Revitalization Inc. for planning 
the Goodyear Tract, a 137-acre Business Improvement District in South-Central. 
If the district is established, the area bounded by Avalon Boulevard and 
Central, Gage and Slauson avenues would be converted into an industrial park. 
An assessment levied on businesses in the area would pay for security guards, 
security fencing, maintenance, lighting and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 * FALSE ALARMS: Directed the city attorney to revise a proposed ordinance 
intended to cut down on the number of police responses to false alarms. Among 
the revisions is one that would require alarm companies to call customers to 
verify that a police response is needed. The proposal also calls for reducing 
from four to two the number of false alarms a customer is allowed before 
incurring a fine. A penalty of $80 would be charged for each false alarm over 
the limit. There were 161,804 alarms recorded by the Police Department last 
year, 153,107 of which were false alarms.  
</P>
<P>
 * THIRD STREET BRIDGE: Approved a plan by St. Vincent Medical Center to build 
a pedestrian bridge over 3rd Street, just west of Alvarado, that will connect 
their existing facilities with two buildings under construction. The bridge is 
expected to have 700 to 1,000 crossings a day. 
</P>
<P>
 * STREET CLOSURES: Approved temporary closure of the following streets on 
Sept. 18 from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. for the Central American Independence Day 
Parade and Celebration: 7th Street between Alvarado and Parkview streets, 
Alvarado between 7th and Pico Boulevard, Pico between Normandie Avenue and 
Alvarado, and Normandie between Pico and 15th Street. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues. * HOUSING PROGRAMS: Authorized the Community Redevelopment Agency to 
distribute $48 million from the Bunker Hill Housing Trust Fund. Of the total, 
$18 million will be allocated for earthquake recovery, $14 million for areas 
affected by the riot, $10 million for citywide housing and $5 million to 
replace housing of people displaced by the earthquake who meet income criteria. 
The council action overturned a vote two weeks ago that would have allocated 
$18 million for citywide housing and $14.7 million for earthquake recovery. A 
compromise plan was rejected. Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky argued that the 
earthquake was the biggest natural disaster in U.S. history and that offering 
less then half of the $48 million for quake victims was already a compromise. 
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas opposed the new package, arguing that the Housing 
Trust Fund money is for citywide housing, not just disaster relief. Passed 9-5. 
Voting yes: Richard Alatorre, Jackie Goldberg. Voting no: Mike Hernandez, Nate 
Holden, Ridley-Thomas, Rudy Svorinich Jr., Rita Walters. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a quick note to thank you for such a wonderful article ("Program Takes 
the Healing Arts Into the Neighborhoods," Aug. 14). 
</P>
<P>
 You really grasped the concept of what the Artist in Residence summer program 
is all about.For people who weren't aware of the program, the article gave them 
a broad, solid understanding of where and why it originated, where it is going 
and the youth it is affecting. It is heartening to know that there are people 
in this city who care enough to give notice to programs like this. We are all 
talking about the youth. It is they who are the beneficiaries of such 
programming, along with the artists who are teaching the workshops and the 
communities where the programming is done.

INFRARED: WAVE OF FUTURE FOR COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS?; TECHNOLOGY: IRVINE 
COMPANY IS BANKING ON ITS NEW CHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS KERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Transmitting infrared signals is nothing new for officials at Irvine Sensors 
Corp. Most have been at it for years now -- for example, every time they change 
TV channels using a remote control. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, though, such commonplace infrared waves may link computers with each 
other and with printers and other devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Major computer makers, such as Compaq and IBM, recently agreed on a standard 
method for such infrared transmission, and Irvine Sensors has produced a chip 
it thinks will be a major help in its conversion from a spy satellite research 
company into a consumer electronics manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at something that could be so prevalent, it will be on every 
schoolchild's desk," said Irvine Sensor's Myles Suer. If his company's 
low-power chip -- called SIRComm -- captures a decent share of the anticipated 
market, it could mean tens of millions of dollars in revenue over the next 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly a modest aim for a 14-year-old company that hasn't made an annual 
profit since it went public in 1982. What's more, Irvine Sensors had been 
making rosy forecasts for several years now about an earlier "breakthrough" 
product -- a high-density memory chip that is only now beginning production. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Sensors is one of several manufacturers scrambling to supply the 
infrared transceivers that some industry analysts expect will begin to replace, 
by next year, the cables that connect personal computers with printers, 
keyboards and other devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials generally believe about a third of the nation's 96 million 
households have a personal computer, although a recent survey suggested the 
proportion of households is closer to 27%. 
</P>
<P>
 Because infrared waves have a higher frequency than radio waves, infrared 
isn't likely to replace either radio, cable or telephone wires for 
communicating over distances longer than several feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 But infrared will make it easier for digital devices to talk with each other, 
particularly products made by different companies. Instead of plugging a PC 
into a printer, users with an infrared-equipped computer would be able to point 
it at another infrared-equipped device, as if using a TV remote control. 
Infrared should also make it easier for users to swap information between 
personal computers, cellular phones, pagers and even digital watches that would 
be able to store phone numbers, business cards and short memos. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that you can go anywhere with a mobile device and not have to worry 
about whether you'll be able to plug in, that's very exciting," said Suer, 
marketing director at Irvine Sensors. "The usage can be impromptu, because the 
device can be ready (to receive signals) all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whiz-bang though it sounds, about 75 manufacturers are currently working to 
develop infrared data transfer devices, or to integrate those devices on their 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Those companies -- including market leaders Motorola, Intel Corp., IBM, Apple 
Computer and Compaq Computer Corp. -- joined an association formed by 
Hewlett-Packard Co. last year to develop common methods for the transfer of 
data via infrared. Many of those companies plan to introduce infrared equipment 
on the computers and printers they will display at this fall's consumer 
electronics shows, said a Hewlett-Packard spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Some products already include earlier forms of infrared data transfer, such as 
the personal digital assistants made by Apple and AST Research Inc., though 
most of these machines do not yet meet the new standard set by the Infrared 
Data Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Sensors is not the only company chasing this potentially lucrative 
market, however. Rivals like Crystal Semiconductor in Austin, Tex., are many 
times bigger in terms of revenue, and have more experience selling electronic 
components in the commercial market. 
</P>
<P>
 With wholesale prices for the infrared assemblies expected to be about $5, 
profits will depend on marketing efforts as much as on technological advantage, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market will look at these as a black box. It doesn't really matter what 
an individual company makes as long as it fits and it works, and it's 
compliant" with the new standard, said Ken Jacobsen, vice president of 
marketing for Connexus Inc., a consulting firm in Fremont that helped organize 
the trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 With the components' standards already agreed upon, the technical knowledge of 
a single firm can "only go so far," Jacobsen said, no matter how advanced its 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even if infrared lags behind other technologies, such as radio data 
transmission, infrared interfaces will still likely be added to most machines, 
according to several analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so cheap, it will be a giveaway," said David Scott Lewis, president of 
Cellsys, a Van Nuys company developing products for radio networks that would 
link computers over longer distances than infrared. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorter than radio signals, infrared light waves lie just past the red end of 
the visible spectrum of colors. Television remote controls using infrared 
signals to change channels were introduced about 15 years ago, and electronic 
stores carry the parts needed to send and receive a few infrared signals. 
</P>
<P>
 But using infrared light to flip a TV on and off, or to change channels, is 
much simpler than transmitting data from a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Computers store information, such as a memo or a list of phone numbers, in a 
complex sequence of signals. To send or receive a document via this new method, 
those signals must be translated into infrared light, then retranslated to data 
by the receiving unit. Irvine Sensors' chips are designed to smooth the 
retranslation process. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Sensors gained its expertise with infrared after it won military 
research and development contracts in the 1980s, including projects that were 
part of the Strategic Defense Initiative. The company first studied infrared 
during research meant to help orbiting satellites identify enemy missiles by 
spotting their heat signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The military work also led the company to design stacks of high-density memory 
chips to store computerized information in rockets and in other environments 
too demanding for standard memory systems, such as floppy disks. It also won 
similar contracts from NASA. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Irvine Sensors began delivery of the first memory chip stacks 
built for it at an IBM factory in Vermont. The shipments will give Irvine 
Sensors its first commercial manufacturing revenue, said John J. Stuart Jr., 
the company's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, he said, the infrared chips and the memory chips are the beginning 
of the end of Irvine Sensor's reliance on defense contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of little bits and corners that we've explored," he said. 
"Now we're looking at what we know . . . that has the most immediate commercial 
applications." 
</P>
<P>
 Increased revenue can't come too soon for the company, which lost $1.5 million 
for the fiscal year that ended in October, 1993. The company, with 45 employees 
at its Costa Mesa headquarters and about 25 more at the Vermont facility, has 
had revenue of about $4 million annually in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The losses have not appeared to deter stockholders, who perhaps are cheered by 
the company's technical prowess and its contracts with IBM. From a low of 47 
cents in 1992, the company's stock is now trading between $7 to $8. Its stock 
climbed to a high of $10 in the third quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 That spike in the stock price was linked to market expectations of revenue 
from IBM's Vermont production, said Lorraine Maxfield, a vice president for 
research with Paulson Investment Co. Inc. in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its reputation for strong research, Irvine Sensors must now hope that 
it has guessed correctly about future demand for its chips, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is (the infrared chip) just another weird military toy, or does it have 
serious commercial uses?" Maxfield asked. "They really do have some hard 
science there. They just have to show the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Andler, director of marketing for AST Research Inc.'s mobile computing 
division, said many companies like Irvine Sensors pay attention whenever 
standards are adopted. The challenge for those companies, he said, is balancing 
their technical know-how with the cost concerns of buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to predict whether the standard you emerge with is the best 
standard, (because) what you're dealing with is competitors trying to 
cooperate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 AST in Irvine will probably begin selling notebook computers that meet the new 
standard around next January, Andler said, assuming that other companies who 
are not members of the association -- along with association members -- 
actually bring the products they have developed to market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're participating because we think (the Infrared Data Assn. standard) is a 
valid standard . . . But if the printer people don't go with it, if the fax 
people don't go with it, then it won't catch on no matter how good it is" from 
a technical point of view, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 AST also sells a personal digital assistant, called the Gridpad, which 
includes infrared data transmission, though it doesn't yet meet the new 
standard. AST will probably update the Gridpads to the new standards as well, 
Andler said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coping with existing machines that do not meet the new infrared standard is a 
strategy that at least one of Irvine Sensors' competitors is pursuing. Crystal 
Semiconductor plans to introduce chips that can handle signals from most 
existing devices as well as those that are compatible with association 
standards. Even when the new standard becomes commonplace, consumers who own 
existing infrared machines will still hope to make use of them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal officials think that even if the new standard wins out, it will take 
several years to be adopted, according to spokesman Wayne Alvarez. "You're not 
going to sell everybody a new telephone just so they can have infrared on it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Alvarez said, he expects products probably will be 
introduced, perhaps with his company's chips, to allow such new peripherals to 
communicate with existing personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Sensors may also go after that dual-use market, officials there said, 
depending on the demands of vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to have the smallest (infrared) chip, so the cost (to the 
manufacturer) of fitting them into the product goes down," said Irvine Sensors' 
Suer. "You want to have the best, for the lowest cost." Linking Up Via Infrared 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Sensors' SIRComm chip allows laptop computers and other portables to 
transfer data to stationary computers, printers and modems within one meter via 
infrared light. How it works: 
</P>
<P>
 1. User commands laptop to transmit data 
</P>
<P>
 2. Data is converted to infrared light pulses 
</P>
<P>
 3. Detector in desktop computer picks up infrared pulses 
</P>
<P>
 4. Chip eliminates signal impurities and converts light pulses into data. 
Process also works in reverse for transmitting desktop files to laptop. Other 
applications: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sending laptop files to a stationary printer 
</P>
<P>
 * Transmitting files to another laptop 
</P>
<P>
 * Sending telephone numbers stored in a cellular phone to a desktop computer

JAMES FLANIGAN: A DAY TO CELEBRATE THE AMERICAN LEARNING FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is the glass half empty or half full this Labor Day? That depends. 
</P>
<P>
 If American business were asked, the answer would emphatically be full. U.S. 
companies are confidently competitive again, both at home where they are 
modernizing constantly and overseas, where U.S. firms lead the world in 
investment once more. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually they are joining a trend. Global investment from all countries is 
rising after a two-year decline, the United Nations reports. And that 
international bullishness is behind the buoyancy in the U.S. and other stock 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 But the glass seems half empty for working people, particularly for middle 
income earners paid $25,000 to $50,000 a year. These people, who make up a 
majority of the work force, have found wage hikes to be few, benefits getting 
skimpy and jobs growing more uncertain in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Reich, the phrase-making Secretary of Labor, spoke last week of an 
"anxious class" in the middle of the U.S. labor force. The economy has created 
2.5 million jobs in the last year, Reich said, and yet "some workers are 
surging ahead, others are treading water and still others are sinking -- in the 
same economy, at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 The big question is: What causes this dissonance? And how can we reconcile the 
renewed confidence and competitiveness of U.S. business with anxiety in the 
ranks of the workers? 
</P>
<P>
 Some point to the precipitous decline of union labor and say competitiveness 
is based on low wages. Unions represent only 13.5% of the U.S. work force now, 
fewer than one worker in seven. And union members earn higher wages on average, 
$14.76 per hour compared to $11.77 for non-union workers, in addition to 
getting better benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But the differentials are not enough to account for the shift in U.S. 
industry's global prospects, especially as union representation is declining in 
all other countries, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Something else is going on. And clues to it lie in the rise of technicians, 
the 20 million U.S. workers who design, manufacture and operate computerized 
machinery in business, medicine and every facet of American life. 
</P>
<P>
 Where U.S. labor, even a decade ago, was dominated by assembly workers doing 
relatively unskilled, repetitive tasks, increasingly it is represented by the 
technician who knows how to manipulate circuit boards to make machinery 
intelligent, to calculate a sales and inventory program or to analyze human 
tissue in a diagnostic clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Such higher skilled tasks demand that workers take special training, often at 
local community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 The new jobs offer decent wages, from $13 to $20 an hour, and pay off in the 
productivity gains that have made U.S. business a global powerhouse once again. 
Overall, productivity in manufacturing and services grew 4.2% last year; the 
gains continue this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising productivity has made U.S. companies venturesome investors, accounting 
for $50 billion of the world's $195 billion in multinational investment last 
year. Major companies are prominent: Coca-Cola, Motorola, GE and Boeing are 
expanding in Asia; Wal-Mart plans to open stores in Europe and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 But smaller companies are increasingly global, too. Economist Thomas McManus 
has compiled a list of U.S. companies doing well in exports and foreign sales 
that includes such firms as: 
</P>
<P>
 * Verifone, Inc., the Redwood City, Calif.-based maker of devices that verify 
credit card transactions. It gets 25% of its $260 million sales from customers 
in 70 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loctite Corp., of Hartford, Conn., which makes sealants and specialty 
chemicals and gets half its $600 million a year in sales from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cordis Corp., a Miami-based maker of catheters and other medical devices, 
which gets almost 40% of its $255 million in sales outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 International success is why some U.S. companies -- such as Coke and Gillette 
-- attract premium prices on the U.S. stock market, and why other firms will in 
time, says Stefan Abrams, investment manager for Trust Co. of the West.  
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, investors have opportunity in the new economy. Less clear have been 
opportunities for workers. But now the rise of community colleges -- "the 
unsung heroes of the new middle class," according to Reich -- is opening a path 
to better jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Community colleges offer two-year associate degrees or courses in academic 
subjects and technical skills, with tuition often subsidized by companies or 
state development offices. Enrollments have grown 30% to 6.5 million in the 
last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Such schools and continuing education are mainstays of the new global economy, 
an economy in which it is not a case of U.S. workers -- as is often charged -- 
being forced to compete with $2-an-hour labor in Malaysia, but of trying to 
keep up with the headlong pace of technological change. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an economy that calls for and rewards individual initiative, but is not 
favorable to groups. "Organized labor should ask itself why young people, who 
want to participate in decisions about their jobs, don't want to join unions," 
says David Lewin, professor of industrial relations at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Unions organized the first celebration of Labor Day in 1882. The fight then 
was to earn and live. The fight now is to learn and grow. The glass is half 
full.

ON A ROLL; ECONOMY: BUSINESSES ARE INVESTING WITH CONFIDENCE EVEN AS ECONOMISTS 
BEGIN TO WONDER IF THE EXPANSION IS NEARING ITS LIMITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sooner or later, the bell tolls for every recovery. And now, given the cooler 
tone to recent economic statistics, some experts have started to wonder: Is the 
nation's 40-month-old upturn -- middle-aged by historical standards -- quietly 
slipping past its prime? 
</P>
<P>
 "We should see a decent end of the year," predicts David A. Levy, director of 
forecasting at the Jerome Levy Economics Institute in New York. "I'm a little 
more concerned about 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet oddly enough, a journey through the nation's economic landscape gives a 
different impression altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies are loading up on high-tech equipment. Some are installing new 
assembly lines for the first time in years. Corporate profits generally are 
strong. Confidence of consumers and executives remains solid. Businesses 
continue to hire, albeit selectively. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an upbeat refrain heard from the operators of machine shops in the 
Midwest, high-tech firms in Texas, hotels, banks, steel plants and some of the 
nation's largest retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Their message: The economic expansion still holds vast reserves of energy, 
even with the restraining effects of higher interest rates.  
</P>
<P>
 "Businesses are looking for loans to expand or modernize, and consumers keep 
borrowing money to buy cars and houses," says Bert Ely, a banking consultant in 
Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 California, of course, remains near the end of the line when it comes to 
enjoying the full benefits of recovery. Nonetheless, the national economy "has 
a head of steam," says Paul W. Boltz, chief economist at the T. Rowe Price 
investment firm in Baltimore. "You may not feel it in every region of the 
country, but the economy as a whole has powerful momentum." 
</P>
<P>
 For evidence of that momentum, look no further than the semiconductor 
industry. North American chip sales for 1994 are expected to surge 26% to $31.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Such ebullient growth is important to the economy, not only because chip sales 
now exceed steel in dollar value, but because semiconductors are a proxy for 
the performance of high-tech overall. They reflect demand for such products as 
cellular phones, personal computers, VCRs, even automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never quite seen it like this," says Paul Plansky, vice president at HTE 
Research, a San Francisco semiconductor industry research company. "Usually 
people say it won't last, but companies are operating plants 24 hours a day, 
and you don't see signs of a slowdown." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Instruments, which virtually invented the semiconductor, illustrates the 
blue-sky optimism: The Dallas firm recently completed its first new U.S. 
semiconductor fabrication line in 10 years. Now it's building a second. 
</P>
<P>
 TI plans to plow an additional $1 billion into new plants and equipment this 
year, double the level of the late 1980s. Intel, meanwhile, is investing $2 
billion, with new chip plants planned for Oregon and Arizona and new capacity 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is positive," says Richard Clemmer, senior vice president at TI. 
"We wouldn't be investing this kind of money if we weren't." 
</P>
<P>
 The view from the nation's industrial heartland is also cheery. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel companies are reporting solid profits and building new plants for the 
first time in more than a decade. In Pittsburgh, fledgling Worldclass Steel is 
investing $340 million in a new mini-mill on the site of a facility once owned 
by U.S. Steel. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for machine tools continues to be strong as factories add new equipment 
to improve productivity and efficiency. Auto makers, meanwhile, are enjoying 
their biggest boom since the mid-1980s. Sales of pickups, minivans and sport 
utility vehicles are so brisk that Detroit cannot make enough of them -- a 
bottleneck widely blamed for a summertime lull in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last month, Ford Motor Co. announced plans to hire 900 workers and invest 
$27 million to boost production of its popular F-Series pickup and Bronco sport 
utility vehicle in Wayne, Mich. Other auto makers are also expanding capacity 
at their U.S. and Canadian plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Such investment could pay off at this stage of the economic cycle. Just 
reaching its life expectancy -- 56 months for the average post-World War II 
recovery -- would give the current expansion more than a year to go. And 
recoveries have been known to last much longer. The last one, which began in 
mid-1981, survived 104 months. 
</P>
<P>
 So auto industry executives have reason for their faith in the economy. A 
lower national unemployment rate, restrained inflation and the prospect of an 
export rally next year all suggest the upturn has staying power.  
</P>
<P>
 "We see demand for trucks of all kinds continuing to grow," explains Bob 
Transou, Ford's vice president of manufacturing. "And we want to be ready for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, those who believe the U.S. economy is starting to shift downward 
can cite recent data on factory orders, economic growth last spring, consumer 
spending levels and orders for big-ticket items.  
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, economists are puzzling over a mystery: Why did the nation's 
product inventories stack up so dramatically on warehouse shelves between April 
and June? 
</P>
<P>
 The $56-billion increase in inventories accounted for a stunning 63% of 
national economic growth in the second quarter. Just working all those excess 
goods through the system, before factories need to replace them, is expected to 
push growth rates down to the range of 2% to 2.5% for the second half of 1994, 
compared to growth levels of 3.6% for the first half. (The revised 
second-quarter figure is 3.8%.) 
</P>
<P>
 Anecdotal evidence suggests that at least some of the inventory pileup was 
unplanned. Companies, it seems, overestimated the appetite of consumers after 
last year's lively Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stockpiled inventory and fell flat on their faces, because they didn't 
pay attention to the facts of life," says Kurt Barnard, a New Jersey-based 
retail economist. "The primary fact is consumers are still cautious." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the picture is ambiguous. Inventories at the manufacturing level 
remain modest, a sign that the economy continues to chug along. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the central issue in the debate over whether the economy is slowing 
down dramatically or merely pausing," says Ross C. DeVol, an economist with the 
WEFA Group, a consulting firm in suburban Philadelphia. "We think it's a 
pause." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Levy sees the Federal Reserve Board's anti-inflation policy -- 
demonstrated by its five interest rate hikes this year -- as the greatest 
threat to the economy. Historically, he contends, "the Fed keeps tightening 
until the economy gets into trouble. They don't know when to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the effect of higher rates has been largely muted, except for the 
housing market, where a rally has reached a plateau in recent months. Mortgage 
rates have climbed nearly two percentage points in the past year. But those and 
other interest rates remain at roughly half the levels of the early 1980s, and 
consumer spending has not slowed enough to frighten business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thus far, the economy hasn't hurt us," says Bruce Nordstrom, co-chairman of 
the upscale retail firm that bears his family name.  
</P>
<P>
 Catalog sales, launched in January by the Seattle-based retailer, are 50% 
higher than expected. Every Nordstrom store -- there are 77 in 14 states -- has 
enjoyed a sales increase in the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Nordstrom, which just opened its 26th California store in Arcadia 
and another in Annapolis, Md., also plans new outlets in White Plains, N.Y.; 
Detroit; Indianapolis; Dallas, and Denver over the next two years. Broadly, 
retail economists foresee moderate sales gains for the balance of the year, 
perhaps in the range of 3% to 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Industrywide, we think there will be a slight upswing in sales," Bruce 
Nordstrom says. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook is positive elsewhere in the service sector, where the hotel 
business illustrates how economic wounds ultimately heal, even though the 
process may take years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel construction has screeched to a halt from the mania of the late 1980s, 
except for low-frills, budget lodging -- a shift that has finally allowed 
demand for rooms to catch up with supply.  
</P>
<P>
 And that "creates a profitable business from one that might have been a loser 
in the early 1990s," says Mike Leven, president of Holiday Inn's Americas 
division.  
</P>
<P>
 Hilton Hotel Corp.'s U.S. occupancy rate of 72%, and Holiday Inns' 63%, both 
reflect steady rises from recent years, said company executives, who expect 
occupancy levels to move further upward next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is more business travel; there is more leisure travel," says Hilton 
Chairman Barron Hilton.  
</P>
<P>
 For many businesses, there also is more action at the middle rungs of the 
ladder, in contrast to the flashier 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Casual restaurants -- such as Chevys, Cheesecake Factory, Houstons and 
California Pizza Kitchen -- are the winners in this environment, taking 
business both from their pricier counterparts and fast-food rivals. Los 
Angeles-based California Pizza Kitchen, two-thirds owned by PepsiCo, has opened 
19 restaurants in 1994 and plans to open 11 more this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate America's spending boom on new facilities and technology has fueled 
a 10% increase in bank loans over the past eight months, according to C.J. 
Lawrence & Co. in New York. Major business loans and personal loans by 
commercial banks have been rising steadily all summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it has to do with renewed consumer confidence," says Susan Weeks, a 
Citibank spokeswoman. "When people are nervous, they don't borrow much and they 
don't spend much."  
</P>
<P>
 Just a few years ago, giant Citibank was teetering on the brink of collapse, 
dragged down by the recession and huge losses in its portfolio of commercial 
real estate loans. Citicorp, the bank's holding company, lost $456 million in 
1991 as it hobbled through a painful restructuring that included writing off 
millions of dollars in bad loans and shutting down offices throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 By last year, however, the retooling process was largely complete, and the 
national recovery helped a slimmed-down Citibank earn $1.9 billion. This year's 
profit is expected to hit about $2.7 billion, analysts say. By 1995, it could 
climb to $3.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just about every area of our business is showing signs of improvement," Weeks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Take credit cards. In the first 90 days of this year, a staggering 700,000 
people opened new credit card accounts with Citibank, spurred by an aggressive 
marketing campaign. Rising home values have also been a boon for the company's 
home equity lending business -- especially in California, where home prices 
have finally started to rise after falling steadily since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year ago, people would come in and try to get a home equity loan, but we 
couldn't help them because values had dropped and they just didn't have any 
equity," said Eric Daniels, president of Citibank's California operations. "Now 
that prices are going up, people can borrow against their houses again. It's 
almost like we've got a whole new source of profits that we really didn't have 
a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
 But as virtually everybody senses, there are important differences between the 
current recovery and its predecessors. Business is expanding with extreme 
caution. Even as jobs increase in some areas, they are being whittled down in 
others. And broad-scale consolidations -- like the past week's proposed 
Lockheed-Martin Marietta merger -- continue in the name of efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere are these crosscurrents more obvious than in health care, an industry 
that is reshaping itself almost independently of the sweeping reform 
legislation rattling around Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, employers are steering their workers into health maintenance 
organizations and other forms of managed health care that promise lower costs 
while restricting patients' choice of doctors. The result has been a wave of 
mega-mergers: Drug makers American Cyanamid Co. and American Home Products 
agreed last month to join forces in a $9.7-billion deal; in California, HMOs 
TakeCare Inc. and FHP International merged in June in a deal valued at $1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The turmoil is creating challenges for firms that long have been all but 
immune from competition. 
</P>
<P>
 With 6.6 million members, HMO pioneer Kaiser Permanente is the nation's 
largest HMO. But Kaiser is mounting its largest reorganization ever, following 
a systemwide enrollment decline last year -- the first drop in half a century. 
(Kaiser, with operations in 16 states, lost 70,000 members in California.) 
</P>
<P>
 The realignment has prompted the company's first major layoffs. Aiming to 
streamline its operations and reduce costs, Kaiser is scrutinizing most of its 
26,000 jobs in Northern California; more then 3,200 managers will have to 
reapply for new positions. Kaiser may also scrap plans to open nearly completed 
hospitals in Roseville and Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, however, the upheaval hasn't reached Kaiser's bottom line. The 
Oakland-based company reported a record profit of $848 million on revenue of 
$11.9 billion last year. For managed-care companies as a whole, near-term 
financial prospects are "very strong," says David M. Lawrence, Kaiser's 
chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews throughout U.S. industry suggest that such sentiments are widely 
shared. Add them all up and it explains why virtually all forecasters expect 
the economy to keep growing at least through next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent blue chip survey of economists, a gauge of the profession's 
general outlook, found average forecasts of 3.6% growth for 1994 and a more 
modest 2.7% next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've definitely not reached the peak of the cycle yet. The underlying 
fundamentals are still quite strong," says Joe Lavorgna, an economist with UBS 
Securities in New York. In the coming months, he adds, chances of a recession 
are "slim to none."

and George White in Los Angeles. Slow but Steady 
</P>
<P>
 The national economy heads into fall with vigor, if not a full head of steam. 
Economists are worried about rising interest rates, but business itself seems 
to be pushing forward with confidence, and consumption remains strong.

 Companies are pouring money into plants and equipment ... 2nd quarter, 1994:

benefits: 2nd quarter, 1994: 4.0 million

 Altman, the deputy Treasury secretary who was forced to resign Aug. 17 because 
of his involvement in the Whitewater scandal, has clearly come to terms with 
his role as the Clinton Administration's designated fall guy. His net worth of 
$20 million to $30 million -- earned during a heady career as a Wall Street 
investment banker -- no doubt has helped soften the blow, providing him with a 
wonderful retreat in the shadows of the Grand Tetons. 
</P>
<P>
 But above all, Altman seems at peace with himself because he is convinced he 
did little, if anything, wrong during his 1 1/2 years in office -- that he was 
simply the victim of nasty partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman and his allies believe that Sen. (R-N.Y.), the leading Senate 
Republican attacker on Whitewater, was out for blood and saw Altman as a 
vulnerable target. Jittery senior White House aides were more than happy to 
throw Altman overboard, his circle contends, to satisfy D'Amato and to keep the 
Republicans from coming after them. In fact, Altman supporters at the Treasury 
Department are just as angry at the White House for their abandonment of Altman 
during and after this summer's Whitewater hearings as they are at D'Amato. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, his allies warn bitterly that the White House will soon regret 
Altman's loss. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Altman was one of the few senior officials in the Clinton 
Administration who could bridge the wide gap between the "substance people" and 
the "political people" -- the two camps that have often feuded for power and 
position in the Clinton hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman moved easily between the two groups and brought to internal turf 
battles the intangible benefits of being an old college friend of Bill Clinton. 
Not only did he love the give-and-take of politics, but he also was rooted in 
Wall Street's sober sense of the practical. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman had played a similar dual role during his career in New York, where he 
was both a successful investment banker and a Democratic Party insider, and so 
was prepared to carry those switch-hitting skills to the major leagues when he 
came to Washington with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 All that explains why he played a much bigger role in the Administration than 
his title would suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roger could bridge that gap better than anybody else," laments one former 
Altman colleague. "He could talk politics with (political consultant) James 
Carville and (senior adviser) George Stephanopolous, but he also fit in well 
with everyone on the economic team," noted another. "That is really rare. And 
without him, I'm not sure anyone will even be trying to build bridges like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Altman's dual talents showed most clearly during last year's budget battle. 
Throughout the post-election transition and the early stages of the 
Administration, Altman worked the inside game. He teamed with Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and his close friend Robert Rubin, chairman of the 
National Economic Council, to push Clinton toward a more conservative economic 
plan that emphasized deficit reduction and abandoned many of Clinton's 
expensive campaign promises. 
</P>
<P>
 But once the plan was sent to Capitol Hill, Altman moved from the Treasury 
over to the White House to run the "war room," whose job was selling the budget 
package to the public and Congress. He directed the Administration's public 
relations campaign, dived into the lobbying battle and probably deserves as 
much credit for the plan's passage as anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of 1993, Clinton was asking Altman to take on an ever-widening 
range of tough tasks, from handling bilateral trade negotiations with Japan to 
trying to help Clinton find a way to finance the Administration's health care 
reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In hindsight, Altman was clearly spread too thin; he ultimately got in trouble 
for taking on the additional role of acting chairman of the Resolution Trust 
Corp., the independent regulatory agency that was handling the 
Whitewater-related investigation of a failed Arkansas thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, Altman displayed instincts at the RTC for both politics and 
policy; this time, however, mixing the two was a fatal mistake and left him 
trapped in Whitewater's crosscurrents. 
</P>
<P>
 In Altman's absence, the gulf between the economic and political factions 
inside the Administration threatens to get much wider. And the selection of 
Leon Panetta, the former budget director, as White House chief of staff isn't 
likely to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta, a leading deficit hawk and a key member of the economic team, clashed 
repeatedly with Carville and fellow political consultant Paul Begala during 
Clinton's first year in office and has already moved to shut off their direct 
access to Clinton. Even Stephanopolous now has to get clearance from Panetta to 
see the President. 
</P>
<P>
 While those moves show that Panetta and the economic team are in the 
ascendancy, they are likely to leave a legacy of bitterness and resentment. And 
without a mediator like Roger Altman, the wounds may go unhealed until the 1996 
presidential campaign.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: TEACHERS' NEST EGGS REQUIRE SPECIAL 
HANDLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Recent problems involving a $1-billion California investment pool for teachers 
shed light on how teachers fund their retirement savings. 
</P>
<P>
 A civil lawsuit filed last month alleges that Newport Beach-based Teachers 
Management & Investment Corp. lost $100 million of clients' retirement money 
through fraud. But TMI's owners blame hard economic times for depressing the 
value of the fund's holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, many teachers -- including many who never dealt with TMI -- are 
nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 In many states, teachers, government employees and employees of nonprofit 
institutions are not covered by Social Security. Instead, their pensions depend 
on separate -- and often unequal -- retirement programs that are partly 
financed by school districts and state governments. In many cases, Medicare 
coverage is not automatic. That combination can leave these public servants in 
bad shape during their golden years. 
</P>
<P>
 How does the system work and what can teachers do to boost their retirement 
security? Here are some questions and answers: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does a California teacher get at retirement? 
</P>
<P>
 A: A defined-benefit pension from the California State Teachers Retirement 
System. The exact amount of pension varies based on age at retirement, years of 
teaching and monthly income. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who retire at age 60 can estimate their pension benefit by multiplying 
their years of service by 0.02 and multiplying that result by their average 
monthly earnings in their final three years of work. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, if your average monthly earnings were $3,000, you taught 20 
years and retired at age 60, your pension benefit would be 0.4 times $3,000, or 
$1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 If you retire before age 60, the pension would be less. Additionally, if you 
want to ensure that your spouse continues to get monthly payments if you die 
first, you would collect a diminished benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does that compare to everyone else? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Generally speaking, those who work for for-profit companies get a company 
pension and Social Security. The value of company-paid pensions varies. Some 
are very generous, others paltry. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Security payments are fairly modest. The maximum benefit, which is 
indexed each year for inflation, is currently $1,147 a month. However, Social 
Security automatically provides survivor's benefits and spousal benefits for 
non-working spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why don't California teachers get Social Security? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Because they don't pay Social Security taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 However, teachers who started working within the past eight years do pay into 
-- and should qualify for -- Medicare. That's because federal law changed in 
1986 to require new teachers to pay Medicare taxes. Those who were teaching 
prior to 1986 were allowed to opt out.  
</P>
<P>
 That's because Medicare works like Social Security. If you have less than 10 
years paid in, you get nothing. When the law changed in 1986, Congress allowed 
districts to give existing teachers the choice of paying 1.45% of their income 
into Medicare or opting out. As a result, many of the teachers who will be 
retiring in coming years have no Medicare coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about teachers who have summer jobs or prior employment where they did 
pay Social Security taxes? Do they get anything back? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If they have at least 40 quarters of eligible earnings -- the equivalent of 
10 full years -- yes. But they wouldn't get as much as a comparable 
non-teacher.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about Medicare? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Medicare, the government health insurance system for the elderly, is 
administered by and works like Social Security. You generally pay into it 
through employee withholding during your career, then -- assuming you have 10 
or more years of work -- you can receive it at age 65. 
</P>
<P>
 But only some teachers pay into the Medicare system. As a result, only some 
teachers will qualify for Medicare benefits at retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you do if you don't have Medicare? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Some school districts pay retiree health benefits. However, this is 
becoming increasingly rare, school officials say. It's more likely that you'll 
have to buy Medicare coverage when you retire. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does that cost? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It varies based on your age when you apply and inflation. However, it 
currently costs slightly less than $300 a month to purchase both doctor and 
hospital coverage through Medicare when you apply at age 65, says Leslie 
Walker, a spokeswoman for the Social Security Administration in San Francisco. 
If you apply late, you'll pay more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How can teachers bolster their retirement savings? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There's a special type of retirement account available to teachers and 
government and nonprofit employees called a 403(b) plan. It works something 
like the 401(k) plans offered by many companies. Teachers decide how much of 
their paychecks they'd like to contribute to the plan, and that amount is 
deducted from their pretax earnings through employee withholding. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, the maximum amount you can contribute is the lesser of 20% 
of your earnings or about $9,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers then "direct" these investments into the mutual fund or insurance 
annuity investments offered in their school districts, says Thomas Bieniek, 
senior vice president of Fidelity Investments Tax-Exempt Service Co. in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How is a 403(b) different from a 401(k)? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The main difference is that most employers match a portion of worker 
contributions to 401(k)s, but few public schools -- kindergarten through 12th 
grade -- provide 403(b) matching funds, Bieniek says. That's one reason 
participation rates are far lower in 403(b) plans than 401(k) plans, he says. 
There are also some investment restrictions on 403(b) plans that don't apply to 
401(k)s. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, 403(b)s are very attractive for a simple reason: taxes. 
Contributions are deducted before tax, so they reduce your taxable income and 
the amount of federal tax you owe at the end of the year. Additionally, income 
earned in the 403(b) plan accrues tax-free until the money is withdrawn at 
retirement. As with a 401(k), money withdrawn at that time is taxable.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: UPDATED LOOK AT THE 401(K) OFFERINGS OF THE PROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investors hoping to find out where the pros put their own money may be 
interested to learn about the latest retirement plan wrinkle at Morningstar 
Inc., the Chicago mutual fund rating service. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year and a half ago, I reported that Morningstar employees could 
choose from among eight no-load mutual funds for their personal 401(k) 
investments. Earlier this year, the company dropped two of those portfolios and 
added six others. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the old and new lists are dominated by stock funds. This shouldn't come 
as a surprise, considering that most of Morningstar's employees are in their 
20s and 30s. 
</P>
<P>
 A 401(k) plan is an employer-sponsored, tax-sheltered retirement program that 
imposes penalties on withdrawals made before age 59 1/2. Presumably, most of 
Morningstar's workers won't start redeeming shares for three or four decades, 
which should be more than enough time for them to fare well in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the original eight funds, two growth-stock portfolios remain: Fidelity 
Disciplined Equity and Gabelli Asset. 
</P>
<P>
 Others surviving the cut were Lindner Dividend (an income fund), Vanguard 
World International Growth (international stock s ), T. Rowe Price New Income 
(corporate bond s ) and Vanguard Prime Reserves (money market). 
</P>
<P>
 Morningstar dropped Gabelli Growth and Janus Venture. One reason is that 
Gabelli's portfolio manager, Elizabeth Bramwell, left the fund earlier this 
year to start her own investment company. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Janus Venture, which invests in small stocks: "We felt it was getting 
too large and conservative for its objective," Morningstar spokesman John 
Rekenthaler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Janus Venture's performance relative to other small-stock funds has 
deteriorated since 1991, when its assets rose to more than $1 billion. The fund 
has closed to new investors to help keep its size manageable, but assets remain 
about $1.4 billion -- a hefty level for this type of portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brandywine Fund replaced Gabelli Growth in Morningstar's 401(k) lineup. 
It's run by a management team headed by respected stock picker Foster Friess.  
</P>
<P>
 But before you rush out to buy shares in Brandywine, make sure you have 
$25,000, the minimum initial investment required for both taxable and 
retirement accounts. All other funds named on Morningstar's list have lower 
minimums, mostly $500 to $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Filling Janus Venture's spot are two small-company funds: Fidelity Low-Priced 
Stock and PBHG Growth. These are complementary choices in that the former 
pursues a bargain-hunting value approach while the latter emphasizes the 
earnings and growth record. 
</P>
<P>
 PBHG Growth ranks among the riskiest funds on Morningstar's list. It was down 
13% from January through July of this year but has come back in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Another volatile new fund in the 401(k) plan is Montgomery Emerging Markets, 
whose largest holdings are in East Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sold on the emerging-markets concept," Rekenthaler said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining two additions are Selected American Shares and T. Rowe Price New 
Era. Morningstar picked Selected American because it's now being run by Shelby 
Davis, whom Rekenthaler calls "one of the industry's premier managers." 
</P>
<P>
 T. Rowe Price New Era, a natural-resources fund, was chosen for 
diversification. The oil, mining and other commodity producers in which it 
invests tend to fare well during periods of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 A closer look at Morningstar's selections reveals that, in addition to having 
a stock market emphasis, most of the dozen funds share these traits: 
</P>
<P>
 * Well-diversified. Morningstar has generally shunned sector funds that bet 
all their chips on a single industry such as health care, finance or utilities. 
T. Rowe Price New Era is the one exception. 
</P>
<P>
 * Good results. In general, these funds have outperformed most close 
competitors in recent years. Fidelity Disciplined Equity, for example, has 
ranked among the top 20% of all growth funds over the past one, three and five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Critical mass. All of these funds count assets in excess of $500 million. 
Mutual funds generally benefit from a larger size because their fixed costs can 
be spread among a wider shareholder base. The notable exception: Small-stock 
funds may, for various reasons, find that a large asset base makes them 
unwieldy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Moderate expenses. Most of the funds are inexpensive to own. Ten charge 1.3% 
or less in annual operating costs. Most impressive is Vanguard World 
International Growth and its expense ratio of just 0.5%, which is very cheap 
for a foreign fund. The two higher-cost portfolios in the group are Montgomery 
Emerging Markets (1.9% expense ratio) and PBHG Growth (2.2%).  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, 11 of the 12 Morningstar picks are commission-free. The exception 
is Fidelity Low-Priced Stock, which charges a 3% load. 
</P>
<P>
 With a dozen funds, Morningstar offers a wider investment selection than most 
other companies in their own 401(k) plans. Even so, employees would have little 
reason to hold all 12, since some are duplicative. The average Morningstar 
worker owns seven funds each, says Joe Sutton, the company's chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Also worth noting: About 85% of Morningstar's eligible employees participate 
in the 401(k) plan. Such a high ratio can be explained in part by the fact that 
the company has a generous policy of matching each dollar an employee invests. 
The Morningstar Dozen 
</P>
<P>
 Here is information on the 12 mutual funds Morningstar Inc. has made available 
to its employees as part of the company's revamped 401(k) retirement program. 
Included are Morningstar ratings for the funds. Ratings range from five stars 
(highest) to one star. 04,21,11,19,15 Fund Rating Type Phone Brandywine *****

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: FEE-ONLY PLANNERS REFERRED FOR FREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: In a recent column you recommended that readers needing financial advice 
consult a for-fee-only financial planner. I do not know how to find such a 
planner. Can you supply a list? -- G.A.H . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>

Mortgage Balance Exceeds Home's Worth? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My condominium is worth about $40,000 less than my mortgage on it. In 
addition, I have been forced to borrow on my credit cards to make the large 
monthly payments. I have no net worth and am accumulating huge credit card 
bills. My lender won't talk to me until I am at least two months behind in 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 What if I just stop paying the mortgage? Will this hurt my credit ratings? So 
far, I have an immaculate credit history. -- D.E.G . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The strategy you are pursuing is perhaps the worst possible of your 
admittedly limited choices, says Robin Leonard, a San Francisco lawyer and 
author of "Money Troubles: Legal Strategies to Cope With Your Debts." 
</P>
<P>
 By charging your mortgage on your credit cards, you are pledging to pay 
non-deductible interest on top of the interest your mortgage already carries. 
Clearly, Leonard says, you must stop what you're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 What should you do? Leonard says you have three choices, all of which have the 
same outcome: You will lose your home and all your equity in it. 
</P>
<P>
 One is to attempt to sell the condominium, taking whatever loss you must. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard says a lender, however, is highly unlikely to accept any price less 
than the outstanding loan balance, making virtually impossible any sale of a 
condo worth $40,000 less than the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, a sale will take some time and effort on your part. If you want to 
keep the sale process as smooth as possible, you should keep current on your 
mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Another choice would be to stop paying your mortgage and let the bank 
foreclose on your loan. 
</P>
<P>
 You will, of course, lose any equity you have -- but you are resigned to that 
outcome already. However, if you have a "purchase money" loan, you will not be 
liable for the unpaid mortgage balance. (Purchase-money loans, unlike 
refinanced mortgages, are non-recourse loans, meaning the lender cannot go 
after assets other than the home securing the loan.) However, a foreclosure 
will damage your credit rating and will remain in your credit history for as 
long as seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Your best alternative and the quickest resolution, Leonard says, is to deed 
the property back to the lender in what in known as a "deed in lieu of 
foreclosure." 
</P>
<P>
 All you need to do is get a quit-claim deed form from a legal stationery 
store. Complete it and record it where you originally recorded your home 
purchase -- your local county recorder's office. However, you should know that 
lenders typically do not like to receive these deeds without being consulted in 
advance, and they may reject the deed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, regardless of the type of loan, your lender has the right to 
pursue you for any outstanding balance remaining if you unilaterally deed the 
property back and it is not accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, however, lenders are unlikely to actually get this money, since 
the only practical avenue is a foreclosure, and the lender of a purchase-money 
loan is prevented from seeking the outstanding loan balance in the event of a 
foreclosure. Heirs' Tax Liability for Installment Sale 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In a recent column you said that a deed of trust for an installment sale is 
not afforded a step up in its basis upon the death of its holder and that heirs 
inherit the original tax basis of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 However, my research of available tax publications indicates the general 
proposition that the tax basis of inherited property is the fair market value 
of the assets at the owner's date of death. Please provide your citation for 
your statement. -- R.A.B . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: As was noted in that column, the payoff of an installment note after the 
beneficiary's death is one of several items the government considers "income in 
respect to a decedent." Such income, which also includes accumulated untaxed 
interest on U.S. Savings Bonds, is specifically exempted from the step up in 
value in Internal Revenue Code section 691 (a)(4). It is also covered in 
Internal Revenue Service regulation 1.691 (a-5). Taxes Owed on Second Home 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I recently sold my home and will move into another one that I have owned 
for years. Will I have to pay taxes on the profits from the sale because the 
home was purchased more than two years before the sale of the first one? -- 
T.D.S . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. In order to qualify for a tax-deferred rollover of home sale profits, 
taxpayers must purchase a replacement home within 24 months of the sale of the 
original residence. 
</P>
<P>
 The replacement home can be purchased 24 months before or after the sale of 
the original home, but the 24-month rule is nearly absolute, with only minor 
exceptions.

INSURANCE RATE PLAN IS A GOVERNMENT 'SHAKEDOWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "6% Auto Rate Hike Proposed to Aid Quake-Devastated Firm" (Aug. 16), it was 
reported that the state Insurance Department and two consumer groups are 
endorsing a plan for a 3% rate increase (about a third of the needed 9.2%) in 
auto premiums for 20th Century Insurance and 21st Century Casualty Co. Also, an 
additional 3% would be temporary until an increase in the insurers' capital 
became apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to obtain even this improvement in viability for the company, part of 
its vital capital would have to be placed in less than the best of hands (local 
banks) to "promote economic development" of the Oakland area, and a further 
amount would have to be given directly to "support nonprofit community 
activities" there. 
</P>
<P>
 This appears to be another case of malfeasance and collusion to commit a 
shakedown (extortion) by "self-serving" government for political purposes. All 
persons from Commissioner (John) Garamendi's office involved in this outrage 
should be clearly disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 An explanation for further jeopardizing the health of this company, which has 
provided such major benefit to all of the citizens of California as well as its 
policy-holders, for the benefit of Mr. Whitehead's Oakland Economic Empowerment 
Foundation is something to which John Garamendi should give very, very careful 
thought.

UTILITY SHUT-OFFS ALSO A SIGN OF RECESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the increased number of utilities being turned off because of 
non-payment of bills ("Debate Sparked Over Edison's Cutoff Policy," Aug. 17), 
you again do not take into consideration that best-kept secret in Southern 
California: namely that the economy is so bad that people are quietly and in 
enormous numbers fleeing the state -- or at least Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 I have lived in Los Angeles for 50 years and have never seen so many 
vacancies.Every single neighborhood in Los Angeles that has apartments shows 
"For Rent" and "Vacancy" signs on almost every building. Even the earthquake 
hardly made a dent in the situation, and more signs have popped up in the last 
couple of months than existed before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility companies are just one type of business being hit by the fallout 
ripples from a truly bad economy. Let's face it: When highly mobile people 
(apartment renters) can't get work locally and have to leave the state in order 
to earn a living, they will stick anyone they can. And leaving without 
notifying the utility companies or paying your last bill is an excellent way to 
thumb your angry nose at hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 I know, as a landlord, that I used to be able to re-rent apartments 
immediately, and the new tenants would change the gas and electricity to their 
names right away to avoid an interruption in service. I certainly don't bother 
to tell the utility companies that a tenant has moved, and I see the gas and 
electricity continue for quite some time before the companies realize they are 
being stiffed and turn them off.

DEATH IN HAITI: A BLOW AGAINST DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Amy Wilentz, Amy Wilentz is the author of The Rainy Season: Haiti Since 
Duvalier (Touchstone). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As you drive up to Jean-Rabel, on the dilapidated highway through Haiti's 
northwest province, it's not always easy to distinguish the emaciated people -- 
standing motionless in their drought-devastated fields -- from the sad, plucked 
twigs of the few trees that remain on the barren land. Haitians call this 
dusty, famine-ridden place the "Far West." This was Jean-Marie Vincent's 
parish, the place he worked in and tried to change before he was brutally 
murdered last Sunday in Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 These starving peasants were his congregation and, over the years, he helped 
them gain a degree of literacy and begin demanding at least a minimum of human 
rights from the rich farmers whose illegitimately deeded lands the peasants had 
cultivated for generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Land reform, labor organizing, financial advancement for the peasant: 
Vincent's recipe for the future was not a brew that sat well on the 
landholders' stomachs. In 1987, two large landholding families reportedly 
conspired to put an end to Vincent's organizing. One fatal day, 300 members of 
the peasant groups he worked with were macheted, shot and stoned to death by 
hired thugs, their bodies hurled into the ravines that surround Jean-Rabel. 
Vincent and the nuns and lay people who assisted him were run out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 But like other tireless heroes who have been involved in Haiti's progressive 
movement since the mid-1970s, Vincent kept on with his calling. He would come 
and go from his order's Port-au-Prince residence, driving in his Trooper to 
peasant meetings. (So many peasants involved in land reform and other programs 
had been forced to the capital by the end of 1987 that much of the organizing 
went on there, semi-clandestinely.) 
</P>
<P>
 This big, cherubic man was the soul of Christian optimism -- cheerful, direct 
and virtually twinkly and dimpled in the face of enormous odds. But he was also 
rigorously intelligent, a skillful diplomat and go-between who knew how to make 
things work in Haiti in conditions of extreme penury. In this, he was so 
different from many political figures there -- who only know how to buy and 
bribe people, how to betray, how to sow discord, to make things fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Conscientisation. This is a word you heard often in Haiti in the years between 
the 1986 fall of Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier and the 1991 fall of President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. It means consciousness-raising, and it was the primary 
method used by Ti Legliz, the progressive wing of the Roman Catholic Church in 
Haiti and the backbone of Haiti's popular movement, to help Haitians understand 
their predicament and take charge of their lives. Vincent's work -- and Father 
Aristide's work, and the work of the hundreds of clerical and lay people in the 
Ti Legliz -- was all about conscientisation, about meetings, analysis, literacy 
and (in Haitian Creole) tet ansanm, or solidarity (literally, "heads 
together"), which was the name of Vincent's peasant organization in Jean-Rabel. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, conscientisation is the bane of Haiti's tiny upper class, which 
already understands the predicament of the Haitian peasant and the Haitian slum 
dweller, and the Haitian houseboy, and the Haitian maid, and the tire-repair 
man, the nursemaid, the mother of nine, the factory worker, the basketry 
weavers and microchip assemblers, the brassiere stitchers and the baseball 
crafters, the clothing workers and all the desperate Haitians whose predicament 
makes the life of the elite just a little bit nicer, a little bit plus aise, a 
little easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent had long been a target for harassment by killers financed by the 
elite. In 1987, after the Jean-Rabel massacre, he was among four priests 
(including Aristide) ambushed along the national highway at night during a 
blinding rainstorm. They only escaped because the cool-headed Vincent, in the 
midst of all the rock throwing and machete wielding and guns going off, noticed 
a hole in the road block and got the driver to go through it. He was always 
threatened, and in the last few weeks had received many warnings that he would 
be next. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the most significant assassination since the coup against Aristide. In 
fact, it is probably the most important killing since the fall of Duvalier. The 
other two best-known figures killed (among the thousands murdered since the 
1991 coup by the Haitian military and its elite patrons) were symbolic leaders: 
Antoine Izmery, financier of Aristide's campaign, and Guy Malary, Aristide's 
justice minister. Both those killings were warnings to Aristide and his 
political backers. The assassinations were attacks on the Aristide presidency 
and the idea of democracy. They were of short-term use, intended to stop 
Aristide from returning to Haiti on the day that had been set by a series of 
negotiations. And they worked. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vincent's killing has longer-range goals. It's a naked attempt to cut off 
the lifeline of the peasants and put an end to the work of Ti Legliz in the 
northwest and elsewhere where Vincent was still patiently working. It's an 
attempt to rip apart the fragile network of people in the countryside and the 
cities, a network that Vincent was shoring up during these days when the 
Haitian crisis seems -- one way or another -- to be coming to a head. Its 
effect is to put a huge hole in the Cabinet that Aristide will be able to rely 
on when, and if, democracy is restored. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be nice if Vincent were alive to see the U.S. State Department using 
his murder as another pretext for a possible intervention. No doubt he would 
laugh it off -- he was always one for irony. But it is all the old policies of 
the U.S. government in Haiti -- its attempt to destabilize the peasants' 
movements; its parallel programs that seduce people away from real peasant 
collectives with bigger offers of money and aid, and most of all, its seemingly 
unending support of the Haitian economic elite and military -- that led, in the 
grand scheme of things, to Vincent's death. (Vincent might also -- as other 
Haitians did -- find wry amusement in the fact that the State Department 
spokesman repeatedly got his name wrong, amid the flood of refugees from Cuba, 
and called him "Jose-Maria Vincent.") 
</P>
<P>
 But desgraciadamente, Padre Vincent cannot be here today. Instead, his corpse, 
the heart blown away by five rapid-fire bullets, lies waiting for a small 
funeral in the chapel of his order's residence. If the military jackboot did 
not lie so heavy on the neck of the Haitian people, Vincent would have his 
funeral mass sung in the cathedral with tens of thousands attending. Instead, 
his friends are reduced to a virtually clandestine rite. 
</P>
<P>
 For so long, the clergy has been spared assassination because of Haitians deep 
respect for the church, and their rooted faith. Indeed, though bungled attempts 
have been made on the lives of other clerics, Vincent is the first Catholic 
priest assassinated in Haiti's long battle of attrition. If the United States 
and the international community do not continue putting sinew into their 
diplomatic and economic threats against the military junta, one fears he will 
not be the last.

ECONOMY KEEPS IMPROVING, WHY AREN'T CLINTON'S POLLS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Walter Russell Mead, Walter Russell Mead, a contributing editor to Opinion, 
is the author of Mortal Splendor: The American Empire in Transition (Houghton 
Mifflin). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosperity isn't what it used to be. Presidents used to get a boost in the 
polls when the economy did well. But it isn't working anymore. Even as the 
economy barrels into the third year of an expansion, President Bill Clinton's 
popularity lags. What's wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 It probably isn't the President. It's something different -- and more 
alarming. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. economy has undergone dramatic changes since conventional political 
wisdom started linking gross domestic-product growth and poll results. The 
effect of these changes has been to unhook the connection between the national 
economy, as a whole, and the welfare of individual families. The trouble is 
that rising GDP no longer means a higher standard of living for the majority of 
American households. 
</P>
<P>
 By many measures, American families are worse off -- even though the economy, 
as a whole, continues to grow. Take one of the broadest measures of well-being 
-- the real, inflation-adjusted pay of non-supervisory employees in private 
industry. From 1947 to 1973 these hourly wages almost doubled -- from $6.75 to 
$12.06 in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But real wages started to fall in 1973, and, by 1993, they had fallen to 
$10.83. During recessionary periods, real wages fell quickly -- at more than 1% 
per year during the two recessions of 1979-82 and 1989-91. But they also fell 
during expansions -- more slowly, but they still fell by about one-half of 1% 
per year, and, as a recent U.S. Department of Commerce report notes, from 1973 
to 1993, real wages fell at an annual compound rate of .7% per year. 
</P>
<P>
 This trend continues. In the three months up to June, 1994, the purchasing 
power of U.S. workers fell .7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Expansion or no expansion, most people's paychecks aren't rising as fast as 
their bills -- and they know it. As they cope with a generation of falling 
wages, most American families have adopted a simple strategy to cope with 
rising expenses and stagnant or falling incomes: They work more. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, women work more. Only one type of family saw its average incomes 
rise in the expansionary '80s: married couples with working wives. It didn't 
come from the men -- 80% of husbands saw their incomes fall during this period. 
But with Ralph's and Norton's incomes dropping, Alice and Trixie went to work. 
American wives in two-wage-earner families increased their hours of work by an 
average of 32.3% between 1979 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't about wealthy women finding new job satisfaction in rewarding 
careers; it is about women taking up difficult and poorly paid jobs to help 
feed their families. The poorest fifth of wives -- the Alices and the Trixies 
-- worked the hardest, adding, on average, 44.7% to their work weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding insult to injury, benefits are falling along with real wages. In 1979, 
the average American manufacturing worker had 23.1 paid days off every year; 10 
years later, after the longest economic expansion in U.S. history, workers only 
got, on average, 20.8 days of paid time off. Pension and health-benefit 
coverage also deteriorated during the much-praised expansion. Seven percent 
fewer private-sector workers were getting either pensions or health coverage at 
the end of the decade than at the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic expansions create new jobs -- but higher employment at lower wages 
isn't most people's idea of progress. Unfortunately, job creation in the last 
two American expansions has been skewed toward low-wage, low- or no-benefit 
jobs, while high-wage jobs, especially in manufacturing, continue to disappear. 
Even the much ballyhooed rise of small businesses as large corporations 
downsize brings wages and benefits down -- small businesses tend to pay lower 
wages and fewer benefits than large ones. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent report -- "The State of Working America" by Lawrence R. Mishel and 
Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute -- makes the statistical case 
for something most American families know from their daily experience: 
Expansion or no expansion, life isn't getting better for most households. 
</P>
<P>
 This is both good news and bad news for the Clinton Administration. It's good 
news because it means Clinton's poor popularity during a business expansion 
isn't a unique sign of his personal political weakness. Americans are still 
voting their wallets -- it's just that rising GDP no longer means fatter 
paychecks for the average family. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is also the bad news. It's no longer enough to deliver a business 
expansion to win the gratitude of American voters. Real wages and benefits have 
to rise -- or at least they have to stop falling. That, unfortunately, is 
harder to pull off than a simple cyclical expansion of economic activity. With 
technology continuing to eliminate some jobs, and low-wage competition from 
foreign countries eliminating others, it isn't easy to see how this 
Administration, or any other, can improve economic conditions for the average 
American family any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of the relationship between economic growth and increasing 
prosperity for the average family may be the most important political event of 
the last generation in American life. Many of the political trends that worry 
and perplex the punditocracy grow out of this collapse. Declining voter 
participation, rising cynicism about virtually every national institution and 
the weakness of the two-party system are all related to the failure of the U.S. 
economy -- and, therefore, the American political process -- to improve the 
living standards of the American people. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, neither party seems to know what to do. Since the fall in wages 
began in 1973, Republicans have had 16 years in the White House and the 
Democrats have had five; Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald 
Reagan, George Bush and now Clinton have all failed to deal with this problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Pundits and economists, who generally belong to the most affluent American 
families with the highest income growth in the last 20 years, tend to think the 
solution is for the American people to lower their expectations, and accept a 
future of harder work, longer hours, shorter vacations, less job security and 
fewer benefits as the economy "adjusts." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe. But few politicians want to take up this idea. And the conflict between 
the expectations of the American people and the performance of the U.S. economy 
is about to get worse. The ability of families to maintain their incomes by 
increasing their hours of work is reaching a limit -- when wives are already 
working full time, what more can families do? 
</P>
<P>
 As more families reach the limits of their ability to maintain their incomes, 
voter frustration will rise. The dissatisfaction with politicians of both 
parties will become more intense; movements like Ross Perot's -- however 
wrongheaded -- will grow in strength and the fragile U.S. political consensus 
will continue to disintegrate. Incumbents will be less and less popular, 
institutions less and less trusted. Where this ends, nobody knows -- and nobody 
sensible wants to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's something for politicians and business leaders of both parties to think 
about on this Labor Day weekend: If the U.S. economy stops working for the 
majority of the American people, the majority of the American people are going 
to lose faith in the U.S. system. That won't be good for business, it won't be 
good for politics and it won't be good for the American people. Unfortunately, 
we seem to be headed down this road. Does anyone have any suggestions?

WITH SOCIAL INSULARITY, A SENSE OF COMMUNITY IS LOST

 "I moved here to get away from all of them." So said a man in the wealthy 
suburb of Potomac Maryland by way of explaining the lawsuit he and his 
neighbors had filed against the county government. Was the county proposing to 
build a half-way house for sex offenders? A new prison? To bus in minority 
students? No, this "social experiment" was a proposal to build townhouses for 
sale at $162,000 apiece to middle-income families, defined as those with 
incomes of up to $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 His objection was straightforward: "I want to be with people at our income 
level who can appreciate what we appreciate." A fellow plan opponent insisted, 
"A person that makes $60,000 doesn't belong in this neighborhood," while still 
another pointed to the sacrifices he and his affluent colleagues had already 
made: "We pay the property taxes so that the policemen and firemen and all that 
can live." But not, apparently, so they can live nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to know which is more extraordinary: that someone would feel that 
families making $60,000 are social untouchables, or that they would feel secure 
enough in this judgment to share it with a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Though lacking the drama of schoolyard violence or the poignancy of children 
having children, this story also captures something essential -- and alarming 
-- about the state of public values. We are rapidly losing something precious 
to any society. It's the idea that we have fundamental moral obligations to one 
another; that while some of us may rise a little faster or slower, the ultimate 
goal is to all rise together. Most simply, that we are connected -- by 
interests, values and mutual empathy. 
</P>
<P>
 If this kind of insularity were limited to the rich, one could just write if 
off to old-fashioned snobbery. But it is not. Increasingly, Americans at all 
socioeconomic levels strive to kick out the rungs on the opportunity ladder 
beneath them, so others cannot follow. Those remaining below are seen as 
potential threats or, precisely because of their lower status, as a source of 
psychic comfort -- or both at the same time. Those a rung or two higher may 
draw resentment, even as those up in the clouds escape scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 America's sickness is not greed. It is misdirected resentments: at struggling 
welfare recipients, perhaps, or union members with good health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 As working-class and middle-class people struggle to make it, they too often 
attempt to wall off -- usually figuratively, sometimes literally -- those 
beneath them. But it's futile: As the firemen and policemen of Maryland 
discovered, there is always someone higher up building a wall between you and 
them. In the end, everyone loses. 
</P>
<P>
 America's culture of possessive individualism is not wholly bad -- it has 
produced great wealth and personal freedom. For that matter, solidarity -- when 
taken to an extreme -- can itself create much ugliness. After all, no one is 
taking to the Florida straits this weekend in a southerly direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The most concrete, measurable consequence of the decline in community -- and 
also a contributor to it -- is America's great and growing economic inequality. 
The evidence is now unassailable: Whether you compare the well-paid and the 
poorly paid, the well-educated and the less-well-educated, or the wealthy and 
those without wealth, the gap is growing. A new report from the Economic Policy 
Institute brings more bad news: The current economic recovery is not reversing 
the trends. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time not only to face the existence of this inequality, but the reality 
that it constitutes a political and social choice. We have historically 
preferred the delusion that distributional outcomes are determined by 
"free-market forces." If some people make more than others, that reflects the 
different economic value of their work -- which, in turn, reflects their 
talent, their effort and -- when we're feeling honest -- their luck. 
</P>
<P>
 But, then, why is the United States so much more unequal than other 
industrialized societies? Why is the gap between the top and bottom wage 
earners, for example, nearly twice what it is in France or Germany, which are 
also free-market economies? Is the distribution of human talent or effort so 
different here? Of course not. These outcomes are politically determined, the 
result of tax policies, labor market organization and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Two nations, Britain and the United States, responded to slowing economic 
growth in the late 1970s with policies designed to reward those who owned 
property. These same two nations are the only ones to have experienced major 
surges in inequality. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who would make a moral claim on behalf of such levels of inequality 
should do so. I don't doubt that many Americans will find them compelling -- 
though I expect most will not. But let us dispense with the demonstrably false 
claim that "human nature" requires it to motivate people. 
</P>
<P>
 How does society advance equality? Part of the answer certainly lies in the 
realm of institutions and social policy. A good starting point would be to make 
work as rewarding as wealth. The distinction between earned and unearned income 
is still made in the tax code, but we have lost sight of its moral and economic 
meanings. We like to talk a lot about the work ethic, yet we don't act 
consistent with that idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax debate today centers on whether we should continue to rely primarily 
on income-based taxes, or move toward a tax on consumption, such as a 
value-added tax. This is just a debate over how to get working people -- coming 
or going. Yet, conservatives call for a reduction or elimination of the closest 
thing we have to a wealth tax, that on capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Another important step is protecting and strengthening workers' rights to form 
unions and bargain collectively with their employers. The percentage of the 
work force in unions has declined markedly, down to 11% in the private sector, 
and is still falling. Even Business Week has concluded this is bad for the 
health of the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to building a sense of community among workers, today's unions are 
also developing a new form of solidarity: cooperation between workers and 
management in pursuit of stronger companies and a better U.S. economy. The 
Dunlop Commission, appointed by Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, has pointed 
out that innovative forms of worker-management collaboration are particularly 
likely to survive in "unionized settings in which the union is involved as a 
joint partner." 
</P>
<P>
 But this crisis of values cannot be solved solely by economics and policy 
measures. There is much talk today of the problem of declining moral values, 
and the need to teach our children better. Yet, a sense of mutual 
responsibility and obligation is rarely mentioned in this discussion. It has 
been so devastated that few even think to call for its resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
 America was founded as a monument to fundamental human equality. Once we were 
the most egalitarian nation on the planet; now we have become (outside the 
Third World) among the least. As we strive to return to "traditional" values, 
let's make sure this is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Michael S. Dukakis was wrong to oppose requiring recitation of the 
Pledge of Allegiance in public schools. We could do worse these days -- and do 
-- than having young people start each day with a reminder that America is 
supposed to be "one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."

THE COMEBACK DICTATOR WHO HAS CLINTON REELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tad Szulc, Tad Szulc is the author of Fidel: A Critical Portrait (Avon). He 
is currently working on a biography of Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What made Jose Raul Capablanca, the Cuban who reigned as world chess champion 
from 1921-27, one of the game's great masters was his uncanny ability to be 10 
or more moves ahead of his adversary. He not only planned his own game; he also 
seemed to anticipate his opponent's every move. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Fidel Castro Ruz is the Capablanca of diplomacy. And for him, the 
trophy in his heretofore successful match with President Bill Clinton is 
nothing less than continued survival 35 years after his revolution seemed to 
have reached its end game. It would not be the first time that conventional 
wisdom misunderstood his calculation as foolishness. 
</P>
<P>
 Assaulting the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in the 1950s with a small 
band of companions seemed foolish, but Castro won out in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cuban leader repulsed the U.S.-organized Bay of Pigs invasion, allied 
himself with the Soviet Union and allowed Soviet nuclear missiles on his island 
in 1962. True, John F. Kennedy persuaded the Russians to withdraw the warheads 
-- at the risk of a global nuclear war -- but Castro gained from the adventure 
a non-invasion guarantee from Washington that protected him for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, the Cuban leader defied President Jimmy Carter by unleashing the 
Mariel boat lift, which seemed unconscionable at the time. Yet, Castro not only 
cleansed his island of "parasites," he also won an immigration agreement that 
allowed Cubans to apply to the U.S. mission in Havana for visas to the United 
States, thus formalizing a safety value for malcontents and political foes. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he seemed to have lost his senses when he dispatched the Cuban army to 
fight in Angola, but his soldiers were victorious -- and Castro became chairman 
of the non-aligned movement, the great chief of the Third World. In the end, 
the United States had to swallow its pride and negotiate with the Cubans, along 
with the Russians and the South Africans, to gain their departure from Angola. 
This time, Castro made himself appear a genius of diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, deprived of Soviet aid and with his country, economically and socially, 
in a state of near collapse, the 68-year-old Castro is moving his chess pieces 
according to a pre-planned strategy designed to save him -- or so he hopes -- 
through concessions from Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Using fleeing Cubans as pawns, Castro knows Clinton must negotiate with him -- 
not just over the wave of refugees headed toward the United States, but over 
what are basic aspects of the U.S.-Cuban political relationship, including the 
longstanding trade embargo. These are subjects Washington has refused to 
discuss since Dwight D. Eisenhower was President. Indeed, Castro is so sure of 
himself that he appointed his best diplomat and the third-most powerful man in 
Cuba -- after himself and brother Raul -- to meet in New York City with the 
U.S. delegation that, according to Clinton, only wishes to talk about 
immigration issues. The United States seems to have been caught off guard when 
it assigned just a mid-level State Department official to the talks with 
Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly, former foreign minister 
and long-time U.N. ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, Castro has a colossal ego. In the span of a few weeks, he has 
transformed himself from a down-at-the-heels, destitute Caribbean dictator -- 
and international pariah -- into a world figure again. At least for a time, he 
has ceased to be irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances surrounding Castro's appearances on the cover of Time 
magazine -- one gauge of presumed public interest -- best tell the story of the 
comeback Cuban. The first cover story, in 1959, portrayed him as the 
revolutionary hero. On Dec. 6, 1993, it was Castro's "failed dream." Last week, 
his eighth cover appearance, it was a stern Castro wagging his finger and 
asking: Ready to talk now? 
</P>
<P>
 With thousands of Cuban runaways imprisoned, in effect, in the U.S. Naval Base 
at Guantanamo Bay and with more crossing the Straits of Florida each day, 
Castro obviously has leverage. He is cynical enough to realize that it is 
easier and cheaper for him to let his people go than for the United States to 
cope with housing them in Florida or Guantanamo. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, it must never have occurred to White House planners that an imperiled 
Castro might fall back on his old habit of defying U.S. Presidents. It was not 
understood -- and this is part of Castro's chess-game approach -- that he is 
perfectly happy to be rid of great numbers of people who, in his eyes, are 
parasites and oppose his revolution. He is not sentimental. He does not 
apologize for the state of affairs in Cuba. He sees advantage in the exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 What must be understood about Castro at this juncture is that his approach is 
absolutely consistent with his previous adventures with the United States. Each 
time, he has staked out a well-prepared position, then refused to budge. This 
is the result of three-and-a-half decades of studying U.S. politics, U.S. 
politicians and U.S. Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has not enjoyed similar study. Clearly preoccupied with such matters 
as Democratic Party politics in Florida, Haiti and health-care reform, the 
President has not had the time or the opportunity to understand -- let along 
outthink -- his Cuban opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The wages of ignorance are evident. Clinton's responses to the Cuban exodus -- 
restricting charter flights, increasing anti-Castro broadcasts and forbidding 
Cubans in the United States to send dollars to relatives back home -- have 
played into Castro's hands. For example, cutting off dollar remittances, 
estimated to be $500 million a year, will only further reduce the level of 
living conditions in Cuba, thereby strengthening Cubans' incentives to take to 
the seas in search of a better life -- and put added pressure on Clinton to 
make a concession. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no reason to believe that the crisis is near an end, especially since 
the volume of attempted crossings from Cuba was rising as the talks in New York 
got under way. The White House, so far, has no credible options to Castro's 
policy of using disgruntled people as weapons in his quest for renewed world 
recognition and for the removal of U.S. trade restrictions against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. President, it's your move.

CHINA IS HAVING ITS WAY WITH U.S. -- BUSINESS BEFORE HUMAN RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Mann, Jim Mann, a Times reporter, is former Beijing bureau chief for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may seem paradoxical, but China is now getting more from the Clinton 
Administration than it ever obtained from George Bush. With Secretary of 
Commerce Ronald H. Brown's trip to Beijing last week, Bill Clinton has made it 
plainer than ever before that his 1992 campaign dictum -- "It's the economy, 
stupid" -- has overridden and washed out his campaign attacks on Bush for 
"coddling dictators" in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by more than 20 U.S. business leaders, Brown said the Clinton 
Administration is giving much higher priority to U.S. commercial interests in 
China and avoided any public criticism of China's human-rights policies. In 
exchange for his deference, China announced the signing of nearly $5 billion in 
business deals, of which more than an estimated $2 billion in work will be done 
in the United States. Many of these deals had been in the works, and would 
likely have been signed anyway. And some supposed agreements are probably 
letters of understanding, not binding contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown did announce that China will resume its human-rights dialogue with 
Washington. But that was merely a giveback by Beijing, since China suspended 
talks earlier this year; the United States had been seeking to resume the talks 
for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's trip was not unprecedented. For years, China has selectively welcomed 
trade missions from various countries as a reward for their good behavior in 
other areas of diplomacy. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was granted 
the right to send a high-level trade delegation to Beijing after she signed the 
agreement to return Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Awarding 
contracts for political reasons would seem to run contrary to principles of 
free trade, but Beijing is not a place for purists of the Adam Smith school. 
</P>
<P>
 During 1989-92, after the Tian An Men Square crackdown, the Democratic Party, 
with Brown as its chairman, repeatedly criticized Bush for seeking a 
reconciliation with the Chinese regime. Now, under the banner of what it calls 
"constructive engagement," the Administration is seeking just such a 
reconciliation. The out-of-office Democrats attacked Bush for sending 
then-National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft to Beijing. Now, the Clinton 
Administration is set to dispatch a series of high-level emissaries to China. 
Brown will be followed later this fall by Defense Secretary William J. Perry 
and Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary. China hopes all these trips will serve as a 
buildup for a visit by Clinton in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in some respects, the Clinton Administration has gone further toward 
upgrading relations with China than Bush dared. It restored the U.S. military 
ties with China's People's Liberation Army that Bush cut in June, 1989, an act 
Bush was unprepared to take. During his last year in office, Bush risked 
Chinese ire by selling F-16s to Taiwan and dispatching a Cabinet secretary, 
U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills, to Taipei; Clinton has been much more 
cautious in his dealings with Taiwan for fear of offending Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Most significant, the Chinese regime has more openly taunted and defied the 
Clinton Administration on human rights than it ever did the Bush 
Administration. On the eve of Brown's trip, Chinese authorities detained a 
leading dissident, Wang Dan, in what seemed to be a test of how much the 
Administration would stomach. Brown said nothing publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine what would have happened in the 1970s or 1980s if the Soviet Union had 
thrown the country's leading dissident, Andrei D. Sakharov, into jail because 
he had committed the alleged offense of meeting with a senior U.S. official. 
Undoubtedly, Presidents Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan would have expressed 
outrage and treated the incident as a serious breach in the relationship. Yet, 
this spring, China did virtually the same thing: It detained China's leading 
dissident, Wei Jingsheng, for more than four months because he met with John H. 
Shattuck, Clinton's assistant secretary of state for human rights. At least in 
public, Clinton has said or done nothing about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 On several occasions during 1990-92, the Bush Administration extracted 
concessions from China, such as the release of a few dissidents, that go beyond 
anything Clinton has yet achieved. That is not to say Bush deserved all the 
credit for winning the concessions. Rather, he was able to get as far as he did 
because the former President could point to the Democratic Congress and say to 
the Chinese, "You better give us something, because otherwise, the Democratic 
Congress is going to punish you." 
</P>
<P>
 That is the important, underlying change in U.S.-China policy from Bush to 
Clinton: Largely because he is a Democrat, Clinton has succeeded in overcoming 
the congressional proponents of human-rights and democratic reforms in China in 
a way no Republican could have managed. It is often said that it took Richard 
M. Nixon, a Republican and longtime anti-communist, to lead America's historic 
opening to China in 1972. Similarly, it took Clinton, a Democrat and 
self-proclaimed human-rights advocate, to restore relations with Beijing after 
the Tian An Men Square upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration worked for a year with Democratic members of Congress who 
favored strong human-rights policies, including Senate Majority Leader George 
J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). Then 
it broke with them on China policy last May, after their support had been 
eroded and their intensity defused. "We were just fooled," admitted Rep. Nancy 
Pelosi (D-San Francisco) in a recent interview. "They (Clinton Administration 
officials) asked us to give them time. We held off from criticism while the 
Chinese were doing all sorts of nasty things." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's principal justification for its new policy, aired 
repeatedly by Brown before and during the trip, is that greater trade will help 
reformers within the Chinese leadership and thus promote human rights. That is, 
however, only an assumption, and so far there is little evidence to support it. 
In fact, at a time when China faces a major political struggle for succession 
to Deng Xiaoping, Clinton's conciliatory policies could unintentionally lend 
greater legitimacy to hard-liners like Premier Li Peng -- leaders who say that 
they know how to handle the United States and that there is no penalty to be 
paid for China's repeated crackdowns on human rights.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; NAFIS SADIK; AIMING FOR CONSENSUS ON THE ROILING 
ISSUE OF POPULATION CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leila Conners, Leila Conners is associate editor of New Perspectives 
Quarterly and Global Viewpoint. She interviewed Nafis Sadik at the United 
Nations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 40 years ago, Nafis Sadik, a doctor, was required to ask her husband 
for his permission to go to work and practice medicine, as was the custom in 
Pakistan. This month, Sadik will lead the international community through a 
critical demographic crossroads. On the eve of the International Conference on 
Population and Development, to be held in Cairo this month, a 90% majority of 
U.N. members is poised to sign the proposed program of action to reduce the 
growth in human population that increases by 90 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 As secretary general of the conference, Sadik has set a course different from 
those of previous conferences on population in Bucharest and Mexico City, each 
a decade apart. The cornerstone of the Cairo program is the empowerment of the 
individual -- in particular, women. 
</P>
<P>
 A gynecologist and obstetrician who has practiced in rural areas, Sadik 
developed a five-year health and family-planning program as part of Pakistan's 
overall development plan. "When the essential needs of the individual are 
addressed," she explains, "those of larger groups -- the family, the community, 
the nation and indeed the planet -- are more likely to be kept in the right 
perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 But this focus on empowerment has galvanized opposition to the Cairo meeting. 
Saudi Arabia has announced it will not attend, and the Vatican has maintained 
its strong opposition. In Egypt, Islamic fundamentalists have threatened 
violence to disrupt the conference, asserting the proposals violate their moral 
beliefs. Sadik's leadership, however, has helped build a majority consensus. 
Abortion -- the most emotional subject in the document -- will remain under the 
jurisdiction of nation-states. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobel laureates and scientists have warned that current population-growth 
trends could lead to irreversible degradation of the environment and continued 
poverty for much of the world. Strong support for the Cairo program could 
change the nature of our stewardship of the Earth, and any decision will have 
far-reaching implications for future generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadik's work to bring attention to the world population crisis has earned her 
numerous awards and honors. She is married to Azhar Sadik, a businessman, and 
has five children, two of whom are adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How will this International Conference on Population and Development 
be different from the previous U.N. meetings on population in Mexico City and 
Bucharest?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The outcome of Mexico City and Bucharest was a policy of population 
stabilization that targeted population goals at the national level, through 
governments that would try to create policy and pass laws. Goals were imposed 
on the individual through international and then through national institutions. 
What those efforts didn't do was establish an enabling environment in which 
people could make the right decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 Cairo conference plan of action focuses both on population and 
development. It broadens the scope of population policy from the narrow focus 
on family planning and fertility to other issues of sustainable development and 
empowerment of the individual -- particularly women -- to make decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The keystone of the Cairo plan is gender equality, equity and empowerment of 
women. Women are half the population of the world, half the population of every 
country. Because women are the only ones who become pregnant and bear children, 
population policy must be dealt with by them. Women have always wanted to have 
some control over their fertility. Even if a woman wants four or five children, 
she should be allowed to space those children, so that she will be better able 
to care for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How is the document, with this cornerstone for the empowerment of women, 
being received by the U.N. member nations?  
</P>
<P>
 A: In the preparatory meetings for the ICPD over the last two-and-a-half 
years, every single government spoke of the importance of empowering women, of 
having women in the decision-making process . . . . From the African countries 
to the Latin American countries, and Arab countries -- all of them spoke of the 
importance of the role of women. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety percent of the governments have also agreed to the text as is, except 
for a few of the brackets. It is only on abortion -- the whole subject of 
reproductive health, women's rights, and abortion is so fraught with emotional 
overtones -- that there are different points of view, even though the document 
does not suggest legalization of abortion. The subject of control is what 
concerns religious leaders. Throughout history, anthropological, cultural, 
social and religious norms have supported fertility control. That has been used 
to subjugate women. 
</P>
<P>
 Disagreement, then, is not centered so much on the need for population 
stabilization, but on family planning and whether it should occur at the 
individual level or at the institutional level. 
</P>
<P>
 Our plan of action is only saying that the needs of women should be addressed 
in consultation with them, not as a prescription to them and imposed on them. 
Today, all women do not have the possibility to choose their roles. Their roles 
are assigned to them to be, in a sense, service providers. To enforce the 
reproductive role as the only role in this day and age is mind-boggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There is opposition to these ideas coming from the Vatican and some Islamic 
leaders. Given their opposition, what is the best-case scenario coming out of 
Cairo?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The Catholic religion does not accept modern methods of contraception. In 
other religions, there is no one point of view. Some Islamic leaders do say 
that family planning is against Islam. But most statements from Islamic leaders 
have favored family planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, religion plays more of a role when it is linked with politics 
-- when religious leaders have influence with government. Look at the U.S., for 
example. During the Reagan Administration, religious groups were more vocal and 
influential than today. With President Clinton in office, it's a different 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The best-case scenario, then, would be full approval of the plan of action 
minus the brackets. That would include an acceptance by all governments of the 
definition of sexual and reproductive health that comes from the World Health 
Organization. It addresses unsafe abortion as a public-health issue for women 
and should be an issue in every country where these deaths are occurring. We 
would also like a full agreement on family-planning services, adolescence and 
reproductive health. 
</P>
<P>
 It does not legalize or seek legalization of abortion. Rather, it seeks to 
make abortion less necessary through the provision of family planning and to 
make medical services available to women who resort to abortion in order to 
prevent health consequences, including death. 
</P>
<P>
 Reproductive health does not contain a hidden agenda to legalize abortion; 
that is up to every country to decide. Reproductive health means information 
and education about reproduction, pre- and post-natal care, assisted 
deliveries, family-planning services and HIV/AIDS and STD (sexually transmitted 
disease) control and prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if we are to be successful, three conditions must exist 
simultaneously, and globally, to help reduce population: First, education and 
empowerment of women -- the ability of women to participate in decisions about 
family size and in decisions about the shape and nature of society; second, the 
availability of family- planning services and information, and, third, the 
confidence by parents that their children will survive. These conditions must 
occur at the same time to be effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you see the Cairo conference as a watershed for feminism on a global 
scale?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it is. We will be looking at major increases in women in the 
economic labor force -- the national labor forces. Across the North and the 
South, women are increasingly working outside the home, admittedly at the 
lowest-paid jobs. In Asia, women are working outside the home; they are 
educated, they become "bread-winners" and thus gain more respect from their 
husbands and families. Gradually and grudgingly, there will be more and more 
recognition of women's work, even within the household. Things are now 
changing. 
</P>
<P>
 Alongside women's entry into the labor force, consideration should be taken 
that their work not simply be overloaded onto them. There should be a changing 
of roles -- a balancing of women's roles outside of the home with the man's 
role inside of the home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nordics are very good examples of this. The role of men and women in the 
parenting of children is quite equal there, especially in Sweden. In Sweden, it 
is not unusual for the father to take leave to look after children. Helping in 
the household is common. The division of responsibilities are such that 
sometimes the man cooks and the woman looks after the rest of the house. 
Sometimes, it is the other way around. Such role equality is not happening in 
the developing world to such a great extent. Men are pushed by what is expected 
of them, and they don't want to be laughed at by their peers and their 
colleagues. The stereotyping there has to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How, then, will gender equality and the changing of stereotypes be accepted 
on a global scale? Won't such change take many years?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Changing gender roles is threatening. Men and women are afraid of how these 
changes are going to affect them. Will they really be able to cope with the new 
circumstances? Women are also worried about a new role expected of them, to be 
independent and fend for themselves. Change is always worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
 But things can happen rapidly. It might not take decades, and major change 
could occur in a decade. If we can identify and engage key people to make 
changes, then change starts to happen very quickly. Core interventions should 
include, for example, getting girls into school and literacy programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Change occurs at different speeds. North and the South are not in sync; 
they exist in non-parallel historical time. Isn't it worth listening to the 
concerns of those in the more advanced industrial societies who have gone 
through the breakdown of the family?  
</P>
<P>
 A: True, different societies live in different historical times . . . . (But) 
all I can say is it is impossible to legislate family. I do not disagree that 
there should be a father, mother and children, but how do you make them stay 
together? 
</P>
<P>
 Women, in fact, don't leave their children and walk out; men do. Women keep 
their children. Most societies have condoned men having multiple sexual 
relationships. Societies don't frown on a man having mistresses, regardless of 
upholding marriage as sacred. In my part of the world, it is considered a great 
achievement to have many women. It is power over women, and confirms the low 
status of women. You can have them, you can own them. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is the same all over the world. Fathers abandon their families and go 
off. In some cases, there is the extended family, but even the extended family 
is now under economic pressure and is gradually breaking down so that they, 
too, are unwilling to support additional family members. 
</P>
<P>
 The nuclear family, in the end, is abandoned when the father, the 
bread-winner, walks out. Restricting women from having children out of wedlock 
could preclude arranged marriages in order to avoid preventing them from 
fulfilling their biological roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The Vatican and some Islamic scholars would argue that America's key 
societal problem is the breakdown of the integrity of the family, in large part 
due to the rise of the feminist sensibility. Is this justified?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Feminism is not the cause of the breakdown of the family. The breakdown of 
the family is due to men having remained in their traditional roles. Men have 
not changed. Men must now take responsibility and change their roles. The roles 
of both genders must change. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman should not be expected to take on double, triple loads. She must not 
be induced to sacrifice her professional career in order to look after the 
family because, after all, it is her job alone. Fathering is also a job as much 
as mothering is a job. Both parents should share the responsibilities of 
parenting and the household work. If you have a proper relationship, that is 
what you will share. 
</P>
<P>
 If the status quo in fact was such that everybody was equal and women and men 
could select their own roles, there would be no feminist movement.

CAMPUS LIFE GOES ON, SORT OF; PROGRESS IS REMARKABLE AT QUAKE-TORN CAL STATE 
NORTHRIDGE, BUT THE STRUGGLE REMAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To gain a sense of Cal State Northridge's earthquake-related woes, one need 
only note that one of its most impressive art exhibits ever is currently on 
display at the university . . . in a trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN suffered more damage than any American university ever had in a single 
natural disaster. According to officials of the California State University 
system, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the governor's Office of 
Emergency Services, the restoration price tag stands at $350 million and may 
yet rise. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage undoubtedly contributed to the fact that the university now has its 
smallest enrollment in 21 years, down 10% from last fall. Certainly fee hikes 
were a factor, but so was the knowledge that CSUN students had to travel to 
UCLA to get to a library last spring, and drive as far as the College of the 
Canyons in the Santa Clarita Valley to get to a science lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Matters might have gotten even worse if round-the-clock efforts had not been 
made to restore the campus to at least a semblance of working order. Given the 
circumstances, progress has been remarkably swift. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the centerpiece Oviatt Library (the San Fernando Valley's largest 
repository of books and periodicals) has been returned to service. All science 
classes are back on campus, and CSUN officials hope that 50% of the 
university's classrooms will be back in use by the end of the semester. Some 
administrative offices, last on the list of priorities, may not be ready for 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, CSUN is a microcosm of the region's unexpected seismic problems 
related to structures. The concrete center of the Oviatt Library was not 
supposed to do very well in a major quake; it did just fine and is open to 
students. The steel-frame wings of the library were supposed to do well in a 
quake; they did not do well. The wings remain closed, and the cost of 
rebuilding them is unknown because engineering experts are still working out 
new earthquake tolerances and standards for steel-frame buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of the $350 million needed to rebuild the campus has arrived 
or is on the way. FEMA has generously promised to come up with 90% of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 In a natural disaster so costly that it is rewriting the record books, it's 
difficult to know exactly what the rebuilding priorities ought to be. But CSUN 
deserves at least a fairly high priority. Some California campuses that 
suffered quake damage years ago still have not been fully rebuilt. CSUN should 
not suffer that fate.

SEEKING LONGER LIFE FOR SOME OF OUR ELDERS; INNOVATIVE BILL WOULD PROTECT TRACT 
OF ANCIENT REDWOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An aerial view of the Headwaters Forest in Humboldt County reveals dense green 
stands of old redwoods, some of which have survived since before Rome fell. But 
just as prominent are acres of desolate land criss-crossed by now-abandoned 
logging roads. 
</P>
<P>
 This patchwork is so dramatic and the remaining old-growth redwoods so 
precious that an imaginative effort is under way to save the trees. That this 
effort is meeting with some success is due to a new spirit of creativity and 
sophistication among environmentalists, plus lawmakers' growing awareness of 
the toll taken by decades of destructive forest practices. 
</P>
<P>
 California's trademark redwood trees once proliferated in the coastal ranges. 
But the monetary value of those trees has meant that fewer and fewer remain; a 
single ancient tree 300 feet tall and 15 feet in diameter can bring $150,000 
when cut for lumber. The temptation to cut has been irresistible and the 
devastation that results to plant and animal life has been extreme. Only 5,000 
to 6,000 acres of privately owned old growth remain in the Headwaters area. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the dense tree canopy, the marbled murrelet, a robin-sized sea bird 
that nests inland, has declined precipitously. There are now only 2,000 to 
5,000 of the birds where there once were up to 40,000. Endangered species in 
the area also include the spotted owl, the peregrine falcon and species of fish 
and amphibians. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting has intensified since 1986 when the Pacific Lumber Co., whose 
old-growth grove is the largest privately owned patch of these trees anywhere, 
was acquired in a hostile takeover by financier Charles Hurwitz, head of the 
Houston-based conglomerate Maxxam Inc. Many feared that old-growth logging 
increased to meet the monthly interest payments on Maxxam's massive debt. 
</P>
<P>
 This forest is much too valuable to end up as "lawn furniture and hot-tub 
decking," as one environmentalist says. That's why Congress needs to pass H.R. 
2866, the Headwaters Forest Act. Sponsored by Rep. Dan Hamburg (D-Ukiah), this 
bill would authorize the federal government to acquire the now-privately owned 
tract of about 44,000 acres, of which 3,800 acres are covered with dense 
ancient trees. These lands would become part of the national forest system and 
thus subject to stricter federal logging rules, including a ban on taking 
old-growth trees. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bill passes after it goes to the House floor this month, the question 
of how to finance such an expensive purchase will come to the fore. The measure 
allows for purchase of the property outright with federal funds or a 
debt-for-nature swap. The latter approach is now employed in some developing 
countries to halt deforestation. It may make just as much sense in California, 
especially in an era of scarce federal dollars. The debt in this case is the 
$1.6-billion federal bail-out in 1988 of Hurwitz's United Savings Assn. of 
Texas, one of the most expensive savings and loan failures in U.S history. That 
debt, or some portion of it, could be exchanged for the Headwaters Forest. 
Either approach -- debt swap or outright purchase -- is acceptable. The 
important thing is to act before these precious trees disappear.

BENJAMIN CHAVIS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "No Time for NAACP to Make a 'Safe' Choice," Opinion, Aug. 28: 
</P>
<P>
 Prof. Derrick Bell has once again scored a "home run," in my opinion. Where 
would African Americans, in particular, and all other Americans be if we always 
had only "safe" persons to lead us in doing the right thing? Those women and 
men who make a difference in the lives of people are those whose philosophy and 
"ways of doing" are, oftentimes, unconventional at best. 
</P>
<P>
 I, like Bell, am gravely concerned with the plight of all the dispossessed in 
this country, but particularly those who are black. 
</P>
<P>
 As a longtime member of the NAACP, I am hopeful that former executive director 
Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. will be replaced by a person with vision, experience in 
working with all kinds of people, and one who is not enshrouded with the "safe" 
mantle, but one who is committed to continuing the long struggle in making 
America a "safe" haven for respecting the diversity that should be a hallmark 
of this republic. 
</P>

 I am sad to see yet another fine institution such as the NAACP come under the 
severe and often sensationalized scrutiny of the American mainstream media. 
Even though the alleged actions of one individual have brought this type of 
focus on the NAACP, the group has successfully come through this difficult time 
with its integrity intact. 
</P>
<P>
 The quick, decisive and appropriate measures taken against Chavis should serve 
as a model for other organizations, government, etc., in dealing with these and 
other serious issues in the future.

CLAS TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Don't Let CLAS Die in a Political Deadlock," Commentary, Aug. 26: 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to what the UC Berkeley think tank directors say, CLAS deserves to 
die. Among other things, students should be judged by their ability to 
understand and recall facts rather than on their ability to make personal 
connections.When I ride in an airplane, I care if the assembler understood the 
designer's directions, not whether or not he remembered a time his grandfather 
built a treehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 As an English teacher, I know students who understand the CLAS literature 
selection quite well, but write responses that only rephrase or are considered 
simplistic. Their scores would falsely indicate an inability to read 
adequately. Conversely, as some of my gifted students have told me, students 
need only get the main idea, and write in florid phrases in order to score 
well, though they had very little idea of what the complete piece said. This is 
hardly a test of reading ability; it is an IQ test. 
</P>
<P>
 On these conclusions our students are being misjudged. CLAS is a 
multimillion-dollar boondoggle.

CRIME BILL AND GUN CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Weary Senate OKs Crime Bill After a GOP Challenge Fails," Aug. 26: 
</P>
<P>
 I am so thrilled that the crime bill passed (at last!) and so angry with those 
who tried to derail it. Some congressmen do not seem to understand or care what 
it is like to live in an urban area. 
</P>
<P>
 As a fifth-grade teacher at an elementary school in a federal housing project 
in Downtown Los Angeles, I have heard my students for years ask why our 
government can't do something about the drugs, gangs and guns. They couldn't 
understand who could be against the Brady bill either. They will be relieved 
that this crime bill passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, those Republicans who spoke of "pork" should live in a housing project 
for one week to talk to the people and see what it is like to live there. We 
need to give these young people something positive to say yes to, not something 
negative like gangs and drugs. Prevention is as important as punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a word in support of President Clinton. His message is reaching my 
students. For years I have had my students write about why they are proud to 
live in the U.S. The usual answers are freedom, good schools and amusement 
parks. But in April a number of my students (mainly boys) wrote they were proud 
"to have a President who cares about everybody" or "who wants to help us." 
President Clinton is giving these young Americans hope.

indiscriminate ownership of weapons of all kinds.

 I'm writing in response to Susan Estrich's article (Opinion, Aug. 28). She, 
the President and the media continue to portray the National Rifle Assn. as 
some kind of special interest group made up of a group of millionaires. They 
couldn't be further from the truth. The NRA is made up of over 3.5 million 
hard-working Americans who believe the Bill of Rights should not be infringed 
upon. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds that Estrich says the NRA receives are from meager donations, 
usually in the $25 to $50 range, that we hard-working Americans send in so that 
our voice can be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 The NRA is made up of Americans in the truest form, unlike those that are 
ready to give up their freedoms for a little safety. Benjamin Franklin said, 
"Those that give up liberty for a little safety deserve neither safety nor 
liberty."

'COMFORT WOMEN': NO COMFORT OR JUSTICE; JAPAN'S CHANGING APPROACH ON ITS 
WARTIME AGGRESSION AVOIDS THE FORCED-PROSTITUTION ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aug. 15, 1995, will mark the 50th anniversary of Japan's surrender to the 
Allies in World War II. Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's government says that 
by then it hopes to have launched a 10-year, $1-billion program created to show 
that Japan is ready to "face squarely" the implications of its aggression in 
Asia in the first half of this century, beginning with its brutal colonization 
of Korea in 1910 and extending through its military conquests of the early 
1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the plan are vague. All that's known for now is that there are to 
be scholarly exchanges with other Asian countries and financing of vocational 
training centers for women in the Philippines and maybe elsewhere. But, on a 
matter that is becoming a test of Japan's ability to frankly face its 
militaristic past, nothing is planned to directly compensate those survivors 
from among the estimated 200,000 women taken from Korea, the Philippines and 
other occupied lands who were forced to become sex slaves for Japan's army. 
</P>
<P>
 The Foreign Ministry indicates that a compensation fund for the women might be 
raised from donations made by individuals and companies. This approach seeks to 
satisfy what the government now, years after the existence of the 
euphemistically named "comfort women" program first became known, acknowledges 
to be a terrible wrong. But at the same time it continues to insulate the 
government from official responsibility for the crime. That's fully in keeping 
with the earlier official response, which tried to portray the sex slave 
industry as being run by private business. Only when a Japanese historian 
released documents from military archives showing that the brothels were in 
fact run by the military did the Foreign Ministry finally acknowledge the 
government's role. 
</P>
<P>
 A refusal to consider direct compensation is justified on the ground that 
various financial agreements made with other Asian countries since the war have 
settled the issue. But few if any of the women who suffered so greatly received 
any money because few if any entered a claim for compensation. Until recently, 
in fact, a deep sense of shame led the surviving victims to keep silent about 
what they had endured. Now, with the truth exposed and responsibility for what 
happened clearly established, simple justice demands compensation for the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Any step taken by Japan to improve relations with countries that were its 
wartime victims is welcome. At the same time Japan's continuing, 
government-fostered refusal to honestly examine and openly discuss the full 
record of its wartime behavior remains deeply troubling. If the approaching 
50th anniversary of the war's end doesn't at last encourage mature and candid 
study and public discussion, what will?

WILSON ON EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A comment on schools by Gov. Pete Wilson in his interview with columnist 
George Skelton (Aug. 25), that the worst classroom culprit is lack of parental 
motivation, which is "much more important than money," calls for a response 
from the state's largest advocacy organization for children and families, the 
California State Parent-Teacher Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 What Gov. Wilson sees as a lack of parental motivation is more likely the 
result of the economic realities family life in the 1990s -- joblessness, 
poverty, two-income families, single-parent families, parents who must commute 
to work and, yes, the frustration of many parents with the educational 
system.The fact is, most parents want and pursue the very best education 
available for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst culprit in our classrooms is the lack of commitment to quality 
education on the part of the elected officials, employers, employees and 
taxpayers of California. One solution to the problem is for school districts, 
school administrators and teachers to encourage and welcome parents as partners 
in the classroom and in the educational system. Another solution is for the 
governor and the Legislature to provide the financial support that will raise 
California from its position of 40th out of 50 states in spending per pupil.

PERSPECTIVE ON LABOR; MOVE BEYOND THE 1929 MIND-SET; SEEK NEW WAYS TO REACH 
PART-TIME, TEMPORARY WORKERS AND FOCUS ON MORE EFFECTIVE METHODS FOR DISPUTE 
RESOLUTION.

 This Labor Day marks another year of a pattern in employment relationships 
that has eroded the collective-bargaining process between labor and management. 
In the 1980s and the early '90s, the most significant protection available to 
the American worker shifted to the non-union sector, which now constitutes 85% 
of the work force. This is a dramatic shift since the mid-1950s when unions 
represented 35% of all workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for this change are complex. But among the most fundamental are 
the composition of the work force and the rise of new industries. Twenty-four 
percent of U.S. employees are contingent workers, those who are employed on a 
part-time or temporary basis, and they are appreciably less likely to be 
organized in unions. Moreover, in industries like trucking, where the 
International Brotherhood of Teamsters was once regarded as the country's 
strongest union, the transformation of some employees into independent 
contractors has meant the loss of labor law coverage for them. 
</P>
<P>
 These workers are not easy for unions and the collective-bargaining process to 
reach. The problem is compounded by the presence of illegal immigrant workers. 
They are afraid to protest sub-standard employment conditions and afraid to 
support an independent relationship between labor and management because of the 
threat of deportation. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is not just the new workers that pose obstacles to collective 
bargaining. Employer resistance to unionization in the service industry is 
fueled by the prospect of increased labor costs that cannot be absorbed by 
improved productivity and thus may be passed on to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, new high-tech industries -- California's Silicon Valley was the 
first dramatic illustration -- constitute unfamiliar terrain for organized 
labor. For the unions, the problem is as formidable as that encountered during 
the Great Depression, when the industrial unions formed to recruit in the 
mass-production industries of auto, steel, rubber and aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the 1980s and '90s, the emergence of new, union-free firms has occurred 
simultaneously with the demise of traditional union strongholds in 
manufacturing and transportation due to foreign competition and deregulation. 
Many employers, through means both legitimate as well as unlawful, have become 
more skillful in warding off union-organizing campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Law -- indeed, the law for which I have had responsibility for administering 
the past six months -- has been a factor because of its weakness and loopholes. 
In the 1980s, the National Labor Relations Board was hijacked by those who were 
openly hostile to the National Labor Relations Act's 60-year-old public policy 
in support of collective bargaining. The Reagan-Bush era was characterized by 
pro-employer one-sidedness and the failure to provide the evenhanded neutrality 
that is critical to the rule of law in a democratic society. 
</P>
<P>
 But the irony is that just as employers found themselves free of unions, 
workplace problems have been exaggerated by an avalanche of litigation under 
various statutes and judge-made law. The challenge is to make the employment 
relationship more fair and equitable and one in which employees have a genuine 
opportunity to opt for collective bargaining. Simultaneously, we must rid 
employers of archaic and inflexible work rules as well as multiple rounds of 
employment-related litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Labor Relations Board can help by expediting its procedures and 
seeking prompt and tough relief in the courts against serious unfair labor 
practices by both employers and unions. Congress, through sensibly balanced 
legislation, and the board, operating within existing law, should foster 
cooperative relationships in both the union and non-union arena. The goal of 
global competitiveness dictates enhancement of communication, participation and 
both information- and decision-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than focus a disproportionate amount of attention on the right to 
strike -- the absence of which remains an anomaly and scandal for a democratic 
society because strikers can be permanently replaced -- policy-makers should be 
looking for more rational bases for resolving disputes through mediation and 
advisory arbitration and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Congress can redeem the promise of the National Labor Relations Act 
through such measures as providing both unions and employers the opportunity to 
communicate with workers about the benefits or lack thereof of unionization on 
company property. Under existing law, the board must find ways to make 
collective bargaining available to the working poor whose only opportunities 
are in part-time or temporary jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In cases where the negotiation of the initial labor contract is stalemated 
from the beginning, the board should have the authority to order the parties to 
proceed to arbitration. More often than not, representation without contractual 
protection is completely meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 What the country needs this Labor Day are new approaches that reject 
contemporary assumptions about the employment relationship, assumptions 
fostered in the entirely different era of the Great Depression. Mutual respect 
and interdependence can never be imposed by government, but the impartial 
administration of law can promote more harmonious relationships than exist at 
present. That will assist our nation's need to reduce the divisiveness and 
acrimony that both erode a productive and effective economy and fail to promote 
fairness.

 Like the Dred Scott, Plessy vs. Ferguson and Korematsu cases, the 1993 
decision in Shaw vs. Reno is proving to be another landmark holding about race 
in American life that the Supreme Court got all wrong. In the name of resisting 
"political apartheid," the court now subjects all majority-black and Latino 
congressional districts to the strictest kind of scrutiny when they have a 
"bizarre" appearance on a map. This outburst of judicial activism by the 
court's conservatives was targeted dead-center at the Voting Rights Act's 
success in promoting minority political power. It is now causing chaos in the 
lower courts and threatens to set back progress in civil rights for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, Shaw gave whites the presumptive right not to be made the racial 
minority in legislative districts whose boundaries are visually unappealing. 
Never before in American history had the court found that a district's 
appearance on a map could determine its constitutionality. Of course, if Shaw 
is to be the new standard, it is only a matter of time before blacks and 
Latinos demand the corresponding right not to be minorities in oddly shaped 
"white" districts. Yet such a result is logically impossible because, in our 
multiracial society, some group is always in the minority, and in a country 
that has practiced gerrymandering from day one, nearly every district looks 
bizarre to someone. 
</P>
<P>
 The court has not yet faced that paradox because Shaw's progeny -- an 
explosion of lawsuits in Louisiana, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Texas, 
California and Maryland -- challenge only "minority" districts. In the 
Louisiana case, a federal court recently considered the majority-black district 
of Cleo Fields, the youngest member of the House of Representatives. The court 
did not even bother to hear the complaining witnesses before it invoked Shaw to 
eliminate his district as a racial gerrymander, likely forcing the talented 
freshman representative to run for reelection in a majority-white district. 
Nearly 20 other minority members of Congress now face a similar fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw thus threatens to stifle the development of a generation of African 
American and Latino leaders that sees beyond race. The hard reality is that 
racially polarized voting still makes it tough on qualified minority candidates 
running in majority-white districts. But minority districts create both greater 
minority electoral success and greater competition and diversity within those 
communities. Moreover, the new generation of leaders emerging from America's 
history of essentially all-white rule in Congress is both serious about 
interracial coalitions and passionate about minority interests. 
</P>
<P>
 As these new leaders struggle to hang onto their seats, the logic of Shaw 
produces a perverse incentive for them to favor residential segregation. The 
decision disfavors unsightly districts, but no one knows how or where to draw a 
pretty line. As far as the states can make out, the decision means that 
districts designed to give minorities a chance to elect representatives of 
their choice may not meander across great distances. Latinos and blacks are 
permitted to be the majority of a district's population only when they live 
apart from whites en masse -- insular and ghettoized. Thus, it is Shaw, not the 
new minority districts, that promotes a true "political apartheid" based on 
residency. 
</P>
<P>
 The litigation spawned by Shaw is now headed back to the Supreme Court. 
Minority districts have begun to fall, with three more declared 
unconstitutional in Texas in August. The Texas court, amazingly, upheld 
bizarre-looking districts carved out to protect mostly white incumbents even as 
it threw out bizarre-looking districts shaped to facilitate nonwhite 
participation. Fortunately, a week earlier the Supreme Court put the very 
conservative Louisiana ruling on hold until it could hear the case on appeal. 
There's also some hope in a ruling that recently upheld the districts 
represented by Mel Watt and Eva Clayton, North Carolina's first black 
representatives since Reconstruction. That decision found that the two oddly 
shaped majority-black districts could withstand scrutiny since they were 
intended to overcome Voting Rights Act violations. But even the North Carolina 
court faced a strong dissent from a judge who would have thrown out these two 
districts, the most racially integrated in the state's history. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Supreme Court addresses these cases in the coming months, one can 
only hope that the conservative justices take the measure of the disaster they 
have created and drop this dubious enterprise.

PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE; CLOUDING THE SIMPSON DNA ISSUE: LET THE NUMBERS GAMES 
COMMENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES BRENNER, Charles Brenner is a mathematician who has been working in 
DNA identification since the procedures were developed eight years ago. He has 
consulted for Cellmark. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Determining whether or not the DNA profile of blood samples taken from the 
crime scene matches that of O.J. Simpson is only half the battle. Then the 
numbers games can begin. 
</P>
<P>
 A DNA test is, in essence, an examination of certain physical traits. In this 
sense, the forensic expert's testimony that the blood stain at the crime scene 
matches that of the suspect is akin to an eyewitness' statement that a 
defendant "looks like" the person seen committing the crime. But the analogy 
will only stretch so far. 
</P>
<P>
 A DNA match means similarity for each of a handful of specific traits. It is 
as if an eyewitness asserts that the faces of suspect and of perpetrator share 
a certain mole and color of eyes but that the witness is unable to observe skin 
color, shape of nose or texture of eyebrows and many other features that add up 
to an impression of facial identity. Consequently, the format of DNA evidence 
presented in court will be unfamiliar to jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 An ordinary eyewitness might claim "100% positively" that the suspect is the 
perpetrator of the crime. Such a person is simple to understand though not 
altogether believable. Jurors may discount the witness' claim of certitude -- 
to say, 95% -- in light of their experience in judging people and other 
evidence presented at trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The forensic expert presenting DNA evidence, on the other hand, may be 100% 
believable in asserting that the crime sample and reference (suspect) sample 
match ("look alike") with respect to certain traits. But the expert admits 
"doubt" when he says that DNA profiles from different sources may have a small 
chance ("match probability") of looking alike. It is not obvious to a juror 
what relationship, if any, the expert's "doubt" has to an eyewitness' 
credibility. Our intuition doesn't easily digest numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The most frequently repeated confusion concerns the meaning of "match 
probability." For example, a recent news story reported that some preliminary 
blood analysis in the Simpson case indicated a match probability of 1/100 -- 
meaning, two samples share a blood type that only one person in 100 has. In 
elaborating on the meaning of the match, the story explained that the chances 
of the two samples coming from different sources was 1 in 100. 
</P>
<P>
 The two statements may sound similar but they do not assert the same thing. 
Match probability assumes different sources, then asks: What is the chance of a 
match? This is only one step toward answering the critical and converse 
question, which can only be answered by a jury: Assuming two blood samples 
match, what is the chance that they came from different people? 
</P>
<P>
 Match probability is a statistical fact about a particular blood type, 
determined by surveying the population. By contrast, the chance that the 
samples come from different sources depends also on what is known about the 
circumstances. For example, if there is good reason to believe that the suspect 
was a continent away at the time the crime stain was made, that does affect the 
odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Or consider the math attached to the two DNA technologies -- PCR and RFLP -- 
in use for forensic analysis. PCR is newer, less firmly established and 
generally less discriminating than RFLP tests. 
</P>
<P>
 But PCR has some advantages, the most salient of which is that it can be 
applied to much smaller blood samples. Therefore, the most critical evidence in 
the Simpson case may well be match probabilities based on PCR typing. You can 
be sure that both prosecution and defense are now considering the following 
scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose a lab performs a battery of four or five different PCR tests on a 
critical blood sample. Assume, also, that some crime-scene DNA sample turns out 
to match Simpson's. There will be two possible explanations: a) the DNA, in 
fact, comes from Simpson's blood or, b) it comes from someone who 
coincidentally shares Simpson's DNA profile. 
</P>
<P>
 To assist the jury in weighing these possibilities, the prosecution's DNA 
expert will quantify the coincidence as, say, 1 in 10,000 if the "someone" is a 
random, unrelated person. It will be intriguing to watch how the defense subtly 
stresses the assumption "unrelated" and tactfully manages to insinuate the 
unspeakable but beneficial hypothesis that the crime-scene DNA might come from 
a relative of Simpson's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unrelated, you say?" asks the defense. "Then the odds would change if we 
considered a relative?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," replies the forensic scientist. "Relatives automatically have 
some DNA traits in common, so there is less remaining to explain as 
coincidence." 
</P>
<P>
 "Purely hypothetically then, and not for a moment suggesting that a Simpson 
relative, say his son, could have committed anything so heinous as murder -- 
but just for the sake of illustration, what would be the chance of a match 
between him and his father?" 
</P>
<P>
 "In this sample from the crime scene were left by Simpson's son, parent, even 
sibling, there would be a 1 in 200 chance that Simpson's would also match it." 
</P>
<P>
 The results from Cellmark Diagnostics will be based on RFLP analysis. When the 
outcome is known, it will either be a mismatch (everybody goes home) or a match 
probability in the range of one in 10 million to one in a billion. 
</P>
<P>
 These are intimidating numbers, but the defense has many ways to shave them -- 
excluding some tests, disputing the statistics, challenging the statistical 
methodology. The matching odds -- whether 200 to 1 or 10,000 to 1 -- are 
obtained by "cascading" (i.e., multiplying) inferences from a handful of 
individual tests each with very modest evidentiary power -- odds of perhaps 
only 3 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in two recent appellate decisions in Northern California, the courts 
disallowed multiplication, holding that such a calculation fails to meet the 
Kelly-Frye standard of uniformly accepted practice in the scientific community. 
The impression of scientific dissent that influenced the rulings was due to the 
heterodoxy expressed in a single scientific paper, notwithstanding voluminous 
data, as well as logic, supporting the majority view. 
</P>
<P>
 If such a ruling were repeated in the Simpson case, the weight of the DNA 
evidence would appear to be severely limited. It is a fair bet that telephones 
of the dissenting scholars have already begun to ring.

REBUILDING RULES PREVAIL; MERCHANTS MUST HIRE GUARDS, SHORTEN HOURS IF THEY 
WANT TO SELL LIQUOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERESTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the past several months, Jae Yul Kim has watched as building contractors 
have pieced his livelihood back together. A liquor store owner whose 
South-Central establishment was destroyed in the 1992 riots, Kim anxiously 
awaits the day when his business, which he plans to reopen as a grocery store 
stocking only small quantities of alcohol, rises from the ashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other liquor store owners who are rebuilding or hoping to rebuild 
their businesses, Kim had hoped for the passage of Assembly Bill 1974, which 
would have lifted two of the costliest conditions imposed by the city on those 
wishing to rebuild damaged liquor stores -- mandatory security guards and 
shortened business hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the controversial bill proposed by Assemblyman Paul Horcher 
(R-Diamond Bar) failed by a 7-4 vote last week in the Assembly Local Government 
Committee, Kim resigned himself to doing the best he can under the strict 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I do?" said Kim, who has been surviving with the assistance of his 
adult children, one of whom dropped out of college after the riots to help 
support the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping we could have saved some money, but we'll just have to pay," 
said Kim, noting that hiring a security guard could cost him close to $100 a 
day. "I'm a good citizen and business owner. A person can't fight the city. I 
have no other choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Of 175 Korean-owned liquor and convenience stores destroyed in the riots, only 
about 50 have gone through the public hearing process required by the city to 
rebuild, said Mehee Kim, director of the Korean American Grocers' Victims' 
Assn. So far, just 10 of those have reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had the bill passed, it would have been easier for them to rebuild their 
stores," she said. "But they've done the fighting part. Now it's time for them 
to rebuild their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment, a 
federally funded drug and alcohol abuse prevention organization based in 
South-Central, the failure of AB 1974 was a big victory. Since before the 
riots, the group has been working to cut back on the number of liquor stores in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had it passed, there would have been a mess," said Karen Bass, executive 
director of the coalition. "Lots of people in the community wanted to begin 
picketing and boycotting liquor stores." 
</P>
<P>
 Bass said that the heavy concentration of liquor stores in South-Central 
increased crime and social problems, in part, because of fierce competition 
between merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They become irresponsible, selling to minors and people who are already 
drunk," she said. "They ignore that gang members are hanging out, and that 
there is drug traffic. What you end up with in some settings is an outdoor 
bar." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jae Yul Kim admits that a rough crowd that used to loiter near his store at 
the corner of Arlington and Vernon avenues disappeared when the business went 
up in flames. However, he said increased police presence in the area, rather 
than the absence of his store, is what drove the loiterers away. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, Kim is rebuilding his business as a grocery store because he wants 
to abide by the wishes of the community, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "My store used to be 40% to 50% liquor," he said. "Now I will only carry 10% 
liquor. I'll have more meat, more produce. I know the community doesn't want so 
much liquor." Even with the reduced liquor sales, Kim's store will still be 
subject to the regulations requiring a security guard and curtailed hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass said switching to a mini-market is one positive way for former liquor 
store owners to adapt to the needs of South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of small markets that don't sell liquor," she said. "They stay 
in business. People here don't always have cars, so they need more stores like 
this."  
</P>
<P>
 Of the 10 Korean-owned liquor stores that have reopened since the riots, four 
came back as new businesses, according to Mehee Kim. Two took advantage of a 
city ordinance waiving sewer hookup fees for riot victims and returned as 
self-service laundries. One large liquor store in Compton successfully reopened 
as a six-store mini-mall. However, one merchant who attempted to reopen as a 
shoe store went out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Korean merchants prefer to stick to liquor stores out of fear of failing 
in another business, said Pat Wong, who runs the Korean Youth and Community 
Center's Alliance for Neighborhood Economic Development, a program originally 
started to help liquor store owners convert to other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a class of merchants who are not from the merchant 
class," she said. "They came to this country and couldn't find white-collar 
jobs. They are educated, but they are not business people. They knew how to run 
their stores, but as far as growing and diversifying or applying those skills 
to other businesses, they don't know how."

HOME COURT DISADVANTAGE; LOCAL YOUTHS PLAY BASKETBALL IN THE HEAT ON CRACKED 
ASPHALT WHILE OUT-OF-TOWNERS WITH PERMITS USE WELL-KEPT AREA GYMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Not many basketballs bounced off the asphalt courts in East Los Angeles on a 
recent Sunday. Just a couple of boys shot a few hoops at El Sereno's outdoor 
recreational center, but with temperatures in the 90s, the court was as hot as 
a pancake griddle. 
</P>
<P>
 They might have sought relief at the better-maintained gyms of their local 
schools, but those courts have been filled this summer by groups from as far 
away as Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very discouraging to see the local kids playing on the asphalt and 
outsiders playing in the gym," said Otis Yette, athletic director at Garfield 
High. Instead of playing inside at nearby Garfield on weekends, he said, 
youngsters play at Belvedere Park, north of the school on the other side of the 
Pomona Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult and youth groups from outside the area use school gyms through a permit 
process run by the Los Angeles Unified School District. While fees paid by the 
adult groups help cover gym maintenance, some say the permit process is unfair 
to Eastside youths. Youths looking for a pickup game must play on outdoor 
courts in the heat, compete for the few indoor courts at recreational centers 
or look to the streets to fill their time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids (today) will slip into these little gangs and they turn around and 
destroy the community," said Rourke Huff, Lincoln High's basketball and track 
coach. "When you don't have anything to do you get in trouble." Huff, 41, 
recalled that there were plenty of tournaments and athletic programs to join 
when he was growing up in the late 1960s in Lincoln Heights. "If you've got a 
gym for kids to play basketball, they'll stay out of trouble and at least 
parents know where their kids are." 
</P>
<P>
 Adriane Alvarez, a 1992 Wilson High graduate and now the school's head junior 
varsity and assistant varsity basketball coach, grew up in City Terrace with 
friends who showed an interest in basketball but turned to gangs. As 
youngsters, he said, they played basketball on outside courts that were covered 
by a dome. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a while they didn't want to play anymore because they saw others who 
had inside gyms. I know when I was growing up I wanted to play on a nice court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is safer to play inside because if you take a fall on the outside courts 
you can scrape a knee against the gravel. The surface is uneven," Alvarez said. 
"If you fall inside, the worst that can happen is you'll slide across the 
floor." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our outside facilities are pathetic," agreed Huff. "There are busted wine and 
beer bottles all over and there are cracks in the pavement from the 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, an open-play policy coexisted with the permit policy, said 
Eddie Barreras, an employee of Youth Services, which operated open play, 
allowing the facilities to remain open after school, evenings and Saturday 
afternoons. The program, coordinated through the school district's permit 
office, paid for a gym supervisor but was scrapped during budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the gyms are only available through the permit process, which doesn't 
allow for informal, or pickup games, nor does it allow the freedom to play 
beyond an allotted time, Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized youth groups are not charged gym rental to play, but a minimum of 12 
individuals is required to apply for a permit. Small groups must play a minimum 
of two hours to make it worthwhile for someone to supervise play, while larger 
associations and leagues can play six hours or up to an entire day, for 
instance when tournaments are held. The gyms can be rented until 9:30 p.m. 
Monday through Saturday and from noon to 5 p.m. Sunday. School athletic events 
have priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult groups, which must have at least 12 players as well, pay almost $19 an 
hour for a large gym, about $17.50 an hour for a small gym and a onetime 
processing fee of about $21, said Mary Lou Del Campo, principal clerk at the 
school district's Civic Center permit office. Applications must be submitted at 
least 1 1/2 months before each four-month rental period. 
</P>
<P>
 The permit fees are put in the Board of Education's general account. Although 
Del Campo could not disclose the total amount earned, she said the adult groups 
generate enough money to cover gym maintenance costs but the district loses 
money by not charging youth groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they first eliminated open play," said Barreras, "kids would come up to 
the gym but there would be a league playing. When they saw they weren't going 
to be able to play, they quit coming." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding up enough youths to play regularly and paying for a permit are 
daunting, some say. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were usually only two or three of us playing basketball, so it was not 
worth it to (get a permit for) a gym," said Lupe Rodriguez. Rodriguez graduated 
from Garfield last year and lives across the street from the school. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her friends usually play once or twice a week at Belvedere Park or 
look for some hardwood at Garfield High. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were always people in there (in Garfield's main gym), so you really 
couldn't use it," she said. Instead, Rodriguez said, she and her friends play 
in the school's smaller, cramped gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, we did mind that the courts were rented because most of the time 
those groups weren't from our school," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gardena, Thousand Oaks, San Gabriel, Alhambra -- they come from everywhere, 
Huff said. "I can see why the community is (upset). You can't use the gym but 
you pay your taxes," Huff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Cantu, Wilson's varsity basketball and baseball coach, said that the 
Mules' gym is always in demand. The school has hosted events during the last 
few Watts Summer Games and has an eight-page summer sign-up list, with paying 
groups like the Hollenbeck police division and the Landau Lawyers League. 
</P>
<P>
 Even high school basketball players have difficulty accessing gyms in the 
summer. Huff's Lincoln High boys basketball team members practice at Lincoln 
Park because the school gym cannot accommodate all the school's athletic teams, 
including the volleyball team seeking to use the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Every afternoon, Huff shepherds his players to Lincoln Park's indoor gym, 
where they are only allowed to practice for 30 to 40 minutes because even that 
gym is in demand. They once played 10 minutes over their allotted time limit 
and were put on probation by the park's recreational center. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastside parents often talk of starting athletic leagues, but the 
organizations seldom materialize, Cantu said. "I don't know why we haven't 
started these programs that we had in the '70s and early '80s," he said. "The 
need is here and the kids are here." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to prioritize our area," he said. "It needs to be understood that the 
people here should have first choice in the use of the facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of leagues and places to play basketball, Huff said, affects the 
quality and number of players he recruits for his teams. "If there was a gym 
the kids would stay, but they are bused out," he said. "They go to the (San 
Fernando) Valley where there are better facilities."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: USC; ONE-STOP REFERRAL CENTER ASSISTS AREA

 USC just made information shopping easier. 
</P>
<P>
 The USC Neighborhood Resource Center serves the community as a one-stop, 
bilingual information and referral center for social, educational and health 
services offered by USC and a network of other organizations.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have some of the best kept secrets that the community is not aware of," 
said Elizabeth Diaz, a former chief deputy to Councilman Mike Hernandez who now 
heads the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in the University Village Shopping Center at Hoover Street and 
Jefferson Boulevard, the center is administered by the USC School of Social 
Work. It is funded by a $500,000 grant from USC alumnus George Handtmann. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a partnership with the Info Line of Los Angeles County, the center 
assists residents and organizations within an area bounded by Washington 
Boulevard on the north, Vernon Avenue on the south, Main Street on the east and 
Western Avenue on the west. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the time people need information, but don't know where to get it," 
Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, one service rarely tapped is the 19-year-old USC James A. 
Peterson Human Relations Center, which provides low-cost therapy for children, 
adolescents, adults and senior citizens who are having personal or 
family-related problems.  
</P>
<P>
 Info Line specialists refer callers to that organization's database of more 
than 4,500 human service providers in Los Angeles County, and also to about 200 
USC-sponsored programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Early next year, USC graduate students in social work, education, dentistry, 
medicine, nursing and public administration will help assess which needs 
require more than a referral. They will develop a client profile and develop a 
plan of assistance.  
</P>
<P>
 Diaz said many of the calls the center has received since it opened in May 
have been from people seeking emergency housing and food. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Arias, 28, said the resource center was "heaven sent" when he found 
himself unemployed and with a stack of bills. Arias was referred to the center 
by the city Housing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 A staff member at the center referred Arias to a South-Central housing project 
director who found Arias, his wife and daughter a two-bedroom apartment for 
$450 a month near Florence Avenue and Broadway.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's exactly what I needed," said Arias, who is seeking employment in civil 
service. "The center is invaluable. More people should know about it."

 Los Angeles Southwest College has entered a new era of education with a 
three-story Technical Education Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The $7-million facility, known as the TEC Building, is the first in a series 
of construction projects coming to the college in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of our equipment will be on the cutting edge," said Thomas Baldwin, 
instructor of computer technology and automated manufacturing. "In our 
computer-integrated manufacturing program, we will have three automated robots 
on an assembly line. Two or three people will be able to run an entire 
production line from there." 
</P>
<P>
 The effect that the new facility will have on the community will be 
significant, said Earnastine Thomas-Robertson, dean of academic affairs in 
vocational and technical education. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas-Robertson said that not only will the college be able to serve more 
students with the building's opening, but the students that come out of the 
specialized programs will also be more marketable. Computer-integrated 
programming, automated manufacturing, computer-aided drafting and computer 
science are some of the programs that will be expanded or added to the 
college's fall curriculum.  
</P>
<P>
 The TEC Building is the campus's first new structure since the first permanent 
classrooms were built in 1978. The next project at the 6,000-student college 
will begin in October when ground is broken for a gymnasium. ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; 3 GENERATIONS TURN TO COUNSELING CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Christine Caraway had her hands full. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of six, all with learning disabilities, was living in poverty in 
the heart of Watts in the mid-1960s and didn't know where to turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd go to church and to the schools, but they didn't know what to say and 
do," Caraway, 64, recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the one-room Kaiser Permanente Watts Counseling and Learning Center 
opened in 1967, Caraway took her youngest two children, both of whom also had 
behavioral problems, there for help. 
</P>
<P>
 And like the rest of the parents who enrolled their children in the free 
counseling programs, she was obliged to participate in support groups to 
discuss her children's progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out I was the cause of a lot of their problems. I didn't realize I 
had a drinking problem until they showed me," said Caraway, a 17-year 
recovering alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of clients later, staff members still help parents at 
monthly meetings, educating them about self-esteem, establishing discipline and 
determining what to expect from their children at different stages of 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "A goal of ours is for parents to be competent and use their skills through 
educational development of their children," said Martha Watson, who has been 
with the center for 13 years and is in charge of counseling, after-school and 
internship programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Coggins, the center's founder and director, recalled that first parent 
discussion group. "They dealt with a gamut of problems in order to survive," he 
said. "It was also a social outlet in a therapeutic way because after the '65 
riots there was nothing standing here." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, he and social work professionals acted on a comment by one 
of the parents: "The parents were telling me, 'It's great what you're doing for 
the children, but parents are people too,' " Coggins said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a third generation of area residents has gotten involved with the center, 
it has come to represent a pillar in the community. The center serves about 
1,000 clients a year with a 22-member staff in an expanded building at 1465 E. 
103rd St.  
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit agency is sponsored as a community service project by Kaiser 
Foundation Hospitals, and supervised by the Clinical Services Department of 
Southern California Permanente Group. Families don't have to be Kaiser members 
to receive the center's free services.  
</P>
<P>
 Currently pursuing a degree in social work at Compton College, Annette 
Bozeman, 35, Caraway's youngest daughter, attributes much of who she is today 
to the center's counseling and education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a young African American woman, I grew up with low self-opinion," said 
Bozeman, whose daughter Keyausha Dupree, 15, is participating in a similar 
personal development group for teens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not only my family environment, but my environment as a whole," 
Bozeman said. "The center gave me a different outlook on that." 
</P>
<P>
 From the time she was 8 until she graduated from Jordan High, Bozeman went 
through different stages of counseling at the center. But it wasn't to be the 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 In spring of 1992, she saw her beauty salon of 11 years go up in flames at 
Florence Avenue and Figueroa Street during the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The transition from being self-sufficient to going into a position where I 
didn't have any income put me over the edge."  
</P>
<P>
 When the unrest subsided, Bozeman said the center was the first place she 
visited. 
</P>
<P>
 "When something bad happens to you, there is always a place where you can go. 
That's what the center is for me." ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: COUNTRY CLUB PARK; FRIENDS PAY TRIBUTE TO GAY 
ACTIVIST LEGG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a garden ceremony on the grounds of the historic Milbank Mansion, about 100 
friends gathered Aug. 28 to bid a final farewell to pioneer gay activist 
William Dorr Legg, 89, who died in his sleep July 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Legg was an educator, author, counselor and the director of ONE Inc., the gay 
rights organization he founded in 1952 that has been headquartered on the 
landmark Arlington Avenue estate for the past 10 years. He was remembered as a 
tireless leader in the battle for gay rights long before the movement gained a 
large, public following after the 1969 riot at the Stonewall bar in New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 "He devoted himself totally to the advancement of the gay and lesbian 
community. He is one of the giants of gay history," said Walter Williams, a USC 
professor of anthropology who co-edited Legg's last book, "Homophile Studies in 
Theory and Practice," published just a few months before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Legg was born in Ann Arbor, Mich., on Dec. 15, 1904, and received his 
bachelor's degree in music and his master's in landscape design from the 
University of Michigan. Eventually, he became an assistant professor at Oregon 
State University. 
</P>
<P>
 After settling in Los Angeles in 1949, he soon became involved in the city's 
fledgling gay rights movement. Along with Merton Bird, a young African American 
activist, Legg founded the Knights of the Clock, a nonprofit organization that 
provided counseling for same-sex couples. In early 1952, he joined the 
Mattachine Society, Los Angeles' first gay rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Hay, 82, who founded the Mattachine Society in 1950, remembered Legg's 
enthusiasm for the group.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of those people who, from the beginning, loved what we were doing 
and loved what was happening," Hay said. "Until the 1950s, we were (thought to 
be) heterosexuals that had been perverted. They thought we had to be cured or 
be exterminated -- either of the two." 
</P>
<P>
 It was during a 1952 Mattachine Society meeting that Legg proposed ONE 
Magazine, which became one of the nation's first gay and lesbian magazines sold 
on newsstands. Out of that idea grew ONE Inc., which provided legal referrals 
and peer counseling. Over the years, it grew to include the ONE Institute, an 
accredited college-level school providing doctorates in homophile studies, and 
the Institute for the Study of Human Resources, which funds scholarly research. 
</P>
<P>
 As Legg and others continued to write for ONE Magazine and ONE Institute 
Quarterly, the texts used in their research were accumulated into one of the 
largest gay and lesbian research libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams met Legg in 1979, while doing research in the ONE library on the 
social acceptance of gays in Native American cultures. He found that Legg, who 
had written an article on Native American homosexuality in 1959, was an expert 
on the subject. "I found out he knew a lot more about this than most people in 
anthropology," Williams said. Legg, who was the first person to teach a course 
on homosexuality at Cal State Long Beach in the early 1970s, was awarded an 
honorary doctorate from the Institute for the Study of Sexual Research in San 
Francisco in January. 
</P>
<P>
 He was buried July 29 at Forest Lawn Cemetery in the Hollywood Hills, and is 
survived by John Nojima, his partner of 30 years. LESLIE BERESTEIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WILSHIRE; GROUP SOLICITS SHOES OF GUNSHOT VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Women Against Gun Violence, a local group involved in a national effort to 
educate families about the dangers of having guns in the home and push for 
tighter restrictions on firearm sales, is collecting shooting victims' shoes 
for a Sept. 20 "Silent March" display in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization is urging local residents who have had a family member die as 
a result of gunshot wounds to turn in a pair of the victim's shoes at any one 
of six Southland collection centers, personalized with a note explaining how 
gun violence affected the family, or with a photo of the victim.A donation of 
$2 for shipping costs is also requested. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims' shoes from across the country will be put on display around the 
Capitol Reflecting Pool when Congress reconvenes for the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is to put Congress on notice in a very visual way," said Anne 
Reiss Lane, who coordinates the Los Angeles effort from Hancock Park. "Our 
mission is to change the way people think about guns." 
</P>
<P>
 Local collection points are at the Korean Youth and Community Center, 680 S. 
Wilton Place, and at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, 4182 S. 
Western Ave. Centers are also located in Lynwood, Wilmington, Montebello and 
the Westside. The deadline to turn in shoes is Wednesday.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: KOREATOWN; MURAL EVOLVES INTO A NEIGHBORLY PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERESTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until two months ago, Koreatown was something of a mystery to Tony Osumi and 
Darryl Mar, two young Asian American muralists from the Westside. Although they 
had driven through it on occasion and had studied the Korean American community 
as graduate students in UCLA's Asian American studies program, neither had much 
direct contact with the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they began work on a mural on the front wall of the Siyeon restaurant at 
721 S. Western Ave., a commission they received after winning a mural 
competition sponsored by the Social and Public Art Resource Center in Venice. 
To their pleasant surprise, they discovered that Koreatown isn't just for 
Korean Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 They originally planned a design focusing on Korean heritage that was agreed 
upon by the restaurant owner and other community representatives, but Osumi and 
Mar changed their minds after seeing groups of Asian American, African American 
and Latino children playing together on the sidewalk around them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first week when we were scraping the wall, we saw all these kids around 
us, all playing together cross-racially," said Osumi, 27, who is of Japanese 
and European descent. "We realized then that our piece was too confining in its 
approach. The mural needed to represent the community." 
</P>
<P>
 After two months of work by Osumi and Mar, plus their assistants Sergio Torres 
and Morritz Lechadores and a small army of Koreatown residents, the result was 
a unique cross-cultural piece titled "Remember Your Roots," the first of its 
kind commissioned by the Social and Public Art Resource Center. The mural was 
officially unveiled Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Osumi and Mar said they began painting based pretty much on their original 
design -- Koreans in traditional and western garb flanking Baek Du Mountain, 
the peak representing the mythological origin of the Korean people -- but added 
the faces of African American and Latino youths in the blue of the mural's 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 As the mural took shape, locals of all ages began dropping by to comment and 
make suggestions. Many ended up donning painting attire and joining the 
muralists.  
</P>
<P>
 "At one time, we had 40 people working on the mural, all races and all ages," 
said Mar, 25, a third-generation Chinese American. "The older ones wouldn't 
paint, but they would give advice." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction at the restaurant has been positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fabulous," said Peter Kwong, a restaurant consultant for Siyeon. "People 
really relate to it. Siyeon is already a landmark, and this just enhances that. 
Busloads of Korean tourists get off, go 'Wow,' and start taking pictures."  
</P>
<P>
 Angeline Rhee, a waitress at the restaurant, has heard pleased comments from 
customers on the mural's cross-cultural motif. 
</P>
<P>
 "They love it so much," she said. "They like how there are both black people 
and Korean people on the mural. It shows we're trying to work with the black 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Osumi and Mar plan to continue painting murals. Their next project will be an 
indoor mural at UCLA's Campbell Hall that will commemorate the 25th anniversary 
of the university's Asian American studies program. LESLIE BERESTEIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; DRUG USE ALLEGED AT SKID ROW TOILETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly a month after portable toilets were installed on Skid Row sidewalks, 
some social service groups and businesses have filed complaints about drug use 
and sanitation concerns with the outhouses, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toilet became a crack house the very first day it was in place" outside 
the Salvation Army's Safe Harbor, said the center's chaplain, Maj. Patricia 
Jolley. "Our staff is telling us that (people) are using cocaine in those 
houses in the evening." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Safe Harbor treats 50 women with drug or alcohol problems, Jolley said 
the smell of cocaine from the toilet could make it difficult for the patients 
to recover from their addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 She has asked that it be relocated farther down or across the street, a 
recommendation that housing officials were considering last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army's request is among four appeals that officials have 
received since the city's Board of Public Works approved spending $53,000 in 
July on a six-month pilot program. A total of 16 portable toilets were placed 
on Skid Row sidewalks in an area bounded by 2nd and 7th streets, Gladys Avenue 
and Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 James Washington, chief street use inspector, said it's too early to determine 
whether cleanliness on Skid Row has improved since the toilets were installed. 
But Washington has heard from police, who say the program is working. "The 
individuals are using (toilets) and some of the concerns about urination on the 
public walls there are declining," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The toilets are "a godsend" for the homeless, said Vernon Spaulding, 
management analyst for the city's housing department. 
</P>
<P>
 Though drug needles and syringes have been found inside some of the toilets, 
Spaulding said, no figures are available as to how many were recovered and no 
arrests have been made for drug use inside the outhouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Spaulding is working to resolve the other three appeals -- from Lan 
Jer Lin and Hsi Shong Lin, owners of a wholesale electronic, housewares and 
Asian goods shop at 372-376 S. Los Angeles St.; Fred Jordan Missions at 445 
Towne Ave., and Asian Rehabilitation Services at 601 S. San Pedro St. 
</P>
<P>
 They cite concerns ranging from odor from the toilets to the structures 
attracting more homeless in front of businesses. No toilets have been placed 
outside Fred Jordan Missions and Asian Rehabilitation Services pending 
consideration of alternative sites for the outhouses, Spaulding said. 
</P>
<P>
 All four appeals might be heard by the public works board at 9:30 a.m. 
Wednesday, he said. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: ECHO PARK/SILVER LAKE; LUCKY DOGS GET A 1-YEAR 
LEASH-OFF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The dog days of summer have taken on a literal meaning at the recreation area 
next to Silver Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local residents and those from surrounding Echo Park have argued over 
whether to turn the center into a dog park, where canines can roam leash-free. 
</P>
<P>
 After a recent two-hour community meeting, City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg 
tossed dog-park proponents a bone by agreeing to a one-year pilot project that 
calls for fencing off a section of the center for the animals and their owners 
as of Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not committed to making it permanent," Goldberg told a group of more 
than 150. "We're going to try as best we can for a year" and then consider 
making the dog area permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver Lake resident David Wayne Louie, who was originally opposed to turning 
the whole center into a dog park, said, "This is a nice compromise. It's going 
to keep all the people happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would actually bring my dog to that park," said Louie, a 46-year-old former 
police officer who owns a retired police dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the pilot project will be worked out after consultation with the 
city attorney's office. Meanwhile, Goldberg has asked parks officials to put up 
a fence by the middle of this month that would separate the grassy field -- 
where dogs can roam without a leash -- from a children's sandlot and basketball 
court, said Goldberg's field director, Carmen Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee made up of local residents will also hold meetings to determine 
regulations for use of the park and enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be the third such park in Los Angeles County where leash laws are 
exempt. The others are in Laurel Canyon in Studio City and in Long Beach; no 
major problems have been reported in either place, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Krebs, a 40-year-old Echo Park resident and owner of three Labrador 
retrievers, believes Goldberg's proposal will work as long as aggressive dogs 
are restricted from the park and owners act responsibly to clean up after their 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think every city needs some area where the dogs could go to play," said 
Krebs, who stopped taking her labrador retrievers to Silver Lake four months 
ago when she heard owners were cited for bringing unleashed pets. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the plan appeases dog park proponents, it has infuriated those who 
fervently believe that the less-than-one-acre recreation center belongs only to 
people. With or without a dividing fence, they say, unleashed dogs could bite 
or otherwise injure park-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is ludicrous. . . . I think (a dog park) endangers the community," said 
Ann-Marie Martin, 50, who has lived in Silver Lake for 26 years.  
</P>
<P>
 Another opponent of Goldberg's proposal, Richard Tanzer, said he plans to file 
a claim against the city, citing the recreation center's public nuisance 
problems with unleashed dogs, loud weekend music and early morning noise on the 
basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg's field director, Gonzalez, said a possible lawsuit will not deter 
the councilwoman from acting on the pilot dog park project. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; EL PUEBLO PANEL BEGINS ITS MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A seven-member panel that will oversee operations at the historic El Pueblo de 
Los Angeles held its first meeting last week and began establishing priorities 
and a vision for the city's birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission of five Latinos, one Chinese American and one Italian American 
agreed Tuesday to set up a committee to study El Pueblo's staff of 44, 
comprised of people from the city's parks department and contracted employees. 
The commission is taking over management of the historic area from the city 
parks department. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners, appointed in August, two years after the panel was created, are 
scheduled to meet again with Olvera Street merchants at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday in 
the Merced Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Following are the panel members' names and views of how to improve the 
two-block Downtown area where 11 families founded Los Angeles in 1781: 
</P>
<P>
 * Philip W. Bartenetti, 52, of Glassell Park, a civil attorney and partner in 
the law firm of Clark & Trevithick. Bartenetti, whose term ends June 30, 1996, 
said promoting Olvera Street is a top concern. 
</P>
<P>
 * Antonio Cardenas, 31, a Mission Hills real estate agent and a Sylmar 
resident. Cardenas, whose term ends June 30, 1996, wants to look into 
developing a North American Free Trade Agreement information office, education 
center or museum at El Pueblo. 
</P>
<P>
 * Juan Gomez-Quinones, a UCLA history professor and Pacific Palisades 
resident. Gomez-Quinones, whose term ends June 30, 1997, said funding must be 
reviewed to determine priorities at El Pueblo. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stewart Kwoh, 45, executive director and co-founder of the Asian Pacific 
American Legal Center. Kwoh, whose term ends June 30, 1997, wants to highlight 
the various cultures that once populated the site. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lydia Lopez, 52, of Lincoln Heights, owner of a fund-raising consulting 
firm. Lopez, whose term ends June 30, 1998, serves as the commission's 
chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I want to do is quickly start meeting with the merchants," Lopez said. 
"We need to hear from them about their experience as business people on that 
street." 
</P>
<P>
 * Josephine Ramirez, 36, of Venice, an arts consultant. Ramirez, whose term 
ends June 30, 1995, wants to incorporate Olvera Street into the city's effort 
to revitalize the arts scene. 
</P>
<P>
 * Andres Topacio, owner of a Downtown architectural firm. Topacio, whose term 
ends June 30, 1998, wants to do more to promote El Pueblo and to look into 
closing Main Street "to make that whole block pedestrian-oriented without any 
(vehicle) traffic." TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: RAMONA GARDENS HONORS 60 YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of the Ramona Gardens Housing Projects last week honored 60 youths 
who worked part-time jobs this summer through the citywide federal Youth 
Employment Program with a luncheon ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're saying to the young men and women who participated, 'Thank you for your 
hard work,' " said Roberto Murillo, coordinator for the Ramona Gardens Resident 
Advisory Council, which also planned to treat the teen-agers to Magic Mountain. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Although the jobs program has been in place for many years, this is the first 
time residents decided to hold the thank-you ceremony, Murillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14- to 21-year-olds painted murals, helped in offices, cleaned sewers, 
delivered food, weeded senior citizens' gardens, worked in day care, re-sodded 
lawns and supervised youth recreation programs. They worked from 20 to 25 hours 
a week and were paid about $5.47 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great. You earn your own money," said Juan Sarabia, 14, whose first 
job was as a member of a 12-person crew that painted murals and did gardening 
for the Resident Advisory Council. New murals have gone up on buildings at 
Murchison Street and Lancaster Avenue, and at Chelsea Street and Zonal Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 "We cleaned yards and dirty places where people walk through by some sewers. 
It's kind of easy stuff, but dirty though," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocio Olivo, 18, said the program provided another chance to hold a clerical 
job with the Resident Advisory Council, and, she hopes, will better her chances 
of landing a part-time job while attending East Los Angeles Skills Center this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Other youths held jobs with the East Los Angeles Youth Activity Foundation, 
the Community Service Center at Ramona Gardens, the Housing Development 
Maintenance Department and Los Angeles Center for Alcohol and Drug Abuse. Some 
also enrolled in academic enrichment programs, which included classes to 
prepare for the Scholastic Aptitude Test, a college entrance exam. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to give a well-rounded experience," Murillo said. "Each agency has its 
own needs that they fulfill for the community. The advisory council tried to 
touch on the environment, academic enrichment, community involvement and the 
spirituality that comes from that." 
</P>
<P>
 Olivo, who was to give a motivational speech to the other youths at the Friday 
awards ceremony, said she learned to work with computers this summer, an 
experience she knows will help her later. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you want to go out and look for a job, you know a little bit," she said. 
"They train you." MARY ANNE PEREZ

 Treason has been on the mind of City Clerk Nina Banuelos ever since the city's 
treasured American flag was stolen from City Council chambers last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of a person would steal a flag?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Banuelos, the 6-by-4-foot Stars and Stripes and its 10-foot pole 
were stolen from behind the mayor's chair between Aug. 9 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be considered treason, depending on who took it and what they did 
with it," Banuelos said. 
</P>
<P>
 The flagpole's maplewood stand, valued at $35, was also taken, according to 
the police report. 
</P>
<P>
 The flag, which has been in the city's possession for more than 20 years, was 
valued at $250. The pole was valued at $15. The state flag, which stood 
alongside Old Glory, was left untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 The city clerk's office has established a voice-mail hot line: (213) 563-9596.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; CASINO GETS NOD TO HOST BOXING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Contrary to the wishes of about 200 who attended last week's City Council 
meeting, the council unanimously approved a conditional-use permit to allow the 
Huntington Park Casino to hold boxing matches and other sports events. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Broudy, president of Celebrity Boxing Inc. of Los Angeles, said the 
casino will also host professional wrestling matches. The sporting event room, 
the site of the original casino before this year's expansion, will seat 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Casinos and professional sports go hand-in-hand," Broudy said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the promoter, the Huntington Park Casino will not receive any 
revenue from sporting events, the first of which is a Wednesday boxing match 
between "Bazooka" Limon of Tlaxcala, Mexico, and John Armijo of Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Schwieterman, general manager of the 10-year-old casino, said his 
facility welcomes sports like boxing and wrestling for the publicity and 
prestige associated with them. 
</P>
<P>
 However, residents who addressed the City Council on Monday night begged to 
differ. Many of the 70 who spoke out were worried about effects of casino 
gambling on the city's youth.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Pro Tem Rosario Marin pointed out during the meeting that state law does 
not prohibit minors from entering a casino's premises. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schwieterman said that no one under 21 is allowed into the Huntington Park 
Casino. 
</P>
<P>
 In part to appease the vocal opposition, the council attached several 
stipulations to the conditional-use permit: 
</P>
<P>
 When people younger than 21 attend sports events, the city said, no gaming 
tables are to be in the entertainment area and the windows between the event 
room and the gaming tables must be curtained.  
</P>
<P>
 The council also required that the casino install security cameras at the 
building's entrance, that it hire at least one security guard for every 100 
patrons during the events, and that the casinos' private security guards wear 
uniforms that are not too similar to those worn by police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 And last, the council said that the "casino" sign inside the building cannot 
be lit during sports events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to go to the casino to gamble and . . . I know it's not a good place 
for kids," said a man who identified himself before the council as Alex 
Figueroa, an ex-gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 Several who spoke referred to an Aug. 18 incident in front of the casino in 
which five males and five females were arrested after a series of brawls in the 
casino moved outside. Reports state that three of the females who were arrested 
were minors who told police that they had entered the casino using illegally 
obtained IDs. SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; BANK READY TO OPEN AFTER QUAKE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 After eight months of repairs following the Jan. 17 earthquake, Founders 
National Bank is poised not just for a reopening but a rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
 The branch at King Boulevard and Buckingham Road, red-tagged by city 
inspectors after the temblor, will reopen Sept. 15 with a face lift and a new 
role as Founders' corporate headquarters. The structure will house the 
three-branch bank's administrative, loan and accounting operations, something 
President Carlton Jenkins said was overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taken us awhile, but I think the community will be pleased with it," 
Jenkins said of the refurbished quarters of the black-owned bank. "Ultimately, 
it will allow us to better serve our customers." The King Boulevard branch 
operations have been consolidated with those at the nearby Stocker Street 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the change from branch to corporate headquarters was planned before 
the quake, the closure forced the bank into immediate action. Founders was one 
of the hardest-hit buildings in Central Los Angeles, suffering interior and 
exterior damage, epitomized by its cracked, fallen sign. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake hit on the day Jenkins was scheduled to move into his newly redone 
office, and just three days before a gala event was planned to celebrate the 
bank's three-year anniversary.  
</P>
<P>
 "The paint was still wet in my office and the wood was brand-new," Jenkins 
recalled. "Then it was all wrecked. It was really discouraging. Rebuilding has 
set us back. But we're proud of what we've been able to accomplish. We think 
we've demonstrated our commitment to the community here."  
</P>
<P>
 While Founders' service continued uninterrupted, the overnight exodus from the 
flagship branch sent Jenkins and staffers scrambling for work space at the 
bank's three other locations. The accounting staff went to the branch at 43rd 
and Western, the lending personnel wound up in a lunchroom at the Gardena 
branch, and Jenkins ran administrative operations out of a cramped office at 
the Stocker Street location. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a difficult managing exercise, particularly since we're a small 
business," Jenkins said. "But we were just happy to keep things going." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction costs were well below the original estimate of $750,000, but 
Jenkins said the price tag to refurbish the 18,000-square-foot building was 
nonetheless a "healthy six-figure amount." 
</P>
<P>
 The bank received no government or other financial aid, relying instead on 
"creative accounting -- moving in-house monies from one department to another," 
Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Renting the office suites on the top level of the building will help offset 
some of the rebuilding cost, he said. Before the quake, Founders was the 
structure's sole occupant, frequently using its surplus space for community 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins said he is determined that Founders continue to host events for such 
groups as the African American and Crenshaw chambers of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were important," he said. "They gave people a sense that there is a 
real, active business community in this area. Unfortunately, once we were 
damaged, no one took up the slack. Now that we'll be back on our feet, we can 
think about doing that again." ERIN J. AUBRY

CITY TIMES COVER STORY; PACIFIC BEAT; SHOPPERS FIND BARGAINS, MERCHANTS FIND 
CLIENTELE AND LATINOS FIND COMFORT ON PACIFIC BOULEVARD. THE VITAL DISTRICT 
'KEEPS THIS CITY ALIVE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EFRAIN HERNANDEZ JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sam Joma, who owns a new electronic appliance shop on Pacific Boulevard, 
beamed as potential customers made their way along the crowded Huntington Park 
thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the way, an unlicensed street vendor nervously kicked her wooden crate 
filled with small fruit baskets out of sight until a police cruiser passed. A 
moment later she quickly sold two orders of watermelon and pineapple chunks for 
$1 each. 
</P>
<P>
 And a block or so down the boulevard, a teen-age boy hustled back and forth 
trying to peddle fake identification cards. " Mica ? Mica ?" he asked 
hopefully. 
</P>
<P>
 It is all part of what is accepted, or at least expected, by the thousands of 
shoppers, merchants, retirees, teen-agers, criminals, panhandlers and others 
who spend time each day on thriving Pacific Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 To outsiders, Pacific Boulevard may be most familiar as the place that became 
unruly after thousands jammed the strip in June to celebrate Mexico's 
advancement in the World Cup. But to local residents, the boulevard is a vital 
commercial district with about 400 businesses that account for at least 
one-third of the annual $3 million in sales tax revenue. It has emerged in 
recent years as a place that Latino newcomers throughout the region find both 
lively and comforting. 
</P>
<P>
 "That boulevard keeps this city alive," said Mayor Richard V. Loya. "It really 
does bring in a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 And it is a strip still in transition from the largely white, blue-collar area 
it had been for so many years after Huntington Park was incorporated in the 
early 1900s. As Latinos poured into the area in recent years looking for better 
lives, businesses began to tailor themselves to the new clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, located just southeast of Downtown, has a population that officials 
say is easily 95% Latino. The 1990 U.S. Census counted more than 56,000 
residents in Huntington Park, but local officials say that factoring in recent 
arrivals, illegal residents and others missed by the count raises the total 
estimated population to 75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the success of Pacific Boulevard registers in cash what many other 
largely Latino communities nationwide can calculate only as potential buying 
power. The boulevard is vibrant even as the community struggles with common 
urban ills such as low income and education levels and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 So, those along the boulevard say, the widespread attention generated when the 
World Cup soccer celebration became too rowdy and led to the temporary closing 
of the strip by city officials was misleading. Local boosters -- while 
acknowledging some persistent problems with crime and trash -- call the soccer 
trouble unrepresentative of daily activity along Pacific Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 For hundreds of merchants, both licensed and illegal, Pacific Boulevard is a 
virtual dreamland of pedestrian and car traffic. It is a nearly three-mile 
strip running north and south from near Leonis Boulevard to about Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, especially between Slauson and Florence avenues, the chatter of 
pedestrians is almost exclusively in Spanish. As people maneuver past each 
other, laughter mixes with an occasional angry voice or the familiar wail of an 
unhappy child. On every block, workers hand out leaflets promoting all kinds of 
special bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 Music coming from inside food shops and record stores inevitably is Latin. 
</P>
<P>
 Joma, whose shop, Super Expo Inc., opened in late August, is banking on 
appealing to the tastes of predominantly Latino customers. Risks exist for any 
business, but the boulevard seems as good as it gets for selling stereos, 
televisions and other electronic merchandise, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came (to scout a location) on a weekend and it was really busy so I decided 
to take the place," he said. "I know Latino people like to buy the kinds of 
appliances we have. Plus, this is the busiest street in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald L. Jeffers, the city's chief administrative officer, agreed, adding 
that the most recent quarterly figures available showed that retail sales on 
the strip increased about 7% or 8% early this year compared to the same period 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it's our main shopping district," Jeffers said. "We do give the 
boulevard a lot of attention." 
</P>
<P>
 It seems anything anyone would want is available on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The attractions include movie theaters, restaurants, bridal shops and dance 
halls. Florists, dentists and even fortunetellers are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Between Clarendon and Gage avenues, the China Bowl Express -- where Asian 
workers take orders in Spanish without blinking an eye -- is next to Tacos 
Mexico, which is next to California Sports Wear. A bit south, near Flower 
Street, is a pawnshop called Casa de Empeno, which is alongside Katty's Bridal 
Shop, Associates-Financial Services and El Indio Amazonico, which besides 
offering goods and services for a price encourages passersby to find out their 
horoscopes for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those selling goods illegally are easy to spot. Many of them admit being 
illegal residents who aggressively seek out customers but are quick to scatter 
when law enforcement authorities appear. 
</P>
<P>
 One 18-year-old woman, who flavors the watermelon she sells with lemon juice 
or salt, said she works on the boulevard five days a week from about noon to 6 
p.m. The daily earnings range from $20 to $30, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't sell that much," she said in Spanish, looking up the block toward 
her mother, who serves as a lookout. "We earn enough to pay rent and survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, a slender teen-ager wearing a baggy T-shirt and a baseball cap 
pulled low on his forehead said he had no choice but to break the law by 
selling fake identifications with half a dozen friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't find other jobs. We're illegal so no one will give us jobs," the 
youth, who declined to be identified, said in Spanish. "We have to eat. We have 
to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say about $100 will buy a fake driver's license, a Social Security 
card and a resident alien card in a street sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Some consider the street vending a sticky problem. While many officials 
vehemently oppose the selling of illegal documents, they are less eager to 
condemn the unlicensed sale of legal goods such as fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys aren't begging," said Loya, the mayor. "We've got people pushing 
those stupid carts, but they're hard-working." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose de Jesus Legaspi, who works throughout the region as president of his own 
marketing and real estate company, said the Pacific Boulevard street vendors 
should be regulated, not eliminated. The vendors represent what helped make the 
boulevard successful during its transition from a predominantly white area 
years ago to a district where more businesses began catering to Latinos in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s, Legaspi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Street vending, he said, is a way for entrepreneurs to learn how to run a 
business. Some are bound to open licensed businesses some day and maintain 
commerce on the boulevard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Activity brings activity," Legaspi said. "They're not really taking away from 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The boulevard, he said, was also helped by a series of conditions existing 
away from Huntington Park. Nearby cities including Maywood, South Gate and Bell 
Gardens do not have shopping centers that can challenge Pacific Boulevard, and 
busy South Broadway in Downtown is plagued by high rents, poor parking, crime 
and uncleanliness, he said. In addition, the 1992 riots exacerbated existing 
problems along South Broadway, while Pacific Boulevard survived with relatively 
minor damage, Legaspi and others said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going through a little bit of growing pains but it's very 
strong," Legaspi said of the boulevard. "Anybody who is anybody who wants to 
sell to the Latino market is there." 
</P>
<P>
 Those conditions allow even those who are adamant about wanting to clear the 
boulevard of illegal activities to be enthusiastic about the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a great community," said Rosario Marin, mayor pro tem. "When I see 
fake IDs offered, that really aggravates me. We're working on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Local police officials say they are pressing hard to discourage the sales of 
counterfeit identification cards with special surveillance and other efforts. 
About five to 10 arrests involving fake identification cards are made each day 
on the boulevard, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there are about two to four arrests a day for petty thefts of up 
to $400, and 16 to 20 arrests per week for attempted grand theft auto or 
attempted burglary of a motor vehicle, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie Morales, 18, a saleswoman at Joma's shop, said most of the people she 
sees on the boulevard are harmless, yet there are also those she considers 
"gangsters." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been living here all my life. To me it's not dangerous," said Morales, a 
senior at Huntington Park High School. "But you do have to look out for thugs. 
There's a lot of gangsters. They look for trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief William F. Reed acknowledged that problems on the boulevard 
include car thefts, illegal street vending and congestion caused by young 
hotshots cruising the boulevard in late-model sports cars. Officers are 
expected to make arrests whenever necessary, but some activity is bound to go 
undetected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an evil place. It's a busy place," said Reed, who became chief three 
months ago. "My concern is that I want people to feel comfortable going there 
to do business and to enjoy themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Raul R. Perez, a city councilman, said that problems are made more intense by 
the throngs on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The success of the boulevard brought its own problems," Perez said. "The good 
people spending money attract the crooks and the bad people who are out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The situation has city officials and activists hustling to come up with 
projects, celebrations or other activities to bring about improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante D'Eramo, 54, executive manager of the Greater Huntington Park Area 
Chamber of Commerce, said a major goal is to establish a business association 
that would collect dues and use the money to help ensure a safer and cleaner 
boulevard. The association could fight the chronic problem of garbage on the 
boulevard despite barrels labeled both basura and trash , he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a personal interest in the community and I always have," said D'Eramo, 
who first moved to Huntington Park with his family when he was 4 and has been 
running daily operations at the chamber for 17 years. "I feel there is more to 
be accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry L. Gray, assistant director of community development/redevelopment, said 
one city project would reduce the number of public telephones along the strip. 
The project, which remains in the works but involves the city striking an 
exclusive deal with an undetermined phone service provider, would cut back on 
the phones available to shady figures, eliminate phone vendors offering poor 
services, and provide the city with a percentage of the revenue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber of Commerce President Gilda Acosta-Gonzalez said another important 
project involves encouraging boulevard businesses to become involved in helping 
local educational institutions. A new satellite of East Los Angeles College, 
for example, sits near the boulevard so businesses and students could benefit 
from a strong relationship, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Marin is pushing to keep the boulevard bustling with new activities such 
as her proposed walk of fame, called "Latino Diamonds on Pacific." The walk 
would involve sidewalk decorations shaped like diamonds featuring the names of 
well-known Latinos, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marin said the walk would only be one small way to encourage pride in the 
boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very young community and that's what is so exciting," Marin said. 
"I think my frustrations come from the failure of the existing systems to 
educate our people." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, on the boulevard, away from the lofty ideals, the social analyses of 
what is right or wrong, and the careful planning for the future, people seem 
most concerned with making it through each day. It is clear, despite the 
constant movement, that there will always be those whose main interest in the 
boulevard will be to simply kick back and enjoy themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for sitting and resting," Jose Rojas, 44, said in Spanish as he 
lounged on a stone bench between Zoe and Saturn avenues. "When I come it's 
mainly to relax and pass the time."

 Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday . . . Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the City of Angels turns 213. So put on that party hat, grab a 
balloon and join the celebration Monday at El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic 
Monument near Downtown -- the city's birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The daylong Labor Day festivities begin at 8:30 a.m. with a pancake breakfast 
served by Boy Scout Troop 364. An hour later, Los Pobladores, descendants of 
the original settlers who founded El Pueblo de Los Angeles on Sept. 4, 1781, 
are scheduled to reach the monument from a walk that will start at 6:30 a.m. at 
the San Gabriel Mission, said Tamryn Stoll, park curator. 
</P>
<P>
 The party continues with a cake-cutting ceremony, stage performances and a Los 
Angeles Fire Department rescue drill from atop the Pico Hotel -- built in 1870 
by Don Pio Pico, the last Mexican governor of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour guides, dressed to resemble historical characters such as Pico and 
Philipe DeNeve, the Spaniard who founded Los Angeles, will show visitors El 
Pueblo's Mexican, Italian, Chinese, Native American and African American 
influences, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful opportunity to learn about L.A.'s history and do it in a 
very fun way," Stoll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' 213th Birthday, 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday at El Pueblo de Los 
Angeles Historic Monument, 125 Paseo de la Plaza. All events free except the 
8:30 a.m. breakfast, which costs $6. Information: (213) 680-2821.

VOICES: PIECE MAKER; HIS WORK RESTORES WHAT NATURE AND TIME TEAR DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCENT G. PANUCCI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vincent G. Panucci owns United Staff & Stone, a small company near Dodger 
Stadium that restores, repairs and makes moldings, facades and balustrades for 
historic buildings, churches and residences. Much of his work has been to 
repair damage from the earthquakes of 1971, 1987, 1991 and 1994.  
</P>
<P>
 He has undertaken projects at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Boyle Heights and 
is working on the Young Apartments on Grand Avenue. Panucci projects also have 
included St. Vibiana's Cathedral, the Biltmore Hotel and the Shrine Auditorium. 
 
</P>
<P>
 A film of plaster dust permeates the shop. Photographs, scrapbooks and 
blueprints tell Panucci's story of the last half-century. He worked at the 
houses of Hollywood celebrities Dean Martin, John Wayne, Aaron Spelling, 
Charles Bronson and Dionne Warwick, as well as at the Getty Museum and at 
Caltech.  
</P>
<P>
 Panucci was interviewed by Berkley Hudson.

</P>
<P>
 I was born in Southern Italy, 74 moons ago. Maybe I don't look it, but I am 
74. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to work at 11 for a mason, my uncle. He was repairing homes, building 
homes. We used to grind by hand the terrazzo, the chips of marble mixed with 
cement, laid in a layer of maybe a half-inch. We'd grind it with water and 
grinding stone to bring out the sheen. We did everything by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 I used to mix the mud, the mortar, with a hoe. It was hard work. My uncle was 
not kindly to me. My father was in this country and told him to take care of 
me. My mother said: "Your uncle is your mentor." 
</P>
<P>
 In my hometown, I used to draw pretty good. So they called me Michelangelo. 
</P>
<P>
 I came to this country in 1938, when I was 17. My home state was Connecticut. 
Then I came to California during the war to work for the government, for the 
Forestry Service. I was a citizen, but I had to register as an enemy alien 
because I was from Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Before I bought this company in the early 1970s, I was doing masonry. In the 
'50s, there were tract homes that needed masonry, chimneys, slate floors, tile 
floors, tile sinks. 
</P>
<P>
 We did a lot of work for actors in Beverly Hills, Bel-Air. We had to do this 
finial (a decorative top) for a gate for Dean Martin. Somebody told me about 
this company that was finishing work at the Paul Getty Museum, that they might 
be able to help me with the finial. They said the Getty would be their last 
job. They were selling their company. So I said: "OK, I'll buy the company, 
providing I can work with you to get the hang of it." That's what I did. 
</P>
<P>
 As a mason, I stacked bricks one on top of another. It's tiresome, boring. 
This is more interesting. You create things. It can take months. You start out 
with broken pieces. You piece it together. Then make molds. We do everything 
from A to Z. 
</P>
<P>
 In this work you always learn. Otherwise I would have given up a long time 
ago. You learn until you die. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to specialize. Otherwise you're a jack of all trades, master of none. 
This is the era of specialization. So we do columns, balustrades, fireplaces, 
mantels and things like that. We restore. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 1 thing is we take the pieces that have been damaged, bring them to 
the shop and make samples to blend the texture, the color, and make it 
stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of our work is veneer, not structural. But when we work on Gothic windows 
in churches, we put in a big steel rod about 20 feet across. We work around 
that rod. Plus put some flat steel pieces around to strengthen things so that 
when seismic movements take place, it's solid. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases we do a structural project, like St. Mary's, where one of three 
windows collapsed in the Jan. 17 earthquake. These were solid, precast concrete 
windows, maybe 4 to 6 inches thick. They were way up where the peak is in front 
of the church. We strengthened those with brackets and put in special screws 
that drive through concrete. That church has been there 70, 80 years. In those 
days when they constructed it, they didn't think about seismic movements. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to remember all the things we've done. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Biltmore the telephone company put some cables in, eight or nine years 
ago. They cut the wires holding the ceiling. So the ceiling fell in. We had to 
replace the coffers, 18 of these octagonal, Venetian type ceiling covers. We 
had to take one of the good ones down, make a rubber mold and a replica. Then 
there was all this little gingerbread design in between that we had to make and 
replace. When we finished, you couldn't tell the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Shrine Auditorium, we had to get a cherry picker to work on the roof 
and north side. That was damaged, I think, in the '71 earthquake. There were a 
lot of cracks in the pediments. We had to rebuild them by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes we're replicating or enhancing the work of a sculptor. Long ago, 
they took their time. They were dedicated. You see beautiful proportion on the 
columns they made. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, anything goes. They mix birds with mice. There's no style. Because 
you have money doesn't mean you have taste. I've talked myself out of some 
jobs. People say: "Mr. Panucci, what do y ou think?' I say: "You're making a 
mistake. You don't want to overpower the situation. You want balance."

VOICES: SENSE OF COMMITMENT; VOLUNTEER CAME TO HELP BLIND CHILDREN AND FOUND 
DIRECTION FOR HER OWN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAMILLE HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Foundation for the Junior Blind has offered services and programs to 
disabled, visually impaired and blind infants, children and adults since 1953. 
Following the 1992 riots, the foundation joined with community groups to create 
the First Steps Youth Enrichment program, which employs 22 local youths. First 
Steps is one of the ways the foundation, at Slauson Avenue and Angeles Vista 
Boulevard in Southwest Los Angeles, tries to emphasize its commitment to the 
surrounding community. Camille Henderson, a 17-year-old resident of 
South-Central, has been with the First Steps program since the beginning. 
Camille, who plans to attend Hampton College in Virginia this fall, was 
interviewed by Joy B. Davis.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I've been with the foundation since last summer, about a year. This summer I'm 
working from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., five days a week. I file papers, do typing, 
make phone calls, answer the phones, whatever they need me to do. 
</P>
<P>
 I was asked to be a personal assistant to Lisa Shavers, a social worker. I 
thought it would be a good opportunity to learn about that field and to see if 
I was interested in psychology and also to brush up on my clerical skills. 
</P>
<P>
 They have made me supervisor over the program for this summer. I do my same 
duties, but in addition to that I check on the others, make sure they're doing 
their duties. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has taught me to be my own person and to get a feel for what the 
work force is like. I've gained patience. Whether or not social work is going 
to be my profession, I still have a sense of responsibility and compassion. You 
gain more understanding and compassion toward people who are less fortunate 
than you. You want to help more each day. Once you get used to them, they're 
just like you and me. When I see a blind person, I see a regular person. 
</P>
<P>
 I was surprised, in a way, that blind people could get along on their own. The 
equipment that they use, I didn't know it was as advanced as it is. For 
instance, there's the reading machine (the Kurzweil personal reader). It helps 
the blind students to read their mail or books. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the program I had planned to become a child psychologist. This 
experience makes me realize that this is really what I want to do because I see 
a need for children to be helped. . . . This is one way that I think it really 
inspires me. 
</P>
<P>
 I like children; I'm a people person. My friends call me the psychologist of 
the group. I'm always there, giving them advice. I know that's something I have 
a talent for. I wouldn't mind turning that into a profession, that's why I 
chose psychology. I would rather work with children over adults because adults, 
you know, they've already lived their lives. If I can do anything to help a 
child who's troubled or has any kind of problems, I want to be the one to turn 
them around. 
</P>
<P>
 A summer job is important because it provides responsibility, and you get 
paid. It's something productive. 
</P>
<P>
 In summers before I started working with the foundation, I would go visit 
friends, go to the movies, read, just stay at home. This gives me something to 
do and it's worthwhile. I'll miss it. You meet new people your own age and then 
you share the same interests. If you don't, you learn to accept the differences 
in others. It's a new excuse to make new friends. 
</P>
<P>
 I do plan to go back and volunteer at the foundation after college, if not 
work there. I'll volunteer in any way possible. What makes this program special 
is that there is a certain closeness you have with not only the students but 
with the staff; they take a personal interest in you. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, it took the civil unrest for not only the foundation but a lot 
of people to open their eyes. It doesn't matter when (First Steps) got started. 
The point is that it got started at all. Just go from there.

'94 FOOTBALL PREVIEW; GOAL ORIENTED; CHAMPIONSHIP QUESTS BEGIN -- AND THE RUN 
FOR REVAMPED CITY TITLES COULD BE WILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Locke's star running back Sirr Parker and the rest of the Central City's 
high school football players take the field on opening night Friday, they'll 
have the usual goals in mind: team victories, personal success, and if all goes 
really well, a championship title to cap off the 1994 season in December. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever twists and turns are in store for the players, a trip to the City 
Section title will take a much different course than in past years, thanks to a 
radical change in the playoff system that has left some coaches pleased and 
others scratching their heads at the complexity of what is to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Tired of seeing the City Section's most physical football teams -- Carson, 
Banning, Dorsey, San Pedro and Crenshaw -- beat each other up weekly in the 
Southern Pacific Conference, Dorsey Coach Paul Knox has long advocated football 
realignment of the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 When his most recent efforts to break up teams in the conference failed, Knox 
provoked the scramble to a new playoff format with a not-so-subtle threat to 
exercise his right to drop his powerhouse Dorsey team -- a perennial contender 
for the championship in the stronger 4-A Division -- to the 3-A Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the current playoff system, Dorsey may very well go to the 3-A 
Division," Knox said during a football coaches meeting in January that left his 
colleagues dumbfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dorsey played for the City 4-A title last season, the Dons, who were 
10-4 overall, were eligible to drop to the 3-A Division because they finished 
the regular season tied for last in the tough Pacific League. 
</P>
<P>
 In most conferences, teams with the four best records are grouped in a 4-A 
league and the remaining teams compete in a 3-A league the next school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox was told by one coach "that will never happen," and conference 
realignment went on the back burner again. But even the idea of Dorsey riding 
roughshod over weaker 3-A Division teams in the playoffs was enough to push the 
City Section to revamp its playoff system. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new system, 16 teams with the best records will be selected to 
compete for the 4-A title and the 16 next-best teams will compete for the 3-A 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 The six conference champions will gain automatic berths to the 4-A playoffs 
and the remaining 10 at-large spots will be determined by a nine-member 
selection committee. Those at-large teams and all of the 3-A playoff teams will 
be selected based on record, strength of conference, and strength of 
nonconference schedule. Winning a league title will have no bearing on 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to crown league champions they can, but it will have nothing to 
do with the playoffs," City Commissioner Barbara Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new system will come as good news to football fans who believed that San 
Pedro should have played for the 4-A championship last season. Under the old 
playoff system, teams were assigned to either a 3-A or 4-A league within the 
City's six conferences based on previous performance. At the end of the season, 
16 teams -- the top two teams from each league and four at-large teams -- were 
selected to each of the two playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite winning the 3-A title in 1992, the Pirates lost their petition to 
replace Crenshaw in the 4-A Pacific League and were designated a 3-A team for 
1993 in the Southern League of the Southern Pacific Conference. The Cougars won 
the 3-A title in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wanted to put Dorsey or Crenshaw in the 3-A," San Pedro Coach Mike 
Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the Pirates went 13-1 and easily defeated Fremont, 31-7, for their 
second consecutive 3-A title. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Pedro was probably the undisputed best team in the City," Fiege said. 
"Yet because of previous conference alignment, they were a 3-A team. This new 
(playoff) system will take away the labeling of a team ahead of time." 
</P>
<P>
 The advantages of the new system also include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Allowing 16 teams with the best records to compete for one championship 
instead of risking having superior teams competing in the lower division. 
</P>
<P>
 * Preventing teams with losing or even winless records from qualifying for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Giving a team going through a rebuilding year a chance to compete for a 3-A 
title one season and the next season to compete with a veteran squad for the 
4-A title. South Gate, for example, won the 3-A title in 1988 and reached the 
semifinals in 1989, but struggled with a rebuilding team against 4-A 
competition in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football teams go through cycles," South Gate Coach Gary Cordray said. "The 
years we had good teams, we played in the 3-A and the years we had bad teams we 
were in the 4-A." 
</P>
<P>
 But the new system does have its share of potential glitches. While the 
Southern Pacific Conference will have its lion's share -- one coach estimates 
five of the conference's eight teams will qualify -- the Northern Conference is 
expected to have no more than one of its eight teams in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Knox: "One of the big problems will be to try to determine whether a 
second-place team in one conference is better or worse than a fourth- or 
fifth-place team from another conference." 
</P>
<P>
 "The only sure thing is that six conference champions will make the (4-A) 
playoffs," said Rob Levy, Belmont Coach and playoff selection committee member. 
"(The Northern) is not considered a strong conference." 
</P>
<P>
 But the far greater problem may be determining the 10 at-large teams for the 
4-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine being the 16th team to qualify for the 4-A playoffs and facing a top 
seed such as Carson in the first round of the playoffs. Or, dodging that bullet 
and being judged the 17th-best team in the City with the top seed in the 3-A 
playoffs and good prospects for a championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is crucial is not who are the top eight or 10 teams," Levy said. "What 
is crucial is the dividing line between the 16th and the 17th teams."

'94 FOOTBALL PREVIEW; OFFERS OR NO, LAST YEAR'S PLAYERS ARE HEADING OFF TO 
COLLEGE 
</P>

 Akili Roberson of Locke High was offered a football scholarship from Nebraska. 
Armando Figueroa of Garfield High did not receive any offers. But both All-City 
Section 4-A Division players will be attending community colleges instead of 
Division I universities this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-way starter at quarterback and defensive back, Roberson passed for 1,189 
yards and four touchdowns but did not meet the NCAA-mandated SAT score of 700 
to play as a freshman. Roberson, instead, opted for L.A. Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 At Southwest, the 5-11, 177-pound Roberson will play only on defense at safety 
this season, but might return to his preferred position of quarterback as a 
sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberson turned down opportunities to play quarterback at West Los Angeles and 
Pasadena City College, choosing Southwest to keep his talents close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of inner-city athletes go to the (San Fernando) Valley and out of the 
area," said Roberson, who was bused to the San Fernando Valley in grade school. 
"It's only making their teams better. Why not use our abilities to help improve 
our teams?" 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa also chose to stay close to home at East Los Angeles College, which 
does not have a football program. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-9, 175-pound tailback rushed for a City-record 4,548 yards and 38 
touchdowns in three seasons, including 1,669 yards and 16 touchdowns last fall 
to help Garfield reach the 4-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa was recruited by USC, Brigham Young and San Diego State. He was 
accepted at San Jose State but was not offered a scholarship. He plans to 
attend East Los Angeles and hope for an offer next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholarship offers are few and far between for players from Bell Gardens. The 
Lancers have qualified for the playoffs 15 of the last 17 years under Coach 
Dave Newell, but only one of his players has received a scholarship from a 
Division I school. This year was no different. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any bullets or stars," Newell said. "We just have average 
players who are an unbelievably tough group of kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Junior Samano and lineman Gus Soto, who helped Bell Gardens reach 
the 1992 Southern Section Division III final and last year's semifinals, were 
named to the All-Division III team but attracted little scholarship interest. 
Ricky Oropeza, the quarterback the past two years, is no longer playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Samano and Soto, along with offensive guard Jose Urias, will continue their 
careers at Chaffey College in Ontario. The three will be reunited with Jose 
Bernal, an All-Southern Section lineman at Bell Gardens in 1992, and former 
Lancer assistant coach Ed Rifilito, now coaching at the Alta Loma community 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 Samano, one of Bell Gardens' best tailbacks, rushed for 1,731 yards and 30 
touchdowns. The 5-8, 180-pounder gained 237 yards in 18 carries and four 
touchdowns against Downey last season, but is being converted to strong safety 
at Chaffey. Soto, 6-5 and 270 pounds, will be used at offensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 A lack of offers was not a problem for Jim McElroy of Washington High, who 
will attend UCLA. The 5-10, 165-pound receiver also attracted interest from 
Cal, Colorado, Kansas, Nevada Reno and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy gained equal acclaim as a sprinter and a football player. He caught 18 
passes for 308 yards and four touchdowns. In May, he won the 100 and 200 meters 
in the City track finals. He is expected to be used primarily for kickoff 
returns at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Central City athletes will continue their careers out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive lineman Eric Scanlan, running back Kadar Hamilton and punter Anthony 
Scotti, who helped Loyola reach the Southern Section Division I semifinals, are 
headed for Duke, Stanford and Southern Methodist University. 
</P>
<P>
 Southeastern Conference Most Valuable Player William Yates, who passed for 
1,474 yards and 17 touchdowns to lead Fremont to the City 3-A championship, is 
at Nevada Las Vegas. Crenshaw linebacker Dennis Fomond will play for 
California. Jefferson defensive end John Johnson will attend Kansas.

CREATORS OF PROP. 187 LARGELY ESCAPE SPOTLIGHT; BALLOT: FROM SECRET O.C. 
LOCATION, POLITICAL NOVICES AND VETERANS SPAWN STRONG DRIVE AGAINST ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ and DOREEN CARVAJAL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like other political neophytes who banded together last autumn for an all-out 
war against illegal immigration, Ronald Stephen Prince had a story to tell -- a 
tale that would inspire the statewide "Save Our State" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 His bitter account would become a campaign refrain: an illegal Canadian 
immigrant bilked him out of $500,000 in a construction project, and the 
judicial system offered no recourse. But it's also an account sharply disputed 
by court records and the Canadian himself, who has lived in the United States 
legally for almost 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated, this obscure, enigmatic Tustin accountant stood in front of a Vons 
supermarket with a clipboard and pen in hand, hoping to whip up public 
sentiment against illegal immigrants. Eventually, he would become one of the 
key leaders of the SOS campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the sweeping initiative and its prickly package of immigration reforms 
has unleashed powerful emotions on all sides, its founders at the California 
Coalition for Immigration Reform have labored in political anonymity, escaping 
the celebrity and scrutiny that often focuses on the authors of controversial 
ballot initiatives with far-reaching consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of political beginners and seasoned veterans have cobbled together a 
powerful volunteer movement from a statewide campaign headquarters in Orange 
County that is a secret location even to some of the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the key players are citizens like Prince who are avenging injustices 
they believe were committed against them at the hands of illegal immigrants. 
Others believe illegal immigration has unfairly drained American tax dollars. 
Still others with the same agenda also will reap financial benefits from the 
campaign. Although the campaign has been touted as a volunteer effort, at least 
three of the organizers have billed the SOS campaign for tens of thousands of 
dollars for political consulting services. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan C. Nelson, the former head of the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
and a co-author of the initiative, is owed $26,500 for his work, according to 
campaign finance reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other consultants, who have themselves petitioned for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 13, also have received more than $35,000 through June for managing the 
campaign and reimbursement of expenses, according to financial disclosure 
statements filed by the SOS committee. The consultants, Robert Kiley and his 
wife, Barbara -- the mayor of Yorba Linda -- are owed an additional $51,000 for 
their work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kileys hosted the first strategy session that spawned the initiative, 
which would deny education, non-emergency health care and other public benefits 
to illegal immigrants. The measure, Proposition 187, faces a vote on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 When they all met last Oct. 5 at a posh, members-only Center Club in Costa 
Mesa, the future SOS leadership knew little about each other except that they 
shared the same contempt for illegal immigrants, a group some scorned in their 
newsletters for the "stench of urination, defecation, narcotics, savagery and 
death." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-member group -- which included Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy 
(R-Arcadia) -- recognized that it lacked money and a statewide political 
organization. But it had the determination to do something more active than -- 
as one participant, a newsletter publisher, put it -- "wring hands . . . and 
drink tea." 
</P>
<P>
 They debated the issue for the entire day, settling on a strategy proposed by 
a political unknown, Prince: a statewide petition drive for an initiative to 
end public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, they would pick the name SOS -- like the international 
distress signal -- for their campaign while dining on Mexican food at a 
restaurant in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron set everything up," recalled Barbara Coe, co-chairwoman of the coalition, 
who had a network of political contacts that Prince sorely lacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all his idea. He said, 'If you people will pick up the ball, I will 
run with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For someone who has placed himself directly at the forefront of the state's 
most controversial ballot initiative, Prince has proved a private man. 
</P>
<P>
 At 46, the campaign co-chairman guards details about his personal life more 
zealously than the location of the SOS headquarters, which is a closely held 
secret because the leaders fear retaliation from their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, who says he is a fifth-generation Californian, politely refuses to say 
where he was born (Long Beach), where he resides (Tustin or Downey, according 
to government agency records), prefers not to divulge his middle name 
(Stephen), or to disclose his place of employment. He is an accountant who used 
to work for his family's business in Downey, but now spends most of his 
workdays and weekends at the Tustin campaign office. 
</P>
<P>
 Why so private? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the repeated threats we have gotten, especially when it's directed 
at me," Prince says without elaborating. His SOS co-chair, Coe, says she 
recently received a dollar bill with a bullet hole drawn on George Washington's 
forehead and drops of red-ink streaming down his face. She said the handwritten 
message on the bill read: "Beware of Prince and Coe." 
</P>
<P>
 His reticence to discuss his background contrasts starkly with his smooth 
debating style during private and public forums on the illegal immigration 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing cool and aloof at times, the volume and pace of his speech quickens 
only slightly as he defends the initiative against a coalition of opponents 
made up of civil rights activists, Roman Catholic church leaders, teachers and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 So devoted was Prince to the movement that he donated $2,000 to get the SOS 
campaign off the ground late last year, and then loaned another $20,000 in May, 
according to campaign finance reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where the heck did he get the money?" asked William Baker, Prince's former 
attorney who has a keen interest in his income. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker obtained a court judgment against Prince -- that as of July totaled 
$9,643 -- after the accountant refused to pay the lawyer for defending him in 
the legal dispute involving a Canadian citizen who Prince contends defrauded 
him in a construction project. In a statement obtained by Baker last year, 
Prince said he was unemployed and had no assets. 
</P>
<P>
 During the course of that case, Prince dropped Baker as his attorney and filed 
with the secretary of state an unsuccessful proposal for an initiative measure 
that called for every member of the State Bar to be re-examined every four 
years. Prince said recently the events were unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince's fight with his attorney was but a minor skirmish in the larger court 
battle between Prince and his former friend, Leonard Thomas Chornomud, 59, a 
Tustin auto garage owner and -- INS records show -- a legal Canadian immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chornomud had no construction experience, both informally agreed in 
1984 to finance and build an addition to Chornomud's Tustin home. They later 
expanded their oral agreement to include construction of a home for Prince. 
Prince told a bankruptcy judge that he entered both projects to learn new 
steel-construction techniques possibly for future business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership ended six years later, with each man accusing the other of 
fraud, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair slapped each other with lawsuits and countersuits in state and 
federal courts, but even the attorneys for both sides and the judge conceded 
that the deal -- born out of friendship -- was too messy to assign blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Perplexed by Prince's contention that he had contributed about $70,000 for the 
projects, bankruptcy court Judge James N. Barr pointedly asked from the bench 
during an October, 1991, hearing why Prince gave the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince replied: "I am a nice guy, I am a good friend. I trusted Leonard and 
Gloria Chornomud. Gloria (who legally emigrated from Nicaragua) had gone on at 
great length about how honorable Spanish people were and that they could be 
trusted, and I believed her, because that has also been my experience in the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Prince would later allege he had lost about $500,000 as a result of 
his dealings with Chornomud -- the bankruptcy court case documented only 
$70,000 -- he settled for a $32,000 payment from Chornomud that ended the case 
in May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Chornomud, meanwhile, contends to have lost even more. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Francisco Examiner article about the initiative published in June told 
of Prince being "defrauded by a Canadian citizen living here illegally, and 
(Prince) said he and others never would have lost money if this country took 
its immigration laws seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's totally false," says Chornomud in anger. "Our country is in trouble 
because of men like him. Our country is what it is today because of immigrants. 
It's the immigrants that worked harder than any other group." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Prince refused to discuss Chornomud. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, he contended Chornomud told him he was an illegal immigrant. But 
then later, he said Chornomud was not the illegal immigrant he had referred to 
in previous newspaper interviews. Was it possible that there could be another 
Canadian citizen who had allegedly bilked him out of a half-million dollars in 
a construction project? 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not going to tell you who it was," said Prince. "I don't think it's 
pertinent." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince argued that the news media had paid too much attention to his anecdote. 
The impetus for the campaign, he added, was not his story, but "the stories of 
all of the people I have talked to" who alleged they have been harmed by 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Prince is the philosopher of the movement, then Barbara A. Coe is its 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 When SOS formed last fall, the new coalition ended up relying on the extensive 
contacts of Coe, 60, a diminutive, chain-smoking woman with an apocalyptic 
vision of the world that is all exclamation points and question marks. 
</P>
<P>
 From her home in Huntington Beach, she presides over an active political 
network tied together by the passionate prose of her newsletter, "911." 
</P>
<P>
 An Oklahoma native, Coe is a late-blooming political scrapper and mother of 
three who has contributed more than $15,000 to the SOS campaign. Coe works as a 
crime analyst for the Anaheim Police Department -- a job that will end in 
December in forced retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Gina Beitler, a representative of the Anaheim Municipal Employees Assn., said 
she helped Coe in her effort to save her job. Beitler said Coe came under fire 
within the department after she used a city Polaroid camera to snap a picture 
of striking dry wallers who were picketing police headquarters. Many of the 
strikers were illegal immigrants, primarily Mexican nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 Coe, who declined to comment on her job, complained to friends that she is 
being forced out because her immigration-reform activities interfered with her 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Her political baptism came just three years ago when she went to an Orange 
County social services office to smooth out a dispute involving an elderly war 
veteran's public health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The frantic scene in the lobby startled her, reminding her of the United 
Nations, she said. Coe noticed windows open to serve Spanish- and 
Vietnamese-speaking clients but said the single one available for 
English-speaking applicants was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked in and I'm going, 'Where am I?' " Coe recalled. "There were hundreds 
of people; I thought I was at UCI maternity ward -- vast numbers were very 
pregnant. There was every language under the sun being spoken, and I am going, 
'What's happening?' " 
</P>
<P>
 A welfare agency employee offered some answers and sympathy. Coe listened in 
dismay as the counselor complained that illegal immigrants were able to obtain 
the same services that were denied to Coe's elderly friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went ballistic," said Coe, whose rage led her to other immigration-reform 
groups that she found weak and powerless. 
</P>
<P>
 So Coe and a former INS border agent, Bill King, decided to form a group with 
more muscle. They placed a brief advertisement in a free newspaper announcing a 
Costa Mesa meeting of "everyone concerned about the illegal aliens problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a big pot of coffee, crossed our fingers and waited," Coe said. To 
her surprise, almost 40 people showed up to listen to the featured speaker, 
none other than the same government worker who had complained to Coe about 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 From those grass-roots beginnings, Coe and King formed Citizens for Action 
Now, joining with other groups worried about illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 That loose web of connections ultimately brought Prince and Coe together last 
fall, to form the California coalition for Immigration Reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "We clicked," laughed Coe. "He said, 'I've heard about you.' I said, 'I hope 
it's good and if it isn't, it's a lie.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Prince and Coe were the muscle behind the movement, then the stars in the 
beginning were two former top INS officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson and Harold Ezell, who were known for their controversial styles at the 
INS, are credited with co-authoring the initiative. They lost their top 
positions in the INS in 1989 several months after George Bush took office and 
accepted their letters of resignation, which are routinely submitted by top 
appointed officials to a new President. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign records show that Nelson was paid $26,000 for his early work on the 
initiative, although he says he has not received the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, a Sacramento-based lobbyist, and Ezell, of Newport Beach, say they 
have actually eased out of the day-to-day SOS campaign to form a national group 
of their own called Americans Against Illegal Immigration, which was organized 
after the SOS campaign was underway. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that there needs to be a lot of groups that are picking up this 
issue (nationally) and running with it," said Ezell. 
</P>
<P>
 So distant are they from the current campaign, that Ezell says he has no idea 
where the SOS headquarters is. 
</P>
<P>
 However, both men continue to stump for the cause on radio shows and public 
forums. In their prior jobs with the INS, they proved to be masters at 
preaching the gospel of immigration reform. Ezell became known for his affinity 
for television cameras and microphones -- sometimes holding as many as six news 
conferences a week during his six-year stint. 
</P>
<P>
 But Latino immigrant rights activists pressed for his resignation, and some 
Republican Administration officials also considered him an embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, while the Justice Department was investigating deposed Philippine 
President Ferdinand Marcos, Ezell danced with Imelda Marcos at a party hosted 
by the couple, and led a prayer asking for the exiled couple's safe return to 
the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Ezell, Nelson stirred controversy as INS commissioner. He produced a film 
touting his accomplishments in an effort to save his job but ultimately was 
ousted in 1989 after a seven-year stint. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of his undoing was an audit by the Justice Department, which criticized 
the INS for inefficiency. Nelson constantly engaged in battle with immigrant 
rights groups and drew fire when the INS planned to construct a four-mile ditch 
at the San Diego border. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the SOS committee organized, Nelson was already a high-profile 
lobbyist for the cause through a consulting contract he had with Federation for 
American Immigration Reform. However, the group allowed the contract to expire 
late last year out of concern that Nelson's political activities might threaten 
its nonprofit status. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robert and Barbara Kiley are, by trade, political hired guns. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is the first time they have managed a high-profile statewide 
initiative campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders say the campaign is strictly volunteer. However, the Kileys' political 
consulting business has received more than $35,000 during the first six months 
of the campaign for management services, commissions and overhead, according to 
campaign finance records. The firm is owed another $51,000 for the Kileys' 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken commissions but haven't taken any salary," said Robert Kiley, who 
added that they may not be paid the money still owed to them if more money does 
not come into the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the campaign raised $335,923 through the end of June, with 
expenditures totaling $406,319. Those expenses included $115,000 paid to 
professional signature gatherers, American Petition Consultants of Rancho 
Cordova. They are owed another $38,506 for that effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the petition drive was underway late last year, the Kileys reported to 
bankruptcy court that they had new, unspecified business clients. Instead of 
being forced to liquidate their assets, the Kileys asked to convert their case 
from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13, which would let them pay off creditors with their 
new income. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Prince and Coe, who came to the fight with personal stories, Robert 
Kiley said his involvement does not stem from any first-hand experiences with 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in this issue. This was not a thing about money, basically we 
believe in the issue. We're consultants and we like to be paid, but that's not 
what this is about," said Robert Kiley. 
</P>
<P>
 He said tax money is being wasted on illegal immigrants. "As a tax-paying 
citizen, I'm feeling pinches like everyone else," Robert Kiley said. 
</P>
<P>
 While unaccustomed to controversial statewide campaigns, they are not new to 
political clashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kiley, a former member of President Reagan's advance team, last year 
helped defeat a Newport Beach measure backed by environmentalists which would 
have taxed property owners to buy three bluff-top properties for open space 
preservation. Barbara Kiley, as a Yorba Linda council member, became the mayor 
last year by forming a coalition that denied the office to the next councilman 
in line. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are in the biggest political fight of their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kiley wonders whether the measure, if approved by voters, will face 
legal challenges. But at least, he said, they have accomplished their initial 
goal -- to call attention to illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we wanted to do," Robert Kiley said, "is wake up the Legislature."

</P>
<P>
 * Prohibit public education for undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Halt non-emergency public health care to undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prohibit public social services to undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>

enforcement officers to report suspected undocumented immigrants to the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service and other authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Order school districts to verify immigration, residency or citizenship 
status of all students and parents or guardians of students. 
</P>
<P>

TODAY MAY BE START OF THE END FOR RAMS IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unappreciated, unwanted and severely undermanned, the Los Angeles Rams begin 
what could be their final season in Southern California today with a game 
against the Arizona Cardinals in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Blindfolds, anyone? 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams went 0-4 in exhibition games, scored three touchdowns and were 
penalized 35 times, a guffaw-inspiring performance that has many predicting 
another last-place finish for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Add the specter of a possible move to Baltimore, St. Louis or Hartford, Conn., 
in 1995, the fans' ill will toward Rams' owner Georgia Frontiere and President 
John Shaw for even thinking about leaving, and there is a potential for some 
real ugliness in the Big A this season. 
</P>
<P>
 But for die-hard Ram fans -- the guys in the end-zone seats with watermelons 
on their heads and the 24,000 who actually purchased season tickets for these 
Not-So-Mighty Lame Ducks -- there is this glimmer of hope: 
</P>
<P>
 The last two times the Rams played their final season before moving, they 
enjoyed remarkable success. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, the year before the Rams moved from Los Angeles to Anaheim, they had 
an 11-8 record and lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 31-19, in Super Bowl XIV. 
In 1945, the Cleveland Rams went 9-1 and beat the Washington Redskins, 15-14, 
in the NFL championship game before moving to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football is a very strange game," said Deacon Jones, former Ram defensive end 
who made the Hall of Fame in 1980. "The odds can fall your way, and you can 
have a miracle season." 
</P>
<P>
 Or the odds can catch up with you and you could have a marginal season, 
incurring the wrath of fans along the way, much like the three recent lame-duck 
NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
 One year after winning the Super Bowl, the Oakland Raiders were 7-9 in 1981, 
with home attendance dipping to an average of 48,989 amid speculation the team 
would move. The Raiders came to Los Angeles in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baltimore Colts were 7-9 and crowds slipped to 41,968 a game in 1983, as 
fans cursed owner Robert Irsay for having the gall to even threaten to move 
their beloved Colts. The team was in Indianapolis by 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 And in one of the nastier lame-duck situations, the St. Louis Cardinals were 
7-8 in 1987, and attendance fell to a paltry 27,821 a game in Busch Stadium 
that season, before the team moved to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a lot of guys it was like a joke, going out there and playing what felt 
like an exhibition game because there were only 25,000 people there," said Neil 
Lomax, the Cardinals' quarterback in 1987. "It was like playing in a library. 
We just said, 'Well, that's OK, another four or five more games and we're out 
of here anyway.' 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of (owner Bill) Bidwill-bashing. Fans would hang him or burn 
him in effigy. He got a lot of hate mail and some death threats. It was a very 
negative atmosphere throughout the city toward Bidwill and the team." 
</P>
<P>
 This is what the Rams have to look forward to in 1994. And what some players 
are already experiencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like we're getting the boot," Ram linebacker Roman Phifer said. 
"From a players' point of view (the talk about moving) isn't a positive. There 
are a lot of distractions, a lot of things that can take your focus away. But 
it's out of our hands. We just have to roll with the punches." 
</P>
<P>
 This, at least, the Rams are accustomed to. They've been Orange County's 
punching bag since 1990, suffering four consecutive losing seasons, watching 
attendance dwindle in Anaheim Stadium and bearing the brunt of fan apathy and 
media scorn. 
</P>
<P>
 So the small crowds that are expected this season certainly won't shock these 
guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be different if we had 70,000 people and then all of a sudden we had 
20,000, but we've only been getting 35,000," defensive back Anthony Newman 
said. "Sure, we miss playing in front of 70,000 fans, but you go back to 1989 
when we went to the NFC championship game and we still didn't sell out -- what 
does that tell you? That people here don't follow football whether you win or 
lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "This atmosphere is totally different than anywhere in the country. People say 
if you don't win you won't attract fans, but you look at Cleveland, Detroit, 
Seattle, their stadiums are packed in the colors of their teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seattle has a losing team, and you can't even hear yourself in that stadium. 
The fans understand that when you're down and out, that's when you need a 
pick-me-up." 
</P>
<P>
 Several Ram players and coaches said small crowds won't affect their play, but 
they also acknowledge that huge, partisan crowds can give home teams an 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fans are upset with the way we're playing, and rightfully so, but I've 
been in places like Seattle where the fan base has been partly responsible for 
us turning things around," said Joe Vitt, Rams assistant head coach and former 
Seahawk assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question fans are a big part of it. Knowing you have 65,000 
screaming fans, where the opponent can't hear its quarterback's cadence, that's 
a real challenge to overcome. When teams come here it's not like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lomax, who now runs a sports management company in Portland, Ore., recalled 
the small crowds affecting defensive players more than the offensive players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember being very relaxed when it was real quiet," Lomax said. "You 
expect a lot more of yourself when you have 55,000 screaming fans at home, but 
I didn't feel that pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed to affect the rah-rah guys, like the linebackers, more than anyone. 
You see the intensity of players after a tackle or big hit, you see guys who 
want the crowd to get involved. Emotions play a big part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who will be working in the Rams' radio booth this season, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't predicate your game on what happens in the crowd," said Jones, a 
member of the Rams' Fearsome Foursome, their legendary defensive line of the 
1960s. "I came out to kill quarterbacks. I didn't care if there were people 
there. It helps to be cheered, but if you lock yourself into that, you can't 
take the other side of the coin, because the boos are going to come." 
</P>
<P>
 They've been coming in bunches lately, which hasn't made the job any easier 
for the Rams or the business leaders trying to keep the team in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Since presenting its proposal to refurbish Anaheim Stadium, build a new 
training complex and purchase a minority interest in the team, the Save the 
Rams Task Force has splintered into three subcommittees, one to refine the 
proposal, one to sell luxury suites and season tickets, and one to help market 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 The major obstacle: indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question we've inherited a number of years of fan frustration with 
team performance, front-office moves and ownership, and it certainly would be a 
great help if the team could score a touchdown," said Newport Beach agent Leigh 
Steinberg, Save the Rams co-chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "But to deal with this whole set of issues it's necessary to look beyond the 
present. This is not a test to determine whether people are delighted with the 
preseason, the last few seasons or ownership. It's a question of whether we 
want NFL football in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg urges short-sighted Ram fans to consider New England, where the 
Patriots, spurred by a new coach (Bill Parcells) and promising young 
quarterback (Drew Bledsoe), recently cut off season-ticket sales at 48,000 and 
have sold out all but one game in Foxboro Stadium. The team averaged 38,551 
fans a game during a 2-14 season in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's Steinberg's star client, Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman, who 
endured the punishment of 1-15 and 7-9 seasons (1989-90) before the Cowboys 
turned things around. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question with Aikman was whether he'd live to see the next season," 
Steinberg said. "He spent a lot of time on his back. Now he's won two Super 
Bowls, so these conditions are not permanent." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Newman: "The New York Giants, the Steelers, the Cowboys, they all went 
through peaks and valleys, and now it's happening to us. You can't stay on top 
forever, but the fans here don't stick with you in the valley." 
</P>
<P>
 One major difference between the Giants, Steelers, Cowboys and Rams, though: 
The first three teams stuck with their fans -- and home cities -- during lean 
times. The Rams, it seems, have not. 
</P>
<P>
 With a series of questionable front-office moves and very little improvement 
on the field, some believe Ram management has welcomed atrophy. A projected 
loss of about $6 million this season has merely made it easier for the Rams to 
justify moving to another city. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, despite the team's problems and a lack of support, Ram players have no 
desire to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you took a poll in here, everyone would want to stay," Newman said. "This 
is a dream place to play football -- you have natural grass, sunshine in 
December. I don't want to deal with cold weather or artificial turf." 
</P>
<P>
 Players, though, would be least affected by a move. With free agency and 
trades, their situations are tenuous to begin with. Moving is part of the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the support personnel in the front office and locker rooms, the longtime 
employees such as Ram cinematographer Mickey Dukich, in his 39th season with 
the team, and senior equipment manager Don Hewitt, in his 28th year, who are 
feeling the most anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's traumatic," said the 71-year-old Hewitt, whose son, Todd, is also an 
equipment manager. "One day you have a feeling we're not going to move, the 
next day you feel we're out of here, the next day you're not moving. I can't 
help but think about it because I'd hate to see Todd and four of my 
grandchildren leave. I don't want the team to move." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does Van Larsen, an independent photographer whose car, with a 
"BYERAM" license plate, was at Rams Park on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my way to show my sorrow," Larsen said. "Some might take it the wrong 
way, but it would absolutely devastate me to see the Rams go to another city 
and win a Super Bowl. I'm of the mind-set that they're gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, an institution in Southern California for 49 years, playing in 
Baltimore, St. Louis or Hartford in 1995? 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams leaving Southern California would mean a step backward for the NFL," 
said Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, who grew up collecting Ram football cards. "Like 
the Green Bay Packers, New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys, they've been one of 
the cornerstone franchises of the league." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram offensive tackle Jackie Slater, entering his 19th season with the team, 
would also find it hard to imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 "But at one point in time I never would have imagined Eric Dickerson not being 
here or Jim Everett not being here or me being here so long," Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So anything is possible." Good Riddance?

<P>
 "It's not the end of the world," the doctor concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's how it felt. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been back from Russia only two weeks with my newly adopted son, 
Benjamin, a robust 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip had been difficult, and the adjustment at once thrilling and 
exhausting. I was grateful to have such a beautiful child in my life, and 
relieved that we had returned home safely to a new beginning: for me, for him, 
and for his sister, Barra, who had arrived from Calcutta in 1987 at the age of 
3 months. This was supposed to be a time of bonding and falling in love, of 
adjusting to a new name, a new language -- and a new life. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not to be -- not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor was a pediatrician who had examined Benjamin on our arrival in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got the final report back from the lab," she said. Choosing to start 
with the good news, she told me that he had tested negative for the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she paused. "He is positive for hepatitis B. He has an active infection. 
He can transmit the virus to others." 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment, I couldn't breathe. My first reaction was disbelief, then 
denial. She droned on, but only pieces of what she was saying registered. She 
urged me to find a specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 I must have shouted, "Oh, no! . . Oh, no! . . Oh, no! . ." because Barra ran 
into the room, frightened by my tone. "What is it? What's wrong, Mommy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Because I write about health policy for The Times, I already knew a lot about 
hepatitis B. And I knew it was grim. 
</P>
<P>
 Hepatitis B can be deadly. It can kill swiftly or slowly -- but either way, it 
is insidious. Over time, an active chronic infection like my son's can destroy 
the liver, resulting in scarring -- called cirrhosis -- liver failure or liver 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease is endemic to Eastern Europe. Many of the youngsters adopted from 
that region were infected by their mothers during birth or through blood 
transfusions and contaminated needles while living in orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not know how Benjamin was infected. I do know that he received some 
inoculations as a baby and underwent a hernia operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people with hepatitis B become sick and die relatively quickly, or 
recover and develop a lifelong immunity. Others remain symptom-free but carry 
an active infection that gradually destroys the liver. Children often appear 
healthy while the virus gains a toehold and begins to replicate because their 
immune systems are not fully developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Both children and adults are sometimes able to clear the virus spontaneously 
-- seroconversion. About 1% do so annually. 
</P>
<P>
 A bright spot in an otherwise bleak picture is that an effective vaccine does 
exist. And, luckily, my daughter and I had been immunized. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of a series of blood tests, however, brought the worst possible 
scenario for my son. He was positive for surface antigen (an antigen indicates 
the presence of virus) and for the more specific e antigen. The latter was the 
most discouraging. Evidence of e antigen indicates that the virus is 
replicating, meaning the patient is highly infectious. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests also showed that Benjamin's liver enzymes were elevated. While that 
means his immune system was fighting the virus, those enzymes ultimately could 
cause liver damage. WE NEED A MIRACLE: How could I share happiness when I was 
overwhelmed with grief? 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin came home last November. We would spend the next six months in search 
of a medical miracle, if one existed. It was a searing experience to confront 
the health care community not as a journalist but as an anxious and vulnerable 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, I knew that with the sources I had developed, if a cure 
existed, I would find it. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first weeks after diagnosis, I was distraught. I could not talk 
about my new son without weeping. I temporarily dropped the idea of sending 
announcements heralding his arrival. How could I share happiness when I was 
overwhelmed with grief? 
</P>
<P>
 That Benjamin should be infected with a virus as serious as hepatitis B was 
particularly stunning because I had asked the agency for a healthy child. Even 
though I knew that international adoption brings no guarantees, I hadn't 
expected any problems. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, my first experience had been good. Barra had been malnourished when 
she arrived, but she had blossomed into a beautiful and healthy girl. 
</P>
<P>
 I had decided to adopt Barra -- and then Benjamin -- abroad because as a 
single woman over 40, my options were limited. When Barra came, India and 
several Latin American countries were about the only places where an unmarried 
older woman could adopt. Since then, Russia has opened its doors to foreign 
adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed fitting to turn there to complete my family, since my parents had 
been born in Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted a little boy of Gypsy heritage. I thought it would be a positive sign 
for my daughter to see another dark-skinned child join our family. And I 
believed asking for a Gypsy would increase my chances of getting a healthy 
child. Gypsy children are typically abandoned because of their heritage, while 
most others are available for adoption because of medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'd been waiting eight months for a referral and was on the brink of 
selecting Dmitri, a 5-year-old in Moscow -- older and fairer than the son I'd 
envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
 On the evening I was about to say, "OK, I'll take Dmitri," the agency called. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just learned of a 3-year-old Gypsy child in Ufa. They say he's healthy. 
We have no other information about him. Do you want to see his picture?" 
</P>
<P>
 Of course I did. 
</P>
<P>
 After two long days, the photo arrived. It showed a charming little boy with 
dark hair and dark eyes and a shy smile. Immediately, I knew he was the son of 
my dreams. THE FIRST MEETING: He laid his head upon my lap, and circled his 
arms around my waist. 
</P>
<P>
 I left for the former Soviet Union at the end of October, believing that 
Benjamin -- then, Igor Lebedev -- was destined to be my son. 
</P>
<P>
 I flew to Ufa, an industrial town about 700 miles east of Moscow. I knew only 
that my son had been abandoned at birth and had spent his first six months in a 
hospital. After that, he had lived in an orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours after arriving in Ufa, I was taken to the orphanage. As I sat 
nervously in the waiting room, a handsome, bright-eyed boy was brought before 
me. He had been told only that his "mama" had come to get him. I held out my 
arms. He hesitated. Then he laid his head upon my lap, and circled his arms 
around my waist. 
</P>
<P>
 The orphanage officials assured me he was in good health. None of his 
documents indicated that he had been tested for hepatitis B. 
</P>
<P>
 We flew to Moscow, where we were to stay for several days while waiting for 
our paperwork to clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin took to Rima, our hostess, a grandmotherly retired nuclear physicist. 
He followed her from room to room -- preferring her to me -- and cried whenever 
she left the apartment. He had been separated from the only home he had known. 
She spoke Russian, and I didn't. I knew when I got him home that things would 
be different and he would turn to me. So I tried to be patient. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, I learned a few key Russian phrases: "Are you hungry?" "Are 
you thirsty?" "Do you have to go to the bathroom?" "Don't touch!" and "I love 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he had become devoted to Rima, by the time we were ready to leave 
I think he knew what was happening. At one point, he told Rima, looking at me: 
"That will be my mama." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, two weeks later, we were home in America. And it was I who was 
struggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Blissfully unaware of the medical time bomb ticking inside him, Benjamin began 
to adjust to his new surroundings. In my cozy and cluttered suburban Maryland 
home, he was on sensory overload. He pushed every button, opened every door. He 
obliterated the message on my answering machine. He traumatized our two cats. 
</P>
<P>
 He bonded with me and quickly became attached to his sister. Barra, who now 
had an instant playmate, decided she adored him -- most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the hepatitis B diagnosis, I held back a little, afraid to get too 
close emotionally. Although I knew that people with chronic HBV infections 
often lived for years before developing problems, I kept worrying that he would 
die -- and soon. 
</P>
<P>
 I became resentful of parents whose children were healthy. I tried to comfort 
myself with the knowledge that far worse things had happened to other children. 
At just about the time I was trying to come to grips with Benjamin's condition, 
Polly Klaas' body was found in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bet her parents would give anything to be in my shoes," I thought. "At 
least my son is alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite my fear and apprehension, I found myself drawn ever more closely to 
Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
 I was horrified when a relative, one of the few who knew of his condition, 
asked thoughtlessly, "Can you send him back?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No we cannot send him back," I replied, my anger barely under control. "We're 
not talking about a 90-day return policy on a car with a damaged bumper." 
</P>
<P>
 It never occurred to me that I wouldn't keep him. THE RAMIFICATIONS: Certainly 
the school had to be told. How would officials there react? 
</P>
<P>
 As I wrestled with my own emotions, I also was forced to confront a more 
practical issue: Whom to tell? I was terrified that Benjamin would be shunned 
-- much as some children with AIDS are. I was afraid that the parents of 
Barra's friends would refuse to let their children come to my home. 
</P>
<P>
 What was my responsibility to parents of Benjamin's friends who invited him 
over to play? Did they have a right to know? What about baby-sitters? Although 
the risk of transmission is considered extremely low -- even in people with 
active infections -- did I have the right to make that decision and take such a 
chance? 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin was supposed to start preschool in a few weeks. Certainly the school 
had to be told. How would officials there react? 
</P>
<P>
 I knew the school legally could not refuse to admit him. The Americans With 
Disabilities Act, which bans discrimination in the private sector, defines 
illnesses such as AIDS and hepatitis as disabilities. But that failed to 
reassure me. I knew I could force the school to take him -- but I wanted to be 
sure they would treat him like any other child. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been writing about the political and social ramifications of AIDS for 
years. To be sure, hepatitis B is not as swiftly or as invariably fatal as 
AIDS. But many of the issues, particularly involving transmission, are 
identical. Because of AIDS, I had seen children, too young to understand what 
was happening, thrown out of school, their families driven from their homes. I 
had seen adults lose their jobs, their friends, their families. 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't bear the thought of either of my children being subjected to this 
kind of cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
 As a journalist writing about these topics, I have always respected peoples' 
desire for privacy -- because I have seen how insensitive the ignorant and 
uneducated can be. But I also believe that being open goes a long way toward 
removing the stigma -- and that hiding something only sends the message that 
there is something to be ashamed of. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I was living it. 
</P>
<P>
 Was I willing to stand behind my own philosophy? 
</P>
<P>
 I was advised by parents of other HBV children to keep Benjamin's condition 
secret. But secrecy simply didn't feel right. Maybe I needed the emotional 
support of others. My instincts told me that if I was open, people would 
respond appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 I told the full story to my closest friends and family, and my regular 
baby-sitters. If neighbors invited Benjamin home to play with their children -- 
and I would not be present -- I decided to tell them. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, the typical reply was: "Oh, OK. Thanks for telling me." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a blip of anxiety at the preschool but, overall, the staff was 
wonderful. The director delayed my son's entry so she could gather information 
about hepatitis B, and educate her staff. 
</P>
<P>
 I put the school in touch with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
in Atlanta. Their advice was clear: The staff of a day-care center, like that 
of a medical facility, should practice universal precautions with all children. 
This means wearing gloves when changing diapers and touching blood. 
</P>
<P>
 One CDC official told them: "You know about this child. He's not the one you 
have to worry about. You have to worry about all the ones you don't know 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 In a city like Washington, with its diplomatic families and other foreigners, 
chances were overwhelming that Benjamin was not the first HBV-infected child in 
the school -- or in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The center offered its staff free inoculations. Some accepted; others felt 
comfortable without them. One teacher learned that she had already been 
exposed. That only reinforced the CDC message: There had been infected children 
the center didn't know about. 
</P>
<P>
 When Benjamin started school, he was warmly welcomed. And I noticed, right 
from the start, that there was no shortage of hugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, his health brought a perilous new meaning to the most innocent 
rites of childhood -- a scraped knee or a cat scratch. Every time he fell, I 
held my breath to see if he was bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 When my unvaccinated mother came to visit, I had to hide her toothbrush. 
Brushing was a new experience for my son, and -- like everything else that was 
new -- he couldn't get enough of it. But brushing makes gums bleed, and blood 
can transmit the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin's first trip to the dentist was an exercise in frustration and 
hostility. The dentist, who had been vaccinated, donned a plastic face shield 
and other protective gear. This would not have annoyed me if I'd seen her do 
this with other children. But I'd never seen her wear anything more than a 
mouth mask and gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 One night, the kids got into a wrestling match, and Benjamin's fist ended up 
in Barra's mouth. When the crying stopped, his knuckles were bleeding. And so 
were her gums. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though she had been vaccinated, I panicked -- fearful that the vaccine 
might not have taken effect. The next week, I had her blood tested to be sure 
she was protected, and was reassured. SEEKING A CURE: Interferon already was 
licensed, and had an excellent safety record. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, I was using every resource in my medical Rolodex to obtain 
information about hepatitis B research. I learned that the National Institutes 
of Health was conducting a trial using interferon Alpha-2b in HBV-infected 
children, most adopted from Eastern Europe. Parents were taught to inject the 
drug three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30% to 40% of HBV-infected adults treated with the drug go into 
remission -- that is, they clear the e antigen. I knew nothing about the 
effects of the drug in children but decided to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 I called NIH's leading hepatitis B researcher, Dr. Jay Hoofnagle, whom I'd 
interviewed for a story. He said the preliminary results with interferon were 
encouraging, and offered to give my name to Dr. Hari Conjeeveram, who was 
conducting the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Conjeeveram called that night. He was a soft-spoken physician from India who 
responded warmly when I told him about my daughter. He seemed eager to know 
more about my son, and whether he would qualify for the NIH protocol. 
</P>
<P>
 NIH, the world's premier biomedical facility, sponsors thousands of studies 
here and around the world. Patients typically are referred to NIH by their 
doctors, usually when there is no other treatment available, or when 
conventional therapies have failed. Participants have to meet certain entry 
criteria. The care is free, and NIH often will pay for travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such research is not without risks, interferon already was licensed, 
and had an excellent safety record. 
</P>
<P>
 Conjeeveram was very enthusiastic about interferon, although he cautioned that 
the numbers of children in whom the drug had been studied were small. He said 
that about half of the children in his study had cleared the e antigen after 
four to six months of interferon therapy. According to my sources at the Food 
and Drug Administration, studies in Belgium and Spain had reported encouraging 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, unlike adults, who typically experienced severe flu-like side 
effects, children seemed to suffer little more than a low-grade fever and mild 
muscle aches. TAKING A CHANCE: 'I'm almost afraid to love him,' I said, knowing 
it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I was becoming convinced that Benjamin should try interferon, I 
wasn't sure if I wanted to go through NIH or see a specialist who could 
prescribe it privately. The NIH would be free -- but there was the possibility 
that my son would be placed in a control group, for comparison purposes, and 
would not receive the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 I decided to consult with a private specialist first. An FDA source 
recommended Alan Lake, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Johns Hopkins 
University Hospital in Baltimore. He was the best in the area, my source said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congratulations on your new son," Lake said on the phone, causing the tears 
to start again. "And stop worrying. He's going to be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin and I drove to Baltimore to see Lake the following week. When Lake 
appeared, he grinned at Benjamin, and began speaking to him in a Donald Duck 
voice -- an approach that almost certainly engages most of his young patients, 
but only puzzled a little boy who had been in America less than three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Lake was not keen on the idea. The drug was expensive. A 
four-month course of treatment for my son would cost at least $1,000 -- 
wholesale. That would not include a hefty markup or the cost of syringes and 
other materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, it would be an "off-label" use of the drug -- since it was not 
approved for children -- and my insurer would have to be persuaded to reimburse 
the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, he suggested NIH. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake and I watched my son tear around his office, turning the lights on and 
off, and punching the buttons on his phone. Lake chuckled. And I began to choke 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 I did not want to lose this little boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm almost afraid to love him," I said, knowing it was already too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love him -- I'll write you a prescription for it," Lake urged. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 8, we met with Conjeeveram at NIH. His explanation of the protocol 
left me discouraged. First, Benjamin would have to undergo six months of 
screenings, and then -- as I'd feared -- faced a 50-50 chance of receiving the 
drug. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to be honest with you," I told Conjeeveram. "I respect the work you 
are doing, but I don't want my kid to be a control. I want him on the drug. I 
want to get it privately. If you were me, what would you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Conjeeveram, the father of a boy close to my son's age, looked at me soberly 
for a long time. He was a scientist. His study was important, and it was far 
from being fully enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would do exactly what you're doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he urged me to stay on the NIH track, in case I was not 
successful in getting the drug outside the study. It made no sense to stop the 
NIH clock, and have to start from the beginning if I failed. 
</P>
<P>
 So we began the first of three months of regular visits there. 
</P>
<P>
 I returned to Lake, who had been unaware of the restrictions in the NIH study, 
and agreed that Benjamin shouldn't wait. He said he would prescribe the drug if 
a liver biopsy confirmed the hepatitis B diagnosis. The procedure established 
that my son had HBV -- nothing else -- and that the liver was not yet scarred. 
</P>
<P>
 The next hurdle was to persuade my insurer to pay for the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd worried about this the most. In gathering information about hepatitis B 
and interferon, I'd heard of families whose physicians were unwilling to go to 
bat for them, and they had been denied. I was afraid the insurers would say 
that this was an "experimental" use of a licensed drug. 
</P>
<P>
 My FDA sources assured me that an "off-label" use was not a sufficient reason 
to refuse reimbursement. Moreover, they said that FDA officials routinely 
intervened with insurers to support off-label uses, if the treatment was 
considered the "standard of care." They said they believed that Benjamin's case 
fell into such a category -- and they would fight for me. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake wrote a very strong letter, enclosing copies of existing studies. He also 
mentioned that he had reviewed his treatment recommendations for Benjamin with 
NIH researchers and FDA officials who had studied the interferon data, and who 
had read Benjamin's medical profile, and that he had received their 
enthusiastic endorsement. He was, in effect, signaling them that we had the 
backing of experts and were prepared to do battle should they refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Without apparent hesitation, the insurance company agreed to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin appeared to be an ideal candidate for interferon. 
</P>
<P>
 His enzyme levels were elevated, indicating his immune system was already 
fighting the virus and was likely to respond favorably to the drug. In 
addition, his viral DNA levels were low, meaning that -- even though the virus 
was replicating -- he apparently had a small viral load, which should make the 
virus easier to clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, I was sitting in Lake's office again, learning to fill a 
syringe and tap out the air bubbles. Then he stood, rolled up his sleeve, and 
made me give him a practice shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Emotionally, I had shifted into a new gear. I was beginning to feel that the 
drug was going to work. 
</P>
<P>
 And I couldn't help but wonder, as my optimism began to grow, about those 
parents who did not have the contacts in the medical community that I had. 
Where could they go? What would happen to their children? WATCHING, HOPING: 
'Some kids just breeze right through,' Conjeeveram said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most U.S. pediatricians, unaccustomed to seeing hepatitis B in children and 
unfamiliar with the research, would almost certainly recommend nothing more 
than a watch-and-wait attitude with periodic blood screenings -- indeed, before 
we found Lake, that was the attitude of our pediatrician. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, I began thinking about how close I'd come to selecting another child. 
And how I'd learned about Benjamin at virtually the final second. The more I 
thought about it, the more convinced I became that he had come to me for a 
reason. He almost certainly would have died at an early age if he had stayed in 
Russia. They didn't even know about his infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, horrifying as it now seems to me, I likely would have turned him 
down if I'd known in advance about his infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at last, with the hope that was being offered by interferon, I was slowly 
moving away from a life that was ruled by hepatitis B. 
</P>
<P>
 And I was falling in love. 
</P>
<P>
 I was charmed by the way Benjamin's face would beam and he would squeal with 
delight and run to hug and kiss me when I showed up at school to pick him up. 
"That's my mommy!" he would announce to the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 And I was amazed by his rapidly developing English and by his growing 
independence. "No -- by self!" he insisted when he wanted to do something 
without help. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember the day he came to me and said: "Mommy, my tummy hurts. Need more 
doctor." I was so thrilled by his sentence construction that I momentarily 
forgot about his symptom. 
</P>
<P>
 I gave him his first shot on Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a child who runs away when I try to wipe his face with a washcloth. 
But he stayed absolutely still when he saw the needle. Somehow, he knew it was 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 After two weeks, Lake drew more blood. He warned me not to expect to see any 
changes. He just wanted to be sure that the drug was not causing havoc with 
Benjamin's blood chemistry. The results showed no adverse side effects. But the 
liver enzymes were still elevated, the e antigen still positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin suffered only an occasional low-grade fever during the first few 
weeks of therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kids just breeze right through," Conjeeveram said. Although we were 
officially out of the NIH picture, we still talked by telephone. I asked 
Conjeeveram what to expect. He said there is typically a drop in the enzymes, 
followed by a spike -- known as a flare -- which indicates that the body's 
immune system is engaged in its final battle against the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, it is hoped, comes seroconversion -- the point at which the body clears 
the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Four weeks later, Lake drew another blood sample. Benjamin had been on the 
drug six weeks. I was beginning to feel discouraged again after my initial 
euphoria. I wanted to see something -- a drop in the enzymes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lake insisted that nothing would happen quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the only time he turned out to be wrong. TIME FOR ELATION: 'Even I 
didn't expect the results to be this good,' Lake said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a Wednesday, I called him, hoping to hear that the enzymes had dropped. He 
reported just the opposite. They were up, one of them by more than 100 units. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know whether this is good news, bad news or no news," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 I took it as good news. At least something was happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Saturday, he called me. The rest of the lab report was in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to give you an interesting weekend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Interesting is a very benign word," I replied. "I don't know what that 
means." 
</P>
<P>
 "His e antigen came back negative," he said. "It may mean the levels of virus 
are so low that the test just isn't picking it up. But, even so, it means he's 
going in the right direction. I am ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
 I whooped. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about antibodies?" I asked. "What about surface antigen?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even run those tests," he said. "I didn't expect anything to be 
happening so soon." 
</P>
<P>
 He recommended that we return in a couple of weeks and he would run the 
complete set of tests. 
</P>
<P>
 We did, and I watched as the technicians drew still more blood. It struck me 
what a stoic this little boy had become. He simply held out his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, my phone rang. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell me, tell me," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I just called to say hello," he said, laughing, and I knew it had to be 
good news. 
</P>
<P>
 "E antigen negative," he began, and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. "E 
antibody positive. Surface antigen negative. Surface antibody positive." 
</P>
<P>
 He paused. "I'm the eternal optimist," he said, "but even I didn't expect the 
results to be this good -- and this fast." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's cured?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 It was over. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other experts, including Conjeeveram, believe that Benjamin's immune 
system probably had been seroconverting on its own -- and got stuck. The 
interferon helped finish the job. Conjeeveram says they often see the same 
thing with adults. 
</P>
<P>
 'I doubt he would have been able to seroconvert without the drug," Conjeeveram 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Lake called, I drove to my synagogue. Benjamin was to receive his Hebrew 
name in a ceremony that Friday, and I needed to pick up a copy of the service 
so I would know what to say. 
</P>
<P>
 I left the temple office with the envelope, and got into my car. I decided to 
open it up and read the lines I was to recite: 
</P>
<P>
 We are thankful for the many joys with which our lives have been blessed. Now 
this great good has come to us: a new life, a new child to love, the opening of 
a new chapter in the chronicle of our family's existence. O may this child grow 
up in health and happiness, to become a blessing to family, friends and 
neighbors.  
</P>
<P>
 I put my head down on the steering wheel and began to cry yet again -- this 
time, finally, for joy.

POTENTIAL U.S. ENEMIES AMASS HIGH-TECH ARMS; MILITARY: GULF WAR-TYPE WEAPONS 
ARE REACHING THIRD WORLD NATIONS. PENTAGON LACKS EFFECTIVE COUNTERMEASURES.

<P>
 Many sophisticated American weapons that were stars in the Persian Gulf War 
are becoming widely available to potential Third World adversaries, who are 
stocking up and even manufacturing their own, U.S. officials warn. 
</P>
<P>
 The consequence, experts said last week, is that Americans are likely to 
suffer higher casualties in future wars -- a risk that could impede the United 
States' willingness to intervene in regional conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of weapons includes high-tech equipment such as night-vision goggles, 
satellite positioning systems, antitank and antiaircraft missiles and even 
primitive -- but effective -- cruise missiles, which can be used against 
ammunition depots and large ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Third World countries are also beginning to acquire conventional submarines. 
While these are a far cry from the American nuclear submarine fleet, they can 
easily be refitted to fire cruise missiles or launch naval mines, military 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the United States still has the edge in most of these areas, it has not 
developed effective countermeasures against use of such weapons by an enemy -- 
even for the relatively primitive versions that countries such as Iraq or Iran 
might acquire. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry D. Sokolski, a former Pentagon weapons expert who heads the 
Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, argued that the Gulf War might have 
been far more difficult for the United States to win if the Iraqis had been 
able to acquire weaponry that now can be purchased. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the Desert Storm-era technology that is making its way into the hands 
of potential Third World adversaries is disturbing to experts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Night-vision goggles. They provide users with the crucial ability to "see" 
surrounding terrain and troops in darkness. They are now sold routinely on the 
open market. Even Cable News Network has used such lenses to televise 
night-landings by U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 * Satellite positioning systems. These allow commanders to use space-based 
signals to determine precise locations. They are openly sold on the civilian 
market and can easily be applied to make Iraqi-style Scud missiles more 
accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anti-ship and antitank missiles. They can be manufactured from components 
widely available from Russian or Western sources. Some pricier cruise missiles 
even have radar-evading "stealth" design features. 
</P>
<P>
 * Conventional submarines. Although the U.S. Navy is good at hunting Russian 
subs, its gear is designed to operate primarily in mid-ocean, not shallow-water 
areas where Third World navies are likely to prowl. Iran, Iraq, Libya, Algeria 
and Syria all have acquired some conventional subs. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the proliferation of such weapons is a series of developments that have 
revolutionized the high-tech weapons market worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the new technology, such as satellite positioning and imaging systems, 
has legitimate civilian applications and is now being marketed -- or in some 
cases leased to subscribers -- by commercial firms. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Cold War's end, the United States and its allies have effectively 
scrapped the strict export controls that prohibited the sale of such 
technology, enabling manufacturers to ship components to virtually anyone who 
wants to buy them. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial advances on satellite technology have outstripped the military 
prototypes of even a few years ago, meaning the systems foreign governments can 
buy today often are more sophisticated than those that U.S. forces used in 
Operation Desert Storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon strategists say Third World countries are already able to buy 
sophisticated cruise missiles from Russia, which is offering a wide array of 
weapons in a bid to obtain more hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got the money, Russia will damned near sell you anything except 
nuclear weapons," said a Defense Department official familiar with 
international weapons transactions. "And most of it is very high-quality 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 China, which already has demonstrated considerable skill in cloning Western 
and Russian weapons, is not far behind in becoming a major supplier to Third 
World military forces. It is actively marketing weapons all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing, for example, recently sold Iran 10 Ho Dung patrol boats bristling 
with anti-ship missiles and will be able to begin rapid production of nuclear 
submarines in a few years, U.S. officials said. So far, China has shown little 
concern about who buys its weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is important because, while the United States still has a solid edge 
on such technology, adversaries that possess such weapons will be more 
difficult to beat in the next regional conflict that the United States becomes 
embroiled in. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Third World countries began acquiring such systems, there was no 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
 In Operation Desert Storm, for example, the United States and its allies 
defeated Iraq's army -- then the largest in the Middle East -- in six weeks and 
with 615 U.S. casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 But Williamson Murray, a former Pentagon planner who is now a professor of 
military and strategic history at Ohio State University, warned that the Gulf 
campaign might have been far different if the Iraqis had had satellite imagery 
or cruise missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 With today's access to satellite data, for example, Murray said Iraq might 
well have blunted the "Hail Mary" feint that U.S. tank forces mounted to make 
an end-run around enemy forces to destroy Iraqi armored vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 And Iraqi Scuds, which provided Baghdad with a psychological advantage in the 
war -- and almost drew Israel into the fray -- would have been up to 100 times 
more accurate with satellite data. 
</P>
<P>
 Such advantages might have enabled Hussein to deprive the United States of its 
sanctuaries at Saudi Arabian air bases, blow up key U.S. ammunition dumps, 
track U.S. tank movements and interrupt allied supply lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't have been this neat little war that we remember now," Murray 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disturbing to some defense planners is that, despite the increasing threat 
from the technology boom, the United States has no weapons capable of coping 
with some of the new, more sophisticated equipment that Third World countries 
are fielding. 
</P>
<P>
 * For all the recent improvements in the Patriot air-defense missile, for 
example, the Pentagon still is unable to shoot down enemy cruise missiles and 
has only begun to embark on programs designed to develop such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 * Enemy forces can use much of the positioning data from U.S. navigation 
satellites, even if the American military tried to jam the signal. And 
commercial services routinely sell satellite imaging data to whatever country 
wants to buy it -- with few questions asked. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many of the computer systems on which the U.S. military relies -- 
particularly civilian satellites and communications systems -- are vulnerable 
to sabotage, and neither military nor civilian officials seem eager to devise 
ways of protecting them. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Pentagon's new Counter-Proliferation Initiative -- designed to 
bolster the ability of U.S. forces to deal with the rapid spread of new, more 
powerful weapons to potential Third World adversaries -- deals exclusively with 
nuclear, chemical and biological warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Sokolski pointed out that, in today's world of reluctant superpowers and 
instant television coverage, Third World adversaries need not actually defeat 
the United States militarily; all they have to do is leverage small, even 
temporary gains to make their point. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Iraq's surprise Scud attack on Israel in 1991, which destroyed 
only a handful of houses, almost succeeded in overturning the entire allied 
strategy by heightening pressure on Israel to enter the war. This surely would 
have brought more Arab states to fight beside Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 In another instance, a raid by a U.S. Ranger company in Somalia last Oct. 3 -- 
which left 18 U.S. soldiers dead and dozens wounded -- sparked an immediate 
push in Congress to pull U.S. forces out entirely, though previous U.S. 
casualties in Somalia had been relatively light. 
</P>
<P>
 Sokolski wants the United States to begin working on crash programs to develop 
new weapons that can head off threats, such as from cruise missiles, and to 
design new technology that can help protect U.S. satellite data and computer 
systems from sabotage. He also wants the United States and its allies to 
restrict the missiles, mines, submarines and other such weapons that they are 
willing to sell to potential adversaries, so it will be easier for the West to 
design effective countermeasures. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, not everyone is as worried about the new danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force Col. John A. Worden, a chief Pentagon strategist during the Gulf 
War, argued that critics are exaggerating the threat from the spread of such 
technology, contending that the United States still has the ability to stay 
ahead and is working on the problem actively. 
</P>
<P>
 While some Third World countries may be able to "get at chunks of" the new 
technology, Worden said, "for things to have any real impact, they'd have to be 
able to employ them relatively quickly and in a relatively coherent way -- and 
they can't. I can't think of anything that Iraq could have owned at the start 
of the Gulf War that really would have made a difference," he asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 Worden contended that the Pentagon already has adequate programs in place to 
develop the kinds of weapons that are needed to meet the new technological 
threat. The key, he argued, is for U.S. research and development teams to 
continue their work. "We simply cannot afford to stand on our technological 
laurels," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Bernard E. Trainor, another key military 
strategist, agreed. "It's obviously serious anytime anyone has an improved 
capability," he said, "but other countries aren't likely to come up with the 
system of weapons that we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Trainor said, the fact that Third World countries are buying more 
conventional submarines is ominous for the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything our Navy has developed to counter subs is designed for deep water, 
not shallow areas," he said. "This will be a much tougher world." 
</P>
<P>
 But Don M. Snider, a former Pentagon strategist now with the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies, argued that, while the Third World's push 
for new weapons may not be sufficient to defeat the United States, it could be 
a serious threat in two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is not whether potential adversaries have more of the new 
technology but whether the United States is managing to stay as far ahead of 
the pack as it was during the Gulf War," Snider said.

ISRAEL PRESSURED TO REOPEN SITE OF MOSQUE KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than six months after a Jewish settler shot dead about 30 Muslim 
worshipers in a mosque here, the site remains closed to Jews and Arabs, and 
both sides are crying foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is under growing pressure from Orthodox Jews and 
rightist Israeli politicians to reopen what Israelis call the Cave of the 
Patriarchs by sundown Monday, when the Jewish High Holy Days begin with Rosh 
Hashanah, the Jewish New year. During a special session of Israel's Parliament 
on Wednesday, opposition members castigated the government for failing to 
reopen the site. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin is also under fire from Muslims who say Israel is planning to 
unfairly divide what they call the Mosque of Ibrahim into separate prayer 
areas, with Muslims getting the smaller portion of the ancient structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism comes not only from Hebronites, but also from Palestine 
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat and other members of the 
Palestinian Authority who have accused the Israeli government of attempting to 
defile a Muslim holy site. 
</P>
<P>
 Many now argue that only Muslims should be allowed to pray at the site, 
although tourists from all faiths should be allowed to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an Islamic mosque," Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natshe told The Times last 
week. "It was never a synagogue. There should be no allowance for other 
religions to pray there." 
</P>
<P>
 Natshe spoke after he and members of the Islamic High Council in Hebron toured 
the mosque with Shalom Goldstein, Israel's military governor of Hebron. It was 
the first time a Muslim delegation has been allowed into the site since Baruch 
Goldstein, a physician who lived in the nearby settlement of Kiryat Arba, 
attacked Muslims as they prayed on the morning of Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim delegation did not like what it saw during its tour, according to 
Natshe and Sheik Salah Natshe, head of the Islamic Waqf in Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now the Muslims will enter from the north side of the mosque and stay in the 
east side, in Isaac's Hall," said Mayor Natshe, illustrating the new 
arrangements on a floor plan of the site. "The Jews will enter from the south 
and stay in the west side." 
</P>
<P>
 The west side of the mosque, divided into two halls, contains tombs believed 
to hold the remains of Abraham and Jacob. The two small halls together are 
larger than the hall on the east side, where the tomb believed to contain 
Isaac's remains stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is safer," Natshe acknowledged. "They have the cameras, they have built 
walls between the Jews and the Muslims, they will have soldiers protecting 
Muslims from the settlers. But still it is a division, and we will never accept 
this division." 
</P>
<P>
 Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian Authority's planning and economic cooperation 
minister, tried to visit the tomb on Wednesday, but the army kept him out. 
Standing on the steps leading up to the cave, Shaath denounced the army's 
security plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is very wrong to mutilate a place of worship," Shaath told 
reporters. "Even though it is a place of worship of two religions, it should 
not be divided." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath said the Palestinian Authority is seeking an urgent debate by the U.N. 
Security Council on the measures Israel is taking in the cave. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbis who have been allowed to visit the site have greeted the security 
arrangements more warmly. But they are disappointed that the site remains 
closed with no date for its reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Rabbis Yisrael Meir Lau and Eliahu Bakshi-Doron recommended last month 
that the government physically separate Jewish and Muslim worshipers rather 
than hold them to different prayer schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you separate by time, then there may be problems if one group does not get 
out on time when another group wants to get in to pray," Rabbi Rafi Dayan, an 
adviser to Bakshi-Doron, told reporters after the chief rabbis toured the site. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with a court order, the army also intends to ban weapons from the 
site. Before the massacre, Jewish worshipers were allowed to carry their guns 
there, and Baruch Goldstein was able to walk past soldiers carrying an 
automatic weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief rabbis have criticized the installation of electronic cameras inside 
the cave, arguing that their continuous operation might violate the Sabbath. 
Some Muslims also say that the presence of cameras in the cave violates the 
sanctity of a house of prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sacred place that has existed in the first place for people to 
worship their God," Sheik Natshe said. "All these things that the army is doing 
are just to improve the security of the settlers. We refuse all these actions." 
</P>
<P>
 An army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the reopening of 
the site has been delayed because of special training for the army unit that 
will be permanently detailed there. But he also said the ultimate decisions 
rest with Rabin's Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin's primary dilemma is that Hebron remains a powder keg -- an 
overwhelmingly Palestinian city that is home to about 40 Jewish families 
guarded by hundreds of Israeli soldiers. It is the only community in the West 
Bank where Jews have moved into Palestinian neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The militant settlers who began living in Hebron in 1968 say they have merely 
re-established an ancient Jewish community that lived continuously in Hebron 
until it was evacuated by British authorities in 1948, when Britain still held 
the U.N. mandate for Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Palestinians, the armed settlers symbolize all that they hate about 
Israel's occupation. They have taken over Palestinian homes and made it clear 
to residents that they believe they have a more ancient and more valid claim to 
the land. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, Hebronites feel even more resentful of the settlers today than 
they did six months ago, blaming them -- and the army's obsession with 
preventing a retaliatory attack on them -- for the city's deteriorating 
economic situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is done here in the name of security," Mayor Natshe said. "After 
the massacre, the army closed down the vegetable market near the mosque. They 
blocked off streets and put restrictions on the movements of residents." 
</P>
<P>
 All those precautions are still in force, Natshe noted. "It is all in the name 
of the security of the settlers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The area around the cave, once a lively marketplace, today is virtually empty, 
save for foot soldiers patrolling around settler homes, and settlers strolling 
with guns over their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of Palestinian men sitting outside their closed shops across from the 
cave said they can't remember a worse time for Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gone from bad to worse in this city since the massacre," said Jamal 
Qafisheh, a construction worker whose 13-year-old son, Kamal, was among those 
slain by Baruch Goldstein. "There is no work here. I haven't worked for six 
months, and that is the situation for most of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Jews," said another Hebronite, who declined to give his name, "have 
turned the situation to their advantage."

CASTRO LIFTS KEY OBSTACLE IN U.S. TALKS; MIGRATION: CUBA WILL RESUME N.Y. 
MEETINGS ON THE EXODUS TODAY WITHOUT PRESSING THE TRADE EMBARGO ISSUE. BUT 
HAVANA'S ENVOY STILL SEES A 'LONG ROAD' AHEAD BEFORE ANY ACCORD. 
</P>

<P>
 Cuban President Fidel Castro will no longer insist on discussing the U.S. 
trade embargo of his nation as a condition for settling the immigration dispute 
that has been fueled by the exodus of thousands of refugees from the island, 
Havana's chief negotiator said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, two leading members of Congress urged the Clinton 
Administration to consider lifting the decades-old embargo and broaden talks 
with Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiator, Ricardo Alarcon, said that despite his country's concession on 
the embargo, he and U.S. diplomats still have a "long road" to travel before 
reaching a detailed agreement to end the flow of Cuban rafters who have been 
trying to reach the United States through the Florida Straits. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon, a former foreign minister and U.N. ambassador, is scheduled to resume 
talks with U.S. negotiators today at the American mission to the United Nations 
in New York. The discussions, which began Thursday, were suspended for a day 
when no agreement was reached by Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks are proceeding at a relatively slow pace despite the sense of 
urgency felt by the Clinton Administration over the Cuban immigration issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The steady flow of refugees is troublesome for President Clinton, who also 
faces a difficult situation elsewhere in the Caribbean -- the continued 
defiance by Haiti's military commander Gen. Raoul Cedras. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, U.S. State Department officials seemed to raise the ante in the 
region by advertising their determination to invade Haiti, if need be, to 
restore to power elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown 
in a military coup. 
</P>
<P>
 The dual issues loom large over the White House, which has been sorely 
criticized for its handling of an array of foreign policy matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon, speaking on CNN's "Newsmaker Saturday," said that because the 
Americans refuse to discuss the embargo, "we are flexible enough to sit down 
with them and make an effort to try to resolve a partial issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether U.S. negotiators had given any indication of a willingness to 
discuss the longstanding embargo, Alarcon said: "No, and I think it's a 
mistake. It's something that has to be done one day." 
</P>
<P>
 While Alarcon declined to discuss any details of the negotiations, he 
acknowledged that the Americans had offered to guarantee more than 20,000 
immigrant visas a year to Cubans if Castro can stop the exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and Cuban diplomats signed an agreement more than 10 years ago that set 
aside a maximum of 27,845 visas a year for qualified Cubans. But U.S. officials 
have insisted that most Cuban applicants do not meet the requirements of U.S. 
immigration law, and visas have been granted to only about 3,000 Cubans a year. 
The new U.S. offer would presumably relax the immigration requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides also have discussed the return of about 1,500 convicts who 
arrived in the 1980 Mariel boat lift and are now in U.S. jails. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for the U.S. concessions, Washington hopes Castro will use his 
police force to stop the refugee flow. 
</P>
<P>
 The exodus reflects the sore economic straits of Cuba these days, abandoned by 
its old patron, the former Soviet Union, and cramped by the trade embargo. The 
32-year-old embargo was imposed by the John F. Kennedy Administration in 
February, 1962, after the now-infamous Bay of Pigs invasion failed and Castro 
announced that he was a communist. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasional efforts by Castro to get the embargo lifted have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, after several incidents in which Cubans hijacked ferries and other 
boats to make the trip to Florida, Castro decided to let Cubans go unimpeded as 
long as they did not seize government boats to make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugee flow appeared to lessen Saturday. While the U.S. Coast Guard said 
that it had intercepted 1,353 Cuban refugees by day's end Friday, it reported 
only 850 rescues on Saturday. More than 20,000 Cubans have been intercepted 
since the exodus began in earnest last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to discourage the departure of refugees, Clinton has revoked the right 
of Cubans to enter the United States automatically as political refugees and 
has ordered the Coast Guard to take them to the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo 
Bay on the eastern tip of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 He has ordered the Cubans detained in camps there, not far from Haitian 
refugees who also had fled their homeland in hopes of entering the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's policies toward both Haiti and Cuba were sharply 
criticized Saturday by Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee, and Sen. Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the leading 
Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Contending that Castro is, in effect, "dictating" U.S. policy, Hamilton said 
on CNN: "I find that to be a very unacceptable situation. So far as I can see, 
our policy is to kind of sit back and wait to see what Castro does, hoping that 
he will pass from the scene in some way. It's a reactive policy and not 
satisfactory." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton said he would lift the embargo "in a calibrated way" and use it "as a 
leverage, as a tool. . . ." Rather than isolating Cuba, he said, the United 
States "ought to be . . . invading Cuba, if you would, with information, with 
people, with facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Lugar agreed, saying: "I would, if I were President Clinton, go on with that 
(talking about the embargo) fairly soon. All these stout denials that we will 
never talk . . . seem to me just simply to create a very, very tough 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Lugar also derided indications by Deputy Secretary of Defense John M. Deutch 
that a Haitian invasion was a virtual certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile Saturday, the Defense Department announced that Defense Secretary 
William J. Perry canceled a trip to Russia so he could remain in Washington to 
"deal with ongoing issues, particularly Haiti and Cuba."

PROP. 187 CREATORS COME UNDER CLOSER SCRUTINY; INITIATIVE: FROM SECRET 
LOCATION, POLITICAL VETERANS AND NOVICES LEAD THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like other political neophytes who banded together last autumn for an all-out 
war against illegal immigration, Ronald Stephen Prince had a story to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 His bitter account would become a refrain in a fiercely contested initiative 
campaign: An illegal Canadian immigrant bilked him out of $500,000 in a 
construction project, and the judicial system offered no recourse. But it is 
also an account sharply disputed by court records and the Canadian himself, who 
has lived in the United States legally for almost 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The frustrated Prince, an obscure, enigmatic Tustin accountant, stood in front 
of a Vons supermarket with a clipboard and pen in hand, hoping to whip up 
public sentiment against illegal immigrants. Eventually, he would become one of 
the key leaders of the initiative campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the sweeping measure has unleashed powerful emotions on all sides, its 
founders at the California Coalition for Immigration Reform have labored in 
political anonymity, escaping the scrutiny that is often focused on the authors 
of controversial ballot initiatives with far-reaching consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of political beginners and seasoned veterans have cobbled together a 
powerful volunteer movement from a statewide campaign headquarters in Orange 
County that is a secret location even to some of the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the key players are citizens like Prince who are avenging injustices 
that they believe were committed against them at the hands of illegal 
immigrants. Others believe illegal immigration has unfairly drained U.S. tax 
dollars. Still others with the same agenda will reap financial benefits from 
the campaign. Although it has been touted as a volunteer effort, at least three 
organizers have billed the campaign for tens of thousands of dollars for 
political consulting services. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan C. Nelson, former head of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and 
co-author of the initiative, is owed $26,500 for his work, according to 
campaign finance reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other consultants, who have petitioned for bankruptcy under Chapter 13, 
also have received more than $35,000 through June for managing the campaign and 
reimbursement of expenses, according to financial disclosure statements filed 
by the initiative's organizing committee. The consultants, Robert Kiley and his 
wife, Barbara -- the mayor of Yorba Linda -- are owed $51,000 for their work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kileys hosted the first strategy session that spawned the initiative, 
which would deny education, non-emergency health care and other public benefits 
to illegal immigrants. The measure, Proposition 187, faces a vote Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 When they all met last Oct. 5 at the members-only Center Club in Costa Mesa, 
the future leadership of the campaign knew little about each other except that 
they shared the same contempt for illegal immigrants, a group some scorned in 
their newsletters for the "stench of urination, defecation, narcotics, savagery 
and death." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-member group -- which included Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy 
(R-Arcadia) -- recognized that it lacked money and a statewide political 
organization. But it had the determination to do something more active than -- 
as one participant, a newsletter publisher, put it -- "wring hands . . . and 
drink tea." 
</P>
<P>
 They debated the issue for the entire day, settling on a strategy proposed by 
a political unknown, Prince: a statewide petition drive for an initiative to 
end public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, they picked the name SOS -- like the international distress 
signal -- for their campaign while dining on Mexican food at an El Torito 
restaurant in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron set everything up," said Barbara Coe, co-chairperson of the coalition, 
who had a network of political contacts that Prince sorely lacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all his idea. He said: 'If you people will pick up the ball, I will 
run with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For someone who has placed himself directly at the forefront of the state's 
most controversial ballot initiative, Prince has proved a private man. 
</P>
<P>
 At 46, the campaign co-chairman guards details about his personal life more 
zealously than the location of the Proposition 187 headquarters, which is a 
closely held secret because the leaders fear retaliation from their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, who says he is a fifth-generation Californian, politely refuses to say 
where he was born (Long Beach), where he resides (Tustin or Downey, according 
to government agency records), or to disclose his place of employment. He is an 
accountant who used to work for his family's business in Downey, but now spends 
most of his workdays and weekends at the Tustin campaign office. 
</P>
<P>
 Why so private? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the repeated threats we have gotten, especially when it's directed 
at me," Prince said without elaborating. His co-chair, Coe, says she recently 
received a dollar bill with a bullet hole drawn on George Washington's forehead 
and drops of red-ink blood streaming down his face. She said the handwritten 
message on the bill read: "Beware of Prince and Coe." 
</P>
<P>
 His reluctance to discuss his background contrasts starkly with Prince's 
smooth debating style during private and public forums on the illegal 
immigration issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing cool and aloof at times, he increases the volume and pace of his 
speech only slightly as he defends the initiative against a coalition of 
opponents made up of civil rights activists, Roman Catholic church leaders, 
teachers and others. 
</P>
<P>
 So devoted was Prince to the movement that he donated $2,000 to get the 
campaign off the ground last year, and then loaned another $20,000 in May, 
according to campaign finance reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where the heck did he get the money?" asked William Baker, Prince's former 
attorney, who has a keen interest in his income. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker obtained a court judgment against Prince -- which as of July totaled 
$9,643 -- after the accountant refused to pay the lawyer for defending him in 
the legal dispute involving a Canadian citizen who Prince claims defrauded him 
in a construction project. In a statement obtained by Baker last year, Prince 
said he was unemployed and had no assets. 
</P>
<P>
 During the course of that case, Prince dropped Baker as his attorney and filed 
with the secretary of state an unsuccessful proposal for an initiative that 
called for every member of the State Bar to be re-examined every four years. 
Prince said recently that the events were unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince's fight with his attorney was but a minor skirmish in the larger court 
battle between Prince and his former friend, Leonard Thomas Chornomud, 59, a 
Tustin auto garage owner and -- INS records show -- a legal immigrant from 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chornomud had no construction experience, both informally agreed in 
1984 to finance and build an addition to Chornomud's Tustin home. They later 
expanded their speculative agreement to include construction of a home for 
Prince, who hoped to learn new steel construction techniques possibly for 
future business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership ended six years later, with each man accusing the other of 
fraud, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair slapped each other with lawsuits and countersuits in state and 
federal courts, but even the attorneys for both sides and the judge conceded 
that the deal -- born out of friendship -- was too messy to assign blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Perplexed by Prince's claim that he had contributed about $70,000 for the 
projects, Bankruptcy Court Judge James N. Barr pointedly asked from the bench 
during an October, 1991, hearing why Prince gave the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince replied: "I am a nice guy, I am a good friend. I trusted Leonard and 
Gloria Chornomud. Gloria (who legally immigrated from Nicaragua) had gone on at 
great length about how honorable Spanish people were and that they could be 
trusted, and I believed her, because that has also been my experience in the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Prince would later claim he had lost about $500,000 as a result of 
his dealings with Chornomud -- the Bankruptcy Court case documented only 
$70,000 -- he settled for a $32,000 payment from Chornomud that ended the case 
in May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Chornomud, meanwhile, claims to have lost even more. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Francisco Examiner article about the initiative published in June told 
of Prince being "defrauded by a Canadian citizen living here illegally, and 
(Prince) said he and others never would have lost money if this country took 
its immigration laws seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's totally false," said Chornomud in anger. "Our country is in trouble 
because of men like him. Our country is what it is today because of immigrants. 
It's the immigrants that worked harder than any other group." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Prince refused to discuss Chornomud. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, he claimed Chornomud told him he was an illegal immigrant. Later, he 
said Chornomud was not the illegal immigrant he had referred to in previous 
interviews. Was it possible that there could be another Canadian citizen who 
had allegedly bilked him out of half a million dollars in a construction 
project? 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not going to tell you who it was," Prince said. "I don't think it's 
pertinent." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince argued that the news media had paid too much attention to his anecdote. 
The impetus for the campaign, he added, was not his story, but "the stories of 
all of the people I have talked to" who said they had been harmed by illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Prince is the philosopher of the movement, then Barbara A. Coe is its 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 When it formed last fall, the new coalition ended up relying on the extensive 
contacts of Coe, 60, a diminutive, chain-smoking woman with an apocalyptic 
vision of the world that is all exclamation points and question marks. 
</P>
<P>
 From her home in Huntington Beach, she presides over an active political 
network tied together by the passionate prose of her newsletter, "911." 
</P>
<P>
 An Oklahoma native, Coe is a late-blooming political scrapper who has 
contributed more than $15,000 to the campaign against illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Coe's political baptism came three years ago when she went to an Orange County 
social services office to smooth out a dispute involving an elderly war 
veteran's public health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The frantic scene in the lobby startled her, reminding her of the United 
Nations, she said. Coe noticed windows open to serve Spanish- and 
Vietnamese-speaking clients, but said the single one available for 
English-speaking applicants was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked in and I'm going, 'Where am I?' " Coe recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 A welfare agency employee offered some answers and sympathy. Coe listened in 
dismay as the counselor complained that illegal immigrants were able to obtain 
the same services that were denied to Coe's elderly friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went ballistic," said Coe, whose rage led her to other immigration reform 
groups that she found weak and powerless. 
</P>
<P>
 So Coe and a former INS border agent, Bill King, decided to form a group with 
more muscle. They placed a brief ad in a free newspaper announcing a Costa Mesa 
meeting of "everyone concerned about the illegal aliens problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a big pot of coffee, crossed our fingers and waited," Coe said. To 
her surprise, almost 40 people showed up to listen to the featured speaker, 
none other than the same government worker who had complained to Coe about 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 From those grass-roots beginnings, Coe and King formed Citizens for Action 
Now, joining with other groups worried about illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 That loose web of connections brought Prince and Coe together last fall to 
form the California Coalition for Immigration Reform. "We clicked," laughed 
Coe. "He said: 'I've heard about you.' I said: 'I hope it's good and if it 
isn't, it's a lie.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Prince and Coe were the muscle behind the movement, then the stars in the 
beginning were two former top INS officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Former director Nelson and former western regional chief Harold Ezell, who 
were known for their controversial styles at the agency, are credited with 
co-authoring the initiative. They lost their top positions in the INS in 1989 
several months after George Bush took office and accepted their letters of 
resignation, which are routinely submitted by top appointed officials to a new 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, a Sacramento-based lobbyist, and Ezell, of Newport Beach, say they 
have eased out of the day-to-day Proposition 187 campaign to form a national 
group of their own called Americans Against Illegal Immigration, which was 
organized after the campaign was under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that there needs to be a lot of groups that are picking up this 
issue (nationally) and running with it," Ezell said. 
</P>
<P>
 So distant are they from the state campaign that Ezell said he has no idea 
where the campaign headquarters is located. 
</P>
<P>
 However, both men continue to stump for the cause on radio shows and public 
forums. In their INS jobs they proved to be masters at preaching the gospel of 
immigration reform. Ezell became known for his affinity for television cameras 
and microphones -- sometimes holding as many as six news conferences a week 
during his six-year stint. 
</P>
<P>
 But Latino immigrant rights activists pressed for his resignation and some 
Republican Administration officials considered him an embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Ezell, Nelson stirred controversy as INS commissioner. He produced a film 
touting his accomplishments in an effort to save his job, but was ousted in 
1989 after a seven-year stint. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of his undoing was an audit by the Justice Department that criticized the 
INS for inefficiency. Nelson constantly engaged in battles with immigrant 
rights groups and drew fire when the INS planned to construct a four-mile ditch 
at the San Diego border. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the Proposition 187 committee organized, Nelson was a high-profile 
lobbyist for the cause through a consulting contract he had with the Federation 
for American Immigration Reform. However, the group allowed the contract to 
expire late last year out of concern that Nelson's political activities might 
threaten its nonprofit status. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robert and Barbara Kiley are, by trade, political hired guns. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is the first time they have managed a high-profile statewide 
initiative campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders say the campaign is strictly volunteer. However, the Kileys' political 
consulting business has received more than $35,000 during the first six months 
of the campaign for management services, commissions and overhead, according to 
campaign finance records. The firm is owed another $51,000 for the Kileys' 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken commissions but haven't taken any salary," Robert Kiley said. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the campaign raised $335,923 through the end of June, with 
expenditures totaling $406,319. Those expenses included $115,000 paid to 
professional petition gatherers, with another $38,506 still owed for that 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the petition drive was under way late last year, the Kileys reported to 
bankruptcy court that they had new business clients. Instead of being forced to 
liquidate their assets, the Kileys asked to convert their case from Chapter 7 
to Chapter 13, which would let them pay off creditors with their new income. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Prince and Coe, who came to the fight with personal stories, Robert 
Kiley said his involvement does not stem from any firsthand experiences with 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in this issue. This was not a thing about money; basically we 
believe in the issue. We're consultants and we like to be paid, but that's not 
what this is about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax money is being wasted on illegal immigrants, he said, adding that "as a 
taxpaying citizen, I'm feeling pinches like everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kiley wonders whether the measure, if approved by voters, will face 
legal challenges. But at least, he said, the Proposition 187 group has 
accomplished its initial goal -- to call attention to illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we wanted to do," he said, "is wake up the Legislature."

EXODUS OF L.A. DISTRICT TEACHERS GROWS; EDUCATION: UNION LEADERS CALL THE 
TURNOVER 'DISASTROUS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Ask Lauren Hartford why she quit teaching in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, and she gives two answers. The first is the official one -- her 
commute was too long -- and the second is the unofficial version -- the 
district is too mired in annual labor strife and bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hartford tells the unofficial story, she is at turns regretful and 
passionate. Here she is, a bilingual teacher at San Fernando Elementary, a 
product of local schools, quitting in frustration after seven years to take a 
job in another district. 
</P>
<P>
 She says the district has cut money for supplies, increased class sizes and 
refuses to make the classroom the priority in budgetary and other decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like if I had stayed with this district, I would have just burned out 
on my profession," she said. "And I love teaching. But the way L. A. city 
schools are now, I wouldn't send my daughter there." 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford is one of more than 2,100 teachers -- 8% of the school system's 
teaching force -- who quit or retired this year. More teachers left the system 
this year than in any of the past seven years, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the teachers resigned, a trend that both the school district and the 
teachers union say is disturbing. Of the 2,127 who left the district, 1,452 
quit and 675 retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, the annual attrition rate for teachers is about 5%, according to a 
new study by the National Center for Education Statistics in Washington. That 
study also found that more than half of nearly 7,000 public and private school 
teachers believed that higher salaries and better benefits would encourage them 
to remain longer in their classrooms. While district officials say they find 
the numbers worrisome, they say this year's exodus was expected. They say the 
earthquake and the sluggish economy forced many to move, and the teaching staff 
is getting older and closer to retirement age. Those factors, along with the 
10% pay cuts instituted two years ago, all contributed to the resignations, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Board of Education members say they anticipated even more resignations 
this year. "I expected a huge turnover this year," said board member Leticia 
Quezada. "But even 2,000 is a lot, and as long as we're in these economic 
conditions, it would take a miracle to turn this around." 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders say the teacher turnover is "disastrous" and does not bode well 
for reform efforts at local schools. "We have to keep starting all over again 
every year," said Helen Bernstein, the president of United Teachers-Los 
Angeles. "Every year they're retraining and indoctrinating teachers. The 
district could provide adequate wages and some stability so people think they 
have some reason to stick around." 
</P>
<P>
 The turnover leaves the school district struggling to fill classroom 
vacancies. The district expects to have nearly 2,000 openings, despite 
projections showing about 1,500 fewer students are expected to enroll this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of substitute teachers are expected to fill vacancies this fall. In 
the subjects that are hardest to staff -- such as English, special education, 
math, science and social studies -- officials said long-term substitutes could 
be assigned until permanent teachers are hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the problem is the fact that more schools are doing their own 
hiring and the district's personnel office is unsure exactly how many teachers 
will be needed when most schools reopen this month. With an increasing number 
of campuses following a new reform plan allowing them to select their own 
staffs, the district no longer controls all the applications and keeps track of 
where teachers are being interviewed or assigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Assistant Supt. Irene Yamahara, who oversees the personnel 
division, says the district is recruiting teachers, particularly in the 
so-called shortage fields. But she said not enough teachers are leaving local 
graduate schools to fill the vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the teachers the district expects to hire, more than half probably will be 
"emergency credentialed" teachers, who do not hold specific education degrees 
or credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be tough -- it always is," Yamahara said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers such as Hartford are hot commodities. Hartford is a fully 
credentialed bilingual teacher; the district needs 234 teachers like her this 
year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty much, teachers like that can go anywhere," Yamahara said. "They can 
write their own ticket." 
</P>
<P>
 But by far the greatest need for teachers in the district is in special 
education classes, where the numbers of students are swelling. The district 
anticipates needing more than 300 special education teachers and probably will 
have substitutes fill most of those positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual labor disputes with the teachers union are hampering efforts to 
attract teachers to the system, union and district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitter and protracted contract talks culminated two years ago with teachers 
taking a 10% pay cut, narrowly averting a strike. This year, the union again 
threatened to strike if teachers' pay was not restored. 
</P>
<P>
 But under a new contract proposal, negotiated last weekend, the district is 
offering teachers an 8% restoration of the 10% cut. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has set a strike vote for Sept. 13-14, when teachers will decide to 
either accept the contract offer or walk out. Union leaders have recommended 
teachers accept the latest offer. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last few weeks, district personnel offices received numerous calls 
from prospective applicants asking about the labor situation and whether they 
should sign contracts or even interview at school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 But district spokesman Bill Rivera said he believes the latest salary offer 
could entice teachers to the district. If the offer is accepted, a teacher 
without any experience would make $29,131 this year, up from $26,573 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And a teacher with 25 years of experience could make $53,003, up from $48,349 
last year, according to district data. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why go somewhere else when you can make as much or more here?" Rivera said. 
"The salaries will be higher." 
</P>
<P>
 But the ongoing labor dispute led many teachers, from the newest to the more 
experienced, to leave the system this year. Pat Hillis, the librarian at 
Pacific Palisades High for 24 years, said she would have liked to retire later, 
but she believed she could no longer work for a salary that had been cut to 
help subsidize the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "If working conditions had been better, I would have liked to have stayed," 
Hillis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillis and the 674 other teachers who retired this year were eligible for a 
one-time, 10% bonus negotiated with the teachers union two years ago, designed 
to help restore the salary cut. But to the surprise of the union and the 
district, fewer teachers than expected took advantage of the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Many said that the money turned out to be negligible and had little, if any, 
effect on their retirement pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Lauritzen, a math and computer science teacher at Canoga Park High, said 
he is considering retiring in the winter, when he still would be eligible for 
the retirement bonus. Nonetheless, Lauritzen said that while he wants to return 
to school this month, there are few incentives to keep him at the campus, where 
he has taught for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not giving me any motivation to stay," Lauritzen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board has established a new personnel committee designed to examine 
these issues. Quezada, chairwoman of the new committee, said she hopes to look 
at the ways in which the district can encourage teachers to remain in the 
system and to forge closer relationships on school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the district's reform plans, teachers are becoming much more involved in 
local decision-making -- a move that the board and district officials hope will 
encourage teachers to feel more a part of their local campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 But to their union, teachers are constantly being encouraged to leave -- not 
to stay in their classrooms. "I don't think it takes a wizard to figure it out 
-- if they cut your salary, you leave," Bernstein said. "It has to do with how 
they make you feel. They want us to do everything, but they treat us badly." 
</P>
<P>
 Even teachers who say they were treated well say the pay cut and the 
continuous labor strife have led to job dissatisfaction. "I think most teachers 
are just saying, 'Enough is enough,' " said Don Palmer, who retired recently 
from Madison Middle School in North Hollywood. "I enjoyed the school; we've had 
good administrations, and I always felt I could walk into their offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we've certainly had our problems, and I can't help feeling -- and many of 
the teachers feel this way -- that there's tremendous mismanagement in the 
district. It's just increasingly frustrating dealing with the district." 
</P>
<P>
 As a computer science teacher, Palmer said he needs more updated equipment and 
more training. He said the district has refused to pay for new computers and to 
provide him with the classes he says he needs to be more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 To Hartford, who graduated from Granada Hills High, the district has been a 
tremendous training ground. When she first began teaching -- before she had her 
credential or graduate degree -- she said she basically learned how to teach 
from her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are wonderful, professional staffs . . . but there's just so much else 
going on all the time. Every year, there's something."

BRAZIL OFFICIAL QUITS AFTER SAYING HE SLANTED DATA; POLITICS: FINANCE MINISTER 
TELLS INTERVIEWER, IN WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS PRIVATE CHAT, THAT HE SOUGHT TO AID 
CANDIDATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just one month before Brazilians go to the polls, the nation's presidential 
campaign was jolted when the country's finance minister resigned Saturday after 
admitting during what he thought was a private conversation that he manipulated 
economic data to help the government-backed candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no scruples," Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero told a television 
reporter Thursday in what he thought was a private chat prior to a televised 
interview. "What is good, we take advantage of. What is bad, we hide." 
</P>
<P>
 The comments, however, were inadvertently broadcast nationwide through 
satellite dishes before Ricupero and the reporter realized they were on the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricupero's statements to the TV Globo reporter were particularly stunning, 
because opposition candidates had been claiming for weeks that the government 
was diverting funds and using other measures to help support presidential 
candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a former senator and Ricupero's 
predecessor as finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Only hours before Ricupero's slip, presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da 
Silva of the leftist Workers' Party had claimed in a Sao Paulo press conference 
that he had fallen behind Cardoso in the polls largely because of government 
and media efforts to aid Cardoso. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were making these claims, they said we were radicals," Lula said 
Saturday. "His statements point out the gravity of the involvement of the 
government and the TV Globo in the benefit of the candidacy of Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso." 
</P>
<P>
 President Itamar Franco on Saturday accepted Ricupero's resignation and tried 
to distance himself from the finance minister's statements, saying that he was 
"shocked and perplexed" by the comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never heard him make such statements," Franco told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricupero's resignation could threaten Brazil's 2-month-old economic plan to 
strengthen its currency and halt spiraling inflation. Ricupero, former 
ambassador to the United States and the fifth finance minister in less than two 
years, has been in charge of guiding the program, which was designed by 
Cardoso. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 1, the nation introduced a new currency, the real, and an economic 
program to drive down inflation, which had run at more than 2,000% last year. 
The government reported that inflation for August was 5.48%. 
</P>
<P>
 The early success of the plan has been a huge boost for Cardoso, who 
skyrocketed from being 20 points behind in mid-June to being more than 20 
points ahead by the end of this month, according to recent polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricupero said his efforts to promote the economic plan have been a tremendous 
help to Cardoso's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Countless people phone me or look me up to say that they will vote for 
(Cardoso) because of me," Ricupero told the TV Globo reporter in the private 
chat. "He knows that I am his big vote-getter." Ricupero added that he was a 
perfect tool to mask government and media efforts to support Cardoso "because 
(TV Globo), instead of having to support Cardoso openly, they put me on the air 
and nobody can say anything." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Lula's campaign was trying to counter his efforts, "but it can't, 
because I'm on the air all the time, and nobody can say anything. Isn't that 
right? This is the solution, indirect, right." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian Atty. Gen. Aristide Junqueira has launched an investigation into 
reports that ministers like Ricupero, and even the president, have been using 
their offices to help promote Cardoso's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Franco and his aides have undertaken multibillion-dollar 
measures that could aid the candidate, including $770 million in wage increases 
for more than a million public workers and a promised $6.1 billion in farm 
credits. 
</P>
<P>
 The government also has sped transferring money to states and cities. It has 
disbursed $1.65 billion in the first five months of this year, compared with 
$770 million for the same period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general is looking particularly into reports that Mines and 
Energy Minister Alexis Stepanenko pressed aides and other ministers to 
inaugurate the Xingu hydroelectric dam and carry out a $16.5 million 
electrification project in Mato Grosso state. 
</P>
<P>
 Urging Planning Minister Beni Veras to free funds for the project, Stepanenko 
wrote: "This deals with the commitment of the president, of (Cardoso) and me," 
according to a copy of the Aug. 1 memo published in Veja news magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso, who has consistently denied any governmental connection to his 
campaign, said he was "surprised" by Ricupero's comments but doesn't believe 
they will harm his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "My campaign has nothing to do with all this. I didn't ask for any of his 
declarations. That's part of the government and not in the campaign with me. If 
he supports me as many do in Itamar's government, it is as a citizen."

CHINA, RUSSIA SETTLE FINAL LAND BORDER DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 China and Russia settled the last remaining dispute over their 2,725-mile land 
border Saturday and pledged they would no longer aim nuclear missiles or use 
force against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidents Jiang Zemin and Boris N. Yeltsin signed the agreements during the 
first visit here by a Chinese leader since Mao Tse-tung in 1957, before the 
Sino-Soviet alliance gave way to bitter struggle for supremacy in the Communist 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony marked a further warming in relations that were normalized in 
1989 at the initiative of then-Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and have 
been marked since by booming two-way trade. Jiang was accorded the rare 
privilege of staying in the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 By delineating a 34-mile fragment of their western border, in the Altai 
Mountains, Russia and China buried a quarrel that led to armed clashes in 1969. 
They also agreed to further talks to cut "to a minimum level" the number of 
troops stationed on each side of the entire frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Russia and China still dispute three small islands in rivers along 
their eastern border, Yeltsin called the agreements "an achievement of historic 
dimensions. . . . For the first time, practically the entire border is legally 
defined." 
</P>
<P>
 Easing conflict with China is important for Russia as it redefines its 
security interests. The shrinking army inherited from the Soviet Union ended a 
massive retreat from Eastern Europe on Saturday when the last several thousand 
troops came home from Germany and the Baltics and marched in Moscow in a 
festive parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace with China, Russia's most powerful neighbor, will enable the retreating 
army to redeploy largely to the south, to keep ethnic warfare now simmering in 
former Soviet republics of the Caucasus Mountains and Central Asia from 
spilling into Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The declaration signed by Yeltsin and Jiang pledged never to allow ideology to 
obstruct Russian-Chinese relations and to stay out of any alliance that would 
endanger the security of the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Their agreement on de-targeting missiles is similar to ones Russia signed 
earlier this year with the United States and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Autumn is the season of harvest, and in Moscow we have reaped a good crop," 
said Jiang, who is spending four days in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin, who went to Beijing for a previous Russia-China summit in December, 
1992, added: "Our views coincided on all the issues touched upon in our talks." 
</P>
<P>
 The two presidents agreed to boost bilateral trade, which almost doubled in 
the past three years to a record $7.7 billion in 1993. China is now Russia's 
second-biggest trading partner after Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 They brushed aside sharp differences over internal economic reform and closed 
ranks against critics in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 China's leaders not long ago denounced Yeltsin and Gorbachev as traitors to 
communism and Russia's post-Soviet political reforms as mistaken. Russia's 
democratic politicians have acknowledged the successes of China's slower-paced 
economic reforms while criticizing Beijing's rule as repressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pay much attention to studying the experience of economic reforms in 
China, which launched them earlier than we did," Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese spokesman Wu Jianmin said the two presidents agreed that "the 
international community should acknowledge that there is no single pattern for 
the development of all countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite appeals from reformist Russian lawmakers to join the West in 
condemning China's harsh treatment of dissidents, there was no mention of human 
rights in the presidents' declaration. "These problems were not discussed at 
the summit," Wu said.

A CLEAN, SOBER OPTION FOR STUDENTS; EDUCATION: DON'T BOTHER CHECKING INTO UC 
BERKELEY'S FREEBORN HALL IF YOU DRINK, SMOKE OR DO DRUGS. BUT IT IS NOT THE 
BORING PLACE MOST PEOPLE EXPECT, RESIDENTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Residents of one UC Berkeley dorm have a message for their fellow students who 
like to light up -- anything. If you tune in and turn on, or even smoke 
cigarettes and drink beer, you have to drop out of Freeborn Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 About 230 students -- many of them exasperated with the lifestyles of their 
fellow students -- have secluded themselves in the campus's first 
substance-free dormitory, which opened this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Freeborn Hall pledge not to bring or use alcohol, tobacco or 
illegal drugs in the building -- a renovated high-rise two blocks south of 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other Berkeley dorms, students of legal age are allowed to smoke and 
drink in their rooms. Illegal drugs are prohibited, but in a city where many 
people have not ended their trip through the psychedelic '60s, and the City 
Council orders police not to enforce marijuana laws, drugs are easy to come by. 
</P>
<P>
 As in many campus settings, moderation is not the rule. Students tell stories 
of beer kegs stored in closets, pot parties that last till dawn and cigarette 
smoking stopped only for sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 The dorms have also harbored a few drug dealers. In April, university police 
closed in on one student who had 180 hits of acid and small amounts of 
marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms in his room. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is, for students not interested in mind expansion, the regular 
dorms can be one big hassle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived above three chain smokers and next to two more. I would open the 
window for fresh air, and have to shut it right away. It was like living above 
a chimney," said Gbenga Ajilore, 19, of Pasadena. Ajilore, another student and 
a member of the housing staff persuaded the school to create Freeborn Hall to 
escape not just smokers but substance abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd find my friends passed out outside the building. I'd have to bring them 
in and take care of them," Ajilore said. 
</P>
<P>
 He now works in the building checking students' ID cards as they enter the 
dorm, but he lives off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as Martina Estrada-Melendez, 18, of Los Angeles and Edwin Tang, 
18, of New York City, want to avoid dealing with the late-night disturbances 
and the vomit that often accompany weekend drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students choose to live here for a variety of reasons," said Aaron Anderson, 
the residential life coordinator who came up with the idea for the dorm. "Some 
have already experimented with alcohol and drugs and they've had terrible 
experiences; some are serious students, and some choose it because of their 
religion. There are others who come from families where maybe a parent . . . 
was an alcoholic," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 230 students who live there make up a small percentage of the 5,200 
undergraduate and graduate students living on campus. But there were more than 
400 requests to live in the dorm, and more have come from students who have 
experienced their first week at school in the real-world dorms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students come up to me all the time and ask how they can get in here," said 
Corinna Monzon, 21, a residential adviser who has lived in both types of dorms. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not the boring place most people expect, Monzon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from different preferences, students in the substance-free dorm are 
hardly distinguishable from their counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 They blare music, talk in the halls until the wee hours of the morning and 
cram for exams. 
</P>
<P>
 The dorm has chosen the questionably hip 1980s as its theme for throwing 
parties -- meaning they play Culture Club music and applaud Velcro-trapped gym 
shoes. They also have "mock tail parties," take tours of San Francisco and the 
campus late at night, and are known for impromptu dance parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is still noise, just not drunken noise. It's not like a whole other 
world," said 18-year-old Nichelle Hines, a freshman studying English and drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Crizella Wallace, an 18-year-old from Paramount, said she has never had a sip 
of alcohol or smoked a cigarette. She said she lives in the dorm because she 
suffers from asthma, bronchitis and emphysema and must stay away from smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's Jessica Morales, 18, otherwise known as Miss Teen California 
1993. Morales, who chose to come to Berkeley to study integrative biology 
instead of running for the national title, said she is sick of watching drugs 
destroy people's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen so many friends get torn up on acid, speed and Ecstasy. I've had 
two friends killed and another two critically wounded (in a car accident) when 
they left a teen 'rave' party where they could get anything from LSD-laced 
lollipops to nitrous balloons." 
</P>
<P>
 Students who live elsewhere tend to scoff at the dorm and its residents -- at 
least until they visit and see how clean and upbeat it is, Monzon said. Then 
they start reconsidering. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeehat Kasubhai, who lives in another dorm, conceded that she may have been 
too quick to dismiss Freeborn. "I wanted more of a live environment," Kasubhai 
said. "I guess I stereotyped the place."

BARDS AND BURRITOS; RAFFISH POETRY READINGS INTERSECT WITH LATINO CULTURE AT 
ROBERTO'S TACO SHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bards of the borderlands invade Roberto's Taco Shop. 
</P>
<P>
 A regiment of artists and connoisseurs of the spoken word deploys from pickup 
trucks and Jeep Cherokees -- all ponytails, bongo drums, cameras, baggy denim, 
faded flannel, bespectacled cool and pent-up aspirations. They come armed with 
verses for the masses. 
</P>
<P>
 Representing the masses on this Friday night are the Mexican immigrant cooks 
toiling in the steam behind the counter and two young female customers in 
sullen makeup and tight jeans. They watch the poets in the parking lot through 
the glass, warily. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard McCaskill, a 27-year-old ex-Marine with a saxophone slung around his 
neck, blows an introductory Coltranesque riff into the microphone. The notes 
wander across the crowded parking lot of the mini-mall into the intersection of 
25th and Broadway, a stark arena ringed by a fire station, Kentucky Fried 
Chicken and 7-Eleven. Neon-streaked concrete shimmers in the afterglow of an 
evening rain. Buses rumble by. A firetruck wails off to a catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaskill recites: 
</P>
<P>
 " Alley flies prance, dance a catch-me-if-you-can dance on top of hot garbage 
cans  
</P>
<P>
 A homeless man stands and mans his world stuffed into a cart  
</P>
<P>
 Concrete jungle dove coos for the crumbs I toss down by my shoes  
</P>
<P>
 And the radio station at Roberto's plays the Taco Shop Blues. " 
</P>
<P>
 Forget coffeehouses tonight. Forget universities. Forget bookstores. This 
cheerful and raffish band of scribes from San Diego and Tijuana want to bring 
the poetry to the people and the people to the poetry. They have selected what 
they consider a bulwark of authentic, unmediated, unchoreographed Latino 
culture in action: the taco shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea started because it got boring to read to the same people all the 
time," said Adolfo Guzman, a music curator at the city's Latino cultural center 
who organized the readings at four eateries. "What we decided to do is take it 
to different sites, to combine two different spaces: the taco shop space and 
the spoken word space . . . to see what happens when they intersect. The people 
who go to buy food, they kind of trip out and they stick around. And the people 
who go to listen to the poetry, they also eat." 
</P>
<P>
 The performers represent a range of ages, ethnicities and styles, although 
Chicano and Mexican themes predominate. There is sly, rapid-fire subversion of 
both border languages ("frijolier- than-thou" is one example from poet Victor 
Payan) and plenty of political denunciations aimed at Washington and Mexico 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 " La migra disparo y la poesia murio (The Border Patrol fired and poetry 
died)," declaims shaggy-haired Elias Ramirez. In a growling barrio lament 
melding Spanish and English, he recounts the death of a friend in a 
confrontation with law enforcement. " He made a suspicious movement -- and I 
feared for my life! " 
</P>
<P>
 After limping away from the microphone, Ramirez describes himself as an 
11-year survivor of the neighborhood known as Golden Hill. That name lingers 
wistfully, decades after the elegant old homes on the heights overlooking 
downtown San Diego lost their cachet. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place is what I write about," Ramirez says, referring to the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an edgy place where inner-city and gentrification collide. Where an 
Asian American man, perhaps 5 feet tall, with baggy shorts, short silver hair 
and feverish eyes, emerges out of the night. He drifts among the earnest, 
stylish, young men and women leaning on cars and sitting cross-legged on the 
pavement. He applauds uncertainly, goes inside and starts hitting on patrons 
for spare change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lot of money out there," a youth tells him in accented English, gesturing at 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaking his head repeatedly as if banishing a thought, the little man mutters: 
"What's the meeting about? Political protest? Jesus? What they talking about?" 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Manuel Mancillas -- literary alias Zopilote (Vulture) -- is talking 
in Spanish about the recent Mexican presidential elections. He assails the 
tyranny of Mexico's ruling party. He crescendos to a satiric final image of the 
party as God, of virgins bathed in waters that are " crystalline and 
transparent like the glasses of Jacobo ," (a renowned television anchorman 
despised by government critics), which reflect the future: "social peace, 
McDonald's, the Hanks (an allegedly corrupt political clan) and CitiBank !" 
</P>
<P>
 Sophisticated stuff for 25th and Broadway. But that's the point, says Adrian 
Arancibia, 23. He recently earned a degree in Spanish literature from UC San 
Diego, where his mentor was poet Quincy Troupe. Arancibia's work features an 
ode to his native Chula Vista and a reflection on the fall of O.J. Simpson. His 
personal canon includes Pablo Neruda of Arancibia's native Chile, a group of 
Puerto Rican writers from New York and the hip-hop culture that he says is 
creating his kind of urgent and gritty literature. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real force," he says. "It used to be that hip-hop imitated poetry. Now 
poetry's imitating hip-hop." 
</P>
<P>
 Arancibia hopes the taco shop series will "take it to the masses." Previous 
readings attracted quite a few passersby, he says. At one event a crack addict 
grabbed the microphone and delivered a diatribe on race. "He was really 
seriously into it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the most enthusiastic response occurred in Tijuana at the enormously 
popular Tacos El Gordo; taquerias in the Mexican border city tend to draw a 
more socio-economically diverse and educated clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, tonight at Roberto's, many of the regulars -- laborers in work 
boots, families, husky youths in cholo attire -- seem uninterested, surprised, 
even intimidated by the crowd of almost 100 congregated at the entrance. Few 
stick around for the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The amplified verses and musical accompaniment provoke downright hostility 
from one of the two young women lounging inside. Her black hair is swept up on 
her head; she wears maroon lipstick and dusky eye shadow; she is lean, skittish 
and graceful in a black halter top. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm gonna kick all of them out here," she snaps in Spanish at the manager, 
who turns away quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "She doesn't like poetry," says her friend, who has blond- streaked hair. She 
has been peering intently through the glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that lady used to be my teacher," she murmurs. "The one sitting down, 
in the black jacket? I think she was my teacher in middle school. A long time 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery remains unsolved. Minutes later the woman in black stalks away 
through the lot, trailed by her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad, because they could have been living inspiration for one of the 
night's final offerings: "Taco Shop Love." Author John Partida, an admittedly 
nervous 15-year-old, wins over the audience with his adolescent wooing of a 
redheaded temptress amid shouting countermen: 
</P>
<P>
 "(' Number 14 !') ' I say, ' What's your name ?' She says , ' Jean .' I said, 
'My name's John.' She asked me , ' Are you strong, John ?' I say , ' No .' I 
say, ' Would you like to go to a show with me ?' She says , ' Si .' " 
</P>
<P>
 At about 10:30, just as things are winding down, the San Diego police show up. 
</P>
<P>
 The black-and-white cruiser has nosed through the parking lot earlier, perhaps 
trying to figure out what is going on. But this time the squad car stops. Two 
muscular officers climb out, looking stern; official tolerance for loud 
literary loitering appears to have run out. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential clash is averted, however. At that moment, master of ceremonies 
Guzman is thanking the listeners and bidding them good night. 
</P>
<P>
 The police officers look at each other and get back in their car. The visitors 
disperse gradually. The parking lot empties. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the taco shop, the people keep coming and going. Because Roberto's at 
25th and Broadway, the newly anointed cultural crossroads of the transborder 
metropolis, never closes. And the poetry never stops.

RESHUFFLING THE DECK OF NEVADA POLITICS; ELECTION: NEWCOMERS ARE WILD CARDS IN 
A GAME ONCE RULED BY POWERBROKERS. HOMESPUN AURA IS FADING FAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years ago Jan Jones was a political nobody in the Silver State, a mother 
of five best known as a TV car huckster with sparkling jewelry and a toothy 
grin. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Jones has been rather busy. First, she became mayor of Las Vegas, 
the biggest city in the nation's fastest-growing state. Now, she is mounting a 
strong run for governor, a quest that could make her the first woman to reach 
the top rung on Nevada's ladder of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 45, is clearly an overnight political sensation. Part of that 
metamorphosis is a product of her energy, ideas and telegenic personality. But 
her rise also proves a broader point: Political change is afoot amid the 
sagebrush and slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a state where a small fraternity of powerbrokers anointed candidates for 
major offices and dominated the political game, Nevada today is a place where 
phenomenal growth has created a jackpot of opportunities for newcomers and 
neophytes who possess the drive to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "You no longer have to be a good old boy to break into Nevada politics," said 
Eric Herzik, a political scientist at the University of Nevada in Reno. "That 
traditional network is breaking down, and it's creating openings for different 
kinds of people who never had much access before." 
</P>
<P>
 Other signs of Nevada's political maturation abound: 
</P>
<P>
 * Campaigns -- once provincial affairs that relied on door-to-door visits with 
voters and were run by a small coterie of managers who doubled as lobbyists -- 
are now big-time, big-money events. Experienced consultants from other states 
have settled here, and a cottage industry of advertising companies, polling 
firms and television production houses has sprung up to serve them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is much more resident sophistication than you found before," said Sig 
Rogich, a veteran Las Vegas consultant and former adviser to Presidents Ronald 
Reagan and George Bush. "In the past, there were just a few of us local people 
doing it all. Now (consultants) with reputations have moved in from outside." 
</P>
<P>
 * New restrictions on the financing of political campaigns are winning favor 
in the Legislature. In 1991, the first-ever limits on campaign contributions 
were adopted, and candidates may no longer spend leftover donations on personal 
items. Political action committees were recently required to register with the 
secretary of state, and lobbyists also face new scrutiny. Under a bill passed 
last year, they must identify who they wine and dine in monthly reports. 
</P>
<P>
 * In another change -- one triggering widespread lament -- the state's 
staggering population growth is gradually eroding the small-town, homespun feel 
that has long been a cherished feature of politics, Nevada style. 
Traditionally, elected officials of the highest rank were expected to show up 
at every 4-H fair or weenie roast. The governor -- who was always called by his 
first name -- took constituent calls at home and traveled without a trace of 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 As Nevadans' numbers soar, that sort of intimacy is becoming impossible. 
"Longtime residents expect a level of access (to politicians) that you'd never 
see in a state like California," Gov. Bob Miller said in an interview. "I want 
to fulfill that expectation, but as Nevada grows it gets tougher and tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 * While women candidates have made the strongest gains, Nevada minorities are 
running for office in record numbers. The state is just 3% Asian, but a Chinese 
American -- Cheryl Lau -- was elected secretary of state in 1990, becoming the 
first minority to hold a statewide office. Now she is one of the three top 
challengers in this year's governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay men and lesbians, meanwhile, are also emerging as a political force, one 
wooed by candidates in statewide contests. Last year, gay rights advocates 
celebrated a victory that once seemed unthinkable in this conservative land 
settled by Mormons -- the repeal of an anti-sodomy law by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little by little, you're seeing change in the political orientation of the 
state," said Bob Fulkerson of the Nevada Progressive Coalition, a new group 
that hopes to accelerate that shift by recruiting candidates for political 
office. "A lot of the old kingmakers are still around, but their stranglehold 
is unraveling." 
</P>
<P>
 At the root of many of these changes, experts say, is the state's 
extraordinary growth. Lured by jobs, cheap housing and low taxes, outsiders are 
pouring into Nevada in dizzying numbers, propelling the population from 800,000 
in 1980 to more than 1.4 million today. In Clark County, home of Las Vegas, 
roughly 4,000 new residents arrive each month, most of them from California. 
</P>
<P>
 Some come from Republican pockets such as Orange County, and they share 
conservative values long dominant here, such as a disdain for taxes. Many 
arrivals, however, appear to be nourishing more liberal trends. Jean Ford, a 
former state legislator from Reno, says this phenomenon is visible in the 
contrast between two statewide referendums, one in 1978, one in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, Nevadans defeated the Equal Rights Amendment by a 4-1 margin. In 
1990, 63% of the state's voters passed a measure guaranteeing a woman's right 
to an unrestricted abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "That vote was an astonishing victory," said Ford, who now teaches women's 
studies at the University of Nevada. "It proved how far we've come, how 
attitudes have changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond their views on such issues, the newcomers are affecting Nevada's 
political agenda with their sheer numbers, creating problems on a scale never 
imagined when the state was sparsely populated and largely rural. Schools, 
social services, water, health care, overcrowded prisons -- these and other 
concerns now dominate debate and create unprecedented challenges for Nevada's 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark County, home to 64% of the state's population, faces the most daunting 
pressures. This fall, voters will be asked to approve $905 million in bonds to 
begin building 110 desperately needed schools. Last year, county voters 
rejected bonds to pay for more police and parks; there is little confidence 
they will approve them for schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years ago, nobody ever worried about growth. It was just, 'Go, go go,' " 
said Jon Ralston, a columnist and publisher of a newsletter on Nevada politics. 
"Now we see the consequences of that attitude, and today growth is the 
political issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its evolution into an urbanized state more like California than 
Wyoming, Nevada has not altogether lost its legendary flair for political 
quirkiness. This tendency began early -- with Nevada's admission to the Union 
in 1864. 
</P>
<P>
 Statehood, recalls historian James Hulse, happened not because the desert 
region was "suitably prepared to graduate from territorial status." Instead, 
President Abraham Lincoln made it happen because he needed Nevada's Electoral 
College votes to win reelection and end the Civil War. "No other state," Hulse 
writes in "Silver State," his recent history of Nevada, "was ever born so 
prematurely or had so much trouble coming of age." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, had he lived, Lincoln might have come to regret his decision. For 
Nevada became a notorious maverick among states, scorned for its legalization 
of gambling, prostitution and prize-fighting -- and its willingness to serve up 
a quickie divorce. Its politics were never, ever dull. 
</P>
<P>
 There was, for instance, the tale of the U.S. senator reelected on his 
deathbed in 1940. During a pre-election drinking spree, the Democratic senator 
suffered a heart attack and was declared a dying man. Fearing that voters would 
elect his rival -- thus placing the seat in Republican hands -- his backers hid 
the news. The senator won the election, and when he died five days later, the 
governor appointed another Democrat to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Statehouse in Carson City, old-timers can recall many a memorable 
episode, from the Assembly Speaker who presided drunk and incoherent over a 
session's closing days, to brawls in the halls and a mysterious bullet said to 
have been fired through a portrait of Lincoln during a heated debate. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, a popular prostitute from Esmerelda County nearly won a seat in 
the state Assembly. Beverly Harrell, proprietor of the Cottontail Ranch, lost 
the 1974 race by just 120 votes after campaigning in an RV filled with 
enthusiastic call girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Though rare today, colorful characters still pop up on Nevada's political 
scene. This year, a man named Rhinestone Cowboy is making a bid for governor. 
He is joined on the ballot by Samuel Bull IV, an electrician whose campaign 
pledges include a shift to executions by hanging and a return to Nevada's no 
speed limit days. 
</P>
<P>
 If voters are not keen on Cowboy, Bull or any of the other candidates on the 
ballot, no matter -- Nevada continues to offer them an option available in few 
other states: the chance to reject all the contenders and choose none of the 
above. 
</P>
<P>
 This option has produced some intriguing outcomes; in the 1980 Republican 
primary, none of the above outpolled George Bush in the race for President. 
Ronald Reagan came in first. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such peculiarities are harmless, other enduring traits of Nevada 
politics are somewhat less charming, critics say. Despite its growth and 
increasingly complex problems, Nevada is still run by a part-time "citizens" 
Legislature that meets for about five months every other year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralston, the columnist, calls the part-time Legislature "a ridiculous relic" 
that is highly vulnerable to special-interest pressure: "These legislators are 
paid a pittance -- $6,800 for the session -- and they have no research staff of 
their own," he said. "That makes them all the more reliant on lobbyists. 
Information is power." 
</P>
<P>
 The most powerful players, of course, are the gaming moguls. Since their 
influence eclipsed that of miners and ranchers in the 1950s, casino owners have 
contributed more to political candidates than any other interest group. Their 
lobbyists have an unparalleled record of squashing gaming tax increases and 
other legislation deemed hostile to the state's No. 1 industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of today's gambling titans are using new techniques to make their mark. 
Multimillionaire Stephen A. Wynn, whose casinos include the Mirage and Treasure 
Island, created a highly sophisticated polling and voter research operation two 
years ago. He shares his findings with chosen candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, the casinos just threw money at campaigns," said Dan Hart, who 
was hired by Wynn to set up the system and now works as campaign manager for 
Jan Jones. "That still happens, but now they're also finding smarter ways to 
use their resources." 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, this year's battle for the governor's post will be dominated by 
gaming contributions, with the Democratic incumbent Miller -- the son of a 
casino executive -- reaping the lion's share of support. But the fiercely 
contested race also symbolizes the new dynamics evident in Nevada politics. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, the scale of the campaigns mounted by Miller and his three 
challengers is unprecedented, making it by far the most expensive governor's 
race in state history. Although the total will look paltry beside the $40 
million expected to be spent in the race for governor of California, it will 
easily top $4 million -- twice the sum spent in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of the campaigns is different as well. With the state's population 
explosion, the candidates are more reliant than ever on television advertising 
to carry their message: "There's no avoiding it," said Billy Vassiliadis, 
Miller's political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 The most striking change is visible in the people who believe they have a shot 
at the state's top political job. In this sense, two candidates stand out. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Republican side there is Lau, 49, a former university professor and 
deputy attorney general who came out of nowhere to win the secretary of state's 
job in 1990. She is opposing Assemblyman Jim Gibbons of Reno. In the Democratic 
primary there is Jones, a Santa Monica native who left a lucrative career with 
a family auto dealership business to become mayor of Las Vegas in 1991. Both 
are political rookies. Both are newcomers to Nevada. Both are highly educated. 
And both are women opposing men in Tuesday's primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the new breed of politician we never had in the old Nevada," said Guy 
Rocha, the state's archivist. "What would be truly unusual is if these two 
women faced off (in the general election) in November." 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, that does not look likely. The latest polls show Miller -- a 
former Clark County district attorney whose political career spans 20 years -- 
with a comfortable lead over Jones, his primary opponent, and all other rivals. 
With the state's economy in robust shape, his challengers have had trouble 
finding fodder for potent attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 But some observers believe growth may be a wild card in this election. 
Newcomers, they argue, arrive here with open minds and limited knowledge of the 
state's political players. That may dilute the traditional advantage of 
incumbency, giving Miller's challengers a boost. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first ran for office, everybody was suspicious of me because I'd only 
been in the state for five years and they figured I didn't truly understand 
Nevada," said Lt. Gov. Sue Wagner, whose political career began in the Assembly 
two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "But look around this state today -- everybody's a newcomer. They don't care 
whether you're a native or not. What they want to know is, 'Can you do the 
job?' "

ON CALIFORNIA: FAIRY TALES AND A STORY ABOUT FISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was perched on a downtown wall, trying to catch the eye of tourists and 
shoppers as they strolled by, bags clutched firmly in hand, all business. He 
wore a red woolen shirt with a hole in the back, stone-washed jeans and tennis 
shoes. His pale blue eyes were pretty clear. He needed a shave, though, and his 
breath smelled like too many New Year's mornings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Got a quarter, man?" he asked, shaking a McDonald's coffee cup. "I'm saving 
up for swimming lessons so I can get out of here and go to Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
 He smiled a wan smile. More than a few teeth were missing. A notebook came 
out, and a conversation began. The panhandler gave his name as Jim Brown. But, 
he added, brightening, "people call me Fish." And he told his story. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish said he had been living on the street since 1981 -- "right here in Santa 
Barbara, the prettiest place you can find anywhere." He had lost his house and 
fishing boat in divorce court. "A judge made a bad decision," he said. Anyway, 
there had been a recent reversal, and any day now the state would be sending 
him "a big piece of change." Ask anyone at Joe's Cafe, he said. They would 
verify it. 
</P>
<P>
 That would not be necessary, Fish was told. All that mattered was that he 
clearly was an expert on the topic at hand -- panhandling. "You bet," he said, 
shaking his paper cup. Two, maybe three coins rattled around inside. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Transients in general, and street beggars in particular, have come under 
attack throughout California. Cities that once congratulated themselves for 
their compassion -- Santa Monica, Berkeley, San Francisco, Santa Cruz -- now 
devise complicated strategies for driving out transients. These panhandler 
crackdowns, it is said, will buck up the local economy, will indirectly help 
cure the cancers that fester in society's underbelly. Or so go the modern fairy 
tales now told to justify the old, old job of running beggars out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Santa Barbara, a new "Say No to Panhandling" promotional campaign has 
been initiated by the Chamber of Commerce. "Make your change help, not hurt," 
the slogan goes. Fish knew all about it. He knew the theory was to deprive 
downtown panhandlers of spare change and, thus, deprive them of booze and 
drugs. That way maybe they would go straight. Or maybe they would just go 
somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking as an expert, Fish regarded the campaign as more than a bit 
misguided, a product of misperceptions. "Most of the people that panhandle," he 
said, "are on Social Security. Some are winos and drug addicts, but most of 
them are just old-timers who pay $550 a month to live in some doper hotel. That 
leaves about $100 for food and clothes and anything else. When they run out of 
money, they panhandle. It's how they eat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Myself," he said, "I don't get any government checks. This" -- he rattled the 
cup again -- "is how I make a living. Eight or 10 bucks a day is all it takes. 
That buys me my cigarettes, beer and dinner. Once I do that much, I go home for 
the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Home, he said, is a downtown deli, where he sleeps in a bedroll on the porch 
and dreams of businesses he will start, once that check from the divorce case 
comes flying in. Fairy tales. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fish doubted that the Say No campaign would "make a bit of 
difference," he was not unsympathetic toward its advocates. There were new 
faces on the street, he said, some rough, some pushing drugs, all rude. "They 
don't know how to talk to people," he complained. "They don't have the 
intelligence. You have to humor people. Make 'em laugh. Tell 'em a joke. I say 
stuff like, 'Care to adopt an aging hippie?' or 'I'm saving to buy a condo in 
Montecito.' It makes people feel better about me." 
</P>
<P>
 Do you like this life, Fish? 
</P>
<P>
 He stared into his cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he said flatly. "I hate it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what the hell else are you going to do? I can't go no farther down, 
except six feet. You make the best of your situation, right? You do what you 
can to survive. What else can you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, what can you do? 
</P>
<P>
 The interview completed, Fish's cup was made a good deal noisier. Call it 
Spare Change journalism, misguided charity. Perhaps it was, but the fairy tale 
I prefer to believe is that Fish will spend his panhandling money on swim 
lessons, just like he said, and someday paddle off to Hawaii. Will it make 
California a better place? Will it make everything just perfect? Well, that's 
another fairy tale altogether.

JAPANESE SOCIALISTS ABANDON ANTI-MILITARY DOCTRINE; ASIA: THE ABOUT-FACE 
ELIMINATES ALL MAJOR POLICY GAPS WITH THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS. DISSENT COULD 
SPLIT PARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama won approval Saturday for a historic reversal 
of his Socialist Party's pacifist policies, but the victory dealt a severe blow 
to party unity. 
</P>
<P>
 A special party convention backed Murayama's declarations supporting the 
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, recognizing Japan's armed forces as constitutional, 
accepting nuclear power generation and acknowledging the national anthem and 
national flag. 
</P>
<P>
 These declarations, which Murayama made in July after forming a coalition with 
the Liberal Democrats and the splinter New Party Harbinger, reversed positions 
that had been the Socialists' bedrock for four decades. The about-face 
eliminates all major policy gaps with the Liberal Democrats, who during their 
1955-93 rule had been archenemies of the Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval of the new policies came only after 40% of the party's delegates 
tried to block them with an amendment to retain the anti-military policies. The 
amendment was rejected 222 to 152. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Parliament members resigned during the daylong convention, where 
widespread dissent pointed toward the possibility of a future party breakup. 
</P>
<P>
 Party divisions could dampen Socialist prospects in an upper-house election in 
July and a lower-house election that must be held by 1997. Last year, the 
Socialists lost half their seats in a lower-house election. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama received a taste of grass-roots opposition when on arrival at the 
convention he was confronted by about 200 peace and environmental activists, 
beating drums and carrying placards saying, "Don't sell out the party." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who can't fully understand the Socialist Party's new policy 
developments say the party has lost its reason to exist -- but that will never 
happen," Murayama told delegates Saturday. "The era of ideological 
confrontation is over. The time for debating specific policies has arrived." 
</P>
<P>
 Wataru Kubo, the party's secretary general, cited a government decision to 
limit the increase in next year's defense budget to a historic low of 0.9% as 
an example of how Murayama will substitute policy for ideology. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its founding in 1955, the Socialist Party has advocated unarmed 
neutrality and insisted that Article 9 of Japan's constitution bans the armed 
forces. In 1960, it sponsored demonstrations against the U.S.-Japan Security 
Treaty that forced President Dwight D. Eisenhower to cancel a visit to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to nuclear power generation was added to the party's platform in 
1972. Socialists also opposed the national anthem and flag as lingering symbols 
of Japan's wartime militarism.

CLINTON LAUDS WORKING AMERICANS IN LABOR DAY ADDRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton paid a Labor Day tribute to working Americans on Saturday, 
asking them to rally around his Administration in the work of making the nation 
better for all. 
</P>
<P>
 What is needed, Clinton said in a weekly radio address delivered in a gym 
filled with residents of Martha's Vineyard, is a government that neither tries 
to do everything itself nor does nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, government should form partnerships with people, communities and 
business because "when we pull together for the common good, we are 
unstoppable." 
</P>
<P>
 The gymnasium at Tisbury Elementary School had the air of a town meeting. This 
is a heavily Democratic island and the 400 or so people inside were invited -- 
many in response to calls or letters they had sent welcoming the Clintons to 
their vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 The President took credit for sparking the economy, improving trade and 
creating 4.5 million jobs so far in his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 But he cautioned that "our work won't be done until all Americans enjoy the 
dignity of work." 
</P>
<P>
 "That can only be done by taking a new direction -- not a government that says 
we can do it alone and certainly not a government that sits on the sidelines, 
but one that works in partnership with business and our individual working men 
and women and families." 
</P>
<P>
 The President plans to interrupt his vacation Monday to mark Labor Day at the 
Bath Iron Works in Portland, Me., the state's largest employer and a company 
Clinton believes exemplifies private and government partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 In a jab at previous Republican administrations, he said: "The friends of the 
failed policies of the past, the people who raised taxes on the middle class, 
lowered them on the wealthy, reduced investment in our people and exploded the 
deficit -- they predicted this economic strategy would fail." 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan Gov. John Engler jabbed back, contending in the Republican radio 
response that Clinton is hampering job growth by ignoring the working class, 
raising their taxes and increasing the bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 After the address, Clinton tried to shake every hand in the room before 
driving to Edgartown, Mass. There, he and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
visited a bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady joined a browser looking at a White House picture book while 
her husband concentrated on mysteries, emerging less than 20 minutes later with 
a heavy shopping bag. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make us quit," Hillary Clinton demanded of the delighted cashier.

ALASKA TRIBE PREPARES TO BANISH 2 TEEN-AGE ROBBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Native American teen-agers who pleaded guilty to a brutal robbery were 
held aboard a fishing boat Saturday pending their move to remote islands for a 
year or more of banishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The two 17-year-old Tlingit boys, Adrian Guthrie and Simon Roberts, were 
banished by tribal elders for the beating and robbery of a pizza deliveryman. 
It is the first case of a state court referring a criminal case to a tribal 
panel for punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the teen-agers were lounging in the sun. One listened to music on 
a Walkman as two tribal guards stood watch. The boys would not talk to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 They probably would be taken to their islands during the night for security, 
said tribal elder Byron Skinna. They were to be moved to separate uninhabited 
islands in the sprawling Alexander Archipelago off the coast of southeastern 
Alaska, but tribal officials will not disclose their final destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers pleaded guilty in May to robbing Tim Whittlesey and beating him 
with a baseball bat while he was working as a pizza deliveryman in Everett, 
Wash. Whittlesey, 25, suffered permanent damage to his hearing and eyesight. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve tribal elders deliberated for 3 1/2 hours Friday night before ordering 
the two banished for a year to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 A Washington state judge agreed to let the two face the tribal court rather 
than put the first-time offenders in prison. The youths still could get prison 
time later if the judge finds tribal punishment failed to rehabilitate them. 
The tribe will send reports to the court every three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Skinna said Whittlesey, who appeared at the hearing and has supported the 
experiment, will be given two parcels of Alaskan land and be paid an 
undisclosed amount of cash in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Skinna also said each boy would be given forks for digging up clams, axes and 
saws for cutting wood, and some food to carry them through the first few days. 
He said they would have sleeping bags and each will build a small shelter, 
which will be equipped with a wood stove for cooking and heat. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be checked on periodically, but there will be no way for them to 
contact the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 The elders say the boys have been taught how to live off the land since they 
began to walk.

U.S. OFFERS BITING RESPONSE TO ROSTENKOWSKI'S DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI LOCY, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the pretrial war of words in the case against Rep. Dan Rostenkowski 
(D-Ill.), prosecutors depicted the former Ways and Means Committee chairman as 
a common thief trying to hide behind lofty constitutional principles to avoid 
being held accountable for stealing from taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Using biting, sometimes sarcastic arguments, the team of prosecutors, led by 
Assistant U.S. Atty. John M. Campbell, said Rostenkowski is trying to argue 
that he is above the law by invoking complex constitutional tenets as reasons 
to dismiss the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 To them, Rostenkowski is arguing that "the Constitution places the whole 
question of whether he systematically looted the public treasury beyond the 
reach of the criminal law." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ironically, these efforts by the defendant to shelter his conduct behind a 
legislative privilege are undercut by the sheer ordinariness of the crimes with 
which he is charged. He is accused, at bottom, of stealing money," the 
prosecutors said in court papers filed late Friday in U.S. District Court in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski is charged with engaging in a pattern of corrupt activities that 
spanned three decades. He is accused of using congressional funds to buy 
personal gifts, hiring ghost workers, using official cars as his own and 
cashing in office stamps at the House post office. No trial date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
 In motions filed last month with U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, 
Rostenkowski's lawyers, led by Dan K. Webb of Chicago, argued that the 17-count 
corruption indictment should be dismissed because it violates the 
Constitution's guarantee of separation of powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the defense is relying on the rule-making and speech-and-debate 
clauses. The rule-making clause allows Congress to make and enforce its own 
rules. The speech-and-debate clause protects lawmakers from being questioned 
about their legislative acts. The Chicago lawmaker's attorneys also argued that 
much of the indictment relies on Congress' rules on hiring and expenditures, 
and it is improper for others to interpret them.

WAGES OF MOST AMERICANS FAIL TO REFLECT BETTER ECONOMY, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Most American workers, including professionals with college degrees, have yet 
to see increases in their pay despite the improving economy, according to a 
study released Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining wages, even among better-educated workers, and a growing income 
disparity between those with and without college degrees, are becoming fixtures 
of the 1990s and the economic recovery, said the study by the Economic Policy 
Institute, an organization partially funded by labor groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the one hand, we're overcoming a lot of our short-term cyclical problems. 
We're getting good job growth and unemployment is falling," said Lawrence 
Mishel, an economist who co-authored the study. "Now we're down to the 
fundamental long-term problems that were present in the economy in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about the middle-class squeeze. We're talking about wages 
falling for a wide majority of workers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, titled "The State of Working America, 1994-95," says that from 1989 
to 1993, median "real" wages, after adjustment for inflation, have fallen 2.6% 
overall and 4.6% among men. During the same period, wages for entry-level 
workers with high school diplomas fell 7.8% while earnings for new workers with 
college degrees dropped 6.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Mishel said inflation-adjusted wages for college-educated men have fallen 
every year since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The study said also that new problems have emerged as well. For instance, it 
said the wages of male college-educated workers fell as fast as those of men 
with high school diplomas, nearly 5% from 1989-93.

MAN BEHIND WYNN KIDNAPING SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mastermind in the Kevin Wynn kidnaping was sentenced to 24 years, 7 months 
in prison by a judge who accused him of terrorizing one of the city's most 
high-profile families with "greed-driven" actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Cuddy showed no emotion and declined to comment before U.S. District Judge 
Lloyd George imposed the maximum sentence of 295 months and ordered him to pay 
restitution of $662,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentencing marked the final chapter in an incident that began July 26, 
1993, when Wynn was kidnaped from her home and held for more than two hours 
until her father, casino mogul Stephen A. Wynn, paid a $1.45-million ransom. 
She was released unharmed in a parking lot at McCarran International Airport.

EXPERTS WEIGH BALLOT MEASURE'S POSSIBLE IMPACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One muggy August evening in 1978, Maria Garcia tearfully kissed her two young 
daughters goodby in a small, Mexican town and boarded a bus bound for Tijuana. 
In the scraggly brush on the outskirts of the city, a station wagon waited to 
whisk her over the border and into the United States. Within hours, she was on 
a plane to Chicago to join her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plan," she said, "was to stay long enough to save some money, then go 
back home." But despite several attempts to make ends meet in Mexico, the 
Garcias -- whose real names are not used because they risk deportation if 
identified -- were never able to return to their native land. Today, home is 
Huntington Beach, where the couple eke out a meager existence -- she cleaning 
houses, he working as a mechanic's helper. 
</P>
<P>
 They now have four children, all born in Mexico, who live with them. Ages 12 
to 19, all have attended Orange County public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the lives they have established here face a new threat: Proposition 187, 
which, if implemented, would put Garcia's children among the 400,000 youngsters 
statewide whom critics say would be kicked out of public school because they 
are in the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it flies in the face of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that grants all 
children, regardless of citizenship, the right to a public education, 
Proposition 187 would require school officials to verify the citizenship of all 
children. Those found to be undocumented would be expelled and reported to the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The radical set of measures contained in Proposition 187 -- many of which also 
conflict with existing federal law -- would exclude illegal immigrants from 
non-emergency medical care, welfare and other publicly funded social services. 
The new law also would require officials at hospitals and social service 
agencies to report to the INS anyone they suspect of being illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the measure -- also known as the "Save Our State" or "SOS" 
initiative -- assert that their ultimate goal is to save billions of taxpayer 
dollars and spark a national revolution in immigration policy. While opponents 
agree that something must be done to curb illegal immigration, they argue that 
the initiative is a shortsighted, misguided solution that will create far more 
problems than it solves. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia disputes the notion that the measure would discourage more illegal 
immigrants from coming to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "All it will end up doing is splitting families," she said. "A lot of the men 
will come over and work and the children will stay behind." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County alone, thousands of children would be drummed out of school 
if the initiative were implemented, opponents say. Left to roam the streets, 
they contend, these uneducated youngsters would likely compound the juvenile 
crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's top public health official fear that the initiative would 
discourage illegal immigrants from seeking treatment for infectious diseases -- 
a public health hazard for the entire community. 
</P>
<P>
 Some social services agencies receiving most of their funding from private 
donations defiantly assert that they would refuse to comply with the reporting 
requirement, even if it meant losing the state grants they also depend on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impact is just scary," says Gladys Hall-Kessler, president of the Santa 
Ana Educators Assn., which represents 2,000 members. "I hope Californians wake 
up and vote 'no.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But even if Proposition 187 passes, it will have to overcome major legal 
obstacles before it ever becomes state law. In a 1982 ruling, the U.S. Supreme 
Court held that every child, regardless of citizenship, is entitled to a free 
public education. For Proposition 187 to be implemented, the high court would 
have to reverse that decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County public school officials say implementing Proposition 187 would 
be an administrative nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 By Jan. 1, 1995, schools would be required to begin verifying the citizenship 
of students enrolling for the first time. By Jan. 1, 1996, all students and 
their parents would have to be checked. 
</P>
<P>
 At Santa Ana Unified, Orange County's largest school district, that would 
entail determining the legal status of nearly 50,000 children in kindergarten 
through 12th grade. In Los Angeles, the task would be even more daunting. There 
are 640,000 children in the Los Angeles Unified School District alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative does not specify how officials are to determine citizenship, 
stating only that they should exclude anyone whom they "reasonably suspect" of 
being an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "How are we supposed to verify citizenship?" asks Hall-Kessler, who has taught 
elementary school in Santa Ana for 20 years. "The only thing teachers can tell 
you is how many fluent English speakers are in their class. But that doesn't 
tell you anything. There are people born in Santa Ana who don't speak a word of 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 "And what do they think is going to become of all these kids turned out of the 
schools?" Hall-Kessler added. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, an estimated 500,000 of the 5.3 million children in grades K-12 are 
illegal immigrants, according to the INS. The state Senate's Office of Research 
puts the figure at 400,000, and the initiative's authors say it is closer to 
300,000. The initiative would exclude all of them from public school, for a 
savings, of $1.2 billion, backers argue. 
</P>
<P>
 Other supporters speculate that if the measure passes and is implemented, 
children already in the school system might be allowed to remain in the 
schools, but newcomers would be screened out and excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, any kid who is 5 can get a 12-year education for free, just by 
getting over here," says Harold Ezell, chairman of Americans Against Illegal 
Immigration and a former western regional commissioner for the INS. "We can't 
afford it, and it's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, however, is angered by depictions of immigrants as a drain on the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she and her husband work hard to earn a living for their family. 
Although they are not legal residents, they pay income tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, she said, "is very unjust. We do the most difficult jobs that 
other people don't want to do for the least amount of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants rights groups also note other hardships the initiative could cause. 
</P>
<P>
 What would happen, they ask, to illegal immigrant parents whose children are 
U.S. citizens by virtue of having been born here? Initiative supporters say 
parents could choose between taking their children with them or leaving them 
here with a guardian. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents say that is not a realistic solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The likelihood that these families would leave the country is minimal," says 
Rigoberto Rodriguez, vice president of the board of directors of the Orange 
County Alliance for Immigrant Rights. "These families already have a life here. 
They have roots here." 
</P>
<P>
 The provision that would prohibit hospitals and clinics from treating illegal 
immigrants, except in emergencies, would put doctors in a "horrible" ethical 
and moral position, according to Orange County Medical Assn. President Peter 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Number one, I can't treat you, and number two, I'm going to report you to the 
INS? I can't imagine," said Anderson, who is chief of emergency medicine at 
Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center. "They never taught us 
that in medical school." 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants are already ineligible for MediCal, the medical program for 
the poor, except to pay for emergencies or prenatal care. Under Proposition 
187, prenatal care would no longer be covered. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hugh Stallworth, the county's director of public health, fears that the 
initiative would hinder his efforts to reduce the spread of contagious 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 It is largely through the services offered at the county's 14 medical clinics 
that public health officials keep tabs on the overall health of the population, 
he said. The county offers immunizations, prenatal care and programs to fight 
sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "With many of the infectious diseases, they don't cause a lot of pain. So 
people can live and function even if they don't feel that great," Stallworth 
said. "A lot of people would rather feel a little bit sick rather than risk 
confrontation with the INS." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Stallworth says, contagious diseases would still be spread. "You 
can't just tell bacteria to stay away from those people," Stallworth. "Bacteria 
don't know any nationality." 
</P>
<P>
 But Proposition 187 supporters argue that illegal immigration is itself 
largely to blame for many of the state's public health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doctors are saying 'we have to treat people or we'll have a resurgence of 
TB,' but where do they think it's all coming from?" asks Bill King, a retired 
border patrol agent from Mission Viejo who is one of the local backers of the 
initiative. "I've seen people apprehended coming over the border with TB, 
hepatitis, and leprosy." 
</P>
<P>
 If the SOS measure passes, some local social services agencies assert that 
they will refuse to question their clients or report them to the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that we would have to give up (public funds) because we feel it's 
unconscionable to accept anything that would deny children polio vaccine and 
mothers prenatal care," says Jean Forbath, a board member of Share Our Selves, 
a Costa Mesa nonprofit agency that runs a food bank and free medical and dental 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization serves 20,000 clients a month, Forbath said. About 85% of its 
funding comes from private donations, with the rest from the state and county, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Far removed from the rhetoric on both sides, the Garcias remain optimistic 
that the initiative will fail, despite polls suggesting it may be approved by a 
two-to-one margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my relationships with people here I have found them to be very 
compassionate," Maria Garcia said. "This is just politics, the work of people 
who want to stay in power."

WOMAN IS REUNITED WITH SON AFTER HE IS TAKEN TO IRAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Arcadia woman and her 2-year-old son were reunited at Heathrow Airport in 
London on Friday, six weeks after her estranged husband had taken the boy to 
Iraq and demanded that she join him, according to the woman's family. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with the FBI and Scotland Yard, Michelle Al-Nasseri duped her 
estranged husband, Haitham Khalid Al-Nasseri, 33, into meeting her in London, 
said Michelle's mother, Liz Pollinger. Agents arrested Al-Nasseri and returned 
2-year-old Laith Adam Al-Nasseri to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really, really thrilled to death," said Liz Pollinger, 50, of Temple 
City. "The worst part about it was being so frightened we'd never see him 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Al-Nasseri, a paralegal, had filed for divorce May 23 and was awarded 
custody of the child, Pollinger said. The couple had been married 1 1/2 years 
but had been together for five years. They grew apart as Al-Nasseri insisted 
that Michelle and the child go to Iraq, where he grew up, Pollinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama began July 21, when Al-Nasseri took the child on what he said was to 
be a three-day camping trip. When he did not return, Michelle Al-Nasseri went 
to his condominium and found bank receipts showing he had withdrawn large 
amounts of money, travel agency paperwork, and receipts indicating that he had 
bought seeds, which are in demand in Iraq because of the food shortage, 
Pollinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Al-Nasseri contacted Arcadia police, who notified the FBI. Meanwhile, 
her sister saw a TV show that featured a story on Corporate Training Unlimited, 
a group of former Green Berets based in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 When Michelle Al-Nasseri contacted her husband in Iraq, he told her she would 
never see her son again unless she came to Iraq, Pollinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ex-Green Berets helped Michelle concoct the ruse to meet her husband in 
London for a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure if he was naive or just self-confident to think that he could 
come into the country not realizing that the FBI would have a hand in this and 
rescue the child," FBI Supervisory Special Agent Stephen Steinhauser told the 
Pasadena Star-News. 
</P>
<P>
 Al-Nasseri is scheduled in court Monday for an extradition hearing, Pollinger 
said, and Michelle and the baby are expected to return to the United States on 
Tuesday.

6 HELD, 660 POUNDS OF COCAINE SEIZED AT DESERT AIRPORT 
</P>

<P>
 About 660 pounds of cocaine bound for New York was seized on a private jet at 
Bermuda Dunes Airport and six people were arrested, a U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration spokesman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The cocaine, worth about $30 million, was found aboard a Lear jet preparing to 
take off Friday night from the small airport, said Ralph Lochridge of the DEA's 
Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
 The seizure foiled an effort to open a new smuggling route in Southern 
California's desert resort region, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to be a new back door around the usual corridors," Lochridge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bermuda Dunes is a resort area in the Coachella Valley near Indio, about 15 
miles southeast of Palm Springs. The airport is near Interstate 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was to head to an airport in New Jersey and continue on to an 
airport in New York, Lochridge said. A five-month investigation led to the 
seizure. 
</P>
<P>
 The cocaine came from Colombia through Mexico and into the United States 
through the Calexico Port of Entry east of San Diego. From the border it was 
brought to Bermuda Dunes Airport by pickup trucks, Lochridge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested were Anibal Cardona, a Colombian national; Ricardo Ocana, a 
Salvadoran; Oscar William Alvarez of Medellin, Colombia; Florentino Rosas of 
Chihuahua, Mexico; Enrique Contreras of Mexicali, Mexico, and Sean Christopher 
Durant of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were two transportation groups," Lochridge said. 
</P>
<P>
 One group was a Mexican trafficking organization bringing the cocaine out of 
Mexico and into the United States, he said. The other was a Colombian 
organization moving the cocaine within the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The six were being held in Los Angeles for investigation of distribution and 
possession of cocaine and conspiracy.

EMPOWERING WOMEN IS FOCUS OF CONFERENCE; POPULATION: U.N. MEETING, OPENING 
MONDAY, TO TARGET FOR FIRST TIME THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO FAMILY PLANNING ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Years ago, when the water buffalo gave plenty of milk and the pigeons and 
chickens were paraded nightly to the dinner table, Om Mahmoud was healthy and 
happy with the annual ritual of giving birth to a new baby: another pair of 
hands in the lush farm fields of the Nile Delta. 
</P>
<P>
 But the babies kept dying, one by one. Om Mahmoud would have a new baby, and 
last year's infant would die. In all, she went to the birthing table 15 times. 
Seven lived. And finally, against her husband's inclinations, she went to a 
family planning clinic and had an IUD inserted. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted more children, but I did not, because of my health. He used to 
think that it would be interfering in God's ways. But he is ill, and all the 
responsibility for the income is on me. I insisted, and he was convinced," 
recalls the 47-year-old woman who supports her husband and children by sweeping 
stairways for about $50 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Om Mahmoud -- even her name, "Mother of Mahmoud," is defined by her 
children -- insists that her four daughters go to school, as her father never 
allowed her to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them to learn and to look and see how times are now, so they won't 
have to do what I have, nine of us living in one room with the toilet under the 
stairs . . . ," she says. "When a girl gets an education, she can read, she can 
learn about programs the government is providing, and from there she can take a 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The deceptively simple idea of a woman making a decision about her future is 
one of the cornerstones of the emerging debate on global population policy. To 
an increasing degree, world leaders are becoming convinced that an important 
key to reducing birthrates is not simply passing out birth control pills or 
promoting sterilization programs or allowing abortion, but empowering women to 
make their own decisions about family and children. 
</P>
<P>
 As more than 20,000 delegates from 170 nations gather in Cairo beginning 
Monday to draft a new strategy for world population and development in the 
coming two decades, the focus for the first time is on what women can 
contribute to the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 There are at least two female heads of state and large numbers of women among 
the delegations to the U.N.-sponsored International Conference on Population 
and Development. Women from both the developing world and the industrialized 
nations are seeking to focus not just on controlling the number of births but 
on issues such as providing women with reproductive health services, counseling 
on sexually transmitted diseases, and better prenatal and postnatal care. 
</P>
<P>
 To a great degree, the conference will recognize that better educated women 
historically choose to have smaller families. Educate women, the reasoning 
goes, teach them to read, let them become responsible for themselves, and they 
will no longer be content to remain locked in the poverty of huge families and 
no future. But the debate goes further than that -- and away from the issue of 
pure numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 For too long, say feminist organizations mobilizing at this week's conference, 
women in the developing world have been targeted for mass-marketed family 
planning programs -- even some whose health impact is dubious -- without regard 
for their health or their own family choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women have made it clear that setting demographic targets or dispensing 
contraceptives is not enough," said Jane Ordway, a spokeswoman for the 
International Women's Health Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft document that will come under discussion when the conference opens 
not only addresses reproductive health services, controls on domestic violence, 
bans on female genital mutilation and empowerment of women in the workplace and 
at home, it raises the issue of male responsibility for family planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. plan promotes the use of condoms and better enforcement of laws 
mandating child support. 
</P>
<P>
 In countries such as Egypt, men are usually reluctant to become involved in 
their wives' birth control decisions, though their consent is required at all 
Egyptian family planning clinics before birth control is dispensed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If women have access to more education, they will at least have a share in 
making a decision about their own health, and their families' health," said Dr. 
Mowalab Mouelhi, a physician at the Zeinhom Family Planning Clinic in downtown 
Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 But the empowerment of women as a touchstone for population policy is not 
without its opponents, primarily those who fear that new women's health 
programs will shift crucial funding away from where it has been most 
successful: family planning programs. The birth control clinics scoffed at as 
coercive by some feminist groups have succeeded in bringing down fertility 
rates in developing countries by about a third since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The women's health policies recommended in the Cairo draft program have an 
inherent contradiction: You can't serve two masters," the Cato Institute, a 
conservative Washington-based think tank, argues. "Although the program 
expresses opposition to coercion and claims to support freedom for people to 
determine their family size, that is contradicted by its call for development 
strategies that incorporate demographic goals. Governments can allow freedom in 
reproductive matters, or they can promote population growth objectives. They 
cannot do both." 
</P>
<P>
 The conference also promises to provide a showdown pitting proponents of more 
open sex education, freer access to safe abortion and family planning against 
the Vatican and Islamic organizations, which have vowed to combat provisions 
for sex education and health services outside the scope of the traditional 
family. The Vatican remains opposed to most birth control methods and has 
demanded deletion of all references to abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged at the references to sex education for adolescents, abortion and 
homosexuality, four Muslim nations -- Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Sudan and Iraq -- 
have announced they are not attending. Two Muslim women prime ministers, Tansu 
Ciller of Turkey and Khaleda Zia of Bangladesh, also backed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's organizations gathering in Cairo see the religious debate as a 
reflection of a male-dominated political arena. "Fundamentalism, whether it's 
about religion or politics, is fundamentally about power," Ordway said.

FIGHTING POPULATION WITH WOMEN'S RIGHTS; MEETING: NAFIS SADIK HAS SPENT YEARS 
PROMOTING FAMILY PLANNING. THE HEAD OF THIS WEEK'S U.N. CONFERENCE SEES 
EQUALITY AS KEY TO CONTROLLING WORLD'S NUMBERS.

 When Nafis Sadik was growing up in India and Pakistan, among friends 
preoccupied with marriage, she wanted to change the world. Now she may get the 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Monday, she will preside over the International Conference on 
Population and Development, where she hopes the delegates of 170 nations will 
set a 20-year agenda for slowing the growth of world population. 
</P>
<P>
 First as an obstetrician-gynecologist, then as a pioneer in family planning, 
now as executive director of the U.N. Population Fund, Sadik has worked to 
elevate the status of women. She is convinced that equality for women is the 
key to population control. 
</P>
<P>
 She steps onto the world stage with a plan to give all women access to modern 
methods of birth control, and the right to choose whether and when to become 
pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Pope John Paul II and some Muslim leaders argue that the conference will 
promote abortion, birth control or promiscuity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to thank the Pope for all this publicity," Sadik said in an 
interview in London. "It's helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion, she said, is "a very small part of the whole program of action, 
which has much more emphasis on . . . empowering individuals, particularly 
women." 
</P>
<P>
 In her first speech for the conference, she charged Saturday that 
anti-abortion campaigns by the Vatican and Muslim fundamentalists have created 
controversy by misrepresenting the issue of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contrary to what others might want you to believe, the conference draft 
Program of Action does not advocate or promote abortion, let alone abortion on 
demand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadik prefers to argue the facts, and emphasizes that nearly 90% of the action 
plan to be considered at the conference has been accepted by all the countries 
invited. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Jaunpur, India, on Aug. 18, 1929, Sadik spent much of her childhood in 
Calcutta, where her father, Mohammed Shoaib, was a government finance officer. 
In school, she loved engineering, medicine and Indian classical music. She was 
a top-ranked badminton player, good at tennis and a tournament bridge player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to tell my mother sometimes I wished I could live two lives at once," 
she said. "She used to say, 'You're mad. Nobody can live two lives.' 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, I wanted to change everything. . . . I said, 'I want to do 
something in which I'll be known and I'll contribute to society.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She chose medicine, but feared opposition from her father, who later became 
minister of finance in Pakistan and vice president of the World Bank. But 
instead of insisting she get married, he supported her and went along for her 
interview at Calcutta Medical College. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother was more reluctant. Until her last year of medical school, Sadik 
said, her mother would say: "I don't know why you're doing all this medicine. 
You're not going to work. Why don't you get married, and I'll give you lots of 
jewelry and clothes?" 
</P>
<P>
 She married Azhar Sadik, a Pakistani army officer, in Washington, D.C., after 
finishing medical school and an internship and residency at City Hospital in 
Baltimore. He encouraged her to work, and when they returned to Pakistan she 
became a civilian doctor in army hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with women in rural villages, part of the army's community service 
program, sparked her interest in family planning. 
</P>
<P>
 When she would tell new mothers they shouldn't get pregnant again for two 
years, the women would say their husbands or mothers-in-law had other ideas -- 
especially if the baby was a girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then it started to come home to me that these poor women really had no 
control over their lives," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pakistan in the 1950s, there were no family planning services. Sadik 
decided to start a program and asked her commanding officer for money to buy 
contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
 "He nearly fell off his chair," she said, but finally gave her some money with 
a warning that if there were any complaints, "I'm going to say you're doing it 
all on your own." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadik bought condoms, took them to villages and talked to husbands about 
family planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think first they were a bit shocked, because I looked very young," she 
said. "But I think they got convinced that I was quite firm, and I was very 
determined. I don't think I got anyone who said, 'No, I'm not going to listen.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 When one woman became pregnant, Sadik was so angry with the husband that she 
made all the men sign pledges not to make their wives pregnant. She now says, 
with a laugh, that it was a "brash" and "stupid" thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-month break in 1963 to try life without work, Sadik decided on a 
new career and went to Johns Hopkins University to study public health and 
health planning. By that time, she had three children of her own and two 
adopted daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Pakistan the next year, she helped design the country's five-year 
family planning program and spent the next three years helping make it work. 
</P>
<P>
 She joined the U.N. Population Fund as an adviser in 1971 and was appointed 
executive director in 1987, becoming one of the first women to head a major 
U.N. organization. 
</P>
<P>
 She is in charge of the world's largest source of assistance to 
population-control programs. In 1994, it will provide about $250 million to 
more than 140 countries and territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Perez de Cuellar, then the United Nations' secretary general, put her 
in charge of the U.N. International Conference on Population and Development in 
1990. Since then, she has worked with member countries on the draft Program of 
Action. 
</P>
<P>
 Her contract ends in April, 1995, and she hopes Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the 
current secretary general, will renew it so she can help implement the program 
agreed upon in Cairo. "When I ultimately retire, I feel I still have a lot of 
things that I can do in Pakistan," she said. "The rights for women and the 
empowerment of women is very poor there."

BOSNIA SERBS WON'T GUARANTEE SAFETY, BUT POPE STILL PLANS SARAJEVO TRIP; 
BALKANS: THEY BELIEVE THE VATICAN TOOK SIDES DURING THE BREAKUP OF THE FORMER 
YUGOSLAV FEDERATION AND IS BIASED IN FAVOR OF THE CROATS.

 Pope John Paul II said Saturday that he hopes to go ahead this week with a 
planned visit to Sarajevo, only hours after Bosnian Serbs said they could not 
guarantee his safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly hope, if there are sufficient guarantees for the security of the 
local population, to be able to go to that city which has been battered -- and 
which is so dear to me -- as a pilgrim of peace," said the pontiff, 74, who 
plans to arrive in Sarajevo on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put this trip in the hands of the Virgin Mother and ask her to ensure that 
all goes ahead without danger to the population," he said before prayers at the 
papal summer resort south of Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope's comments came after a Vatican envoy failed Saturday to win a pledge 
from Bosnian Serbs to guarantee his security when he visits the Bosnian capital 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Radovan Karadzic, president of the self-declared Bosnian Serb state, told the 
papal envoy that he feared Muslims might attack the Pope and blame the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leaders have told the Vatican privately that the Pope's presence 
in Bosnia is "highly undesirable." The Orthodox Serbs believe the Vatican took 
sides in the breakup of the former Yugoslav federation and is biased in favor 
of the Roman Catholic Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 Papal Nuncio Msgr. Francesco Monterisi met Karadzic for two hours in the 
Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale near Sarajevo but left saying only that "it was 
a very interesting meeting with the president."

NEW RWANDA LEADERS MAKE PLEA FOR UNITY; AFRICA: OFFICIALS OF BOTH ETHNIC GROUPS 
APPEAR BEFORE CROWD. WHETHER THEY CAN END RIVALRY IS UNKNOWN.

 From the rolling green hills surrounding Rwanda's second-largest city, 
thousands of peasants walked to the Huye soccer stadium Saturday for their 
first glimpse of the country's new leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The people perched on the stadium's crumbling walls and sat on the rough brown 
grass of the playing field as hawks circled overhead. It was cool and cloudy as 
the meeting began, and many people took shelter under umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Minister Seth Sendashonga, his baritone amplified by two 
loudspeakers, told the audience, "If you agree to construct unity in the 
country, put up your hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of hands shot up. Hutus raised theirs, and Tutsis raised theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 That pledge of tolerance by Butare's people may have been motivated by hope, 
the desire to conform or fear about what lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the coming months and years will show whether a new Rwanda can be 
constructed and the deadly rivalry between the country's two largest ethnic 
groups put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The past has been a disaster; the present is very bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 The new prefect of the Butare region, a young man named Zigara, told the crowd 
of 4,000 that "the general situation is catastrophic." 
</P>
<P>
 "This spring's orgy of ethnic murder has left countless orphans, widows and 
widowers," Zigara said. In the Central African country that called itself "the 
land of eternal spring" in travel brochures, "there is a danger of famine," he 
said. Many of the banana groves and farm fields are eerily empty. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the latest estimates by U.N. officials handling emergency relief 
to Rwanda, almost 2 million people, many of them Hutus who planned and carried 
out the slaughter of Tutsis and moderate Hutus, are hunkered down in foreign 
refugee camps. Hundreds of thousands have left their homes and are living 
elsewhere in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 One million people, an eighth of Rwanda's population at the beginning of this 
year, are believed to have died. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should do everything so that it doesn't start again," said Vice President 
and Defense Minister Paul Kagame, a Tutsi who led the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
to victory in a three-month war against a Hutu-dominated government. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's done is done -- people should think about the future," Kagame said. 
"There are people who want to use the military to carry out acts of revenge. 
But people must understand that the military waged war and that now it is 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Small bands of the old government army are still armed and scattered in 
Rwanda's southwest, U.N. officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rwanda's new leaders clearly fear counterattack or insurgency. From here 
to Kigali, the capital, young men from Kagame's forces were placed about 100 
feet apart on the roadside Saturday. As the new leaders trundled into Huye 
stadium aboard four all-terrain vehicles, former members of the guerrilla army 
sprinted onto the field to stand guard. 
</P>
<P>
 During the rally, Cabinet members were paraded onto the field to show that the 
new government is made up of both Hutus and Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody should get together; everybody should help each other," said Prime 
Minister Faustin Twagirimungu, a Hutu. "There is no difference between a Hutu 
peasant and a Tutsi peasant."
