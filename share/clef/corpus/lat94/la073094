KEVIN CARTER; PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING PHOTOGRAPHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Carter, 33, whose photograph of a vulture standing near a starving 
Sudanese child won a 1994 Pulitzer Prize. The photo was first published by the 
New York Times and then distributed around the world by news and photo 
agencies.In May, Carter attended the Pulitzer award ceremony in New York to 
collect his prize for best feature photograph during the preceding year. "He 
was an extraordinarily courageous photographer dedicated to his work," said 
Anton Harber, editor of the Weekly Mail and Guardian newspaper, where Carter 
once worked as photo editor. "I think the picture that won him the Pulitzer was 
a truly remarkable one which will add to his memory." Carter worked almost a 
decade as a broadcaster and photographer for South African newspapers until 
deciding to become a free-lancer in 1993. He then worked for Reuters, Agence 
France-Press and other organizations, and sold several news photos to the 
Associated Press. In a Johannesburg suburb Wednesday of carbon monoxide 
poisoning, an apparent suicide.

DOESN'T ANYONE CARE ABOUT THE FANS?; THEY'RE THE TRULY AGGRIEVED PARTY IN THIS 
UNNECESSARY AND REGRETTABLE BASEBALL FEUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like one of those loose ceiling tiles dropping from the roof of the Seattle 
Kingdome in recent weeks, the possibility of yet another players' strike in 
major league baseball has hung ominously over the national pastime all summer 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 Some contests scheduled for Seattle have moved elsewhere while the roof gets 
fixed, but now the game itself has a far more serious patching-up job to do. 
With the setting of Aug. 12 as a strike date, who knows how long fans will be 
without games to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing to be sure of is that those fans won't have much to say in the 
outcome. It is worth pleading with the parties to go to arbitration, but the 
sad fact is that a strike seems frustratingly unavoidable for these 
intransigent parties. It is utterly annoying for the people who support it all 
by buying the tickets. They are the truly aggrieved party in the latest chapter 
of this long-running feud between stubborn adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 This time the issue is the owners' bid to institute a salary cap to close the 
gap between big and small-market teams. The owners are right that baseball 
needs to get its economics in line with reality. Nowadays even mediocre 
reserves are paid overblown salaries, and cities like Pittsburgh lose their 
superstars and their hopes to better-bankrolled franchises in San Francisco and 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But the players have history on their side, especially in the patronizing 
behavior of owners who in previous years drove labor relations to a state of 
bitter mistrust, even after being forced to loosen their grip through 
free-agency. The owners can't even decide now on a commissioner who might help 
keep them in line, or even urge both sides to act in the best interest of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Does anybody care about the fans? The players often remember at All Star time 
that it is ultimately the fans' game, and the owners greeted the announcement 
that a strike was coming with a gratuitous statement about their concern for 
the fans' interests. But who really speaks for the kids who want a hot dog and 
the thrill of a home run, and for the grown-ups who want the games to help them 
forget about the business side of life for a few hours? Not these posturing 
owners and players. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans in fact are outside the loop except to supply their hard-earned cash 
for the revenue streams of the game -- its flow of ticket money, concessions 
and big TV bucks. And now these supporters will have their beloved sport cut 
short just as interest in the pennant races mounts. 
</P>
<P>
 What a cruel reward for fan loyalty. The fans are getting a negative message 
from the sport they have stood by through thick and thin. They can love this 
game, but shouldn't put anything on the calendar after Aug. 12 that includes 
baseball in their plans.

WHEN EXTREMISM BECOMES TERRORISM; NOTHING CAN JUSTIFY THE OUTRAGE THAT OCCURRED 
IN PENSACOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not even the most vehement advocates of a woman's right to end a pregnancy 
claim that the decision is an easy one. On the contrary, it is deeply personal 
and often painful; and thoughtful opponents of that right understand this. The 
issue of abortion is complex; there are strong and sincere feelings on all 
sides, and many people -- men as well as women -- have profoundly ambiguous 
emotions about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, partisans at the extremes of the abortion debate claim to have no 
such ambivalence. It has been argued that extremism in defense of either side 
may be no vice, but only so long as the public display of such polar 
convictions remains within proper bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, some anti-abortion extremists -- representing primarily their 
own personal, implacable volatility -- go too far. The courts have recognized 
this by requiring protesters camping outside abortion clinics to keep their 
physical distance and allow clinic staff and patients the freedom of movement 
and the freedom to exercise their rights under the landmark Roe vs. Wade 
decision. But isn't it regrettable that it had to take court intervention to 
compel anti-abortion protesters to permit those who disagree with them to 
exercise their rights? 
</P>
<P>
 To state it again: The vast majority of anti-abortion Americans do not support 
the extremists. And they certainly do not support the rabid, out-of-control 
anti-abortionists who shot and killed a doctor and an abortion clinic volunteer 
in Pensacola, Fla., on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first such political assassination by anti-abortion lunatics, 
of course. It was the nation's third shooting at an abortion clinic since 
March, 1993, when a doctor at another Pensacola abortion clinic was also shot 
and killed by an extremist. 
</P>
<P>
 It is extremely paradoxical that those who oppose abortions on the ground that 
the procedure amounts, in effect, to the taking of a life would then take a 
life to register their opposition. And it is extremely corrosive of the 
respectable, serious-minded, morally based anti-abortion argument (often best 
articulated by those responsible religious leaders who argue their position out 
of the basic logic of the tenets of long-established religious belief) to have 
the anti-abortion message blurred if not marred by murderers. 
</P>
<P>
 But such is the perfervidly poisonous atmosphere of anti-abortion extremists 
that medical personnel who are willing to perform these procedures now have to 
wonder whether they are taking their lives in their hands by agreeing to serve 
such patients. Indeed, in the shooting Friday, the slain doctor entered the 
women's clinic not only with a volunteer escort, who was also killed by shotgun 
blasts, but was wearing a bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Americans who support a woman's right to choose -- in effect the Roe vs. 
Wade view -- also take the position that both sides need to respect one 
another's position, argue their views with responsibility and civility and 
remove the issue from the political arena, where it is inherently susceptible 
to politicization. This is obviously the direction America must go. 
</P>
<P>
 With the deaths of two more Americans at the hands of anti-abortion 
terrorists, the need to cool the rhetoric, respect thy neighbor and 
depoliticize the debate becomes all the more urgent.

INDIA-PAKISTAN RELATIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The letter of July 9 from Pakistan's press minister regarding events in 
Kashmir does a disservice to efforts aimed at resolving the problem there. 
</P>
<P>
 India currently is seeking to resume talks with Pakistan on all outstanding 
issues, including Kashmir. To be productive, those talks will need to be 
grounded in facts debated by level-headed people. Logic thus dictates that the 
liberties taken in the press minister's letter be rectified. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion that there isn't a shred of evidence that terrorists aiding and 
abetting a separatist movement in Kashmir are supported from Pakistan is widely 
contradicted. For instance, in its most recent annual report on terrorism, the 
U.S. State Department again confirms that "there are credible reports of 
official Pakistani support to Kashmiri militants." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that racism is part of the dynamic in Kashmir simply doesn't wash. 
Both the Muslim and Hindu populations in Kashmir come from the same racial 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggestion that India is at loggerheads with Nepal and Bhutan, two of its 
neighbors to the north, is simply absurd. India maintains healthy diplomatic 
and economic relations with both countries. The criticism of India's liberation 
of Goa from colonial rule years ago shows the extent to which anti-Indian 
passions dictate Pakistan's India policies. Pakistan should know that India and 
Portugal enjoy excellent relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that Indian troops are terrorizing innocent Muslims in Kashmir is a 
very lame attempt at spin control. In its most recent "Country Reports on Human 
Rights Practices," the U.S. State Department notes that "Kashmiri militant 
groups carried out politically motivated killing on a wide scale, targeting 
government officials, alleged police informers, members of rival factions and 
Hindu civilians." Almost the entire Hindu population of the Kashmir Valley has 
fled because of violence unleashed against them by Islamic terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 If Pakistan is sincere in its assertion it wants to reduce tensions with 
India, let it put the rhetoric aside and return to the negotiating table.

25TH ANNIVERSARY OF MOON LANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As I write this, it's been 25 years to the day since the first man set foot on 
the moon. Sadly, the U.S. space program has taken a "giant leap" backward since 
that historic occasion. Even now, Congress is still trying to slash NASA's 
budget and cancel the Space Station entirely, to the point where NASA, as your 
editorial noted (July 20), is left wondering whether Congress and the President 
really want a space program at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Where is all that money we supposedly saved by cutting back the defense budget 
drastically at the end of the Cold War? Why couldn't some of that money be used 
to advance the space program and keep some aerospace workers employed? 
</P>
<P>
 The knowledge we have gained from the space program is invaluable, going far 
beyond the bounds of space exploration itself. Why are we throwing it all away?

 The story of the celebration at the White House of the 25th anniversary of 
man's first walk on the moon appears inside your paper! I looked to see what 
stories appeared on the front page. Of course there were extremely important 
stories there but can the story about a wife suing her ex-husband for a share 
of his lottery winnings possibly be considered more important than the 
anniversary of the first moon walk? 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, not only the newspaper but the evening news on commercial 
television brushed off the anniversary with a story so brief that if you 
blinked, you missed it. Public television presented the full speech of Neil 
Armstrong and enough coverage that one could grasp the significance and flavor 
of the celebration taking place in the White House. KCET marked the occasion 
with two full hours of excellent programming on the Apollo missions. 
</P>
<P>
 In your story a 12-year-old girl who was present at the White House ceremony 
was quoted as saying, "At first, I didn't really believe people could go to the 
moon." It seems obvious she hadn't realized that people already had done so and 
it seems equally obvious why she may not have known.

 What was the first word uttered from the surface of the moon? Most of the 
sound-bite- happy TV retrospectives cut Neil Armstrong's first two syllables 
before his dramatic " . . . Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed." The 
missing word is "Houston." But thanks to TimesLink and a few other sources, a 
number of us with a special interest in historical accuracy on both moon and 
Earth can repeatedly confirm this significant bit of space trivia -- with 
pride.

 Astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first man to step on the moon on July 20, 1969, 
wanted to spend the evening of the 25th anniversary of that event at the 
American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics banquet in Los Angeles, 
where 500 people gathered to pay tribute to the contractors and subcontractors 
who designed and built the wondrous Apollo 11. The White House even advanced 
the time of its ceremony honoring Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins 
for Armstrong to fly to Los Angeles for the banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a problem with the flight and he could not make it in time for 
the banquet. So it is ironical that in 1969, he boarded a spacecraft that got 
him to the moon as planned, but in 1994, an airline could not get him to Los 
Angeles on schedule. How times have changed.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO CHARITIES

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article "Charities Find L.A. Is a Challenge" (July 20) paints only part 
of the philanthropic picture. The survey neglected to measure the significant 
contributions of volunteers and in-kind donations, which are worth their weight 
in gold to the nonprofit organizations in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Without these kinds of contributions, the Venice Family Clinic would not have 
been able to function as the largest free clinic in the country, now in its 
25th year. Volunteer medical professionals alone provide over half the clinic's 
51,000 annual patient visits made by the working poor and homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently we were chosen from a national pool of 5,000 nominations to receive 
the President's Volunteer Action Award from President Clinton for the 
involvement of almost 2,500 volunteers. Of the 21 organizations selected, five 
were located in or near Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 We have found that when the availability of monetary contributions becomes 
more limited, our donors are more concerned about how much of each dollar they 
give actually goes to pay for the purpose it was given -- namely, direct 
patient care. That's why the involvement of volunteers and in-kind donors is so 
important. They allow us to maximize the cash support we do receive.

 Your article dealing with the poor showing for charitable gift giving in Los 
Angeles (ranked 48th) omits a major consideration of how Angelenos give. On an 
almost daily basis, I am asked for change from an apparently homeless person. 
Unequivocally, I donate between $3 and $5 weekly to various people seeking 
money for food, shelter, and probably, alcohol and drugs. You cannot get out of 
your car in the Los Angeles area at a grocery, pharmacy, convenience store, 
etc., without someone asking for money. Not always, but frequently, I give 
something. 
</P>
<P>
 When I receive a solicitation in the mail for the charities I regularly gave 
to in years past, today I consider what I have already given directly to the 
"people's" version of the United Way, etc. If middle-class direct contributions 
were factored into the study of our "stingy" habits, I am certain the ranking 
of Angelenos would be much higher than the study reports.

<P>
 Susan Moffat's article was excellent reporting on a topic infrequently and, 
often, inadequately covered. 
</P>
<P>
 There was one dimension of philanthropy, however, not covered: Planned or 
endowed giving. This type of giving -- where a donor gives funds that are 
managed by a charitable organization to generate income that is distributed as 
grants for social services -- is an increasingly important funding source for 
charities that previously survived on annual fund-raising campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next 20 years, an estimated $7 trillion is expected to pass from one 
generation to the next. In the process, a significant portion of this wealth 
will be given to philanthropic organizations -- both as a result of estate 
planning and the strong commitment to philanthropy that many have. 
</P>
<P>
 A donor working with philanthropic organizations such as the Jewish Community 
Foundation or the California Community Foundation has choices and flexibility 
-- in the assets used to fulfill charitable commitments, charitable vehicles, 
ability to direct charitable gifts to specific agencies, causes or populations, 
ability to continue philanthropic involvements into future generations, the 
timing of gifts during their lifetimes or after -- that are very appealing to a 
person with a desire to fulfill a philanthropic vision.

GROWTH REPORT PUTS SPRING IN STOCKS' AND BONDS' STEP

 Long-term Treasury bond yields plunged to their lowest level in more than a 
month after a report of slower-than-expected economic growth eased concern that 
the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates to subdue inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The news also elated Wall Street, boosting blue-chip stocks to their highest 
level since June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's key 30-year bond yield plummeted to 7.39% from 7.55% on 
Thursday, pushing prices up 1 23/32 point, or $17.19 per $1,000 in face value. 
Yields and prices move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Many bond strategists were elated by the Commerce Department's report that 
inflation tied to the gross domestic product rose a moderate 2.9%, the same as 
the first three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns that the Fed would soon raise interest rates to combat inflation 
aggravated by economic growth practically evaporated with Friday's data, 
traders said. Bond prices rose in the morning and continued to surge throughout 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the euphoria in the bond market Friday, traders said all bets will be 
off if important economic data released next week points to inflation, which is 
feared by bond investors because it erodes the value of their holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 The national purchasing managers' index will be released Monday, and non-farm 
payroll data comes out Friday. The employment report would have to show a 
slowdown in the growth of new jobs to keep the sentiment positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of short-term Treasuries rose between 12/32 point and 15/32 point, and 
intermediate maturities rose 26/32 point to 1 3/32 point, the financial 
information service Telerate Inc. reported. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average soared 33.67 points to 
3,764.50, up 29.46 for the week.  
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 13 to 5 
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 269.59 million shares, up 
from 246.56 million Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally was broad-based, and other market indexes posted substantial gains 
as well. The NYSE's composite index rose 2.02 points to 252.62. The Nasdaq 
index of mostly smaller companies rose 9.73 points to 722.16. At the American 
Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 3.81 points to 437.69. The Standard 
& Poor's 500 index rose 4.03 points to 458.26. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect that interest rates will remain steady sparked Wall Street's 
broad rally in the stock market. Economically sensitive stocks and those 
closely tied to interest rate fluctuations, such as banking and utility issues, 
were all higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Steel stocks rose along with other cyclical stocks and after LTV released a 
good earnings report and J.P. Morgan recommended four steel stocks. LTV rose 1 
5/8 to 18 3/4, Bethlehem Steel advanced 1 to 22 1/4, Inland Steel added 1 to 38 
and USX-US Steel climbed 1 1/4 to 37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among other cyclical stocks, Caterpillar climbed 1 1/8 to 108 3/8, 
International Paper advanced 1 3/4 to 72 7/8, Whirlpool tacked on 5/8 to 50 7/8 
and Alcoa added 1 3/8 to 78 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks also rallied, including Apple Computer, up 1 13/16 to 33 
11/16; Intel, up 1 3/8 to 59 1/4, and Microsoft rose 2 to 51 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telefonos de Mexico's American depositary shares led the action on the New 
York Stock Exchange and rose 1 to 60 3/4 along with the Mexican stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks rose as prospects receded for an increase in consumer lending 
rates. The stocks were also still getting a lift from record-high earnings 
reports released earlier this week. Ford rose 7/8 to 31 7/8. General Motors 
added 1 1/8 to 51 3/8. Chrysler advanced 3/4 to 48 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Foundation Health sank 2 7/8 to 32 1/8 after announcing that it will acquire 
Intergroup Healthcare in a stock swap valued at $720 million. Intergroup, which 
rose sharply Thursday on rumors that it would be acquired, added another 10 1/8 
to 57 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas markets ended the week mixed. Mexico City's Bolsa index climbed 
1.36%, or 33.12 points, to 2462.27, its highest level since it reached 2494.84 
on June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo stocks ended firmer, with the 225-share Nikkei average rising 201.54 
points to 20,449.39. In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX average closed at 2,146.64, 
up 23.83 points. Meanwhile, London's Financial Times 100-share average fell 
13.3 points to 3,082.6. 
</P>
<P>
 In the currency market, meanwhile, the dollar slipped back below 100 Japanese 
yen and declined against most other major currencies as profit taking and 
concerns about the U.S.-Japan trade talks erased an early boost from rallies in 
U.S. stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The British pound rallied broadly on expectations that the Bank of England 
will raise its rates early next week, market participants said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 99.95 Japanese yen, down from 100.10 on 
Thursday. The greenback was quoted at 1.583 German marks, down from 1.5910. The 
British pound was quoted at $1.543, up from $1.5270.

 Accountants Seek Liability Shield: The nation's Big Six accounting firms, 
hoping to prevent their partners' personal assets from being seized in 
lawsuits, are looking to change their firms' structures to "limited liability" 
partnerships.Unlike most professional partnerships, the accounting firms' 
partners were not afforded such a shield before. But recent changes in the law 
in New York state and Hawaii means all states now recognize limited liability 
partnerships for accounting firms. The Big Six firms are Arthur Andersen, 
Coopers & Lybrand, Deloitte & Touche, Ernst & Young, KPMG Peat Marwick and 
Price Waterhouse.

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; A DIFFERENT BRAND OF FABULOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The four years since his last tour have been trying ones for Jimmie Vaughan. 
In 1990 the guitarist made the chancy move of leaving the Fabulous 
Thunderbirds, after 15 years of hard touring through which the Texas 
blues-roots band finally had achieved a comfortable level of success. Vaughan's 
monstrously motivating rhythm playing and incisive leads had defined the 
group's sound. 
</P>
<P>
 He left the group behind to record the "Family Style" album with his brother 
Stevie Ray Vaughan. When Stevie Ray died in a helicopter crash weeks before the 
album's release, Jimmie retreated from the public eye, spending time with his 
family and managing Stevie Ray's estate. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be that his current sound has been shaped more by his travails and his 
time away from the music world than by all the years he spent in the thick of 
performing. A number of new things were evident in his show at the Coach House 
Thursday night, the most obvious being that Vaughan now sings and, at center 
stage, does a lot more soloing. 
</P>
<P>
 His band, meanwhile, is an unusual lineup: There's no bass, just organ, piano, 
drums and three male backup singers. The sound is part old (reminding of great 
'50s R&B and gospel) part new, and very right. 
</P>
<P>
 But there also is a deeper difference now. With the T-Birds, Vaughan always 
played like there was no tomorrow, snapping out solos with a bracing immediacy, 
and his rhythm work was so compelling you knew that if you weren't up dancing, 
you never would. He was no less immediate Thursday, but the music also carried 
the sense that there is a tomorrow and it's worth hanging in to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of that attitude was put across in lyrics that were unabashedly 
spiritual, but it also infused the music itself. For all the buzz and sting of 
Vaughan's solos, there also was a peaceful quality washing through them like 
late afternoon sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Sporting black slacks and a black shirt embroidered in white, his ever-sharp 
ducktailed pompadour in place, Vaughan came onstage to welcoming applause, 
turned up his battered white Stratocaster and plowed into the instrumental 
"Tilt A Whirl." As throughout most of the evening, he didn't use a pick, 
instead coaxing meaty tones from his strings with an odd approach to 
finger-picking, his digits flicking at the strings as if they were tiddlywinks. 
</P>
<P>
 He has an encyclopedic command of blues styles, with Freddy King being the 
most obvious influence, though there were touches Thursday of Guitar Slim, 
Lonnie Mack and a host of others and a stunning evocation of B.B. King with one 
slow blues instrumental. Yet even during such emulations, Vaughan's style was 
distinct; his phrases expressed as much personality as any speech. Even the 
spaces between his notes said more than most guitarists ever manage. 
</P>
<P>
 His voice isn't as distinctive a tool. He has a limited range, and an innate 
cool made him sound at times like a more soulful Steve Miller. But it certainly 
got the job done, putting emotion and feeling into the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the three young singers (Reginald Brisbon, Dennis King and Calvin 
Burns), Vaughan's band members are all vets so seasoned that none would have to 
flash his ID to get a senior citizen discount, but boy can they ever groove. 
George Rains proved a rock-solid drummer. Organist Bill Willis did remarkable 
double duty, fleshing out the songs with churchy fills with his right hand 
while pumping out the bass lines with his left. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Denny Freeman has spent most of his long career as a guitarist -- 
having been a mentor to the young Jimmie Vaughan -- he was splendid on piano, 
and proved a solid foil for Vaughan when he did strap on a guitar for "White 
Boots" and "D/FW." (The group was joined for one number, "Flamenco Dancer," by 
-- appropriately enough -- flamenco guitarist Rene Martinez). 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the songs came from Vaughan's current "Strange Pleasure" album, with 
four songs from "Family Style" and a couple of covers, the standout being 
Vaughan's version of the 5 Royales' sultry "I Like It Like That" from 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan's "Just Like Putty" was a stylistic nod to the 5 Royales, both in 
terms of its rich, inviting harmony vocals and Vaughan's stinging guitar 
phrases which brought to mind the Royales' Lowman Pauling. With those smooth 
vocals behind it, the guitar lines seemed like a snake moving on satin sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Another standout was "Two Wings," written by Vaughan with Mac (Dr. John) 
Rebennack. Even more than on the "Strange Pleasure" album, the song was given a 
celebratory gospel liftoff with the voices, organ and guitar locking in an 
irresistible rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan played acoustic guitar on two numbers, the quirkily harmonized, Leo 
Kottke-like instrumental "Strange Pleasure" and "Six Strings Down," a song 
about his brother's death. Instead of expressing sorrow, the song posits that 
Stevie Ray is jamming in heaven with all the departed blues greats. It's the 
same theme approached years ago by the mawkish '70s hit "Rock and Roll Heaven" 
but Vaughan, with the three singers closed in behind him, made the song 
sincere, heartfelt and upward spiraling. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing "(Everybody's Got) Sweet Soul Vibe" Vaughan tried to dismiss the 
song by saying, "that's a little song we do just so you'll think we're 
sensitive." If that's their ploy, it worked: The song is a soothing expression 
of redemption, of the potential beauty lying in every person. 
</P>
<P>
 Between that and the soaring encore of "Tick Tock" from "Family Style" -- a 
song of the "Love Train" school about making a better world for children -- 
Vaughan indeed did come off as a sensitive guy, and a deeper talent than one 
might have guessed, even in his most fabulous of Fabulous Thunderbirds days.

 Dogged With New Charges: Rapper and murder suspect Snoop Doggy Dogg pleaded 
not guilty in a Los Angeles court Friday to new charges of conspiracy and 
accessory after the fact. The controversial Long Beach hip-hop star, whose real 
name is Calvin Broadus, already faces murder charges along with co-defendants 
Sean Abrams and bodyguard McKinley Lee, stemming from an Aug. 25 shooting in 
the Palms area of West Los Angeles. The rapper acknowledges driving the vehicle 
from which Lee shot Philip Woldermariam, but claims the action was in 
self-defense. The new charges dispute that contention, accusing all three men 
of conspiring to commit the assault with a firearm. In addition, Broadus has 
been charged with accessory, in relation to the disappearance of the Jeep after 
the alleged attack. The murder trial is not expected to convene before October.

 Music Center Cutbacks: As part of what President Shelton g. Stanfill calls a 
"de-centralization of fund-raising," the Los Angeles Music Center -- the 
fund-raising arm for the center's resident performing arts companies (Los 
Angeles Philharmonic, Center Theatre Group/Mark Taper Forum, the Master 
Chorale) -- has laid off one executive and three support staffers. Stanfill 
said that vice president of marketing and communications Larry Steven Londre 
and the lower-level employees were let go not only to save money, but as part 
of the Music Center's on-going attempt to focus more on fund-raising, rather 
than on marketing. Stanfill added that the Music Center's various volunteer 
support groups will now report directly to the resident companies, so the Music 
Center no longer needs a staffer to oversee those groups. Stanfill said that 
the vice president of development position formerly held by Susan Pearce -- who 
resigned several weeks ago to take a position with a marketing consultant firm 
-- will eventually be filled by one new executive who will handle both 
development and marketing. COMEDY

 Button-Down Bob: Bob Newhart, who began his career as a stand-up comedian in 
the late 1950s, is going back to his comedic roots after doing TV sitcoms for 
two decades. "I guess a lot of people don't know that I did stand-up for about 
12 years," Newhart told the Boston Globe. "It's a totally different type of 
discipline from TV. You have the freedom to go off in different directions." 
Though he enjoys performing, this may be his last big tour because he wants to 
spend more time traveling with his family and playing golf. TELEVISION

 Spoonin': Israeli psychic Uri Geller, best known for his feats of spoon 
bending and watch stopping, has now twisted his mind toward art. Geller has 
covered his cherished shiny black 1976 Cadillac with 5,000 pieces of contorted 
cutlery, some of which Geller said he bent with brain power. The artwork, he 
says, is a symbol of peace, particularly in the turbulent Middle East. "One 
morning I woke up and I had this vision of my Cadillac riddled with bent spoons 
and forks," said the 48-year-old Geller. The word peace is carved into some 
spoons in several languages, including Arabic and Hebrew. The car will be 
parked at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem for two months. QUICK TAKES

MUSIC REVIEW; FISCHER, BUDAPEST ORCHESTRA EMPHASIZE THE LYRIC AT BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In their third program this week at Hollywood Bowl, conductor Ivan Fischer and 
the Budapest Festival Orchestra emerged Thursday more as lyric than dramatic 
poets in a program dominated by literary allusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakespeare appeared in musical guises through three selections from 
Mendelssohn's Incidental Music to "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and Tchaikovsky's 
"Romeo and Juliet" Overture-Fantasy. Russian folk legend provided the plot 
source for Stravinsky's "The Firebird," presented here in the Suite the 
composer made in 1919. 
</P>
<P>
 That left Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto to represent pure musical form. 
</P>
<P>
 In the "Dream" selections, Fischer evoked spritely, electric rhythms and 
caressed the lyric passages in the Overture, even if the strings occasionally 
lacked precision. He shaped the Scherzo with delicacy and let it also emerge as 
a dance. Perhaps most felicitously, he injected yearning, even erotic, 
intensity, into the middle section of the Nocturne. 
</P>
<P>
 He paid the same attention to detail in Tchaikovsky's familiar work, building 
finely balanced organ chords in the opening moments and a broad and pained 
statement of what are the remnants of the famous love theme at the end. Still, 
he took some dangerous liberties in stretching out the musical lines, and the 
love music could have been more kaleidoscopic in emotional content. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Stravinsky Suite, which he conducted from memory as he did the 
Overture-Fantasy, Fischer emphasized the subdued and lyric; indeed the 
transition from the Berceuse to the Finale was lost in the ambient outdoor 
background noise. Yet he brought the work to a ringing conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Soloist in the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto, Gyorgy Pauk combined grace and 
intensity without venturing too deeply into even the limited interpretive 
depths. He played with warmth, polish and affection, and rightly did not try to 
make the work a showy vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer accompanied sympathetically, adding elements of darkness and drama and 
lovingly crafting the bridge between first and second movements. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the amplification system allowed pleasing transparency of texture, it 
did narrow the spectrum of tone color. Overall, the orchestra and the strings 
sounded especially dry. More particularly, the romantic horn motif of the 
Mendelssohn Nocturne was scruffy. The percussive death knell in Tchaikovsky's 
"Romeo and Juliet" emerged papery. The mid-orchestral sounds in Stravinsky's 
Infernal Dance just about vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 For the single encore offered the 11,872 members of the audience, the 
orchestra played the Hungarian March from Berlioz's "Damnation de Faust."

JAZZ NOTES: 30 YEARS LATER, BARRON'S STILL LEARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine, if you will, Fred Astaire's crisp elegance translated to the piano. 
Envision his agile, spinning glides and split-second steps as dulcet tones, and 
you have a strong picture of the sound of pianist Kenny Barron. 
</P>
<P>
 Barron, who is performing at the Jazz Bakery in Culver City through Sunday, 
has been called the jazz world's premier keyboardist by fans, critics and 
musicians, but he won't hear of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciate it, but it's a little hard for me to believe," the self-effacing 
Barron said in a telephone chat last week from his home in Brooklyn. "I mean, 
there are so many people who play better: Hank Jones, Tommy Flanagan, Barry 
Harris, younger guys like Mulgrew Miller, Stephen Scott." 
</P>
<P>
 Barron, instead, said he sees himself as a solid veteran who is still a work 
in progress. "I'm just trying to learn. There's always something to learn, and 
I hope I'm never satisfied," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no doubt that Barron's 30-year career has never fared better. He has 
an exclusive recording contract with Polygram Records (the recordings are 
distributed by Verve; his latest is "Other Places"), he's playing more 
high-profile engagements at concert halls and festivals, and he's commanding 
higher fees than ever. He thinks he may get more respect, artistically and 
financially, because "people may know more about me now, may look at me 
differently since I'm older (he's 51), have been out there a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Barron has been out there for a while, playing on close to 100 albums either 
as a leader or a sideman. He moved to New York in 1961 from his boyhood home in 
Philadelphia. He cultivated his craft in New York and gained valuable insight 
while working with such notables as trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie (1962-66) and 
Freddie Hubbard (1967-69) and saxophonists Yusef Lateef (1971-75) and Stan Getz 
(1985-91). 
</P>
<P>
 "From Dizzy I learned about rhythms, chord voicings, how to be consistent," he 
said. "Freddie was more adventurous (than Dizzy), so I felt freer to try new 
things, and Yusef was even freer. He liked to take chances. Stan was very 
lyrical, and I like to play that way too, so it was great just to listen to his 
lines, observe his choice of notes. I listened, and I learned." 
</P>
<P>
 Barron said he looks back fondly to his early days in jazz, a time he feels 
the music was thriving and audiences were not only hungry for it, but 
knowledgeable about what they were hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd walk into a bar or a restaurant, especially in a black neighborhood, 
and there'd be jazz on the jukebox, Miles Davis, Gene Ammons," he said. "A 
record would come on, and the customers would know all the solos." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he said, "they play tapes but nobody knows who it is." 
</P>
<P>
 The pianist said he feels that there are many reasons why jazz is not held in 
higher regard in the United States. Specifically, he cited the absence of jazz 
on television. "In the States, you can hardly find it, but in Europe, there's 
always something, concerts, videos of festivals," he said. "It exposes people 
to jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 But it isn't just exposure that jazz needs; it's proper recognition. "Arsenio 
Hall made a statement when he had Kenny G on as a guest (on his now-defunct TV 
talk show), calling him one of the greatest jazz saxophonists," said Barron, a 
hint of ire in his voice. "That's ridiculous. Things like that need to be 
straightened out." 
</P>
<P>
 Who, then, are the great jazz saxophonists, Barron was asked. "First of all, 
the older people who are still living, like Benny Carter and Phil Woods. There 
are so many people," he said. "Then some of the younger players, Jesse Davis, 
Steve Wilson. Again, there are so many." 
</P>
<P>
 But from Barron's vantage point, the business has changed. Younger players are 
getting too much exposure too soon, he said, pointing to a lack of nurturing 
from older, established musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jazz has always had younger players, and today's are no worse, nor better, 
than in the past," Barron said. "They are just getting recorded sooner. They're 
presented with a situation, and they take advantage of it. Anybody would. The 
problem is, if they're signed and recording at 20, where will they be when 
they're 50?" 
</P>
<P>
 The overexposure resulting from these record deals may not pay long-term 
benefits, Barron said. "These players may be bandleaders before they are ready 
to be, through no fault of their own," he said. "But there's no place to serve 
any kind of apprenticeship. There are no Art Blakeys, where you could play 
three or four years, get that experience playing in one band. This probably 
won't hurt the music, but it may hurt the younger players in their later 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 * Kenny Barron plays tonight at 8 and 10 p.m.; 7:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. on 
Sunday, at the Jazz Bakery, 3221 Hutchison Ave., Culver City. $15, refreshments 
included. Information: (310) 271-9039.

 I am outraged! Don't you think we see enough rotten news in the media without 
this blatant show of cruelty? "Carousel" is as disgusting as it gets.

GEORGE PUTNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a pleasure to hear it told "like it is"! I'm referring to the insightful 
and enjoyable interview with George Putnam, ("I Broadcast in My Spare Time," 
July 21). 
</P>
<P>
 I remember sitting (probably too close!) to our tiny Emerson TV and listening 
intently to the dulcet tones of newscasters such as Putnam and Baxter Ward.And 
now I really miss them. These guys were no-nonsense reporters . 
</P>
<P>
 Putnam is so right when he decries the million-dollar anchors. Can they 
remember the copy they'd just read? No! Did they write it? No! It is a shame 
that banter that masquerades as insight is simply more text on the 
TelePrompTer. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's have more articles and interviews with real television journalists. How 
'bout Ralph Story, Baxter Ward and Joseph Benti, to name a few.

'TRUE LIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his review of "True Lies" ("The Secret Life of 'True Lies,' " July 14), 
Kenneth Turan notes the film's "determination to use caricatured unshaven Arabs 
as terrorists" as one of the film's many flaws. I would like to applaud him for 
mentioning this aspect of the movie, which most critics seem to have overlooked 
or simply ignored. As an Arab American, I have grown weary of constantly seeing 
Arabs portrayed as terrorists on the screen.

 I was quite active in the Los Angeles theater scene throughout the '60s, '70s 
and '80s, having run the Hollywood Center Theatre for 14 years. However, no 
time during my so-called "heyday" did I witness the level of acting I witnessed 
recently at the Fountain Theatre in Hollywood in their bill of one acts being 
presented under the title of "Summer Shorts." My sincere congratulations to 
this theater, which is presenting Ensemble Studio Theatre, the L.A. Project.

KIMBA AND SIMBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To settle the simmering Kimba-Simba controversy ("A 'Kimba' Surprise for 
Disney," July 13), I have a suggestion.Why not resurrect and restore the 
classic "Kimba, the White Lion" episodes and air them with reasonable fanfare 
on, say, the Disney Channel? 
</P>
<P>
 Then everyone can decide whether Disney owes animator Osamu Tezuka appropriate 
screen acknowledgment. At the same time, Tezuka's groundbreaking series (and 
its equally engaging, rarely seen sequel, "Leo the Lion") can be exposed to a 
whole new generation of youngsters and animation buffs.

LEAVING 'ROSEANNE' OFF THE EMMY LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fact that "Roseanne" was once again snubbed for a best comedy series Emmy 
nomination is good news to those of us who prefer our television comedy on the 
intelligent side ("TV Academy Is Snubbing 'Roseanne,' " July 23). 
</P>
<P>
 The success of such excellent, intelligent shows as "Frasier," "Northern 
Exposure," "Seinfeld" and "Murphy Brown" seems to indicate that once again the 
networks are aiming for our minds instead of the gutter.Keep up the good work. 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN McELLIGOTT JR., Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding why the "TV Academy Is Snubbing 'Roseanne,' " the answer is in the 
mere presence of its subversive star. The woman might as well be Godzilla as 
far as the industry is concerned. From the moment Roseanne arrived in 
Hollywood, she has been very public about her disdain for the sexism, phoniness 
and political game-playing that impedes instead of encourages creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knows that she is the driving force behind that show, and there is no 
way that they are going to acknowledge her with a producer's award. If Roseanne 
gets credit for knowing what she is doing, then maybe it's not a coincidence 
that she is hugely popular, and maybe she's on to something, and then maybe, 
just maybe, she's right, and then Hollywood would have to cop to the fact that 
most of the product we churn out is boring and uninspired with no valid excuse.

MCBROOM'S 'HEARTBEATS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I find it hard to believe that reviewer Laurie Winer and I were in the same 
audience at the opening of "Heartbeats" at the Pasadena Playhouse ("Housewife's 
Laments Make for a Lamentable 'Heartbeats,' " July 19). 
</P>
<P>
 What she thought to be banal, I thought universal.The writing is sharp, witty, 
insightful and touches to the core of the human condition. Amanda McBroom's 
observations on getting older, relationships, worries and life mirrored every 
person's concerns of the values in the world today. And, yes, that does include 
everything from gray hair to drive-by killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Winer also missed the point of the contrast between the times of the young 
Annie and the world now -- the purposefulness of the "Let's Put On a Show" 
feeling in the staging when showing the innocence of life in her youth. 
</P>
<P>
 I take exception to every aspect of Winer's review. And to call McBroom 
"chilly"! Where was Winer when the audience I was part of was laughing and 
crying and having a wonderful evening seeing a meaningful look at a part of 
life we all must confront?

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; G. LOVE BLENDS BLUES, LAID-BACK HIP-HOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Philadelphia's blues mutation G. Love and Special Sauce played a show Thursday 
at the small, smoky West L.A. club the Mint that had the charm of a scratchy 
old 78 and the hypnotic flare of stoned hip-hop. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio, one of the first bands to release an album on Sony's recently 
revived blues label Okeh, plays scratchy back-porch blues with a low-fi, fuzzy 
edge and adds tiny traces of hip-hop for flavor.Far from the smooth and slick 
nature of acid jazz, G. Love's organic rhythms are substantially imperfect and 
real. 
</P>
<P>
 The unique blend, which sounded even better live than on the band's 
self-titled debut, attracted a full house of mainly twentysome-things that 
howled and swayed to the sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer and guitarist G. Love, clad in mustard and brown polyester pants and 
'70s buckle boots, sat on a wooden stool and plucked a Dobro guitar, seemingly 
tasting every note. The baby-faced front man sang with a self-induced 
Mississippi accent that came off as one more part of the lugubrious sound 
rather than an insulting affectation. His vocals went from laid-back, slow 
rambles to rhythmic rapping. Barefoot stand-up bassist Jimmy Jass Prescot 
plucked sleepy notes as G. Love's vintage electric guitar reverberated through 
an old amp. 
</P>
<P>
 A groovy vibe from jazzy drum beats, incense and candles also came off the 
stage, causing some members of the audience to dance as if they were at a 
Grateful Dead show. 
</P>
<P>
 * G. Love and Special Sauce plays two sets tonight at 9 and 11 at the 
Troubadour, 9081 Santa Monica Blvd., (310) 276-6168. Tickets are $8. LORRAINE

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; A MELLOWED BAND STILL PICKS THE RIGHT MATERIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thursday night at the House of Blues, the Band offered an eager crowd a set of 
the countrified folk-rock that earned the group a place in the Rock and Roll 
Hall of Fame. Original members Rick Danko, Levon Helm and Garth Hudson -- 
carrying on without primary songwriter Robbie Robertson and the late Richard 
Manuel -- no longer play with the fire or focus that elevated the group in its 
heyday, but the material still shines. 
</P>
<P>
 Supported by three back-up players and a five-piece horn section, the Band 
opened with gusto, running through some skillful renditions of back-catalogue 
favorites including "Blind Willie McTell" and "Rag Mama Rag." Danko's 
percolating bass lines and Helm's soft touch on the drums were in particularly 
good form on the off-kilter shuffle of "Don't Do It" and the slinky groove of 
"Up On Cripple Creek." 
</P>
<P>
 The group sounded a bit thin and unsteady on such deceptively complex tunes as 
"Stagefright" and "Life Is a Carnival," but Danko and Helm's affecting vocals 
added heart and depth. "The Weight" was reeled off in perfunctory fashion, but 
enough of the song's spirit came through that the crowd sang along with every 
lyric. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson's absence leaves a large hole in the sound, and hard years on the 
road may have dimmed the spirits. But the group is still capable of magic, and 
in those moments, the Band's rich, soulful music remains deeply satisfying.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; JEFF BUCKLEY'S GAMBLES PAY OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Buckley sings like a man with more than a few exposed nerves. He sings 
mostly in an expressive falsetto given to wild shifts in volume and hysteria, 
delivering messages of isolation, romance and other urban ailments to 
uncomfortable extremes. 
</P>
<P>
 That voice, and the jazz-flavored, charged rock he plays behind it, makes 
Buckley a self-indulgent new pop artist with the best of intentions: a 
willingness to take unexpected chances with his music and audience. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Las Palmas Theatre in Hollywood on Thursday, Buckley and a three-piece 
band explored subtlety through passages that had the light touch of a cool jazz 
combo, only to shatter the quiet with sudden bursts from Buckley's electric 
guitar. It was difficult pop played well, reflecting deep influences from the 
likes of Leonard Cohen and other rock sophisticates, including Buckley's 
father, the late cult-hero singer-songwriter Tim Buckley, whose "Kangaroo" was 
the encore. 
</P>
<P>
 The night was also a preview of young Buckley's debut album, "Grace," to be 
released next month on Columbia Records, with many of Buckley's same fragile 
arrangements, the moments of feedback from his plugged-in acoustic, the 
occasional jarring crescendo. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckley wore faded Bohemian threads Thursday that perhaps better reflected his 
life now on New York's Lower East Side, rather than his earlier years playing 
in Hollywood. Between songs, he was achingly soft-spoken on such matters, as if 
the vocal excesses of his performance left him too taxed for anything else.

TV REVIEWS; SHOWTIME'S 'ROSWELL' AN ENGAGING UFO ENCOUNTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flying saucer stories may have fallen out of fashion, but Showtime's "Roswell" 
is not a mere sci-fi hardware yarn. 
</P>
<P>
 It dramatically re-examines the social and human side of a controversial 1947 
UFO incident in the New Mexico desert that many observers on the scene insist 
was covered up by government authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody, it seems, was spotting flying discs in the summer of '47. But the 
most controversial sighting, later dubbed "a cosmic Watergate," occurred 
outside of Roswell, N.M., the then-home of the 509th (Atomic) Bombardment Group 
that had leveled Nagasaki and Hiroshima two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning, a New Mexico sheep rancher named Marc Brazel (played by country 
singer Dwight Yoakam) discovers shiny, lightweight, foil-like fragments 
scattered over a wide surface of his scrubby outback. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon a Roswell Army Air Force intelligence officer, Maj. Jesse Marcel (Kyle 
MacLachlan), surveys the crash site and proceeds to set in motion the country's 
most notorious UFO case: the only instance in which the Air Force announced 
that it had recovered a flying saucer only to frantically retract the statement 
two days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the nonfiction book "UFO Crash at Roswell" by Kevin D. Randle and 
Donald R. Schmitt, the production succeeds because it's not so much a space 
odyssey but the story of a man's lost soul: in effect, the wages of a man's 
discovery and search for truth by MacLachlan's dogged and humiliated Maj. 
Marcel. 
</P>
<P>
 Combing those sheep fields and taking some of the bizarre crash particles home 
to his wife and son, Marcel in no time becomes the classic fall guy for 
higher-ups who insist the crushed vehicle was not a UFO but a mangled weather 
balloon. 
</P>
<P>
 UFO fanatics and conspirators of all stripes will have a field day. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie paints the picture of a Washington security cover-up despite 350 
military and civilian witnesses who observed and later talked about the wild 
and murky events. 
</P>
<P>
 The late '40s period production values are exceptionally sharp and the writers 
(Arthur Kopit, executive producer Paul Davids and director Jeremy Kagan) wisely 
integrate "Hiroshima"-like multiple viewpoints, including that of a mysterious 
ex-airman played by Martin Sheen. 
</P>
<P>
 Blending past and near-present, the script unfolds within the framework of a 
30th-anniversary reunion of the 509th Bomb squadron that was caught up in the 
top-secret Rosewell story three decades earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it all true?" Sheen's character is asked at the reunion party by the now 
embittered intelligence officer who first touched pieces of the UFO. "None of 
it is true," Sheen replies, then pauses and teasingly adds: "Or maybe some of 
it." 
</P>

 * "Roswell" airs on Showtime, Sunday, 8 p.m. 'The Whipping Boy' a Disney 
Delight 
</P>
<P>
 A bountiful children's movie premieres on the Disney Channel with all the 
ingredients of a big, warm coloring book -- a young pauper and a spoiled 
prince, rapscallions, highwaymen, a beautiful Gypsy and her huge black bear, 
dark, wet German forests, medieval towns, a careworn king and a royal castle. 
</P>
<P>
 Light and tasty as a chocolate eclair, "The Whipping Boy" may rework familiar 
territory but the production is ample evidence that on rare occasions tone, 
flavor and crisp locations can fully compensate for derivative material. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the story (adapted by Max Brindle from Sid Fleischman's 1986 
novella) conveys traces of Mark Twain's "The Prince and the Pauper" overlaid 
with Dickensian touches that include a rapacious George C. Scott as Blind 
George, the owner of a low-grade gaming club who sports an eye patch and buys 
sewer rats from orphan kids for dubious entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults should respond to this 18th-Century adventure, shot with rich colors in 
Burgundy and the Rhine, as much as kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The young co-stars are 13-year old actors Truan Munro (the pauper Jemmy) and 
Nic Knight (snotty Prince Horace). Naturally, they switch roles once they run 
away from the castle where the king has been too preoccupied to play games with 
his neglected son. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the title, it refers to the substitute whippings the scruffy orphan kid 
has literally been absorbing for the royal pranks committed by the callow 
prince. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Syd Macartney, a one-time music video and TV blurb director, nicely 
catches the whimsical imagery in the material. That includes rogue Kevin 
Conway's stench-ridden Hold-Your-Nose-Billy and the luscious-looking French 
actress Mathilda May as a Gypsy bear-keeper who helps the young boys on their 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
 This earthy fairy tale of a movie can also stop you with its bucolic charm, as 
when the pauper teaches the prince how to catch trout in a beautiful stream. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Whipping Boy" airs Sunday, 7 p.m., on the Disney Channel.

HIGH COURT TO RULE ON MAN'S RIGHT TO VETO SON'S ADOPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Revisiting an emotional issue of family law, the state Supreme Court has 
agreed to decide whether a San Diego man could veto an adoption the day after 
his child was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the seven justices, all but Ronald George, voted Thursday to review a 
lower court ruling that allowed the father, Mark King, to exercise parental 
rights on the grounds that he had shown a full commitment to assume parental 
responsibilities after the birth. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing had been sought by the adoptive parents, John and Margaret Stenbeck 
of San Diego, and a lawyer appointed to represent the 3-year-old boy, who has 
lived with the couple since birth. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves an issue that the state's high court addressed in 1992, when 
it said a biological father who makes a prompt and thorough commitment to 
assuming parental responsibilities has the same right as the mother to veto an 
adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 King, of Prescott, Ariz., was 20 when he impregnated his 15-year-old 
girlfriend, Stephanie Harman, in 1990. He was surprised by the pregnancy 
because he had undergone a vasectomy, and he had twice beaten Harman, used 
drugs and attempted suicide halfway through the pregnancy, said the 4th 
District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple agreed to the adoption by the Stenbecks, but King changed his mind 
while recovering from his suicide attempt, the court said. However, he did not 
tell the Stenbecks until a day after the child, Michael, was born in February, 
1991. Over the objections of Harman, from whom he had separated, he sued for 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the Stenbecks said in court papers that the appellate ruling in 
King's favor "sends a brutal message both to unmarried teen-age women 
considering adoption and prospective adoptive parents."  
</P>
<P>
 But King's lawyer said his client was not to blame for the Stenbecks' pain. 
"They chose to prevent him from having the child and they're now suffering the 
consequences," attorney Paula Mendell said in April.

COURT DEALS FINAL DEFEAT TO SUPERVISOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty months ago, a rancher named Willy Chamberlin won a seat on the Santa 
Barbara County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Or did he? 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the more bizarre election disputes in recent California history, 
Chamberlin's narrow victory over veteran Supervisor Bill Wallace has been in 
question since November, 1992, tied up in a legal fight over a ballot count. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the matter was finally settled by the California Supreme Court. The 
upshot: Chamberlin is officially out. Wallace is in. 
</P>
<P>
 It all began with that fall election in 1992, the one long ago when Bill 
Clinton was elected President. In a high-stakes battle where spending topped $1 
million, Chamberlin -- a conservative who is friendly to coastal development -- 
was declared the winner over Wallace -- a slow-growth environmentalist -- by 
seven votes. 
</P>
<P>
 With the finish so close, Wallace paid for a recount, which narrowed 
Chamberlin's winning margin to 5 votes. He appealed to a Superior Court judge, 
who further cut the margin to 2 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred, Wallace pressed on, and finally found victory in April at the 3rd 
District Court of Appeal. In a 62-page decision, the justices declared Wallace 
the winner -- by 12 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, however, Chamberlin had grown comfortable in his supervisor's seat, 
and he appealed to the California Supreme Court. On Thursday, he lost. In a 
two-sentence order, a majority of the state's high court declined to hear the 
appeal. That means the lower court's ruling will stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace, who has been working as a veterinarian since his apparent election 
defeat, was out of town and could not be reached for comment. But slow-growth 
advocates were jubilant, noting that Chamberlin had given the board a 
development-friendly majority at a time of crucial decisions about the county's 
open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace's attorney, Phil Seymour, predicted that his client would be back in 
the supervisor's seat by Aug. 9. "This is very good news" for Santa Barbara 
County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamberlin was not talking. But his close political ally, Supervisor Timothy 
J. Staffel, was gloomy: "I'm disappointed. With Supervisor Chamberlin on the 
board, this county was experiencing a positive change of direction."

AL MARTINEZ: WHILE DRIVING MISS IDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By AL MARTINEZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I hardly ever do anything for the benefit of humanity. Bill Boyarsky is out 
there warning everyone about bad government and Robin Abcarian is out there 
warning everyone about bad day-care centers, but all I ever do is wonder how 
many more words I have to write to fill 21 inches of space. 
</P>
<P>
 This was made clear to me the other day in a telephone message left on my 
answering machine by a woman I've named Constance Bigot. She calls every once 
in awhile to chastise "your people" for violent crime, graffiti, teen-age 
pregnancy, moral filth, welfare fraud and beer cans on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 I've never actually spoken to her, thank god, but I have listened to her 
messages. While I don't count them among my more pleasurable experiences, they 
do provide moments of comedy on otherwise lackluster days. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time she telephoned she said the reason for our current bus strike 
was that mostly Mexicans take the bus and, because Mexicans tend to be heavier, 
it overloads the system to such an extent that more maintenance is required. 
This puts a strain on the MTA work crew, which is why they want more money. 
Makes sense to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she said I ought to set an example for others of my kind by getting out 
there and helping alleviate the mess caused by the strike, since the strike was 
my fault to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 That gave me the germ of an idea. I would spend a day driving stranded bus 
riders. At last, something for humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was not an easy undertaking. I didn't want anyone to think I was, you know, 
cruising for chicks as I drove back and forth along the 17-mile length of 
Ventura Boulevard. My wife, Cinelli, suggested it was unlikely I would be 
suspected of that, but I might be mistaken for an old pervert. "Just don't 
touch anyone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 I accomplished my humanitarian project by slowing at bus stops and asking 
anyone sitting there if I could take them someplace in the immediate vicinity. 
I wasn't about to drive anyone to San Diego, but I would take them wherever 
they wanted to go along the Street of Dreams, which is what my friend Nick used 
to call Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 I picked up three different riders. Well, actually, one was a group of riders, 
four teen-agers I drove from the vicinity of Taft High to the Galleria mall in 
Sherman Oaks. But since their collective IQ was probably no higher than 98, I 
count them as one. 
</P>
<P>
 They entertained me by telling me how cool everything and elevated the 
language by substituting "goes" for "said" as an active verb. He goes, she 
goes, we go, they go. Finally, I go, "Here's the Galleria," and they go, 
"Cool!" And then they went. 
</P>
<P>
 My next rider was a clean-cut young man I picked up at Reseda. He was standing 
near a bearded, one-legged guy with a crutch who seemed to be trying to avoid 
Clint, which was his name. The person with the crutch waved me off when I asked 
if he wanted a ride, too. I learned why in a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Clint had not been in the car three minutes when he said, "Do you love Jesus?" 
Uh oh. I said, "Well, I like him a lot." It was a compromise. I'm not about to 
anger anyone who might hear the voice of God telling him to kill. We spent the 
whole ride talking about redemption. When he left, he said he'd pray for me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Ida was the best. She got into the car around White Oak, but not before 
poking her head in the window and studying me closely. You can't be too 
careful. Ted Bundy was sweet-faced too. "All right," she finally said, getting 
in, "let's go." I felt like Morgan Freeman in "Driving Miss Daisy," but she was 
no Jessica Tandy. She was more like Clara Peller, the woman who used to shout, 
"Where's the beef?" 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Ida's real name was Ida Cohen. She was probably in her 80s and maybe 
4-feet, 8-inches tall. She carried an umbrella to shield her from the sun and, 
no doubt, to beat the hell out of anyone who tried anything funny. 
</P>
<P>
 She hardly said a word most of the time, making me feel as though I ought to 
fill the void by babbling. Silence intimidates me. I told her about my job, my 
dog, my gallbladder operation, my military career, my tendency toward acne and 
my theories on why goldfish swim in a clockwise direction. She stared straight 
ahead, scowling. 
</P>
<P>
 She finally said, "Stop here," which I did, immediately. To my surprise, Miss 
Ida reached into her purse, handed me $3 and strode off down the street. I 
shouted after her that the ride was free, but she never turned around. So I 
bought beer with the $3 and drank it on the beach. To hell with humanity. I 
tossed the cans in the surf, and strolled away humming "La Bamba."

DESHIELDS SAVES BEST FOR LAST, 7-5; BASEBALL: ONLY HIS SECOND HOME RUN OF THE 
SEASON COMES WITH TWO OUT IN THE NINTH AND GIVES THE DODGERS A 7-5 VICTORY OVER 
THE ASTROS -- AND ANOTHER DAY OF GRACE ATOP THE NL WEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Delino DeShields hit a two-out, three-run home run in the ninth inning to give 
the Dodgers a 7-5 victory over the Houston Astros at Dodger Stadium on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The comeback, after rookie Ismael Valdes balked home the go-ahead run in the 
top of the inning, enabled the Dodgers to stay on top in the National League 
West for the 69th consecutive day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, in addition to the balk, had to overcome Jeff Bagwell's 35th home 
run and some sharp pitching by Shane Reynolds to hang onto the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a bizarre affair all around. While the second-best home run hitter in 
the league produced the power for the Astros, it was two of the lighter hitters 
who produced for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Butler's eighth home run, in the third inning, was one of the few balls 
the Dodgers hit hard until the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, they rallied for three runs in a weird seventh inning in which a 
popup dropped untouched near second base, and the three Dodger hits wouldn't 
have added up to one drive to the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the Astros fell out of first in the Central Division, the staggering 
Dodgers remained in first place with only their fourth victory in the last 14 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdes (2-0) shuffled his feet for the balk that let pinch-runner James Mouton 
score the go-ahead run, but the rookie wound up the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Hansen singled with one out in the bottom of the ninth against the 
Astros' bullpen ace, John Hudek, but there were two out when Butler coaxed a 
walk to put the tying run in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields, who had one home run in his 271 at-bats this season, then drove a 
2-and-1 pitch into the bleachers in right field. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds certainly deserved better than a no-decision in only his second start 
after moving into the rotation last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first start last Saturday, the big right-hander struck out 11 as he 
beat Pittsburgh, 11-0, in his first complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 He was almost as impressive against the Dodgers until the seventh. Except for 
Butler's homer in the third, which ended Reynolds' scoreless string at 18 
innings, he seemed to be in command. 
</P>
<P>
 When Eric Karros singled to open the seventh, it was only the fourth hit 
against Reynolds and he was holding a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But his next pitch probably finished Reynolds, through no fault of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Rodriguez hit a towering popup and shortstop Andujar Cedeno, the weak 
link in an otherwise solid defense, seemed to be moving in under it. Suddenly 
he ducked away, the ball dropped about 10 feet from second base, bounced high 
and the Dodgers had two runners on for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, who walked none in his shutout victory, hadn't even reached a 
three-ball count in this one. But he walked Raul Mondesi to fill the bases and 
departed in favor of Todd Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 A looping single by Chris Gwynn, a groundout and Butler's infield hit then 
brought the punchless Dodgers even. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOT ON THE TRAIL 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Giants, winners of 15 of their last 19 games, moved into 
second place with an 8-4 victory over the Colorado Rockies. C8

DE LA HOYA GETS SERIOUS VICTORY; BOXING: HE OVERWHELMS PAEZ WITH SECOND-ROUND 
KNOCKOUT. TONEY STOPS WILLIAMS IN THE 12TH. 
</P>

 With cold eyes and a malevolent left hand, Oscar De La Hoya sent Jorge Paez to 
the canvas Friday night and hammered down the little doubts that had crept into 
his young career. 
</P>
<P>
 After coming into the ring with a grimace replacing his traditional bouncy 
entrance, De La Hoya first dazed, then took out Paez before 8,011 at the MGM 
Grand. De La Hoya (14-0, 13 knockouts) ended the bout early in the second with 
two left-handed half-hooks that De La Hoya calls "45s" -- because they come 
from a 45-degree angle. 
</P>
<P>
 Paez, by far the most experienced and successful fighter De La Hoya has met as 
a professional, hit the floor forehead first and did not come close to rising 
before referee Richard Steele counted him out, 39 seconds into the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 After suffering two first-round knockdowns in his last three fights against 
journeymen, De La Hoya said he knew he needed a dazzler. And he got it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're always going to have critics, and it seems like in boxing there are 
those that still don't believe in me," De La Hoya said. "But I feel very good 
about winning my second world title in just my 14th pro fight."  
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya, who moved up from junior-lightweight for this bout, won the vacant 
World Boxing Organization lightweight title (his second WBO championship, which 
is not considered a major title) with the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had to prove to people that I'm a good fighter," De La Hoya said. 
"There were a bunch of people who were saying to me that Paez is too 
experienced for me, that I wasn't ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Mexican fans were kind of confused about me, they didn't know who 
to cheer. But you see when I knocked him out, they were cheering me." 
</P>
<P>
 In the card's main event, James Toney (44-0-2, 29 KOs) retained his 
International Boxing Federation super-middleweight belt -- and prepped for a 
potential showdown with IBF middleweight champion Roy Jones in mid-November -- 
in a blue-collar outing over Prince Charles Williams (36-6-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 32, pressed the attack the whole fight but ended it on his back with 
15 seconds remaining in the 12th and final round after absorbing a furious 
Toney overhand right and referee Joe Cortez counting to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 But the revelation of the evening was De La Hoya's ability to blow out Paez 
(53-7-4). Paez has always been better known for his ring antics than for his 
punching power and is well past his prime. But Paez is a savvy veteran and 
received a welcome equally warm as De La Hoya's Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember anything after getting knocked out," said Paez, who 
complained of dizziness after the bout. "I don't remember the second round at 
all. I was in good shape and wanted to fight, but De La Hoya was too strong and 
hit too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been hit that hard by a punch before." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya was cautious in the first round -- all too aware that his 
recklessness caused the two embarrassing first-round knockdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know what he was going to do," De La Hoya said. "Paez is such an 
unpredictable fighter." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the second, things happened quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first left knocked him kind of wobbly," De La Hoya said. "But when I saw 
him still standing, I thought, 'Wow, this guy's ready, most guys would have 
gone done after that shot.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Right there, I decided I better go after him and end it, because he's an 
experienced fighter." 
</P>
<P>
 It began, as De La Hoya's most devastating combinations usually do, with a 
sharp left that landed solidly on the chin and staggered Paez. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, De La Hoya threw two lefts and a right, stepped away for a moment, 
then caught Paez with the last left that ended it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a very important win for us, because of all that he has been making 
from boxing recently," trainer Robert Alcazar said. "It's a great result, a 
fight that will get people, hopefully, to see what's here: He's a true 
fighter." 
</P>
<P>
 The plans now call for De La Hoya to go on a world tour of 10-round non-title 
fights -- September in Mexico City, October in Japan, November in Africa. After 
that's over, De La Hoya hopes to face IBF lightweight champion Rafael Ruelas, 
who fights in Hong Kong this October, sometime in early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "After this fight," said De La Hoya's father, Joel, "all we've got to say is: 
Who's next?" 
</P>
<P>
 Next for Toney is Jones, who apparently will relinquish his middleweight crown 
to facilitate the way to Toney. Jones has balked at recent attempts to make the 
fight but has signed a deal to fight Toney in November on pay-per-view in 
either New York, New Orleans or Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sick today," Toney said. "I had the flu. I won't be sick against Roy 
Jones."

WHERE'S DAVE WHEN DAN NEEDS A PUSH?; GOODWILL GAMES: O'BRIEN DECIDES TO TAKE IT 
EASY IN 1,500 AND MISSES BREAKING HIS DECATHLON RECORD BY 176 POINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dan O'Brien set a Goodwill Games record in winning the decathlon by 538 points 
over his closest pursuer Friday. Everyone except O'Brien seemed to believe he 
should have done better. 
</P>
<P>
 Needing to run the 1,500 meters, the final event in the two-day, 10-event 
competition, in a respectable but hardly out-of-reach 4 minutes 40.92 seconds 
to surpass his two-year-old world record, O'Brien trotted around the track at a 
pace only four seconds a lap faster than the fastest walkers, finishing in 
5:10.94. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not collapse out of exhaustion. He did not even bend over with his 
hands on his knees to catch his breath. No, while he stood in the infield and 
posed for photographers, it was his unhappy coaches who stood beside the 
Petrovsky Stadium track and hyperventilated. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt we'll have a little heart-to-heart about my effort level and what 
not," O'Brien said later, anticipating his next meeting with his coaches, Mike 
Keller and Rick Sloan. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after O'Brien completed his afternoon jog, ending the decathlon, 
Cuba's Javier Sotomayor, the only man to clear 8 feet in the high jump, went 
over the bar at 7-10 1/2, waved to the crowd of about 10,000 and waved off an 
attempt at the world record.  
</P>
<P>
 That was particularly galling to Goodwill Games officials because Sotomayor 
had guaranteed them that he would attempt to break his record of 8-0 1/2 if he 
was in that position. "I was too tired," he said, bringing to a close the 
dissatisfying track and field competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Heeding their motto, "Uniting the World's Best," Goodwill Games officials 
assembled a stellar cast of track and field athletes, then were disappointed in 
performances that, for the most part, were uninspired. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we can do is bring them together," said one official who did not want to 
be identified. "If they don't want to put out, what can we do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Athletes complained about the heat and the wind, but there also was a 
suggestion that arriving at the starting line was all that was expected of 
them. Although many of the bigger-name athletes received hefty appearance fees, 
prospective bonuses for world records did not compare with those in major 
invitational meets. For example, an athlete who sets a world record in the long 
jump in a meet Sunday at Sestriere, Italy, will receive a Ferrari Testarossa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a large financial incentive," O'Brien said when asked whether he would 
have received a bonus by setting a world record, "but it wasn't large enough." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, 28, of Moscow, Ida., said he was satisfied with the victory and a 
total of 8,715 points, 176 fewer than his world record, and appeared not only 
willing but eager to defend his position at a news conference. He acknowledged 
that he did not do his best, but he said it was good enough for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "My coaches told me to go out there and challenge the 1,500," he said. "It's 
something coaches can say because they don't know how I feel after nine events. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to go out there and run that race after you've already (clinched) 
the event by 600 points. At that point, the world record becomes irrelevant. 
It's easier when there's somebody pushing you." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien's lead over U.S. teammate Steve Fritz, the eventual runner-up with 
8,177 points, was 623 after the first five events Thursday. More notable was 
O'Brien's 16-point edge over his world-record pace, which he extended to 38 by 
running the first event Friday, the 110-meter hurdles, in 13.81 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 A sub-par discus throw of 157 feet 10 inches and pole vault of 16-1 left him 
one point behind his record, but he was still within seven after a 204-1 
javelin throw. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd stirred when the public-address announcer spelled out the situation, 
but O'Brien's coaches acted as if they expected to be disappointed. He needed a 
similar time in the 1,500 to break the world record earlier this summer in the 
national championships at Knoxville, Tenn., and loafed in at 5:16.42. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he expected O'Brien to do at the distance here, Sloan said: "I'm 
reasonably confident he's going to finish." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien did that but was 44 seconds behind the winner of the event and nine 
seconds behind the next-to-last finisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Masback, a former miler who was a commentator here for Turner 
Broadcasting, said O'Brien has developed a phobia about the 1,500, pointing out 
that he once ran it as fast as 4:33.19 and recorded a 4:42.10 in setting his 
world record. 
</P>
<P>
 And Keller said the problem was as much in O'Brien's head as in his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a big disappointment with the 1,500 meters," Keller said. "It always 
seems to come down to that for us. It's not a physical thing, it's a mental 
thing with him, obviously. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somewhere along the line, we'll need a sports psychologist to deal with the 
1,500. We need to do something different than we're doing. Obviously, it's not 
working for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had two opportunities to break a world record, his own world record, 
and he hasn't been able to do it. . . . We need a victory over the 1,500 more 
than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Keller also suggested that O'Brien was reluctant to suffer the pain needed to 
run a strong 1,500, adding: "He's run 4:33 in the 1,500 back in 1989, but maybe 
his memory is pretty good and he remembers how much it hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said he can still run the 1,500 fast if he needs the time to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have run 4:50 today, very easily," he said. "If I had had a better 
pole vault and discus, I really would have gone for it. It's hard to say 
whether I would have gotten it. But since I didn't feel I was fit enough in the 
1,500 to get the record and had already won the competition, I was just 
concentrating on finishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's Bruce Jenners out there who love that race. I've yet to find a liking 
for it. Maybe I've got to develop the mental toughness. But I believe that when 
the time comes for me to run a 1,500 like I want, I'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he will find out for sure later this summer in Talence, France, where 
he is scheduled to compete against this year's world decathlon leader, Eduard 
Hamalainen of Belarus. Goodwill Games Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In other events on the final day of track and field competition, Americans won 
five gold medals, sweeping all four relays. Derek Mills, Andrew Valmon, Jason 
Rouser and Michael Johnson won the men's 1,600 relay in 2:59.42. Mike Marsh, 
Leroy Burrell, Sam Jefferson and Carl Lewis won the men's 400 relay in 38.30. 
Natasha Kaiser-Brown, Maicel Malone, Jearl Miles and Michele Collins won the 
women's 1,600-meter relay in 3:22.27. Cheryl Taplin, Dannette Young, Collins 
and Gwen Torrence won the women's 400 relay in 42.98. . . . Kenny Harrison led 
a 1-2 U.S. finish in the triple jump, sailing 57-2 1/4. Mike Conley was second 
at 56-7 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban heavyweight Felix Savon landed a thudding right hand to the stomach to 
drop Russian Sergei Machalov to his knees for a gold-medal knockout after two 
minutes. It was the first punch he landed in the match. Four Americans will box 
for gold in today' six matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Norway's Trine Hattestad was in for an unpleasant surprise after winning the 
gold medal in the javelin. Hattestad, the 1993 world champion who had a winning 
throw of 215 feet 8 inches, stood proudly on the medal podium as the national 
anthem began. The wrong national anthem. The Swedish national anthem.

ANGELS HAVE PERFECTED LOSING; BASEBALL: THEY DROP EIGHTH IN A ROW, 5-3 TO 
RANGERS. QUEST FOR AGUILERA CONTINUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Manager Marcel Lachemann looked across the clubhouse Friday night when he 
walked in after the Angels' 5-3 defeat to the Texas Rangers and made one simple 
request: 
</P>
<P>
 "If I ever call a team meeting again," Lachemann said, "I want you to kick me 
in the (butt) and tell me to shut up." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann, who called a 57-minute team meeting Tuesday in an attempt to 
inspire the Angels, instead is helplessly watching his team crumble before his 
eyes, dropping out of the American League West race. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels managed to erase any anxiety of being victimized by back-to-back 
perfect games, but it did nothing to ease their pain, losing for the 
season-high eighth consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
 They now have managed to lose in virtually every way during this streak -- 
no-hitters, three-hitters, ninth-inning home runs and just plain routs. And the 
latest gem was finding a way to lose to Ranger starter Roger Pavlik, who began 
the game with a 1-5 record and an 8.67 earned-run average but limited the 
Angels to four hits and two runs in 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 It has left them a season-high 8 1/2 games out of first place, and with only 
11 games remaining before the Aug. 12 strike date, the Angels might be all but 
mathematically eliminated from the race they vowed they could win. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't played consistent enough baseball where it was going to make that 
much difference anyway, to tell you the truth," said Angel starter Mark 
Langston (6-7), who gave up six hits, five runs, and a season-high six walks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed to win three out of four from Texas, and now this puts us in a 
serious hole. We're not going to get too many opportunities to be in this 
situation and still having a legitimate chance to be in contention. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't taken advantage of it, and that's the most frustrating thing of 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are now setting their sights on 1995 and are boldly trying to 
acquire a high-priced closer before Sunday's trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have intensified trade talks with the Minnesota Twins in an attempt 
to acquire All-Star closer Rick Aguilera, who would be their first legitimate 
closer since Bryan Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
 The Twins, according to high-ranking sources, informed the Angels that they 
will trade Aguilera in return for a package deal involving three pitchers. They 
are asking for either starter Brian Anderson or Andrew Lorraine; triple-A 
reliever Troy Percival; and a pitching prospect, either Ryan Hancock or Jeff 
Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are balking at the price, but the sides still are talking. The 
Twins, in fact, have sent Terry Ryan, vice president of player personnel, to 
scout the Angels in Texas, and the Angels sent scout Rick Schlenker to Kansas 
City, where the Twins are playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not afraid to make a deal involving pretty young kids, and we're not 
afraid to spend money," General Manager Bill Bavasi said. "But we're not 
prepared to tear apart the club. We have some things we can get done, but we'd 
have to overpay to a degree."

MORNING BRIEFING: SHE'S ALLOWED TO 'HOG THE BALL WITH THE GUYS

 Colette Cunningham of the Washington Warthogs became the first woman to score 
a point in the Continental Indoor Soccer League when she assisted on a goal 
against San Jose. The former North Carolina State player said she has had no 
problems being accepted by her male teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only time we're apart is when we're changing into our uniforms," she told 
Darren Sabedra of the San Jose Mercury-News. While the men are dressing, 
Cunningham waits outside the locker room door before entering for pregame 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yell when they're ready," she told a locker room attendant at a recent game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're ready," came the reply and Cunningham walked in and joined her 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys on my team are unbelievable, they're so supportive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But how do you suppose she feels being called a Warthog? 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who did Pete Sampras defeat in the U.S. Open tennis final last 
year? 
</P>
<P>
 Woman's prerogative: JoAnne Carner, golf's Big Momma, loves crowds, even loves 
to go among them during tournaments. She explained why to Joe Falls of the 
Detroit News. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spray the ball off the tee a lot and I usually wind up with them behind the 
ropes," she said. "It gives us a chance to visit. I tell 'em what I'm going to 
do with the ball, and if I miss, I turn around and tell them I changed my 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
 What price, memorabilia: An autographed white Bell helmet once worn by Carroll 
Shelby brought $10,000 at a recent Newport Beach auction; one of Shelby's black 
cowboy hats sold for $5,000, and his trophy from the 1960 Examiner-Herald 
Express Grand Prix at Riverside brought $4,000 for the Shelby Heart Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Say it isn't so: Cricket in jolly old England has been getting unexpected 
attention because its No. 1 player, Mike Atherton, has been accused of 
doctoring the ball before bowling it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cricket is an institution and only a game incidentally," wrote the late 
Neville Cardus, a celebrated reporter of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 When he asked someone whether W.G. Grace, the Victorian father of the game, 
ever cheated, Cardus said he was told: "Nay, never! The 'Old Man' cheat? -- 'e 
were too clever for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Checkered flag: When NASCAR fans in Phoenix heard that KTVK-TV did not plan to 
carry ABC-TV's coverage of next Saturday's Brickyard 400 Winston Cup race at 
Indianapolis, they deluged the station with telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday evening, the station led off its local newscast with the waving of two 
checkered flags and an announcement that it would indeed carry the race 
telecast.

WHO GOOFED? HEALY'S DEATH LEAVES BIG HOLE IN THE L.A. COMMUTE

 For more than 20 years, I have scheduled my appointments before or after 5:30. 
I have tried not to return telephone calls between 5:30 and 6 p.m., and leave 
work as close to 5:30 as possible for one reason -- Jim Healy.

 I lived in Los Angeles for 27 years. I moved to Utah two years ago and I've 
told people the only things I miss are the L.A. Times and Jim Healy. 
</P>
<P>
 My parents sent me a copy of Bill Dwyre's commentary on Jim's passing, and I 
laughed aloud with a sizable lump in my throat. 
</P>
<P>
 He was unique, he was the best and he will be missed . . . but not forgotten.

 With the passing of Jim Healy, the Southern California sports audience loses 
one of the announcing legends of our time. In addition to being right on top of 
the fast-breaking sports story of the minute, Healy also made it entertaining. 
But perhaps his greatest contribution to his thousands of radio listeners was 
his overflowing generosity. When my son turned 21, Healy sent him an 
autographed picture, personalized with his famous "blow it out!" refrain. To 
his family, please know one very important thing about Jim Healy: We truly 
loved him.

 So many have told us they thought of him as the sports world's Wizard of Oz, 
the man behind the curtain (or, in this case, radio booth) pulling the levers 
and pressing the buttons, creating a magic world of fact and fantasy, heralded 
by the recurring question: Is it true? 
</P>
<P>
 That so many enjoyed tuning into Jim Healy's world every day is a lasting 
comfort to us. 
</P>
<P>
 For all those who shared their feeling and offered their kindness since his 
passing, our deepest gratitude. And we wish to extend special thanks to the 
nurses and staff of the Oncology Hospice at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for the 
comfort they brought to his final days. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally: Our compliments to The Times sports department -- in particular Larry 
Stewart and "Journalist Bill" -- whose insightful words pulled back the curtain 
and revealed the essence of the Jim Healy we're sure his friends and listeners 
will long remember. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it true? Always.

 Today's article, "Mitchell Makes Point in Bad Will 100," makes the statement 
that Dennis Mitchell's time was "respectable considering the stiff wind of 1.9 
meters per second in his face." 
</P>
<P>
 Silently grumbling about what quasi-socialistic forces must be at work in this 
country for it to have come to this, I set about converting this to American 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 My calculation went as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1.9 meters per second times 3,600 seconds per hour equals 6,840 meters per 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At 1,625 meters per mile, divide 6,840 by 1,625 to get 4.21 miles per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this the "stiff wind" your article refers to? Why don't we stick to 
American from now on in the sports page?

 I think it is very rude of the Angels to refuse to play Seattle in the minor

TENNIS / WENDY WITHERSPOON; AGASSI'S NEW COACH AN OLD FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The relationship was forged over a casual dinner at Key Biscayne, Fla., in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Agassi, dining one evening after playing in the Lipton Championships, 
asked his friend, Brad Gilbert, to give him some pointers on his game. They 
went to the tennis court the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it was that Agassi, ranked 20th on the professional tour, and Gilbert, 
ranked 35th, have become player and coach. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Player's International tournament in Toronto this week, Gilbert was 
asked about the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think (Agassi) was looking for somebody to come in and make all kinds 
of changes in his game, and I wasn't looking to coach and it kind of just 
happened," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi was coached by Nick Bollettieri until 1993, when he split with him and 
hired Pancho Segura. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement between Agassi and Gilbert is informal. They hit when they can 
and talk on the phone often. Gilbert attends Agassi's matches when he is not 
involved in another tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Since striking the partnership, Agassi and Gilbert have appeared in five 
tournaments together but have not played one another. That streak could end in 
the L.A. Open, beginning Monday at the Los Angeles Tennis Center, where both 
are scheduled to play. 
</P>
<P>
 If they meet in the tournament, Gilbert, 4-5 against Agassi in his career, 
will be at a distinct disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've given him too many of my secrets in practice," Gilbert said. "He won't 
let me get away with some of the things I used to get away with." 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. Open field also includes sixth-ranked Michael Chang, ninth-ranked 
Boris Becker and 26th-ranked Richard Krajicek, the tournament's defending 
champion. Krajicek is scheduled to play his first match Monday night during a 
session that begins at 7; Chang and Becker will make their first appearances 
Tuesday starting at 11 a.m., and Agassi will play his first match Tuesday night 
on a program that starts at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Agassi: The neon-spandex-wearing player of the early 1990s is staying one 
step ahead of the fashion police. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi modeled his new line of clothing for fans during an Arthur Ashe 
Foundation benefit match against Chang on July 23 at the National Tennis Center 
in Toronto. Tom Tebbutt reported in the Toronto Globe and Mail that the color 
scheme "derives more from a barroom shiner than bright-eyed visions of tennis 
elegance and civility." 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi told Tebbutt that he wanted his new line to be casual, labeling it, 
"Something that guys could wear skateboarding down the street." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Road to recovery: Steffi Graf, who has lost consecutive matches for the first 
time in more than nine years, will defend her championship in the $400,000 
Toshiba tournament starting Monday at the La Costa Resort and Spa. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-ranked Graf won the Australian Open while dominating the first five 
months of the season. She then lost to Mary Pierce in the semifinals of the 
French Open and to Lori McNeil in the first round at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Costa field includes the top three women in the world: Graf, No. 2 
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, who won the French Open, and No. 3 Conchita Martinez, 
who won Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other entrants are sixth-ranked Lindsay Davenport, eighth-ranked 
Jana Novotna and ninth-ranked Natalia Zvereva. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Farewell: Organizers of the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles tennis tournament 
say they have received hundreds of letters to Martina Navratilova wishing her 
farewell. 
</P>
<P>
 Tournament officials asked that fans of Navratilova, nine-time Wimbledon 
champion, participate in a tribute to her final singles appearance in Los 
Angeles by writing letters and making a donation in her name to the Los Angeles 
Disaster Relief Fund benefiting victims of the Jan. 17 earthquake: Martina 
Navratilova Farewell, P.O. Box 570506, Tarzana, Calif. 91357. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova, ranked fourth, will join Davenport, Novotna, Zvereva, 
fifth-ranked Kimiko Date, 10th-ranked Gabriela Sabatini and McNeil in the 
tournament Aug. 8-14 at the Manhattan Country Club in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hometown jitters: Davenport, who spent much of her childhood in Palos Verdes 
before moving to Murrieta and graduating from Murrieta Valley High in June, 
enjoys the two Southland tour stops because it means coming home. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also means playing in front of more of her fans than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hope to do well when you're (playing) kind of near where you're from, but 
it also can make you a little more nervous. There's a little more pressure," 
Davenport said. Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay Davenport was asked to do a sound check recently before a television 
interview. "One, two, three, four, five," Davenport said. "Do you want me to 
count higher? I can, I have a high school diploma." . . . Davenport and friend 
Natalia Zvereva plan to become roommates and move to Newport Beach. . . . The 
Southern California Tennis Assn. stages exhibitions between matches at the L.A. 
Open to showcase programs such as junior tennis, and these matches often 
feature the tennis stars of the future. In 1987, for instance, a highly touted, 
skinny 15-year-old boy who had just been named to the Junior Davis Cup team 
played in one of the SCTA exhibitions. Pete Sampras returned to win the singles 
title at the tournament four years later. In addition to junior tennis, 
exhibitions this year also will include adult and wheelchair tennis.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; ROGERS ENJOYS PERFECT DAY AFTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Texas Ranger pitcher Kenny Rogers, who never again will be confused with the 
country-western singer, came to work Friday without having gone to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, who became the first left-hander in American League history to pitch a 
perfect game Thursday night against the Angels, said Friday he just was 
starting to understand the significance of his feat. 
</P>
<P>
 When "Good Morning America" telephones for a 6 a.m. interview, and the Hall of 
Fame asks to put your glove and cap on display at Cooperstown, Rogers realized 
that this hardly was just another victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been asleep yet," Rogers said Friday afternoon. "Really, I never 
closed my eyes once. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something that I don't think will ever happen again to me, but at 
least I got it that one time. I'm the only guy from Georgia ever to throw one 
of these. And I knew I'd be the only guy from Dover (Ga.), because there's no 
one else that lives in Dover. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'll be able to top this again. I guess I'm on the downside of 
my career. I might as well quit." 
</P>
<P>
 So, just how does a guy who pitches a perfect game spend his last 24 hours? 
</P>
<P>
 He stayed up until 2:30 in the morning drinking champagne with teammate Kevin 
Brown and answering congratulatory phone calls, he stayed up until 5 talking 
with his wife, went on "Good Morning America" at 6, went to play golf at 6:30 
and was at the ballpark filming a public-service announcement at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really played (golf) terrible today," Rogers said, "but you know something? 
I never had a better time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It might have violated an unwritten rule in baseball, but Rod Carew, Angel 
batting coach, said he would have bunted to break up Rogers' perfect game and 
doesn't understand why no one tried a bunt Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A base hit is a base hit," said Carew, a Hall of Famer. "If a guy's getting 
you out, I'd drop one down. Even if I'm the last hitter up, I'm trying to break 
it up any way I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ranger Manager Kevin Kennedy: "If somebody had bunted, I would have shot 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel owner Jackie Autry, who was at Thursday's game, said she got caught up 
in the emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the game ended," she said, "I stood up and applauded along with everyone 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel third base coach Ken Macha has been on the field three times during 
perfect games: Cleveland's Len Barker against Toronto in 1981, Montreal's 
Dennis Martinez against the Dodgers in 1991 and Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Which was the most dominant performance? 
</P>
<P>
 "It had to be Martinez," Macha said, "because the Dodgers didn't even hit the 
ball hard. Of course, Mark Gardner threw a no-hitter through nine innings (two 
nights before), so the Dodgers weren't exactly scorching the ball." BOB

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; SIERRA'S LONG HOMER LEADS STREAKING A'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ruben Sierra hit his 22nd home run, breaking an eighth-inning tie and sending 
the Oakland Athletics to their fifth consecutive victory, a 6-4 decision over 
the Tigers Friday night at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Oakland pitchers combined for 10 walks, but they gave up only four hits. 
Bob Welch (3-6) won in relief and Dennis Eckersley got his 17th save. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a hell of a win because the staff did the job they are here to do, 
and the hitters came through for us," Oakland Manager Tony La Russa said. "The 
walks aren't good, but other than the two (Mark) Acre gave up to lead off the 
seventh, they didn't bother me that much. Detroit has a lot of guys who can hit 
the ball into the seats, but they have enough patience to lay off the stuff out 
of the zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra led off the eighth with a 424-foot home run to left-center field off 
Tim Belcher (7-13) for a 5-4 lead. Belcher lost for the fifth time in six 
starts, giving up five runs and eight hits in 7 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 5, Cleveland 2 -- A three-run fourth inning and a solid outing by 
Sterling Hitchcock at New York sent the Yankees to their seventh consecutive 
victory over the Indians this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitchcock (3-1) allowed baseball's best-hitting team only two runs and nine 
hits in 7 2/3 innings. Bob Wickman closed the eighth and Steve Howe pitched the 
ninth for his 13th save. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't understand it either," Hitchcock said when asked about the 
Yankees' unblemished mark against the Indians. "But some teams match up really 
well with other teams. Our pitchers against their hitters and vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Belle, who earlier in the day had his suspension for using a corked bat 
reduced from 10 days to six days, went three for four with his 34th home run 
for the Indians, who had their three-game winning streak snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 5, Minnesota 3 -- Gary Gaetti hit two solo home runs and made a 
sparkling defensive play at Kansas City as the Royals stretched their longest 
winning streak in five years to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 16th two-homer game and the second this season for Gaetti, who had 
not homered since June 26. His 11th homer tied the score, 2-2, and his 12th, 
leading off the seventh, made it 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do things right on the field, take advantage of mistakes and don't make 
as many mistakes," Gaetti said. "We're playing with the confidence that we're 
going to win. And it's about time." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose DeJesus (2-0) went seven innings for the victory. He gave up seven hits, 
struck out three and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 7, Milwaukee 2 -- Mo Vaughn homered twice and Tim VanEgmond pitched a 
five-hitter at Boston for his first major league win. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wonderful feeling right now," said VanEgmond (1-3), who retired 16 
of the first 17 batters he faced and lowered his earned-run average from 9.41 
to 7.26 in the sixth start of his career. "Tonight, every time I threw the ball 
I felt it was going to go where I wanted it to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, who also had a run-scoring groundout in the first inning, led off the 
sixth with a 425-foot drive to right and hit a two-run homer into the screen 
atop the left-field wall as Boston scored four runs in the seventh. Vaughn, who 
has 24 home runs, has homered twice in a game four times this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 4, Baltimore 3 -- Joe Carter homered and Al Leiter pitched six solid 
innings at Baltimore as the Blue Jays defeated the Orioles for the first time 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Molitor had two hits and scored twice for Toronto, which ended a 
three-game losing streak. The Blue Jays were 0-6 against Baltimore, managing 
only eight runs in 54 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very important win," Blue Jay Manager Cito Gaston said. "We 
certainly have not played well against them at all this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto has won nine of 12. Baltimore has dropped four in a row and eight of 
10. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter (6-5) gave up three runs, eight hits and three walks. He struck out 
three to improve to 3-0 in five starts since June 27. Tony Castillo pitched two 
innings and Darren Hall worked the ninth for his 13th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 5, Seattle 4 -- Alex Fernandez (11-7) gave up nine hits and four runs 
in 7 1/3 innings and that was good enough. Fernandez improved his career record 
to 11-1 in July as the White Sox ended a four-game losing streak with a victory 
at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He won a ballgame, that's what counts," Seattle Manager Lou Piniella said of 
Fernandez, who won his fifth game without a loss this month. "I'd rather a 
pitcher not have his best stuff and win than have his best stuff and lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Norberto Martin had three hits for Chicago and drove in two runs. His 
two-out single in the seventh inning broke a 4-4 tie. Roberto Hernandez pitched 
the ninth for his 13th save.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; GIANTS KEEP UP PRESSURE BEHIND WILLIAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Matt Williams drove in three runs Friday night to lead the Giants to an 8-4 
victory over the Colorado Rockies at San Francisco, and into second place in 
the West Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants, who have won 15 of their last 19 games, moved past the Rockies and 
are one game behind the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' first-inning single drove in John Patterson, and Darryl Strawberry's 
sacrifice fly scored Barry Bonds to give the Giants a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants made it 3-1 in the bottom of the third on consecutive doubles by 
Bonds and Williams, and then added two more runs in the fourth when Patterson's 
fly ball to short right was misjudged by Colorado's Dante Bichette and fell for 
a two-run double. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score 6-4, San Francisco scored one more run in the seventh on 
consecutive singles by Bonds, Williams and Strawberry. Williams walked with the 
bases loaded with two out in the eighth for their final run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants are batting .272 over the 19 games since Strawberry moved into the 
lineup. Before that, they were batting .239. Bonds and Williams are batting a 
combined .370 since Strawberry arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 5, Philadelphia 2 -- Fred McGriff's two-run single capped a three-run 
fifth inning and Javier Lopez hit a two-run homer in the sixth at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Avery (7-3) gave up six hits, walked none and struck out eight, five on 
called third strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had super control," Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox said of Avery, who gained 
his first complete game of the season and ended the Phillies' four-game winning 
streak. "He didn't make but a couple of mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 8, Florida 4 -- The Expos broke open a tie game with a four-run 
seventh inning on only two hits at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Walker's single drove in Rondell White with the tiebreaking run. The 
Expos also scored on a walk, a hit batsman and Sean Berry's sacrifice fly, all 
with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Shaw (5-2) pitched 1 1/3 innings of perfect relief for the victory. Mel 
Rojas and John Wetteland combined to shut out the Marlins over the final three 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 4, San Diego 1 -- Jeff Branson hit a two-run homer and Bret Boone 
had two runs batted in for the Reds at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Schourek (6-2) pitched 6 2/3 innings, giving up one run on nine hits, 
with six strikeouts and one walk. Jeff Brantley pitched the final 2 1/3 innings 
for his 12th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Branson hit his homer to right field in the second inning off Andy Ashby 
(4-11), who has lost five consecutive starts and is 0-6 lifetime against 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Branson's fifth homer of the year, all coming in his last 41 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 4, Pittsburgh 1 -- Bobby Jones continued to excel on the road and 
Ryan Thompson stayed hot in the Mets' victory at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones (11-7) limited Pittsburgh to seven hits and a run over seven innings and 
is 7-1 with a 1.67 earned-run average away from Shea this season. He has a 9-2 
career road record, compared to a 4-9 record and 4.29 ERA in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 His road success has helped the Mets win 12 of their last 16 road games. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson homered in the seventh and is five for 15 with three homers and five 
RBIs in Three Rivers Stadium this season. John Franco pitched the ninth for his 
26th save in 32 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 8, St. Louis 3 -- Jim Bullinger pitched eight solid innings and Steve 
Buechele hit a two-run homer and a run-scoring triple to lead the Cubs at St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs have won eight of their last 11 games. The Cardinals have lost six in 
a row and 19 of their last 25. The teams are tied for last place in the 
Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullinger (6-2) won his third consecutive start as he gave up three runs on 
four hits with two walks and four strikeouts. The Cubs scored five runs off 
starter Allen Watson (6-5) when they sent nine men to the plate in the first 
inning.

 Cleveland slugger Albert Belle made a simple declarative statement regarding 
his corked bat controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never used or knowingly attempted to use a corked bat in a game," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 With that, Belle accepted a six-day, seven-game suspension from American

originally imposed. As part of the settlement, the Major League Baseball 
Players Assn. withdrew the appeal of the punishment.

 Fuzzy Zoeller is taking his victories on the PGA Tour on a round-by-round 
basis these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm comfortable because I've got two rounds of golf under my belt," 
Zoeller said Friday after shooting a 65 for a two-round total of 131 and a 
two-stroke lead in the $1.25-million St. Jude Classic at Memphis, Tenn.  
</P>
<P>
 Tour rookie Dicky Pride, who started the day tied for the lead, finished with 
a 67 for 133. He was tied at nine under with Gene Sauers and Jay Haas, each of 
whom shot 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Price, the British Open winner and the defending champion, had a two-day 
total of 138 after shooting a 66. 
</P>
<P>
 The cut came at two-under 140, with casualties including John Daly, Tom Kite 
and Hale Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoeller, whose last victory was the Anheuser-Busch Golf Classic in 1986, 
struggled with back problems before winning $378,175 in 1993. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Lee Trevino and Jimmy Powell shot six-under-par 66s to share the first-round 
lead in the $650,000 Northville L.I. Classic at Jericho, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevino, 54, who already has five victories in 15 tournaments this year, needs 
one more to tie Miller Barber for the Senior PGA Tour career lead of 24. 
Powell, 59, who didn't join the regular PGA Tour until he was 45, shot a 
bogey-free round.

 Paul Azinger, who has spent this year undergoing treatment for cancer, will 
return to the tour next week at the Buick Open.

including the PGA Championship. He finished second on the money list with $1.4 
million in winnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors then discovered a lymphoma in his right shoulder and started Azinger 
on treatment that kept him out of competition for seven months.

 Juli Inkster shot a 69 to take a one-stroke lead after the second round of the

<P>
 It's tough for the Raiders to look at the blue waters of the Mediterranean 
outside the windows of their Barcelona hotel, watch sailboats lazily cruising 
through the calm waters, see the vacationers stretched out on the long beaches 
and remember that they are supposed to be in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 But once he has them out there, Coach Art Shell has been working his players 
hard in their one daily practice session.They went nearly three hours Friday, 
an hour longer than a normal session in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to let them enjoy it over here," Shell said. "This is a place they 
may never get to again. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I also hammer into their minds that they are still in training camp and 
they have got a game to play." 
</P>
<P>
 It also helps that Sunday's game against the Denver Broncos is the Raiders' 
first of the exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
 What if it was the last? 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't do it," Shell said. "We wouldn't be here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shell plans to give starting quarterback Jeff Hostetler at least one quarter 
of work Sunday. But probably not much more. Shell wants to shield Hostetler, 
who took a beating last season, as much as possible until the regular season. . 
. . Wide receiver Alexander Wright, suffering from a pulled calf muscle, has 
started jogging but won't play Sunday. STEVE SPRINGER

 Veteran defensive end Fred Stokes suffered a sprained left knee during 
blocking drills. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes, a starter who finished with 9 1/2 sacks last season, suffered the 
injury during one-on-one blocking drills against rookie offensive lineman 
Ronald Edwards. Stokes couldn't put any weight on the knee and had to be helped 
into a cart. Team doctors said there appeared to be no ligament damage, adding 
that they would do an MRI today if the knee swells overnight. Losing Stokes 
would mean the Rams would turn to either veteran Gerald Robinson or rookie Brad 
Ottis as the starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some people who are going to have to come on," Coach Chuck Knox 
said. "Ottis had a great day Thursday on pass rush."

 Wide receiver Greg McMurtry practiced, turned in his playbook, stopped by the

 McMurtry, the former New England wide receiver signed by the Rams as a free 
agent, told Knox that he didn't believe he had a chance to play with the Rams.

 The Rams still have McMurtry under contract. They could cut him to free up his 
$500,000 salary under the salary cap.

 Save the Rams, a group of Orange County businessmen trying to keep the team in

today but will take Sunday off, the first break since camp opened July 22. . . 
. Wide receiver Sean LaChapelle returned to practice after sitting out three 
days because of an ankle injury he suffered in a collision with cornerback 
Dexter Davis. . . . Defensive end Robert Young (hip) returned to practice. 
Defensive tackle Marc Boutte (knee), defensive end Kevin Patrick (shoulder), 
wide receiver Chris Brantley (hamstring) and cornerback Steve Israel (leg 
muscle) sat out both practices. MIKE REILLEY

 Rookie linebacker Trev Alberts' contract problems have come to an end after

 "We got the language worked out, and it has been sent to the league," Irsay

Steve Bono from the 49ers in exchange for a draft pick. Tagliabue had been

bargaining agreement.

 LABELS: Rating video games by their content (A16) is supposed to help parents

 CHICKEN MUSICK: You may not see many chickens from the freeway, but Orange 
County's tiny egg production has actually shown some growth lately. . . . Not 
that there are many chicken farms left. The only one of any size is Singing Hen 
Chicken Ranch in Cypress -- and it's down to fewer than 100 hens. Actually, 99% 
of all the commercial eggs in the county come from the jail system's James A. 
Musick Branch Jail. Says Cal Meekhof, owner of the Cypress ranch, which once

you could somehow pedal 24 hours a day? Just under seven days, say riders in 
the annual, corporate-sponsored Race Across America, which starts Sunday at the 
Holiday Inn in Irvine. . . . Four team members split the clock with six hour 
daily shifts each, the others sleeping in support vehicles. Last year's 
winners, from Cypress-based PacifiCare, are back again. They should reach the 
finish line next Saturday in Savannah, Ga.

 REALISTIC SWEAT: Frank Pangborn suggests if you want to go to Hollywood, try 
Irvine Valley College in Irvine first. The actor teaches a seminar there today 
on how to break into acting. Casting director Kathy Smith, who got Pangborn his 
first commercial, will be there to help. Says Pangborn: "It's an extremely 
competitive business. But if you enjoy it, and are willing to sacrifice -- and 
be a realist -- don't be afraid to go for it." Busy Hens

SAMUEL WILLIAMS, 61; HEAD OF STATE BAR, POLICE BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Samuel L. Williams, a highly visible Southern California attorney, a member of 
the boards of several prominent corporations, a past president of the Los 
Angeles Board of Police Commissioners and the first black to serve as president 
of the California State Bar, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the law firm of Hufstedler & Kaus, where he had been a 
senior partner before retiring in 1990, said Williams had suffered a heart 
attack and died at his Los Angeles home Thursday night. He was 61 and had 
suffered a stroke in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 At his death, Williams -- a close friend and political intimate of former 
Mayor Tom Bradley -- had filled a multitude of positions in professional life 
and community service.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1981 he turned down -- for family and personal reasons -- an offer by Gov. 
Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. to be appointed to the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Within his profession he had been president of the National Conference of Bar 
Presidents, a president of the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. and in 1981 head of 
the State Bar of California. He also had been chairman of the U.S. Circuit 
Judge Nominating Commission and the California Federal Selection Commission for 
Federal Judicial Nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 For his native city he had been a member and former president of the Los 
Angeles Board of Police Commissioners and was a staff attorney for the McCone 
Commission, which investigated the 1965 Watts riots. Williams was on the police 
commission in April, 1991, when amid rancorous debate it voted to suspend Chief 
Daryl F. Gates in the aftermath of the Rodney G. King beating. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been on the boards of the Walt Disney Co., the Bank of California, the 
Los Angeles Music Center, USC and several other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 He played football and baseball at UC Berkeley while also being named an 
Academic All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from the USC School of Law he worked as a probation officer 
and deputy state attorney general before entering private practice. 
</P>
<P>
 His honors included the Maynard Toll Award for lifetime service to the Los 
Angeles Legal Aid Foundation and the county Bar Assn.'s highest tribute, the 
Shattuck Price Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Hufstedler, former U.S. secretary of education, judge of the 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals and now senior partner at Hufstedler & Kaus, the firm 
Williams joined in 1965, said: "We have lost a superb partner and a beloved 
friend. . . . Our country has lost a great American." 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Beverly, a son and daughter. Funeral arrangements 
are pending.

 Rod Carew, Angel hitting coach, said he would have bunted to break up Rogers' 
perfect game and doesn't understand why no one attempted a bunt Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A base hit is a base hit," Carew said."If a guy's getting you out, I'd drop 
one down. Even if I'm the last hitter up, I'm trying to break it up any way I 
can." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ranger Manager Kevin Kennedy: "If somebody had bunted, I would have shot 
him."

 Rogers' perfect game was only the second pitched in the first year of a 
ballpark. The Philadelphia Phillies' Jim Bunning pitched one in 1964 at Shea 
Stadium.

 There have been only seven no-hitters pitched in first-year ballparks, the 
last thrown by Nolan Ryan on May 15, 1973 at Royals Stadium in Kansas City. BOB

BULLFROGS USE A FAMILIAR STYLE OF PLAY TO DOMINATE LAS VEGAS, 14-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were many happy returns for the Bullfrogs in their 14-4 victory over Las 
Vegas Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 10,601 at The Pond of Anaheim watched the Bullfrogs bring back the 
style of game that many fans had grown accustomed to last season, when the team 
won the Roller Hockey International championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Gervais and Jim Brown rediscovered their scoring touch as each 
collected three goals and an assist. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Bobby McKillop, last season's playoff MVP, made his way back to the 
score sheet with two goals, his first in nearly four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 And Anaheim's suffocating defense also returned, limiting the Flash to 31 
shots as goalie Rob Laurie made some sparkling saves.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I could bottle tonight's emotion and release it before every game I'd be a 
millionaire," Bullfrog Coach Grant Sonier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Bullfrogs played without captain Kevin Kerr and their top-scoring 
defenseman, Darren Perkins, the team didn't miss a beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Lalonde and Steve Beadle each had four assists, Brad McCaughey had a 
goal and three assists, and Joe Cook scored two goals.  
</P>
<P>
 Rich Chernomaz scored three goals for Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerr sat out after receiving a mandatory one-game suspension for a 
game-misconduct penalty he incurred in the last game. Perkins is attending his 
sister's wedding, Sonier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs (12-4) pulled within two points of the Blades (13-4), who lead 
the Pacific Division. Las Vegas (6-10-1) is four points out of the division's 
last playoff spot behind San Diego (8-7-2). 
</P>
<P>
 The only scare for the Bullfrogs came with 3 minutes 46 seconds remaining in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Gervais, the team's leading scorer with 20 goals and 20 assists, injured his 
knee and left the game. Sonier said he may be ready for tonight's game at 
Oakland.

U.S. JUNIOR AMATEUR GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS; FULLERTON'S NOE ADVANCES TO SEMIFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terry Noe of Fullerton advanced to today's semifinals of the U.S. Junior 
Amateur Golf Championship with two victories Friday at Echo Lake Country Club 
in Westfield, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Two victories by Noe today would mean a fourth consecutive title for an Orange 
County golfer. Tiger Woods of Cypress won the previous three. 
</P>
<P>
 Noe, who will be a junior at Sunny Hills High this fall, had an easy time in 
his morning match, routing Allen Chaney of Columbus, Miss., 6 and 5. It got 
tougher in the quarterfinals, where Noe edged Darren Angel of Northridge, 1-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Noe will face Puerto Rico's Mauricio Muniz, who defeated Wilfredo 
Morales of Puerto Rico in 19 holes in the third round and Charles Woerner of 
Sunnyvale, 3 and 2, in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Howell of Augusta, Ga., reached the semifinals for the second 
consecutive year by eliminating favored Ted Oh of Torrance, 1-up, with a 
six-foot birdie putt on the final hole in the quarterfinals. He will meet Andy 
Barnes of Stockton today. 
</P>
<P>
 Howell also scored a 1-up victory in his morning match against Jeremy Anderson 
of Lake Park, Fla. Barnes beat Brandon DiTullio of Thousand Oaks, 3 and 2, and 
Boyd Summerhays of Farmington, Utah, in 20 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament is for players under 18 with a handicap no higher than 9.4.

SUNNY GARCIA RISES AND SHINES; OP PRO SURFING: SAN CLEMENTE'S BESCHEN ALSO 
ADVANCES BY SCORING HIGHEST WAVE OF THE DAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defending Op Pro champion Sunny Garcia would have liked a few more days to 
settle in and practice surfing the Huntington Beach break, but in his first 
heat, it didn't seem to matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in the second round of the main event, Garcia easily won his first 
heat, scoring 24 points to the second-place Richard Lovett's 22.64. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get here early but my sponsor, Billabong, had a contest in 
Jeffrey's Bay (South Africa). I didn't get in until Tuesday," Garcia said. 
"Yesterday was the first day I surfed since Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 The time off didn't appear to hurt Garcia, 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Op brings out the best in most people; it does in me," he said. "This is 
the first beach I ever surfed outside of Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
 Now in his ninth year on the world tour, Garcia has been competing since he 
was 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surfing's come a long way in that time," he said. "When I started, if you 
finished 33rd in a contest, you'd get $300 and we thought that was big money. 
Now it's $1,500 for 33rd." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia grew up in a tough neighborhood in Makaha, Hawaii. His parents divorced 
when he was 5. With his mother and sisters, Garcia lived on welfare at times 
and lived off a single, minimum wage at others. And school was no escape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where I went to school, if you didn't know how to fight, you wouldn't want to 
go to school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a few beatings at school and gaining confidence in his surfing, 
he dropped out and committed himself to the his sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first turned pro, I was making $600 a month and I thought I was on top 
of the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to putting money in his pocket, Garcia credits surfing with 
keeping him out of trouble. "My best friends from home are in jail and if I 
wasn't surfing I probably would have been hanging out with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Even on the surfing scene, Garcia struggled to stay focused. In 1988, he 
developed an addiction to cocaine, and something had to give. He chose surfing 
and his family. 
</P>
<P>
 On the world tour, his determination showed as he climbed from 16th place to 
10th to sixth to third. His wife, Anella, and their three children met him in 
Huntington Beach to cheer him on in the Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 After two rounds of men's surfing Friday, only 32 of 218 surfers who entered 
event remain. San Clemente's Shane Beschen scored the highest wave of the day 
-- an 8.83 -- on his way to scoring the highest heat of the day, 26.76. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same heat as Beschen, Rob Machado of Cardiff scored a 23.40 to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the usual California waves out there," Machado said. "It's tougher 
when it's inconsistent like that, but I guess I'm used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Also advancing were: Joey Jenkins of North Hollywood, Shane Stoneman of Dana 
Point and Jeff Deffenbaugh of Huntington Beach. Australians Richie Lovett and 
Barton Lynch advanced, as did the amateur champion Kalani Robb. Newport Beach 
surfer Richie Collins advanced in men's surfing and longboarding competitions.

TRENDS; DIVINE INSPIRATION; RELIGIOUS OBJECTS ARE GETTING REVERENTIAL TREATMENT

 Stained glass windows, wooden pews, crucifixes, statues and icons -- some of 
which once graced old churches and some always meant for personal use -- are 
increasingly being used as design elements in homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those using these objects to adorn their living areas are moved by 
genuine religious sentiment, some by a more worldly interest in the latest 
design trend, some by a fascination on both levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Sinner -- yes, it's her real name, and, no, it's not why she collects 
what she does -- has filled her townhouse in Orange with so many religious 
artifacts that when friends come by they often ask, "Do we have to start 
praying?" 
</P>
<P>
 Crucifixes and icons adorn the walls. Her shelves and tabletops are crammed 
with statues representing Jesus and Mary, crosses of all kinds, candlesticks 
and fonts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I once looked at a church steeple and thought, 'Where could I put that?' But 
I decided it would look out of place on top of my townhome," Sinner says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her collection mixes freely with her other eclectic furnishings and has spread 
throughout her bedroom and bath. Among her rarer pieces: a two-foot-high wooden 
santo (an image of a saint) holding baby Jesus in one hand and a skull in the 
other that dates back to the early 1800s; a prayer box she found in a thrift 
shop with a carving of images of Mary and Jesus and a drawer below for storing 
a rosary, candle or other religious items, and a mid-1800s altar boy bank with 
a bobbing head used to collect money for missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love living with spiritual things. They're beautiful to look at," Sinner 
says. "I'm Catholic, and my grandmother was very Catholic. She loved 
crucifixes. I've loved religious things for years, and now decorators are 
really using them a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in collecting religious artifacts has emerged as a trend over the 
past four or five years. Cher is an avid collector, and Madonna -- the 
celebrity, that is -- is said to have furthered the trend with her mania for 
crosses. 
</P>
<P>
 Not until a year ago, however, did Orange County antique dealers notice a big 
jump in the demand for holy objects. 
</P>
<P>
 Some buyers use the religious items as they were intended, say, to set up a 
small shrine or altar in the home for private worship. Others find radically 
different uses for religious artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbie Francis, sales supervisor for the Old Chicago Antique Market in Fountain 
Valley, which usually has a few church furnishings on hand, recalls how a 
preacher's pulpit was purchased by a homeowner and converted into a bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Pews are often shortened and used as benches on porches, in hallways or with 
tables, Francis says. 
</P>
<P>
 Most religious articles come from churches that have been torn down. The 
churches auction off their furnishings, which are purchased by antique dealers 
and passed along to buyers, says Johnny Lambrecht, owner of Cardinal Church 
Furniture in Azusa, which sells old and new church furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've become more sensitive to older buildings and want to preserve their 
content," Lambrecht says. "In the 1940s through 1960s everybody wanted to 
modernize. That's how a lot of the pews ended up on the market today." 
</P>
<P>
 In this machine-made age, people have begun to appreciate the handcrafted 
artistry of pre-1950s pews, which often had elaborate rosettes and Gothic 
arches hand-carved out of fine Appalachian red oak, Lambrecht says. 
</P>
<P>
 While the recent closure of some older Catholic churches has added to the 
supply of artifacts, antique dealers say that increased demand is rapidly 
drying up their inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a diligent collector can find religious items at antique stores, flea 
markets, thrift stores and estate sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinner, an antique dealer by trade (although she never sells her religious 
items), has a knack for finding rare pieces for just a few dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of her best items have been found at garage sales and thrift shops. She 
found her favorite piece, a 1930s-era statue in the image of the Christ child 
wearing a tiny crown, at a garage sale for $10, and she recently came across a 
turn-of-the-century Staffordshire porcelain font selling at the Goodwill for 
$1. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Sinner's finds are campy -- such as her plastic snow globe with a 
Madonna image. Other items are a touch morbid, such as the tiny cross that 
inexplicably conceals a switchblade or the stained- glass lantern with a brass 
cross on top that Sinner says came off of an old funeral car. 
</P>
<P>
 Some truly fine religious specimens can be found through antique dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Yeakel, owner of Richard Yeakel Antiques in Laguna Beach, has rare 
artifacts that go back centuries, such as 13th-Century chalices and 
12th-Century religious art. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pope John Paul II visited Los Angeles two years ago, he borrowed four 
pieces from Yeakel to use for a private Mass, including a 15th-Century triptych 
(three panels with Christ and 12 saints carved out of wood) and a three-tiered 
cross believed to have been made for a 15th-Century Pope that remains in 
Yeakel's personal collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most art from before the 17th Century is religious. Back then churches had 
the money to hire the great artists," Yeakel says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Great Exchange Consignment Co. in Laguna Beach routinely sells religious 
items, most of which were purchased from churches by wealthy patrons and sold 
off with their estates. There's a small collection of icons, hand-painted on 
wood and often adorned with brass or silver overlays, that date back to the 
1700s. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say the home is blessed with an icon hanging in it. That's why people 
buy them," says Tom Campbell, co-owner of the Great Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious artifacts come from churches all over the world, from Mexico to 
Russia. Synagogues and Buddhist temples are other sources of artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Great Exchange, Campbell usually has Buddhas of all kinds as well as 
temple carvings -- elaborate, colorful carvings that once hung over doorways to 
temples. He mounted one temple carving in his back yard on a gazebo that 
overlooks an Oriental garden. Yeakel has many items that once belonged in 
synagogues, such as Hanukkah lamps and menorahs. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in religious objects crosses all denominations. One doesn't have to 
belong to the religion to appreciate a beautiful furnishing from a church or 
temple, Sinner says. 
</P>
<P>
 For her, the spiritual meaning of the pieces she collects outweighs their 
trendy, monetary appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "God's close to me. This is like living with part of him in my home," she 
says.

A FOLLOWING AMONG THE FAITHFULLY HIP

<P>
 Things Catholic have become hip among the so-called Generation X set, 
fascinated with a denomination that either dominated their family life or that 
they know very little about. 
</P>
<P>
 They are decorating their homes with new or reproduction religious 
items.Mexican-made folk art crafted from metal, such as recycled beer cans, or 
tin treated to look rusty are among the trendiest. Even hotter, and had for 
only a couple of dollars, are mass-produced votive candles wrapped with 
stickers depicting Jesus, the Virgin Mary or saints. 
</P>
<P>
 Velour aprons and pillows depicting the Virgin Mary in vivid colors sell as 
fast as those bearing Elvis at Na Na's Trading Co. in Costa Mesa and Santa 
Monica.  
</P>
<P>
 At the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana, the store can't keep in 
stock enough stick-shift knobs picturing Our Lady of Guadalupe. Other favored 
fare: three-dimensional pictures of holy figures in ornate tin frames, night 
lights and soap shaped in the Virgin's form and black velvet paintings of 
related figures and topics. 
</P>
<P>
 Our Lady is the most favored image, in part because of its popularity in 
Mexican culture. In addition to its traditional uses, it is favored by Latino 
gang members on jackets and as tattoos. Just as gangs have influenced 
mainstream fashion with their baggy attire, the same is happening with their 
use of Our Lady. ROSE APODACA JONES

 There are some things, like food and water, you just can't live without. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are some things that you think you just can't live without, such as 
an air-conditioned car when you're sitting in traffic on the 405 on a 
sizzling-hot afternoon, your cellular telephone in an emergency or your roving 
teen-ager without a pager. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are some things you might not know you can't live without, like the 
following items. On the House 
</P>
<P>
 Even facial tissue needs a home. And there are none more stylish than the 
all-natural log cabin holders by Palecek in Richmond, Calif.  
</P>
<P>
 The rectangular cabin (about $25) has a lift-off top; the square one (about 
$19) nestles the tissue box. 
</P>
<P>
 Believing there was a need for such a holder, company president Allan Palecek, 
who began his firm 18 years ago, went to the design board. In addition to 
tissue holders, Palecek has a full line of baskets and accent wicker, rattan 
and steel furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 The tissue holders can be purchased in Orange County at Living Creations in 
Newport Beach, Roger's Gardens in Corona del Mar, La Tortuga in Orange and 
Springdale Drug in Huntington Beach. Best-Dressed

<P>
 One way to keep your bottle of suds from looking like a dud by the sink is to 
dress it up in a designer bib by the Music Stand, a catalogue of gifts and 
ideas from the performing arts, based in West Lebanon, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
 Styled with a music-manuscript fabric that's washable, the bib (about $7 plus 
shipping and handling), trimmed with an eyelet ruffle and a red ribbon sash, 
could help change your tune when you're washing the dishes.

 What host or hostess with the mostest would want to be without Touchstone's 
ceramic toilet tissue holder? 
</P>
<P>
 It conceals a bathroom necessity while keeping it in clear view of your 
guests. Not since crocheted jackets for tissue rolls has such attention been 
given to this matter. Available with either a peony or an ivy motif, the 
ceramic holder ($54 plus shipping and handling), distributed by the 
Atlanta-based Touchstone, stacks a spare pair of toilet tissue rolls in a 
container that keeps the rolls visible. Also available is a coordinating toilet 
brush holder ($43 plus shipping and handling.)

EXTENDING THE LIFE OF AN EXTENSION CORD; SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Extension cords seem simple to use, but if the cord is the wrong size or type 
for a job, or if it's improperly used, it can cause a fire. Some local codes 
forbid extension cord use because they're considered a safety hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 An extension cord is intended only for temporary duty -- unplug and store it 
after each use. Don't run one where it may be tripped over. To avoid a severe 
or fatal shock, never use one near water. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some do's and don'ts about choosing and using an extension cord: 
</P>
<P>
 * Be careful when buying an extension cord. Just because it has several 
receptacle ends doesn't mean that it can carry more current than the outlet 
into which it's plugged. As a general rule, don't plug more than one item into 
an extension cord. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most extension cords are marked with a rating in amperes (also called amps 
or simply abbreviated "A"). Look at the nameplate. If not listed and you know 
the wattage, divide by 110 (household voltage) to obtain amperage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never exceed the ampere rating. 
</P>
<P>
 * The longer the cord, the greater the drop in current, which can reduce an 
appliance's efficiency. A 25-foot cord, for example, has to be heavier than a 
six-foot cord performing the same task. 
</P>
<P>
 * An extension cord contains a pair of wires, each covered with heat-resistant 
plastic insulation and wrapped in a plastic or rubber sheath. The cord is 
equipped with a male and female plug. If there is a three-prong plug, the cord 
also contains a third, ground wire. Plug this type of cord into a grounded 
(three-hole) plug. Use only three-wire extensions for tools and appliances that 
have three-wire cords. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you must use an extension cord for a refrigerator, freezer or some other 
electrical unit that draws substantial amounts of current, make sure it's a 
heavy-duty, three-wire type. 
</P>
<P>
 * The thinner the cord, the lower its capacity for conducting electricity. 
Wiring in electrical cords is rated by numbers. The lower the number, the 
larger the wire and the greater amount of current it can safely carry. 
</P>
<P>
 * A lamp-type cord usually contains a number wire. Don't use it for any device 
that draws more than seven amps. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heavier-duty numbers 16, 14 or even 12 should be used for devices that draw 
higher amounts of current. 
</P>
<P>
 * If an extension cord feels warm to the touch, replace it with a heavier one. 
</P>
<P>
 * If at all possible, avoid using extension cords in a workshop. If using one 
is unavoidable, make sure that the cord has a three-prong plug and is at least 
a number 14 or heavier. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hook the cord slack on a long spring screwed into the ceiling above your 
workbench to keep extension or power cords out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the cord has frayed insulation or a bare wire, replace the entire cord. 
If the plug is damaged, replace it with a new plug that has the same or greater 
current-carrying capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remove an extension cord from an outlet by grasping the plug body. 
Otherwise, wires may tear loose and result in a shock or a short circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 * To keep them from tangling or wearing, store folded cords in napkin rings or 
toilet paper tubes, or hang on an old tie rack wrapped with masking tape.

PHOTO PRESERVATION IN A SNAP; STORAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Time, temperature and other environmental elements can have a negative effect 
on your photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Photos are just pieces of paper with a thin chemical coating, and they can be 
easily damaged by the environment, improper storage and rough handling. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the steps you can take, and the things to avoid, in order to preserve 
them for posterity: 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid direct sunlight and extreme heat and humidity, whether your photos are 
kept in an album, in frames or loose. Any of these elements can change a 
photo's chemistry, causing fading, discoloration and warping. 
</P>
<P>
 * Store photos in rooms where you feel most comfortable, suggests Grant Romer, 
director of education at the International Museum of Photography at the George 
Eastman House in Rochester, N.Y. That would rule out hot attics or humid 
basements, where photos are likely to grow mold or become brittle and flake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never store photos or albums above a radiator, Romer adds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Light can turn a normal photo into a faded and discolored image in just 10 
years. Keep photos away from areas that receive direct sunlight and away from 
lamps and overhead lights. 
</P>
<P>
 * Handle photos as little as possible. If there are special photos that you 
want to display or pass among relatives, have extra copies made and carefully 
preserve the originals. Fingerprints, which contain oils and amino acids, also 
damage photos. 
</P>
<P>
 * Store all valued photos in acid-free file folders, envelopes and boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * The album is an important aspect of photo survival. Today's most popular 
photo albums -- those with sticky backings and sheets of plastic that cover the 
snapshots -- are actually the most damaging. Over time, the sticky backing 
becomes more tenacious, making it difficult to remove photos without destroying 
them. The clear plastic sheets that cover the pictures can pull the emulsion 
off photos. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pasting photos into scrapbooks will also damage prints. 
</P>
<P>
 * Acid-free archival albums and mounting corners, which don't require the use 
of glue on the photos, are a better choice. This method allows for easy removal 
of photos whenever you want. Archival albums, however, can cost twice as much 
as regular albums. To keep expenses down, sort through your photo collection 
and select only the most important ones for your album. 
</P>
<P>
 * Albums, like loose photos, should be stored in a relatively cool, dark, dry, 
dust-free environment. 
</P>
<P>
 * When framing photos, use acid-free matte board and airtight frames. It is 
important to keep the image away from the glass -- if humidity gets in between 
the photo and the glass, the emulsion from the photo will come off on the glass 
when the photo is removed from the frame. 
</P>
<P>
 * Insert acid-free paper behind the photo. If the photo touches cardboard or 
wood, it can absorb damaging resins and acids from its backing and matte.

'UNGARDENING' YARD BRINGS ANIMALS BACK; ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN McGRATH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-odd years ago, science writer Sara Stein and her husband bought some 
land in New York. It was "the sort of land that real estate agents, embarrassed 
by its unkempt appearance, describe as 'having potential.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next 10 years, the couple "cleared brush and pulled vines and hauled 
rocks and broke ground and dug beds until . . . we had an expanse of landscaped 
grounds and gardens that seemed to us like Eden." 
</P>
<P>
 And then, in a sort of epiphany, Stein realized what all their hard work had 
accomplished: "We had banished the animals from this paradise of ours." 
</P>
<P>
 Systematically, if unintentionally, Stein had made her garden a place 
uninhabitable by most of the animals living there when she arrived. Grouse 
departed when she mowed their cover. Fox and woodchuck lairs were "preempted 
for rock garden and day-lily border." The toad that lived in the loose stone of 
the doorstep went when cement brick replaced the step. And so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Horrified by what she had contrived, Stein spent the subsequent 10 years 
"ungardening" her land, restoring it to the productive habitat it was when she 
found it. 
</P>
<P>
 She documents her work in a fascinating book called "Noah's Garden: Restoring 
the Ecology of America's Backyards" (Houghton Mifflin, 1993. $21.45). 
</P>
<P>
 Stein is one of a growing number of Americans looking around at the suburban 
landscape -- at its acres of manicured lawn and traditional perennial border -- 
and finding it sterile and unwelcoming. In its place, these new gardeners are 
transforming their lots into enchanting sanctuaries for birds, amphibians, 
insects and small mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 As Stein makes so clear in her book, these back-yard wildlife sanctuaries are 
more than just a nice idea or a trendy new way of gardening. They are providing 
vital habitat for many native species feeling the squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The word habitat is used by biologists as the wildlife equivalent of 
neighborhood. It is an area that affords animals food, water, shelter and space 
to live. Believe it or not, it is possible to provide all of these elements for 
a variety of species in all but the smallest of yards. (And even then you can 
always rope in a neighbor or two.) 
</P>
<P>
 In a garden, you can provide food by growing plants that produce seeds, 
berries, nuts and flower nectar and attract insects. You can provide water 
year-round by installing a birdbath, sprinkler, drip faucet, pond, puddle or 
stream. 
</P>
<P>
 You can provide shelter in the form of trees of varying sizes, both evergreen 
and deciduous, shrubs, rock walls or piles, hollow logs, snags (these are 
standing dead trees), thickets and leaf litter. 
</P>
<P>
 You can provide these things without turning your yard into a 
useless-for-humans jungle. In fact, some of the features that make a garden a 
good wildlife habitat -- diversity, edge effect, layering and native plantings 
-- are the very same features that can make a garden beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Diversity means having a wide variety of plants, the different foliage, 
flowers, berries, nuts and seeds of which offer some food to wildlife -- and 
delight to your eye -- throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Layering refers to the height of plants. You want to have variety here too, 
since different species live at different heights -- canopy, understory, shrub 
layer and ground. Look at a beautiful garden: A variety of layers, artfully 
arranged, is a pleasing feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Edges occur where one habitat type, say trees and shrubs, meets another, such 
as meadow or lawn. Many species thrive in edge habitat. This can be lovely in a 
garden too, and achievable even in a small space, by weaving a bed through a 
lawn, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Native plants, adapted to your soil and climate, make the best habitat for 
wildlife. They are also the least fussy, generally speaking, and won't require 
a lot of care. Of course, not all plants in your garden must be native. Many 
expatriates, wisely chosen and carefully placed, can do just as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Landscaping experts recommend that you approach landscaping for wildlife in 
these four steps: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Outline your needs -- patio, sandbox, play lawn, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Inventory your existing conditions, including mapping your property, 
showing built and paved space and vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Evaluate your conditions in light of their current and potential 
effectiveness as habitat for wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Design a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 This can be fun to do, especially the mapping part. However, if it strikes you 
as too organized an approach to gardening, tackle landscaping for wildlife in 
your own way. 
</P>
<P>
 Lie on the lawn and think like a bird. Buy a book. Hire an expert. 
</P>
<P>
 Or just keep wildlife in mind as you go about your gardening. That can make a 
significant difference in how habitable your garden becomes.

 Lighting is taken very seriously in Italy, where manufacturers are constantly 
working to satisfy the creative and functional needs of consumers.Some offer 
the latest in technology and materials; others elevate lamps to works of art.

<P>
 "I am fascinated by pictures of explosions, especially seen in slow motion," 
says German-born Ingo Maurer, known for his sculptural lighting designs. "And I 
wanted to challenge today's chandelier mania -- conservative and humorless." 
</P>
<P>
 Maurer's riveting new chandelier "Porca Miseria" resembles a colossal clump of 
fine porcelain dinnerware exploding in midair. (The chandelier is available 
only by custom order from Maurer in Munich for about $28,000.) 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some other intriguing lighting designs introduced recently at Milan's 
Euroluce international trade show: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Gilda," by Artemide, is a table or bedside lamp with a moving sphere on top 
that adjusts for different levels and tints. It comes in 12 color combinations. 
("Gilda" is available in American stores for about $109.) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Luminator," by A & P.G. Castiglioni for Flos, is a reissue of a 1954 floor 
lamp made of stove enamel steel and painted metal tripod legs. It provides 
indirect light. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Jooge," designed by Berto Pandolfo for Arteluce, is a series of 
weatherproof outdoor lights that give diffused or shaded light. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Rosy Angelis," by French designer Philippe Starck for Flos, is a floor lamp 
with a carbon-fiber tripod base and a lampshade of a lightweight fabric. It 
will be available in U.S. stores in 1995.

VARIETY, BLOOMING TIME KEY TO GROWING FLOWERS FOR CUTTING; GARDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIENNE COOK, TIMES-POST NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cut-flower garden combines the ornamental richness of perennials with the 
productivity of annuals. Indeed, no other blend more satisfactorily delivers 
cottage-garden charm without the time and commitment required for a cutting 
garden of perennials alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The cut-flower garden is grown, simply, to provide a wide array of flowers for 
indoor bouquets. Traditionally, it was planted as part of the "working" garden, 
the site that served as the primary source of food and medicine for 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the tradition of cut-flower beds as part of the back-yard garden 
continues in many parts of the world, especially Europe. In American gardens, 
it is still somewhat rare. But there is a demand for cut flowers: Witness the 
success of market gardeners and farmers who sell them at farmers' markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Flowers for cutting are grown in the same enriched garden soil that suits 
hard-working vegetable varieties: plenty of organic matter, a neutral pH 
ranging from 6.5 to 7.5, good drainage and a tilled or dug depth of six to 
eight inches. 
</P>
<P>
 A boost of organic fertilizer before seeds are sown or seedlings planted is 
always a good idea. The cut-flower garden, like the vegetable garden, will 
require periodic applications of the same fertilizer, when plants are 2 to 3 
weeks old, again one month later and later as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many prefer organic fertilizers because they don't cause excessive foliage 
growth at the expense of flower production. A formula containing nitrogen, 
phosphorus and potassium (N-P-K) within a couple of numbers of each other 
(5-4-2 or 8-6-4, for example) is good. And there is a wonderful forgiving 
quality about organic fertilizers: The concentrations don't have to be precise. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut-flower gardens are less flexible when it comes to sunlight. The sunnier 
the better. This doesn't mean you have to give over the choicest sunny spot in 
the garden to them -- many blooms will fit into a small area, say, four feet 
square. Also, they can be planted within or around the vegetable garden or in 
an existing border. 
</P>
<P>
 The flowers themselves can be a combination of annuals and perennials or all 
annuals. The goal is to have a variety of flowers blooming at all times. It can 
take years of trial and error and of effort and patience to achieve this in a 
perennial garden; but with annuals, which bloom continuously all summer, 
getting a good selection for indoor bouquets is nearly instantaneous, once 
plants are established. 
</P>
<P>
 In selecting flowers, consider what you want, whether it is ease of care, 
height, scent, color or flower form. The availability of plants in garden 
centers also will influence what will go into the cut-flower garden, although 
many excellent annuals can be sown from seed. 
</P>
<P>
 Plants that grow tall are more versatile as cut flowers than dwarf or 
miniature varieties. Flower stems on tall varieties are generally longer than 
on small ones, and the foliage itself can contribute to dramatic arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 In this regard, cosmos stands out as one of the most desirable and useful of 
the cutting flowers. Easily grown from seed, this rugged annual belies the 
delicacy of its bloom and foliage. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosmos comes in a range of colors and even styles. There are two distinct 
strains, one producing sunny yellow, gold and orange ruffled blooms and the 
other sporting fragile-looking daisy-faced blossoms in shades of deep red, 
pink, purple, lilac and white. Today's varieties include scalloped, ruffled, 
single and double flowers. All make stunning cut flowers, either alone or in 
combination with others. Depending on the variety, cosmos ranges in height from 
two to five feet, and the taller -- and most commonly available -- ones will 
need support, either against a wall or trellis or with caging. 
</P>
<P>
 For scent, nicotiana is a good choice. This aromatic member of the tobacco 
family produces a profusion of slightly trumpeted, open-faced blooms, varieties 
ranging in color from deep red to white, with pinks in between. There is a 
dwarf version, which gets up to about two feet tall; the traditional form grows 
to three or sometimes four feet. Other scented annuals that lend themselves to 
cutting include stock, sweet peas and nasturtium. 
</P>
<P>
 For sheer endurance, one of the most reliable annuals is the zinnia. For some 
reason there seem to be fewer choices of this trusty variety than there once 
were. Cut and Come Again is perhaps the most durable of the zinnias, yielding 
an abundance of brilliant, multicolored blooms between two and three inches 
across, borne atop stiff stems. Their name reflects reality -- the more you cut 
them, the more they'll bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, this rule applies to all annual flowers. The cut-flower garden is 
primarily a harvesting garden, handled the same way as tomatoes or 
strawberries. If flowers are left to mature into seed pods, plants will tend to 
stop blooming. In addition, most the annuals withstand and even benefit from 
severe pruning of the sort that accompanies harvesting for bouquets -- foliage 
and all.

BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE COULD BE AS CLOSE AS A COMPUTER SCREEN; TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You've chosen the Lawson over the Chesterfield, but the fabric is still up in 
the air. Should it be green plaid, solid red or green-and-red floral? And would 
the sofa look better with a tailored skirt or with the legs exposed? 
</P>
<P>
 Such questions are enough to turn some potential furniture buyers into 
procrastinators. To help these skittish customers make up their minds, 
retailers are turning to computerized video catalogues. Thus, a customer may 
sit in front of a PC and watch as a variety of furniture styles "try on" 
several fabrics electronically. Color printouts can make visualizing even 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
 These video catalogues have been available for about five years on a limited 
basis but are becoming more widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost all the major manufacturers are aligned with a system, and the number 
of stores with video catalogues is probably 10 times what it was last year," 
says John Case, vice president of marketing for La-Z-Boy Furniture Co. in 
Monroe, Mich. "Retailers who have the system feel it shortens the 
decision-making process." 
</P>
<P>
 Floor space limits retailers to only a sampling of what's available from a 
manufacturer, but video catalogues allow them to show it all. La-Z-Boy 
estimates that about one in five of its dealers will have a video catalogue by 
the end of this year. (In Orange County, the La-Z-Boy stores in Lake Forest, 
Costa Mesa and Anaheim all use the video catalogues.) By typing in a code 
number, the customer can see any of some 1,400 fabric options to try on various 
frame styles. 
</P>
<P>
 The La-Z-Boy video catalogue, one of 35 developed by Intellitek of Omaha, 
operates on a satellite-based communications network that regularly updates 
fabric and frame information. The computer also figures out how much fabric is 
required, the approximate delivery date and the total price. Retailers 
generally opt for three manufacturers' catalogues from Intellitek for about 
$450 a month. Additional catalogues are available for about $50 each. 
</P>
<P>
 "Video catalogues enhance the shopping experience with furniture, draperies 
and rugs," says Jerry Schneider, president of Intellitek. "These are all areas 
in which customers have to visualize something that hasn't been built yet and 
where figuring out the price is complicated because there are a number of 
variables." 
</P>
<P>
 Norwalk Furniture Corp., a Norwalk, Ohio, company that makes upholstered 
furniture, has had a computerized video catalogue for nearly five years. It is 
in 108 company-owned and independent furniture stores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Gerken, vice president of marketing services, says Norwalk's database 
includes more than 500 frames and 2,000 upholstery fabrics. Multiple images can 
be displayed for comparison, and a "zoom" feature offers a close-up look at 
details. If a fabric is unsuitable for a specific use, the computer will say 
so. In addition, a menu lists complementary fabrics for accent pillows and 
trims. 
</P>
<P>
 The Norwalk Computerized Catalog System is produced by ModaCAD, a 
computer-aided design system developed in Los Angeles. ModaCAD also designs and 
markets systems for use in the textile, apparel, industrial design and 
entertainment industries. 
</P>
<P>
 ModaCAD recently put the fabric collection of Boussac of France on video for a 
presentation to interior designers at Boussac's New York showroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Although known for their ability to visualize how a fabric and frame will look 
together, the designers appreciated the computer aid, according to Eileen 
Samet, communications director of Boussac. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't totally take the place of the real fabric," Samet says. "But it 
was captivating to watch as a fabric design was draped over a sofa or 
materialized before your eyes on the wall of a room setting." 
</P>
<P>
 Video fabric draping has been limited mostly to catalogues. But the weekly 
syndicated TV show "Haven," sponsored by the Home Furnishings Council, an 
industry trade group, is doing electronic make-overs using the Intellitek 
system ("Haven" airs locally on Channel 42). 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done about four of these electronic make-overs so far," Schneider 
says. "A room setting taken from our database that includes the catalogues of 
31 manufacturers is flashed on the screen. Then, the color and pattern are 
changed in several different ways right on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next season, we plan to do the make-overs by remote control. We'll be in the 
studio in New York, and the video make-overs can be taking place in a store in 
Arizona or anywhere else."

SILK FLOWERS PRESERVE HISTORY IN OLDER HOUSES; DECORATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENE STONESIFER, TIMES-POST NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fresh-flower arrangements that once adorned historic properties across the 
country have all but disappeared for reasons of authenticity and practicality. 
</P>
<P>
 In their place, bouquets of silk flowers are brightening the carefully 
preserved interiors and adding a historical grace note to the houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of historic houses say the change has been prompted by 
problems with insects on the live arrangements, petal and pollen droppings that 
can damage antique finishes and a concern that live flowers were not being 
chosen with an eye to historical accuracy. In some cases, dried-flower 
arrangements have been replaced with silk varieties. Woodlawn Plantation in 
Alexandria, Va., is the most recent historic house to join this trend. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Trust for Historic Preservation, which oversees 17 historic-house 
museums nationwide, has been advising against the use of fresh flowers for two 
years, said Barbara Martin, senior curator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flowers and their pollens are acidic," Martin said. "They can damage 
furniture finishes. If put into period vases, they can corrode the inside. 
Sometimes, people can get a little overzealous in watering them, and you can 
end up with water damage on the furniture. You just need to exercise some care 
when using flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 If the property director and curators decide to have flowers, they are asked 
to weigh the risks and benefits carefully, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Woodlawn Plantation, a brick Georgian mansion built in 1800 for Nelly 
Custis, George Washington's adopted daughter, dried floral arrangements have 
been replaced in recent weeks by silk bouquets done up in historically 
documented 18th-Century style. 
</P>
<P>
 The flowers for the arrangements at Woodlawn, like those being added to most 
historic houses, have been carefully researched and commissioned.  
</P>
<P>
 "Those featured were documented in some way, either from a period source or a 
sight reference such as a diary or a letter," said Woodlawn curator Heather 
Palmer.

INCREASED SECURITY IS JUST A DEADBOLT AWAY; SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Installing a deadbolt lock, or deadbolt -- a solid steel bolt that operates 
independently from a doorknob -- adds an extra measure of security to a home. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning carpenters usually can install a deadbolt on a wooden door; moderate 
to expert skills are needed if the door is steel. 
</P>
<P>
 Buy a deadbolt lock with a bolt that will extend an inch or more from the 
door's edge into the door frame. Deadbolts have one or two lock cylinders; a 
two-cylinder model requires unlocking with a key on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 In a door with glass panels it prevents a burglar from reaching through a 
broken pane to unlock the door. But because it hinders quick emergency exits, 
some local codes prohibit its use. 
</P>
<P>
 Deadbolt lock kits come with all the parts needed. Included is a paper or 
cardboard pattern called a template, which serves as a guide for drilling the 
required holes in the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Follow the instructions that come with the kit. In most cases, start by 
attaching the template to the edge of the door at least six inches above the 
doorknob, then prick the template with an awl or nail to mark the holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, use an electric drill with a hole-saw attachment to bore a large hole 
through the door for the cylinder assembly, which passes from one side of the 
door to the other. A hole saw resembles a metal cup with a serrated rim. 
</P>
<P>
 To use, drill a pilot hole through the door with an ordinary 
one-eighth-inch-diameter drill bit. Then drill halfway through the door with 
the hole saw; withdraw the tool and finish drilling from the other side. This 
technique prevents splintering. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedge the door open and drill a smaller hole into the edge for the bolt, using 
a flat spade bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Both holes in the door must be precisely horizontal, and the hole in the edge 
must meet the larger hole at a right angle. The best way to ensure accurate 
drilling is to use a drilling guide, available at hardware stores. The guide 
attaches to the drill and holds the tool against the work at any desired angle. 
</P>
<P>
 Slide the bolt and attached mounting plate into the hole in the door's edge 
and trace around the plate with a sharp pencil. Remove the bolt and carefully 
chisel away a thin layer of wood from inside the marked lines so the plate will 
lie flush with the surface. Then reinsert the bolt and fasten it to the door 
with the screws supplied. 
</P>
<P>
 Install the cylinder assembly by fitting each half against the opposite sides 
of the larger hole. The pieces meet in the center and capture the inserted end 
of the bolt. Long screws fasten the assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Retract the bolt, dab the end with lipstick or chalk, then close the door and 
turn the lock so the bolt leaves a mark on the door frame. Drill a hole for the 
bolt into the frame, centered on the mark. Place the metal strike plate 
supplied with the kit around the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Trace the plate's outline, then chisel wood from the frame to fit the plate as 
you did installing the bolt. 
</P>
<P>
 For greater protection against break-ins, install a metal strike box instead 
of a strike plate. A strike box fits into the bolt hole, strengthening the door 
frame. Minor chiseling usually is required to enlarge the bolt hole so the box 
will fit. When mounting a strike plate or a strike box, use three-inch-long 
screws.

AN IDEA HATCHED IN FRUSTRATION: STREAM OF WATER DISPELS FLOCK OF PIGEONS; 
WILDLIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES E. WALTERS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people love pigeons, as demonstrated by their feeding tidbits to them in 
public places. 
</P>
<P>
 Other people consider pigeons the most obnoxious and unsanitary of all birds. 
</P>
<P>
 For those in the second group, control has been discouraging. But now comes 
discovery of something that really sends them flying -- a sudden stream of 
water from a hose. Pigeons can't stand the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery was accidental, borne from frustration over a noisy flock 
congregating above an oleander hedge and raiding the cat's bowl of food. 
Surely, the same idea must have occurred to others over the long course of 
civilization.  
</P>
<P>
 But I'd never heard of it. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, for the possible benefit of mankind and without a single regret for 
the feelings of pigeon lovers, here's the technique: 
</P>
<P>
 Attach a nozzle to your hose that will produce a sharp spray reaching 15-20 
feet into the air. When pigeons (there never seems to be only one) roost on a 
tree or utility wire, give them a blast. 
</P>
<P>
 They fly away in panic. 
</P>
<P>
 Something approaching them suddenly probably startles them. However, I like to 
think they are just antagonistic to the cleansing potential of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, being pigeons, they come back. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it becomes a test of wills -- and your ability to cram into their 
birdbrain that they are not wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 If you spray them again, and perhaps another time, they often will depart for 
hours. This is helpful since few folks, no matter how aggravated, have the time 
to stand outside firing frequent blasts of water at pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, my flock is so well trained that it will fly away if I even walk into 
the area without picking up the hose. This needs daily reinforcing. And there's 
no guarantee on how long this might work for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Some years ago, the University of Arizona's John L. Stair compiled a paper 
titled "Feral Pigeon Control." The control possibilities were pretty 
discouraging . 
</P>
<P>
 A "feral pigeon" was described as a domestic pigeon that has returned to wild 
status and, unless banded, does not belong to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Pigeons, said Stair, "account for the spread of 57 known diseases and 
parasites . . . and their droppings create an unsanitary situation around 
homes, picnic areas and buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 He said they transmit such human diseases as salmonellosis, histoplasmosis, 
trichomoniasis, meningitis and the Schistosomiasis trematode and give Newcastle 
disease to domestic animals, especially chickens and turkeys. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no question their droppings create a mess,

SHOOTING SUSPECT HAS ADVOCATED CLINIC VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As he stood vigil outside a Wichita, Kan., courtroom this spring in support of 
a fellow anti-abortion extremist on trial for shooting an abortion doctor, Paul 
Hill explained that he believed he had been called by God to pray for those who 
commit violence, but did not believe that God wanted him to shoot doctors 
himself.  
</P>
<P>
 As the leader of his tiny, self-styled group, Defensive Action, he has 
traveled the country over the past year encouraging anti-abortion violence, 
telling fundamentalist church groups that murdering abortion providers was 
tantamount to "justifiable homicide." He even appeared on "Donahue" endorsing 
last year's killing of Pensacola, Fla., abortion physician Dr. David Gunn.  
</P>
<P>
 "We all have different callings, and my calling is to minister" to those who 
kill doctors, Hill, 40, said in an interview in March. "It's largely a matter 
of calling. I've taken up the weapon I'm most comfortable with. I've taken up 
the weapon of the spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, after Hill was arrested and charged with the shotgun slayings 
of a Pensacola abortion doctor and his male escort and the wounding of a woman, 
it appeared that Hill had finally begun to practice what he preached. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's brutal murders mark the first time that a leader of a militant 
anti-abortion group has been charged with an abortion-related killing. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the case will almost certainly make it far more difficult for 
anti-abortion leaders to dismiss such crimes as isolated incidents, as they 
have with earlier shootings. And it could intensify scrutiny of the militant 
subculture of the anti-abortion movement by federal investigators. 
Congressional leaders on Friday urged the Clinton Administration and the FBI to 
mount a major undercover investigation of anti-abortion groups to prevent 
further violence. On Friday, the FBI joined the investigation into the 
Pensacola murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal government has the tools and the resources to deal with such 
reprehensible terrorist attacks and the organizations responsible for 
perpetrating the attacks," said Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), the sponsor 
of legislation just signed into law by President Clinton that makes it a 
federal crime to commit acts of violence against abortion providers and 
clinics. "The FBI must begin to infiltrate anti-abortion groups that advocate 
the use of violence, and the members of these groups who conspire to commit 
violent acts should be prosecuted," Schumer said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hill's arrest could put dozens of leaders of anti-abortion groups on the spot, 
since many of them have signed petitions circulated in recent months by Hill 
endorsing acts of murder.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an isolated incident, and it was not committed by an isolated 
nut," Eleanor Smeal, president of The Fund for the Feminist Majority, charged 
at a Washington news conference Friday. "Paul Hill is a leader of a group 
advocating what he calls 'justifiable homicide,' and many people in this 
movement have signed his petitions." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past year, Hill has become a well-known figure in the radical fringe 
of the anti-abortion movement, and has increasingly drawn the attention of 
abortion-rights advocacy groups and of local law enforcement officials in 
Florida for his inflammatory public statements. Officials of abortion-rights 
groups said they have been told that state law enforcement officials have 
periodically had Hill under surveillance in recent months, but the Florida 
Department of Law Enforcement refused to comment Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Hill first gained public attention following the shooting death in March, 
1993, of Gunn in Pensacola; he created Defensive Action largely to provide 
support for Michael Griffin, an anti-abortion protester who was convicted in 
Gunn's murder earlier this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Hill has appeared on several television and radio talk shows to 
debate the morality of violence against doctors and abortion clinics. He also 
developed close ties to other radicals who have formed anti-abortion splinter 
groups around the country. Hill and other extremists argue that abortion 
doctors are guilty of murdering unborn babies, and thus killing an abortion 
doctor is a justifiable way of preventing such killing.  
</P>
<P>
 Those groups, including Defensive Action, have broken off from the mainstream 
of the anti-abortion movement out of frustration with the refusal of groups 
such as the National Right to Life and Operation Rescue to endorse the bombing 
of abortion clinics and violence against doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Rescue, in particular, has been riven with internal division over 
the issue of whether to endorse violence. While founder Randall Terry and other 
leaders publicly call doctors "child killers" and the organization now targets 
doctors and their families for protest and harassment, Operation Rescue has not 
endorsed the violence when it occurs. Abortion-rights advocates charge that the 
group tacitly supports the violence, while the more extreme anti-abortion 
leaders have formed their own groups and charge that Operation Rescue has lost 
its way.  
</P>
<P>
 Hill has been in the forefront of that splinter movement, and has close ties 
to other leaders. He has often written for a publication published by another 
extremist group, Advocates for Life, which also endorses targeting doctors. In 
addition, Hill writes his own Defensive Action newsletter, which he has used to 
generate support throughout the anti-abortion underground, pleading with 
supporters for cash to support his travels while calling for help in militant 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who has most recently been "self-employed" doing automotive restoration 
in Pensacola, describes himself as a former Presbyterian minister who was 
excommunicated in 1993 for his support for Griffin's murder of Gunn. He has 
said that he received a master's of divinity degree in 1983 and later worked as 
a Presbyterian minister in the Pensacola area from 1984 to 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 He was clearly bitter over the way he was treated by his church, however, and 
appeared to become increasingly isolated even within the fundamentalist 
Christian church network that provides most of the foot soldiers in the 
anti-abortion movement. In July, 1993, he wrote in the Advocates for Life 
newsletter that the effects of his excommunication was like being "treated like 
a non-Christian visitor" to his own church. "I am not allowed to take the 
Lord's supper," he lamented.  
</P>
<P>
 But his religious isolation only drove him further to the fringe. On his own, 
he published a 16-page tract last year called "Was the Killing of Dr. Gunn 
Just?" which argued that Gunn's murder was righteous retribution for abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 In their publications, Hill and other militants often target individual 
doctors by name, and doctors in the Pensacola area had been high on those 
lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John Bayard Britton, 69, who was killed Friday with a shotgun blast to the 
head, had been the target of a heavy harassment campaign from anti-abortion 
protesters; he was a close colleague of David Gunn, who was murdered at another 
Pensacola clinic, and the facility where Britton was gunned down Friday had 
been bombed in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Britton was wearing a bulletproof vest because of repeated threats. 
He was so fearful for his life that he had an escort driving him; that escort, 
74-year-old abortion-rights advocate James Barrett, was also killed, and his 
wife, June, 68, was wounded.

COLUMN ONE; QUEBEC'S FREEDOM FIGHTER; IN LUCIEN BOUCHARD, SEPARATISTS MAY HAVE 
FOUND THEIR THOMAS JEFFERSON, A LEADER WHO COULD GAIN INDEPENDENCE FOR THE 
CANADIAN PROVINCE. BUT CRITICS CALL HIM AN OPPORTUNIST AND TURNCOAT.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an oak-paneled parliamentary office once occupied by the country's World 
War II prime minister, surrounded by a well-thumbed library and photos of his 
family, Lucien Bouchard plots the dismemberment of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 It is all very democratic, if sometimes a trifle impolite. Bouchard arrived 
here in November with the anomalous title of Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition, earned by the startling electoral success of the Quebec separatist 
party that he founded, the Bloc Quebecois. He intends to leave, perhaps as 
early as next year, as a citizen of the new nation of Quebec, a fact he reminds 
Canadians of almost every day.  
</P>
<P>
 And people here listen, intently, for in Bouchard, Quebec may have found its 
Thomas Jefferson -- or Canada its Jefferson Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard, 56, is the most compelling presence in Canadian politics today -- 
and perhaps since the flowering of Pierre Elliott Trudeau (to whom he is 
diametrically opposed, politically). Charismatic, passionate, eloquent, 
possessed of a thoughtful intensity and married to a French-American wife who 
grew up in Orange County, Bouchard is by every measure the most popular 
politician in Quebec.  
</P>
<P>
 While Quebec independence is far from assured, the prospect of an acrimonious 
breakup of America's northern neighbor and largest economic partner has 
unnerved financial markets and pushed aside almost everything else on the 
Canadian national agenda, and Bouchard is largely responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard portrays himself as a sort of Quebecois Everyman, whose political 
journey mirrors the centuries-old struggle of his predominantly French-speaking 
province to come to terms with its place in North America. His story, he says, 
is one of "an unfinished country." 
</P>
<P>
 The next few months will show whether Bouchard and his colleagues can complete 
the task. A Quebec provincial election is scheduled for Sept. 12. If the Parti 
Quebecois, Bouchard's separatist ally in the province, wins, a provincial 
referendum on independence is promised within 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 History, and the polls, seem to stand against the separatists. But Bouchard, 
with typical self-confidence, believes that actually works in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my hypotheses is they don't take Quebec seriously," he says of his 
opposition. "They think that Quebeckers at the last moment . . . will shy away. 
And until now, they've been right. . . . I'm in the business of proving that 
they are wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard is seen in the province as that rare politician who has staked 
everything -- career, fortune, honor -- on a single ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lucien is not a political animal. I see him as a type of missionary," says 
Jean Lapierre, a Montreal lawyer who served in Parliament with Bouchard and now 
hosts a radio talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 Others denounce Bouchard as an opportunist, a hypocrite and a turncoat. His 
onetime best friends, who brought him into politics and helped raise him to 
prominence, believe he betrayed them and Canada in a most calculated fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything to do with Bouchard, you have to read the fine print twice," says 
Jean Charest, a member of Parliament from Sherbrooke, Quebec, and leader of the 
Progressive Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "People (in English-speaking Canada) don't much like what they're hearing from 
Bouchard, but he has served the role of lightning rod. . . . He has forced out 
the agenda (of Quebec)," says Philip Resnick, a University of British Columbia 
professor and expert on Quebec-Canada relations.  
</P>
<P>
 For a period this spring, Canada was obsessed with Lucien Bouchard. 
</P>
<P>
 In Parliament, he jabbed questions at Prime Minister Jean Chretien while 
Chretien pretended that no one wanted to hear about Quebec independence. 
Bouchard's public appearances in Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary, ostensibly to 
promote his autobiography, sparked a cross-country debate on Quebec 
sovereignty. Lobbying trips to Washington and Paris sent commentators and a 
couple of Western provincial premiers into a rage. 
</P>
<P>
 After his return from Paris, Parliament spent nearly a full day in an 
emotional and rancorous debate on "national unity." One Liberal Party 
Parliament member suggested that, in most other countries, a dissident like 
Bouchard would be in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard has come to embody the conviction of Quebec separatists -- or 
sovereigntists as they prefer to be called -- that the best way to preserve the 
last island of French language and culture in North America is through 
independence. The often-troubled relationship of what novelist Hugh MacLennan 
dubbed Canada's "two solitudes" -- one English-speaking and one French-speaking 
-- last erupted with the failures of the Meech Lake Accord in 1990 and the 
Charlottetown Agreement in 1992. These proposed constitutional revisions had 
intended to codify special status for Quebec in the Canadian federation. 
</P>
<P>
 A clash over the Meech Lake Accord caused Bouchard to bolt the Progressive 
Conservative Party and resign from the Cabinet of then-Prime Minister Brian 
Mulroney, his longtime friend and political mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard came back as an independantiste and brought 54 members of the Bloc 
Quebecois to Parliament with him. Now, Bouchard sees his mission as preparing 
the rest of Canada for the break he believes will follow a referendum in 
Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in flawless, double-breasted suits, brushing aside the comma of hair 
that persistently drops to his eyebrow, Bouchard goes about his work with 
deceptive calm. Today, there are few visible signs in public of the dreaded 
temper recalled by longtime Bouchard watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask if he considers himself a revolutionary, and those eyebrows rise just a 
bit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a very moderate man," he says. "I came very late to politics and to 
speaking out about my political beliefs. I practiced law as an Establishment 
lawyer for 21 years, and no, I'm not a revolutionary." 
</P>
<P>
 Even among those who have known him for years, he remains elusive -- a 
disciplined, introverted intellectual. Much is made here of the fact that he 
has twice read all seven volumes of Marcel Proust's "Remembrance of Things 
Past." He drops into conversation anecdotes about Cincinnatus, the savior of 
the Roman Republic, and Chateaubriand, the early 19th-Century French writer and 
statesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Meighen, a university classmate and now a member of Canada's Senate, 
conjures up a quintessential Canadian image to explain Bouchard's elusiveness: 
"He paddles his own canoe." 
</P>
<P>
 Those close to Bouchard say he saves his gregariousness for family and 
friends, and that it's wrong to see him as a loner. Bouchard himself is not 
much given to self-examination in public. His 282-page autobiography is a 
detail-filled recitation of his public life and his private thoughts on public 
policy, but it reveals little of the inner man.  
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, he is relaxed and direct, but the fence that he has erected 
between the public figure and the private man drops only a couple of times. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is when he talks about his father, who delivered construction 
materials, first by horse-drawn wagon, then by truck, in the logging region 
near the Saguenay River in central Quebec, where Bouchard was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned from my father that life is not easy," he says. "You have to win 
everything. You have to win it correctly, the right way. You have to work hard. 
And I have a sense that you must fight to stay alive, and if you want to rise 
above average, you have to fight hardest." 
</P>
<P>
 The second is his reflection on the seminal event in his political life: his 
May, 1990, resignation from Mulroney's government. Today, those on both sides 
of the argument can't even agree on the events leading up to his resignation, 
much less on his motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 He declares it was a matter of conscience, that Quebec's interests had been 
sold out in a compromise on the Meech Lake Accord. Others in the Mulroney 
government believe Bouchard acted with selfish deliberation -- "a staged 
stunt," one put it -- and helped torpedo a historic opportunity for national 
reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The break sundered more than political ties. Mulroney and Bouchard had been 
close friends for nearly 30 years, since meeting as Laval University law 
students. Now they refuse to speak to each other. Mulroney, battered by the 
Meech Lake and Charlottetown defeats and pushed into political retirement, 
declines all interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 The friendship with Mulroney, was "close, very close, probably too close to be 
in a government together," Bouchard says. "I wish our friendship had endured, 
but I felt, and I still feel, that it was a situation where I had to make a 
choice. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It's been like a divorce, you know, with some (friends) staying with me, 
others staying with him, others trying to be in both camps and having a rough 
time of it. . . . The complicity of old friends cannot be re-created easily at 
age 50. I have met good people, of course, very good people for whom I have 
much respect and with whom I share a common vision of what the future should 
be. But I don't have many private relationships with new friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "But my life has changed too. I have a family now. I never had any children 
before, and I have a new marriage. . . . So I take care of my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard declines to involve his family in much of his political life, which 
is just fine with his wife, Audrey. When Parliament sits, she and sons 
Alexandre, 4, and Simon, 3, stay at home in Montreal while Bouchard spends the 
nights from Monday through Thursday at a Holiday Inn in Hull, the Quebec city 
just across the river from the Canadian capital of Ottawa, Ontario. He calls 
home "at least four or five times a day," says Audrey Bouchard, who describes 
him as "the mushiest father I've ever seen," incapable of disciplining his 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics . . . doesn't play a big role in my life. . . ," she said. "I try to 
go with him (to political events) when I can, especially if it's the weekend, 
because otherwise I wouldn't see him. But I'm not a very political wife. . . . 
You know, when this is over, when he leaves politics, I will be just as happy, 
if not more so." 
</P>
<P>
 The fluently bilingual daughter of a French mother and a retired U.S. Navy 
commander, Audrey Best Bouchard, 33, was born on the French Riviera and grew up 
in Los Alamitos, Calif. She met her future husband on a flight between Paris 
and London in 1987. He was Canada's ambassador to Paris, and she was moving 
from Orange County to live with her Parisian grandmother and study French. It 
is the second marriage for both. 
</P>
<P>
 Audrey Bouchard does not hold Canadian citizenship, and thus can't vote for 
her husband. Breezily independent, she displays the same sort of pragmatism 
about the day-to-day demands of political life as does her husband. Neither 
professes to lose much sleep over the controversy he stirs up -- although there 
is a Royal Canadian Mounted Police bodyguard assigned to him -- and both 
decline to speculate publicly on his political future beyond a Quebec 
sovereignty referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucien Bouchard grew up far from Montreal in a region where, for 100 years or 
more, French-speaking Canadians felled trees and cut logs for absentee, 
English-speaking mill owners. He is part of a breakthrough generation of 
French-Canadians who transformed Quebec from a rural society -- dominated by 
the Roman Catholic Church and an English-speaking elite -- into a modern 
industrial state where French has become the prevailing language in fact and in 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Educated at Catholic schools, Bouchard became the first in his family to 
attend a university. His classmates at Laval University in Quebec City included 
an extraordinary sampling of Canada's future political leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was obviously one of the better students, if not the best . . . and I 
suspect there were some of us who drank more beer and chased more girls than 
Lucien," classmate Meighen says. "He has a great laugh and is fun to be with, 
but . . . you know, most people don't spend their nights relaxing with Proust." 
</P>
<P>
 At Laval, Bouchard developed a friendship with an exuberant Quebecker named 
Brian Mulroney. A few years later, when both men were lawyers, Mulroney was 
appointed to a special commission to investigate corruption in Quebec's 
construction unions. He selected Bouchard as chief counsel. The commission's 
findings were sensational, and Mulroney was launched on the political career 
that in 1984 made him prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 He took Bouchard along with him, first as speech writer and adviser, then as 
ambassador to Paris, and finally as a member of Parliament and a Cabinet 
minister. It was an extraordinary rise and led to complaints of cronyism. Then 
came the break. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard's political permutations -- he has been, successively, a Trudeau 
Liberal, a Quebec separatist, a Mulroney Conservative, then a separatist again 
-- are cited as evidence of his opportunism. But the case also can be made that 
he is the perfect reflection of Quebeckers' ambivalence about their future -- 
the tug of war over whether the French language and Quebec's unique culture can 
be best preserved within Canada or in a bold strike for independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard says his first romance with separatism ended with the 1980 defeat, by 
a margin of 60% to 40%, of Quebec's first and so far only referendum on 
independence. It revived when the Meech Lake disillusionment dashed hopes of 
future reconciliation with the rest of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Marc Leger, a leading Quebec pollster, attributes Bouchard's popularity 
to his "down home" background and his appeal to high principle. Or as talk show 
host Lapierre, an admitted cynic, puts it, "It takes two things to succeed in 
Quebec politics: an image of competence and a sense of indignation. He's got a 
150% mark on indignation." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Bouchard's speeches on Quebec "honor" and his lamentations of the 
"humiliations" heaped on his province cause his critics' eyes to roll. 
</P>
<P>
 How can Quebec be so oppressed when three of Canada's last five prime 
ministers -- Trudeau, Mulroney and Chretien -- came from the province, they 
ask. And how about the fact that Quebec receives more in federal government 
payouts than it contributes in taxes? 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideologues have a tremendous capacity to adjust reality to their ideology, 
and he will do that consistently," Charest says. 
</P>
<P>
 To Bouchard, none of this changes his fundamental point. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing is, Quebeckers feel quite different from the rest of Canada," 
he says. "They have a sense that they are a people by themselves and they would 
be much better off if they could make their own decisions when it comes to 
collective affairs. . . . It would be an open state, a modern state with 
economic exchange with as many partners as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard even talks of an independent Quebec continuing to use Canadian 
currency -- at least for a limited period -- perhaps relying on the Canadian 
military for national defense and leaping directly into the North American Free 
Trade Agreement as a new equal partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Such sentiments strike others as naive, or duplicitously aimed at reassuring 
nervous Quebeckers that independence would be an easy path. No one can predict 
how the rest of Canada would react to a referendum vote in Quebec calling for 
independence, but a growing number of voices suggest the response would not be 
amicable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't think French Canadians -- and Lucien is typical in this 
instance -- know the rest of Canada," says Meighen. "He doesn't appreciate the 
disappointment and inevitable anger that I and most English Canadians would 
feel if Quebec voted to separate. This is my country too and I have something 
to say about its future." 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard -- who says, "I know a lot more about English Canadians than most 
English Canadians know of Quebec" -- acknowledges a separatist vote would 
provoke "strong emotions," but he refuses to entertain the thought that Canada 
would do anything other than accept a democratic ballot and let Quebec go. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the road to a referendum must be paved with a victory by the 
Parti Quebecois, led not by Bouchard but by the decidedly less popular Jacques 
Parizeau, 63. As Parti Quebecois candidate for premier, Parizeau will be 
campaigning on television every night, while Bouchard works the small towns and 
back roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "I compare it to a police motorcycle. Parizeau is driving, and Lucien is in 
the sidecar," Lapierre says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard publicly professes enthusiasm for this role as Parizeau's helpmate, 
but he can't suppress a smile when reminded of their relative popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of Parizeau's personal standing, voter surveys consistently show 
the Parti Quebecois comfortably leading the governing Liberal Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want change, and the only other party (on the ballot) is the PQ," 
pollster Leger says. 
</P>
<P>
 Those polls, however, show much more uncertainty among Quebeckers toward 
independence. Some suggest Bouchard has stiffened the opposition with his 
sovereigntist roadshow.  
</P>
<P>
 Even Bouchard's youngest brother, Gerard, 51, a professor at the University of 
Quebec in Chicoutimi, has doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not look like a society on the verge of declaring sovereignty," he 
says. "Are we going to threaten this lifestyle for a political idea that may be 
desirable but not necessary?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Lucien Bouchard remains optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure a referendum will be won," he said. "But I know that the 
objective conditions are in place now for a victory of the sovereigntists. The 
rest will be for us. If we do our work properly . . . then we have a fair 
chance to win."

FIRE SUSPECTS WILL NOT BE CHARGED, D.A.'S OFFICE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County district attorney's office said Friday it does not have 
enough evidence to prosecute two firefighters named last fall as suspects in 
one of the worst wildfires in Southern California history. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement at a Friday afternoon news conference came several weeks 
after lawyers for the two suspects -- Steven R. Shelp and Nicholas A. Durepo -- 
called on prosecutors to either charge their clients or publicly exonerate 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelp, 29, and Durepo, 24, were not arrested, and both have steadfastly 
maintained their innocence. Both were taken off active firefighting duty after 
Sheriff Sherman Block publicly said he believed that two firefighters started 
the Nov. 2 Calabasas/Malibu fire and authorities later identified Shelp and 
Durepo as those two suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire killed three people and caused $375 million in damage to hundreds of 
homes as it roared through thousands of acres of brush from the San Fernando 
Valley to the Malibu coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a case . . . that at this point in time is complete in terms of the 
investigation," Deputy Dist. Atty. Sally Thomas said during a brief news 
conference. "As in many cases, there are instances where more evidence or 
witnesses come to light and in that particular situation we would re-evaluate 
this case. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two men are presumed to be innocent. They were presumed to be innocent 
during the investigation and nothing has changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, a prosecutor in the special trials division, said in an interview 
after the news conference that the district attorney's office went public with 
its decision not to prosecute because of widespread interest in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that it was important for the community to know what our decision 
was," Thomas said. "There have been hundreds of victims touched by this and . . 
. we have a lot of compassion for the victims. It was a very extensive 
investigation, but arson cases are notoriously difficult to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If any evidence or witnesses should come together in the future, we will 
evaluate the case," Thomas said. "That certainly is not unusual in a murder 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Shelp nor Durepo would comment on the case, but they told close 
friends they were happy and relieved at the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just ecstatic for the guys. We stood behind them all the way. We 
believed in these guys," said Chris Keenan, a firefighter with the El Toro Fire 
Department, who spearheaded an effort among firefighters to support Shelp and 
Durepo. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Friday afternoon discussion, Keenan said Durepo -- a volunteer with the 
Manhattan Beach Fire Department -- was thrilled with the news, but "too 
spooked" to talk. "He and his family have never been through anything like this 
before," Keenan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations against Shelp and Durepo, their lawyers contend, have 
prevented the men from advancing their careers as firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelp has been taken off active firefighting duties and placed on 
administrative duty since the investigation went public. Durepo has been taken 
off active duty as a volunteer fireman in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Fire Department Battalion Chief Roger Gillis said the news was 
"positive" for Shelp but that he will stay on administrative duty with pay 
while the department continues an internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would sure like this thing to come to an end, one way or another. The 
whole department has hoped this guy is innocent, and that firefighters would 
not be involved in something like this," Gillis said. "We put them out, not 
start them. So it's been a stigma for us since the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach fire officials could not be reached for comment late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelp and Durepo had maintained their innocence from the start, saying they 
were driving by the fire's point of origin on Old Topanga Canyon Road about 11 
a.m. when they spotted the first signs of a blaze. They told authorities they 
jumped out of their pickup and hooked up a garden hose that they happened to 
have with them to a nearby fire hydrant, with the help of a plumber who had a 
special adapter in his truck. But they told authorities the fire spread too 
fast, and that they instead concentrated on helping a burn victim who appeared 
at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men stayed at the scene for several hours, and later cooperated with 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, as the case received national attention, the mystery plumber surfaced 
after his photograph was published in The Times. The "plumber," actually a 
swimming pool contractor named Robert Blakeley, said he saw the firefighters 
arrive on the scene after the blaze started. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Block had publicly questioned the existence of such a plumber, and 
said he believed the two suspects started the fire so they could put it out, 
become heroes and get paying jobs with area fire departments. Shelp later 
joined the Los Angeles Fire Department, and Durepo was a volunteer with the 
Manhattan Beach Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Blakeley later helped authorities as a witness in the case, and appeared 
before a grand jury along with Shelp, Durepo and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the district attorney's announcement, sheriff's officials Friday stood 
by their earlier conclusions in the matter. Sheriff's Homicide Capt. Don Brooks 
said: "We still feel that we have the right people. That's why we submitted the 
request for issuance of a complaint." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, the Sheriff's Department said: "As indicated at the outset, 
the evidence presented was circumstantial and the district attorney's office 
had to decide whether or not to file a criminal case. It has been our 
responsibility to do a thorough and professional investigation, which we have 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 One sheriff's official said privately that his department has wanted charges 
to be filed against Shelp and Durepo since late last year, when they first 
presented the case to the district attorney's office. But like others in the 
department, he withheld criticism of prosecutors, saying they were the ones who 
would have to prove the case in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not the guy that has to go in there and prosecute the case," he said. "If 
they have a loser going in, they certainly can't go in there and take their 
chances."

RELIEF EFFORT A HUGE TASK FOR MILITARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The massive humanitarian relief operation that President Clinton has ordered 
for the Central African country of Rwanda is presenting the military with one 
of its most daunting logistic challenges in recent memory, Pentagon officials 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer physical task of moving thousands of tons of desperately needed 
food, medicine and other supplies goes beyond anything American forces faced in 
Somalia or Saudi Arabia. To get aid to landlocked Rwanda, U.S. troops must deal 
with clogged port facilities and inadequate storage areas on the African coast, 
then manage a 1,200-mile trip inland across three or four countries -- often 
over narrow, unpaved roads. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, security is uncertain. Besides the danger of snipers, U.S. troops 
might confront demands by local soldiers for payoffs in return for permission 
to pass unchallenged. And the rapidly spreading cholera outbreak threatens the 
rescuers as well as Rwandans. 
</P>
<P>
 To top it all off, the relief operation must be carried out at breakneck 
speed, both to quell the cholera epidemic and get the refugees home before late 
August to save Rwanda's crops, which are now ready for harvest. If this year's 
crops are lost, officials warn, the ill-starred country's hunger problem will 
grow drastically. 
</P>
<P>
 "This relief effort is the most difficult and complex the world has faced in 
decades," Clinton told reporters in a White House briefing Friday. "This is our 
mission. We must continue it until it is accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some strategists fear the venture could temporarily sap so much of the 
military's logistic capability that the Pentagon might have to abandon the 
Rwandan effort if the United States were drawn into a military action elsewhere 
in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a real question about how you get out (of the Rwandan operation) if 
there should be another in Haiti or Korea," a senior Army official acknowledged 
Friday. "The ships would just have to change course." 
</P>
<P>
 And if Congress does not provide the extra $320 million that Clinton requested 
Friday, the Army, at least, will have to cut back on some of its training 
activities, Army officials said. Without a new appropriation, the Army would 
have to use its operating funds to pay for the relief program. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon logistics officers have come up with a series of improvised solutions 
to help them overcome some of the problems they face: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dozens of truck convoys will make the 40-hour trip from the Kenyan seaport 
of Mombasa to the Rwandan capital of Kigali in 10- or 12-hour stages, changing 
drivers every few hundred miles -- "almost like the Pony Express," one Army 
logistics officer said. Hundreds of trucks will be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 * Port masters will conserve precious dock facilities by unloading only that 
part of each ship's cargo that is needed immediately, leaving the transports to 
anchor in the harbor until there is room for more. 
</P>
<P>
 * The military is contracting out some jobs -- such as burying the thousands 
of dead and setting up water purification facilities to help break the cholera 
epidemic -- to private civilian firms, such as Brown & Root Inc., the giant 
Houston-based construction company. Military bulldozers also will help. 
</P>
<P>
 * Building up the region's airfields has been the military's first priority. 
The airfields at Goma, Zaire, and Kigali are relatively primitive and lack 
air-traffic-control equipment needed for massive airlift operations. 
Cargo-handling and storage facilities are almost nonexistent. On Friday, 
Clinton ordered U.S. troops to improve the airport facilities at Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. relief operation actually began about a week ago. The United States 
is flying C-5A and C-141 cargo planes loaded with humanitarian supplies into 
airports at Entebbe, Uganda, and Goma, in what has turned into a 24-hour-a-day 
operation.  
</P>
<P>
 Five large military ships laden with food, medicine and equipment are on their 
way to Mombasa and could begin arriving as early as this weekend, Army 
logistics planners said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the potential hazards, the truck convoys going into Rwanda will 
travel at only 35 m.p.h. and no night driving will be permitted. Besides the 
normal pitfalls -- narrow dirt roads, mud and steep hills -- the area is 
largely thick jungle, with no support services. 
</P>
<P>
 Army officials said that the convoy operation is likely to be the biggest -- 
and most challenging -- since the 1950-53 Korean War. Truck transportation in 
the Persian Gulf War was relatively simple. Seaports were close to staging 
areas and airlift capacity was huge. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Friday that their first few days' work has brought some 
progress. Until U.S. troops moved in, Goma's tiny landing strip could 
accommodate no more than 10 flights a day, many of them smaller planes. Today, 
it is handling more than 20 such flights -- including several giant C-5s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon said that expanding the airport facilities at Kigali will double 
the number of flights that can land in the region, establishing an airlift 
network stretching from Entebbe to Goma and Kigali. The Goma airstrip already 
is "saturated." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
acknowledged that the airlift facilities still will be too small to meet the 
mammoth demands of the refugee problem. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. military planners said the relief effort may be impeded somewhat by the 
fact that the United States does not have full operational control of the 
seaport and airport facilities and may have to bow to U.N. schedulers in 
deciding when and how to land supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 That is partly because the Administration is refusing to take formal charge of 
the operation, as the United Nations initially had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.N. officials had little choice but to turn to Washington. The logistic 
problems in the Rwandan relief venture were so huge that only the U.S. military 
had the wherewithal to meet them. "There's no one else around anymore," one 
official said.

CLINTON ORDERS 200 TROOPS TO RWANDA TO REOPEN AIRPORT; AFRICA: PRESIDENT SAYS 
THEY WILL BE USED ONLY FOR HUMANITARIAN EFFORT AND WON'T BE DRAWN INTO 
PEACEKEEPING. HE ASKS CONGRESS FOR $320 MILLION IN AID. 
</P>

<P>
 President Clinton ordered 200 U.S. troops to Rwanda on Friday to reopen the 
airport in Kigali, the nation's capital. Officials insisted that American 
forces will be used solely for humanitarian aid and will not be drawn into 
peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States must do more," Clinton said at a White House news 
conference earlier in the day. He announced an emergency request to Congress 
for $320 million to pay for additional aid for Rwanda, where war and disease 
have killed up to half a million people. 
</P>
<P>
 "This relief effort is the most difficult and complex the world has faced in 
decades," he added. ". . . The United States must not cease its efforts until 
the dying stops and the refugees have returned." 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton Administration officials coupled that expansive pledge with 
repeated and notably narrow promises about the scope of the American operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mission is designed to deal with the immediate humanitarian crisis. This 
is not a long-term peacekeeping commitment in Rwanda," said White House 
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. responsibility ends at the airport perimeter," Deputy Secretary of 
Defense John Deutch said at the Pentagon in announcing the deployment of the 
200 troops, roughly half of whom will be security personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission today and tomorrow . . . is to assist in providing humanitarian 
assistance. There isn't a word in my instruction from the President that has 
anything to do with peacekeeping or anything else," said Gen. John M. 
Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's decision to open the airport is based on the assessment 
that the new government in Rwanda, established by the Tutsi-led Rwandan 
Patriotic Front after its victory in the nation's civil war, can maintain 
order, officials said. "If there is greater disorder in the country, another 
route will be taken," Deutch said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. forces are expected to begin arriving in Kigali today or Sunday. Defense 
Secretary William J. Perry, who had already been scheduled to visit the region 
over the weekend, will now add a stop in Kigali, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reopening the Kigali airport, which was damaged during the weeks of civil war 
that drove more than a million people into squalid refugee camps in Zaire and 
other neighboring countries, is designed to alleviate a severe restriction on 
current aid efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The small airfield at Goma, Zaire, can now handle just over 20 aid flights a 
day and its capacity cannot be expanded much beyond that, Shalikashvili said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kigali, roughly 60 miles from Goma, "isn't a terribly long distance and it 
would then give us an alternative to more than double the number of flights," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the airport opening goes smoothly, U.S. personnel may conduct a "second 
phase" effort that would require more troops, Deutch said. Other officials have 
said that fewer than 2,000 troops would be involved in that effort, if it 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Deutch warned, "We shall only do this if we see success and if security 
conditions permit." 
</P>
<P>
 One possible part of a second phase would be the establishment of way stations 
along Rwandan roads to provide food, water and other supplies to refugees as a 
way of encouraging them to return to their homes. U.S. forces might run the way 
stations or turn them over to U.N. troops or civilian aid agencies, Deutch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials continued to say that the only solution to the enormous refugee 
crisis in the camps around Goma is to encourage the refugees to go home. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the U.S. aid effort has been marred by a slow start, with complaints 
of disorganization coming from private aid workers and even some U.S. officers 
on the scene. Shalikashvili defended the operation but said he understands "the 
frustrations of the people in and out of uniform in places like Goma" with the 
pace of the relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be very strange if they did not feel impatient and frustrated with 
the flow of humanitarian assistance, with the water purification equipment, 
with the medical teams, because the need is really so very vast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he warned that frustration may continue because the many aid "priorities . 
. . far exceed our ability to squeeze all of that in through very limited 
airfields." 
</P>
<P>
 The first priority of U.S. officials has been to set up the logistic base that 
will allow the aid effort to expand smoothly and continue for the weeks, 
perhaps months, that will be required, Shalikashvili said. Private relief 
agencies, which have been able to get planes into Goma more quickly than the 
U.S. military, have been able to do so only because U.S. forces made improving 
the airfield there the first priority, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive logistic problems involved in delivering water, food and shelter 
to more than a million destitute people are only part of the difficulties the 
aid effort faces. Keeping order will also be a major challenge -- one that the 
Administration wants to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials insisted that peacekeeping will be the province of a 
separate U.N. force. U.S. forces will provide only logistic support. Eight 
nations so far have agreed to provide small contingents for the force, but when 
they will arrive and whether they will be enough remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials conceded that the Kigali mission will not be 
risk-free. "You cannot be involved in operations without some danger that 
someone will take a potshot at you," Shalikashvili said. 
</P>
<P>
 But they insisted that, in contrast with Somalia, this mission should be 
reasonably safe. While Somalia was still in the midst of a civil war when U.S. 
troops entered, Rwanda's RPF appears to have decisively defeated forces of the 
former Hutu-led government, officials said. Mission Rwanda 
</P>
<P>
 The relief problem in Rwanda involves two major tasks: First, persuading 
refugees who fled across the border to return home, where they fear being 
tortured and killed by rebels who overran the country two weeks ago. Second, 
getting the aid where it needs to go. The U.S. Mission 
</P>
<P>
 The White House laid out a five-part mission for the U.S. troops that are 
being sent to Rwanda: 
</P>
<P>
 Stabilize the situation in Goma, Zaire, where the bulk of the refugees are 
gathered, and "stop the dying" by curbing the spread of cholera. 
</P>
<P>
 Pave the way for the return of the refugees to Rwanda by setting up way 
stations to give them food and shelter on the trip home. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiate with the interim government in Rwanda to make sure that the 
situation there is stable and that the refugees will not be subject to 
reprisals when they return. 
</P>
<P>
 As quickly as possible, turn the situation over to the Office of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees and to U.N. peacekeeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Leave. Refugee Overflow 
</P>
<P>
 As of Thursday, more than 2 million people were believed to be massed in the 
French "safe zone," and U.N. officials feared people would flood out of the 
region into neighboring Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross said displaced people in the towns of Gikongoro and Cyangugu were in 
far worse condition than the refugees in Zaire. It was stepping up operations 
in southwestern Rwanda. Fact Sheet

 One of the obstacles facing relief operations is Rwanda's distance. Here are 
some of the mileage and travel times involved: 
</P>
<P>
 From the United States: 6,500 miles, 24-hour flight. 
</P>
<P>
 From U.S. headquarters, Europe: 2,727 miles, 9-hour flight.

DOCTOR, VOLUNTEER SLAIN OUTSIDE ABORTION CLINIC; CRIME: A THIRD PERSON IS 
WOUNDED. POLICE ARREST A LOCAL ACTIVIST WALKING FROM THE SHOOTING SCENE IN 
FLORIDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An abortion doctor and his volunteer escort were shotgunned to death Friday 
outside an abortion clinic, 16 months after a similar fatal attack here 
prompted federal legislation banning violence against such facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Police almost immediately arrested Paul Jennings Hill, 40, a well-known 
anti-abortion activist, and charged him with two counts of murder and one of 
attempted murder in the wounding of the wife of the volunteer escort. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill often demonstrated outside the clinic with placards advocating violence 
against doctors who perform abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know one thing: No innocent babies are going to be killed in that clinic 
today," police said Hill declared after his arrest Friday morning a few hundred 
yards away from The Ladies Center, one of two abortion clinics in this city. 
</P>
<P>
 A fatal attack on an abortion doctor at the other clinic last year rocketed 
Pensacola into the national spotlight, turning a port town that draws military 
retirees and conservative Christians into what some have billed "the Selma of 
the abortion-rights movement," a reference to the Alabama city associated with 
violent resistance to the 1960s civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and activists on both sides of the issue were quick to 
denounce Friday's attack, which killed physician John Bayard Britton, 69, and 
James Herman Barrett, 74, and wounded Barrett's wife, June, 68. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am strongly committed to ending this form of domestic terrorism that 
threatens the fabric of our country," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno pledged to investigate any concerted movement targeting 
abortion clinics with violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many more people must die in these 'isolated incidents' before these 
terrorists are stopped?" the National Abortion Federation said in a statement. 
"We will not give in." 
</P>
<P>
 Flip Benham, director of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue National, 
said, "We are appalled." But he added that the killings "reflected the same 
spirit of murder that exists inside where they are killing little children."  
</P>
<P>
 Susan Carpenter-McMillan, a prominent anti-abortion activist in Southern 
California, said she had talked to Hill four months ago "and found him a 
tragedy waiting to happen . . . . I can only conclude that not only is he not 
pro-life, but he has become as of today that which he condemns, a cold-blooded 
killer." 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything short of aggressive condemnation (of the murders) will seriously 
damage the credibility of the pro-life movement," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack occurred as the Barretts, volunteer escorts for about a year, 
arrived at the clinic with Britton, a Jacksonville-area doctor whom the couple 
picked up from the Pensacola airport for his weekly shift at The Ladies Center, 
a slightly shabby two-story wooden building fenced in from all sides on the 
north side of town. 
</P>
<P>
 The three pulled up in the center parking lot shortly before 7:30 a.m. and 
before the arrival of an off-duty, uniformed police officer hired by the clinic 
for security. Pensacola police said Hill ambushed the trio, blowing out both 
windows of the truck and mortally wounding both James Barrett and Britton, who 
wore a homemade bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a pretty sight to see two people shot in the head with a shotgun," 
said Pensacola Police Sgt. Jerry Potts, who described the faces of the men as 
nearly unrecognizable. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers, responding to a 911 call, found Hill walking away from the scene 
followed by three to four witnesses who waved and pointed at him as the 
suspected killer. Hill, who had been ordered by police just 40 minutes earlier 
to pull up crosses he had planted outside the clinic as part of an 
early-morning protest, was arrested without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers recovered more than a dozen 12-gauge shells from Hill's person and a 
pump-action shotgun behind an oak tree on clinic grounds, near the Barretts' 
truck.

 Hill, a bespectacled auto restorer and leader of the militant Defense America 
anti-abortion group, is scheduled to be arraigned today. As he was led to jail, 
he was seen smiling. The murder charges leave open the possibility of the death 
penalty if he is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 June Barrett, who was struck by shotgun pellets in the attack, was taken from 
the crime scene to a local hospital, where she was in fair condition Friday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt in her mind that Paul Hill was trying to kill everybody in 
the car," Bill Caplinger, a fellow clinic escort, said after a visit with Mrs. 
Barrett. "She's proud of Jim. He was doing what he believed in." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's violence led abortion-rights supporters to worry that doctors will be 
further reluctant to provide abortions in a region where anti-abortion 
sentiment, often vocal and sometimes violent, runs high. Pensacola's two 
clinics, now the scenes of the nation's only fatal abortion-related shootings, 
are the only abortion providers between Mobile, Ala., and Tallahassee, a 
stretch of several hundred miles. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, they have been the targets of several demonstrations and attacks in 
the past, including a firebombing a decade ago that damaged The Ladies Center, 
which provides first-trimester abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately adjoining the center lies a small plot of land owned by local 
anti-abortion activist John Burt, a triangular lot sporting a statue of a 
weeping woman and a sign dedicated to "over 26 million babies murdered since 
1973 in the American Holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
 Scaffolding erected outside the perimeter of the clinic on land owned by Burt 
also allowed protesters to peer into the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Britton, the father of five, knew that working at the clinics posed a risk and 
often carried a .357 magnum in his car, according to a recent magazine profile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't get him to tell me about how he felt about (the danger). Maybe he 
was scared -- but not scared enough," Vanita McKinney, Britton's companion and 
nurse for the last 10 years, said Friday from the home the two shared in 
Fernandina Beach, about 300 miles from Pensacola. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers at The Ladies Center were shaken by the attack but vowed to 
continue their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't back down. That was Dr. Gunn's song, and it's a good one," Caplinger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of numb. It seems so impossible for that to happen," said escort Pat 
Welch. 
</P>
<P>
 She said protesters are a regular fixture at the clinic, including Hill, who 
police said was arrested a month ago on a misdemeanor charge for "hollering and 
screaming" outside the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would smile and say 'God bless you' and 'God forgive you.' I never took 
him seriously, but I knew he was dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Welch and others described the Barretts as a warm couple, especially James 
Barrett, a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel who met his wife just a 
few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was tough, personable, wasn't afraid of a thing," Welch said. "A very 
strong man. I felt very secure around him." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road from The Ladies Center, Sandy Sheldon, an administrator of 
Pensacola Women's Medical Services -- the clinic where Gunn was killed last 
year -- said her office was aghast. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that eventually he (Hill) would flip out. We were not surprised to 
hear it was Paul Hill. It's hard to believe it has happened again." 
</P>
<P>
 Potts of the Pensacola police force said security would be stepped up at both 
clinics today. He acknowledged that police knew of Hill's support of violence 
against abortion providers and that officers closely monitored his activities 
during the trial of Michael Griffin, who was convicted earlier this year of 
killing Gunn. 
</P>
<P>
 But he defended the department, saying Hill's constitutional rights allowed 
him to carry his signs and protest peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could not take that right away from him," he said.

JURY ORDERS HOSPITAL TO PAY $2.7 MILLION TO AIDS PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Climaxing the first AIDS medical fraud case to come to trial in the United 
States, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury ordered North Hollywood Medical 
Center on Friday to pay $1.8 million in punitive damages for allowing an 
"unethical medical experiment" on five patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision brought total damages to $2.7 million after the same jury earlier 
this week found the hospital and two former doctors liable for negligence, 
fraud, conspiracy and violation of state medical codes in administering the 
controversial, homemade drug Viroxan. 
</P>
<P>
 In that earlier verdict, four of the five patients who brought the civil suit 
were awarded a total of $925,000 for their physical injuries as well as pain 
and suffering. Although the jury found that the fifth patient was also wronged 
by the hospital and doctors, he was not awarded damages because the jury felt 
he sustained no harm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury made it abundantly clear that the doctors were guilty of AIDS fraud 
and that the hospital conspired with them," said Ray Henke, lawyer for the 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.8-million punitive award will be divided between two of the patients, 
Mark Addy and Roderick Garcia. They were found to have been the victims of 
"oppressive, malicious or fraudulent" conduct, which made them eligible to 
collect the punitive damages.  
</P>
<P>
 Only the hospital, a 165-bed facility owned by American Medical Institute, was 
asked to pay punitive damages. Henke said that the former doctors -- both of 
whom had their medical licenses revoked by state authorities because of the 
Viroxan treatments -- would probably be unable to pay large punitive awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The patients charged that Dr. Valentine Birds and Dr. Rajindra Sethi, a 
surgeon, had given them the drug, which was invented by an Orange County 
radiologist in his home laboratory, to gather data on its effects. Viroxan has 
not been approved for any medical use by the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit charged the hospital with "indifference to its legal, ethical and 
professional duties," in allowing the treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital's lawyer, Alan Rushfeldt, placed the blame solely on the doctors. 
"The hospital was not at fault, not at all," he said. "If you look at the 
initial verdicts, the jury said the hospital should pay only a small percent of 
the damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason they said the hospital should pay all the punitive damages 
was because the doctors said they were broke." 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors and the lawyers representing them could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The patients who brought the suit are still alive, though none is currently in 
the hospital. But because their health is fragile, their lawyer said at least 
some of them may not live long enough to collect any money. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this goes to appeal, three of my clients will certainly not survive that, 
and the other two, it's not sure," Henke said. All five of his clients are 
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and three of them have fully 
developed AIDS, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rushfeldt said his client would not base an appeal decision on the plaintiffs' 
life expectancy. "It's the legal issues that are important," he said. "The 
money would still have to be paid out if we lost the appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 But Henke charges that delays in this case and a drawn-out appeal process are 
part of a strategy to discourage AIDS suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they are saying to people with AIDS is that if you do sue, you probably 
won't live to see your day in court," Henke said. "And if you do, you certainly 
won't collect because we can tie the whole thing up for years." 
</P>
<P>
 The inventor of Viroxan, Dr. Stephen D. Herman, was arrested in 1990 in what 
state medical authorities said was the first action taken against AIDS quackery 
in California. He was later pressured by state officials into giving up his 
medical license. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman was originally named in the suit but was dropped from it on the eve of 
the five-month trial when he declared bankruptcy, complicating any action taken 
against him. He now lives in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deliberated for almost a month before reaching the verdicts.

SIMPSON TRIAL ON SEPT. 19; POLICE TALK TO PROWLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles judge on Friday set Sept. 19 as the date for O.J. Simpson's 
murder trial to begin, while police detectives interviewed an admitted burglar 
who defense lawyers contend has information that could cast doubt on the case 
against the former football star. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, grand jury documents reviewed by The Times provided 
new details about Simpson's statements to police on the day after the killings. 
Previously undisclosed testimony from that proceeding reveals that detectives 
said Simpson told them he had last been at his ex-wife's house about a week 
before the murders but had not cut himself there. 
</P>
<P>
 That statement could be important to the case because police analysts have 
said that blood found near the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle 
Goldman matches Simpson's in several respects. If DNA analysis confirms that 
finding, Simpson would have to explain how his blood got there. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that could prove problematic for Simpson, his attorneys spoke 
publicly for the first time Friday about a witness they believe may have 
evidence that could help clear their high-profile client. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is at least one witness who police have talked to some time ago, and 
are apparently talking to him even as we speak," Simpson attorney Johnnie L. 
Cochran Jr. said during a brief and unusually amiable court hearing Friday. 
That witness, Cochran added, "has given testimony or evidence that is totally 
inconsistent with the theory of a lone assailant and is entirely inconsistent 
with the fact that Mr. Simpson is that assailant." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither side identified that person during Friday's hearing, but the mystery 
witness told The Times in a series of interviews that he is a part-time burglar 
who has been to prison three times and who claims to have been casing houses in 
Brentwood on the evening that Nicole Simpson and Goldman were murdered. Police 
interviewed him for more than three hours Friday and took him to the scene of 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In his interviews with The Times, the prowler said he noticed two burly, 
bearded white men dressed in dark clothing near the back gate of Nicole 
Simpson's condominium about 9 p.m. on Sunday, June 12. Then, more than an hour 
later, as he was approaching a house across the street, the prowler said he 
heard a woman yell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as soon as I was going inside, off the sidewalk, I heard a lady, I heard 
a commotion," said the man, who lives several hundred miles from Los Angeles in 
Northern California. "Something was going on there, and I heard a lady's voice 
going: 'No.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The prowler said he ducked behind a hedge and moments later saw the same two 
men he had spotted earlier. This time, they were running from the front of 
Nicole Simpson's condominium, the man said, adding that one was carrying a bag, 
possibly a small laundry bag. The man said he overheard one of the men saying 
something about slicing or slashing a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he did not see anyone resembling Simpson in the area but said he 
cannot be sure whether anyone entered and left Nicole Simpson's property from 
the rear while he was scouting out houses in the front. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the defense team have interviewed the prowler on several occasions. 
They said they find him credible despite his history of breaking the law and 
his admitted participation in previous scams. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police had spoken with the man before, on Friday they took him to the 
crime scene, where they had him re-enact the events of June 12, questioning him 
closely about what he saw and about the times of various events. The man said 
later that police seemed skeptical of his account. Detectives, who spent more 
than three hours with the prowler, would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The man conceded that he was not wearing a watch on the night of the murders 
but said he is reasonably sure he heard the scream and saw the men run away 
shortly after 10 p.m. because he ran back to his car at that point and noticed 
the clock. That clock, he added, is 1 hour and 12 minutes slow, but he said he 
remembers doing the addition and concluding that it was about 10:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The man asked that his name not be published, but he supplied it and other 
biographical information to The Times. Law enforcement sources confirmed 
details he provided regarding his criminal history -- including three trips to 
prison and a long string of arrests, mostly for burglary and theft. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who came forward to Simpson investigators before a reward was 
offered, said he does not want any money for his information. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very serious," the man said. "I feel sorry for Simpson. For me to 
take his money would be like taking money from somebody who's disabled. . . . 
It ain't right. I don't care if they find him guilty or not, there's always two 
white guys who left that scene." 
</P>
<P>
 In court, meanwhile, Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman said that prosecutors 
were attempting to comply with the defense's sweeping request for pretrial 
discovery and that he thought much of it could be worked out informally. He 
promised to collect reports regarding burglary calls from the area around 
Nicole Simpson's home and to turn over other information once Simpson's lawyers 
clarify their requests. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hodgman said some of the requests were too broad -- such as one for 
records of anyone who was treated for a dog bite at an emergency room near the 
crime scene within 24 hours of the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense is not permitted to engage willy-nilly in some sort of fishing 
expedition," Hodgman said. "If the defense wants to go fishing, on this 
particular one they're going to have to use their own pole and their own tackle 
box." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike previous sessions in the Simpson case, Friday's hearing was subdued and 
sometimes almost jovial. Hodgman and Cochran pledged to work together on 
sharing evidence, and Cochran at one point emphasized his trust in his former 
colleague in the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Lance A. Ito also showed flashes of humor, announcing that he had 
received a number of letters regarding the case -- "some are more interesting 
than others," he said wryly. Ito added that a number of people unconnected to 
the case have filed legal briefs. One, he said, was inexplicably accompanied by 
a $12-million check. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did the check clear, your honor?" Cochran asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be here if it did," Ito responded, prompting members of the 
audience to laugh. Simpson, who appeared animated and relaxed during Friday's 
session, smiled slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Simpson's lawyers did not get immediate access to some of the 
information they had sought, legal experts credited them with scoring 
significant points during the brief hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great day for the defense," said UCLA law professor Peter Arenella. 
"The defense used the hearing to float a theory of reasonable doubt. . . . This 
will be a reasonable doubt case, and today we learned one potential foundation 
for reasonable doubt -- namely, the possibility that two assailants of a 
different ethnic identity than Mr. Simpson were involved in the killing." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hearing's final items of business was for Ito to set a trial date 
in the fast-moving case. He selected Sept. 20, which he said appeared to be the 
final day available to him under Simpson's right to have a trial within 60 days 
of his arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Shapiro, Simpson's lead attorney, urged Ito to pick an even earlier 
date, suggesting Sept. 2. Shapiro explained later that Simpson wanted a quick 
trial so that he could return home as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The environment that he is in is not the environment he prefers," Shapiro 
said outside court. "He'd like to return to his family." 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday, after recomputing the number of days from Simpson's arraignment, 
Ito moved the trial date to Sept. 19. Although that is later than the date 
sought by Shapiro, the case nevertheless is moving at extraordinary speed. Many 
murder cases can take more than a year to come to trial, and some take much 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson trial is expected to blend physical evidence -- most notably 
bloodstains discovered at the crime scene, at Simpson's Brentwood estate and on 
his Ford Bronco -- with testimony from an array of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 A hint at the scope of the case comes from grand jury files reviewed by The 
Times on Friday. Those files reveal that 17 witnesses testified in that 
proceeding before it was halted because of the extensive publicity surrounding 
the case. Testimony at the grand jury fills 460 pages of transcripts and is 
accompanied by 30 photographs, two diagrams, a chart and a photo display. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the witnesses was Detective Philip L. Vannatter, a veteran Los Angeles 
police detective who is one of the lead investigators in the case and who 
interviewed Simpson shortly after the football Hall of Famer returned from 
Chicago on the morning after the murders. After waiving his Miranda rights, 
Simpson was questioned about a cut on his left hand -- a potentially 
significant injury because police are focusing much attention on bloodstains, 
including some they believe Simpson left at the scene of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Vannatter told grand jurors that Simpson acknowledged having cut himself but 
said he could not remember how he did it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he didn't know," Vannatter testified. "He said he didn't remember how 
he injured himself. He says he might have injured it sometime that evening 
while he was preparing for his trip." 
</P>
<P>
 Vannatter said Simpson told investigators that his cut could be responsible 
for blood found in his car and his Brentwood estate. But he did not offer any 
explanation for blood found at his ex-wife's condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he had last been at her residence, he believed, about a week prior 
and had been in her house maybe five to seven days prior," Vannatter told the 
grand jury. "And we asked him, 'Were you injured or anything while you were 
over there? Could you have been dropping any blood?' And he said, 'No,' he 
wasn't injured and he couldn't have been dropping any blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Blood drops later discovered at Nicole Simpson's home contain characteristics 
that matched Simpson's and that a police expert said could only have come from 
0.43% of the population -- or roughly 40,000 to 80,000 people in Los Angeles 
County. Police believe that Simpson was hurt during a struggle and that he 
dripped blood from his cut hand as he left the scene of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Tom Lange, Vannatter's partner, also testified before the grand 
jury, describing the bloody scene of the crime as he found it in the early 
morning hours of June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was apparent to me that a violent struggle had ensued between a suspect 
and the two victims, so violent a struggle that it was entirely possible the 
suspect himself would have been injured," Lange said. "There was an extreme 
amount of blood." 
</P>
<P>
 While Simpson's case raced toward an early trial, prosecutors elected for now 
not to go ahead with charges against the ex-athlete's best friend, Al (A.C.) 
Cowlings. Cowlings was arrested along with Simpson on charges of harboring the 
Heisman Trophy winner when he disappeared and failed to surrender to 
authorities for six hours. 
</P>
<P>
 When Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Craig E. Veals asked Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Christopher Darden on Friday whether his office was ready to file charges, 
Darden answered: "We are not. We are continuing our investigation of this 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Veals then "exonerated" Cowlings' $250,000 bond and told Cowlings that 
prosecutors have up to three years from the date of the offense to file 
criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Cowlings' attorney Donald Re called the district attorney's 
office's decision to leave the case open "disappointing." He said he had hoped 
that prosecutors would have decided by now not to file charges. Legal analysts 
and Simpson's lawyers have speculated that prosecutors may be keeping the case 
open in part to discourage Cowlings from taking the stand on Simpson's behalf 
during his upcoming trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "A.C. is in good spirits," Re said afterward. "A.C. realizes that he has done 
nothing wrong. He would like to get this behind him."

DOCTOR, VOLUNTEER SLAIN OUTSIDE ABORTION CLINIC; CRIME: A THIRD PERSON IS 
WOUNDED. POLICE ARREST A LOCAL ACTIVIST WALKING FROM THE SHOOTING SCENE IN 
FLORIDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An abortion doctor and his volunteer escort were shotgunned to death Friday 
outside an abortion clinic, 16 months after a similar fatal attack here 
prompted federal legislation banning violence against such facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Police almost immediately arrested Paul Jennings Hill, 40, a well-known 
anti-abortion activist, and charged him with two counts of murder and one of 
attempted murder in the wounding of the wife of the volunteer escort. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill often demonstrated outside the clinic with placards advocating violence 
against doctors who perform abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know one thing: No innocent babies are going to be killed in that clinic 
today," police said Hill declared after his arrest Friday morning a few hundred 
yards away from The Ladies Center, one of two abortion clinics in this city. 
</P>
<P>
 A fatal attack on an abortion doctor at the other clinic last year rocketed 
Pensacola into the national spotlight, turning a port town that draws military 
retirees and conservative Christians into what some have billed "the Selma of 
the abortion-rights movement," a reference to the Alabama city associated with 
violent resistance to the 1960s civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and activists on both sides of the issue were quick to 
denounce Friday's attack, which killed physician John Bayard Britton, 69, and 
James Herman Barrett, 74, and wounded Barrett's wife, June, 68. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am strongly committed to ending this form of domestic terrorism that 
threatens the fabric of our country," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno pledged to investigate any concerted movement targeting 
abortion clinics with violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many more people must die in these 'isolated incidents' before these 
terrorists are stopped?" the National Abortion Federation said in a statement. 
"We will not give in." 
</P>
<P>
 Flip Benham, director of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue National, 
said, "We are appalled." But he added that the killings "reflected the same 
spirit of murder that exists inside where they are killing little children."  
</P>
<P>
 Susan Carpenter-McMillan, a prominent anti-abortion activist in Southern 
California, said she had talked to Hill four months ago "and found him a 
tragedy waiting to happen . . . . I can only conclude that not only is he not 
pro-life, but he has become as of today that which he condemns, a cold-blooded 
killer." 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything short of aggressive condemnation (of the murders) will seriously 
damage the credibility of the pro-life movement," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack occurred as the Barretts, volunteer escorts for about a year, 
arrived at the clinic with Britton, a Jacksonville-area doctor whom the couple 
picked up from the Pensacola airport for his weekly shift at The Ladies Center, 
a slightly shabby two-story wooden building fenced in from all sides on the 
north side of town. 
</P>
<P>
 The three pulled up in the center parking lot shortly before 7:30 a.m. and 
before the arrival of an off-duty, uniformed police officer hired by the clinic 
for security. Pensacola police said Hill ambushed the trio, blowing out both 
windows of the truck and mortally wounding both James Barrett and Britton, who 
wore a homemade bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a pretty sight to see two people shot in the head with a shotgun," 
said Pensacola Police Sgt. Jerry Potts, who described the faces of the men as 
nearly unrecognizable. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers, responding to a 911 call, found Hill walking away from the scene 
followed by three to four witnesses who waved and pointed at him as the 
suspected killer. Hill, who had been ordered by police just 40 minutes earlier 
to pull up crosses he had planted outside the clinic as part of an 
early-morning protest, was arrested without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers recovered more than a dozen 12-gauge shells from Hill's person and a 
pump-action shotgun behind an oak tree on clinic grounds, near the Barretts' 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, a bespectacled auto restorer and leader of the militant Defense America 
anti-abortion group, is scheduled to be arraigned today. As he was led to jail, 
he was seen smiling. The murder charges leave open the possibility of the death 
penalty if he is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 June Barrett, who was struck by shotgun pellets in the attack, was taken from 
the crime scene to a local hospital, where she was in fair condition Friday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt in her mind that Paul Hill was trying to kill everybody in 
the car," Bill Caplinger, a fellow clinic escort, said after a visit with Mrs. 
Barrett. "She's proud of Jim. He was doing what he believed in." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff White, director of Operation Rescue in California, said he was 
"grief-stricken" by the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 He challenged Planned Parenthood officials to meet with him and others in his 
group to work out a solution that would allow people to continue to protest but 
that would prevent future violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're never going to agree on abortion, but we need to meet and work out what 
is acceptable protest in California," White said. "I don't want for California 
what is happening in Florida." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Dudley, associate executive director of the Planned Parenthood in Orange 
and San Bernardino counties, said, "What is really sad is that both sides of 
the arguments basically want the same thing, and that is to prevent unintended 
pregnancies, unwanted pregnancies and abortion.  
</P>
<P>
 "When abortion is needed -- and that is the choice that these women make -- 
the physicians and people who are providing these services need to be safe."  
</P>
<P>
 Friday's violence led abortion-rights supporters to worry that doctors will be 
further reluctant to provide abortions in a region where anti-abortion 
sentiment, often vocal and sometimes violent, runs high. Pensacola's two 
clinics, now the scenes of the nation's only fatal abortion-related shootings, 
are the only abortion providers between Mobile, Ala., and Tallahassee, a 
stretch of several hundred miles. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, they have been the targets of several demonstrations and attacks in 
the past, including a firebombing a decade ago that damaged The Ladies Center, 
which provides first-trimester abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately adjoining the center lies a small plot of land owned by local 
anti-abortion activist John Burt, a triangular lot sporting a statue of a 
weeping woman and a sign dedicated to "over 26 million babies murdered since 
1973 in the American Holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
 Scaffolding erected outside the perimeter of the clinic on land owned by Burt 
also allowed protesters to peer into the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Britton, the father of five, knew that working at the clinics posed a risk and 
often carried a .357 magnum in his car, according to a recent magazine profile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't get him to tell me about how he felt about (the danger). Maybe he 
was scared -- but not scared enough," Vanita McKinney, Britton's companion and 
nurse for the last 10 years, said Friday from the home the two shared in 
Fernandina Beach, about 300 miles from Pensacola. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers at The Ladies Center were shaken by the attack but vowed to 
continue their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't back down. That was Dr. Gunn's song, and it's a good one," Caplinger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of numb. It seems so impossible for that to happen," said escort Pat 
Welch. 
</P>
<P>
 She said protesters are a regular fixture at the clinic, including Hill, who 
police said was arrested a month ago on a misdemeanor charge for "hollering and 
screaming" outside the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would smile and say 'God bless you' and 'God forgive you.' I never took 
him seriously, but I knew he was dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Welch and others described the Barretts as a warm couple, especially James 
Barrett, a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel who met his wife just a 
few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was tough, personable, wasn't afraid of a thing," Welch said. "A very 
strong man. I felt very secure around him." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road from The Ladies Center, Sandy Sheldon, an administrator of 
Pensacola Women's Medical Services -- the clinic where Gunn was killed last 
year -- said her office was aghast. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that eventually he (Hill) would flip out. We were not surprised to 
hear it was Paul Hill. It's hard to believe it has happened again." 
</P>
<P>
 Potts of the Pensacola police force said security would be stepped up at both 
clinics today. He acknowledged that police knew of Hill's support of violence 
against abortion providers and that officers closely monitored his activities 
during the trial of Michael Griffin, who was convicted earlier this year of 
killing Gunn. 
</P>
<P>
 But he defended the department, saying Hill's constitutional rights allowed 
him to carry his signs and protest peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could not take that right away from him," he said.

UNION ANGRILY BREAKS OFF CONTRACT TALKS WITH MTA; STRIKE: LABOR OFFICIALS 
DENOUNCE AGENCY CHIEF'S LETTER TO MECHANICS. EMERGENCY BUS SERVICE IS EXTENDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The nagging transit strike that has snarled life for more than half a million 
mostly low-income Los Angeles County commuters seemed poised Friday to drag on 
indefinitely after secret talks aimed at resolving the walkout collapsed in 
acrimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency service was extended into the weekend on six critical bus and rail 
lines, the only good news for frustrated riders and transit-dependent shopping 
districts. But with no new negotiations scheduled, representatives for the 
striking mechanics abruptly broke off talks with the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority, accusing the top brass of poisoning the process by 
going behind the union's back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a tragedy," said Jim Wood, secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles 
County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, which is participating in the 
negotiations. "They do not want to settle this. They do not want the buses to 
roll." 
</P>
<P>
 The union's anger was sparked by a conciliatory letter sent by MTA chief 
Franklin White to each of 1,900 striking mechanics -- part of the agency's 
campaign to bypass the unions and take its case directly to the rank and file. 
In the letter, dated July 27, White promised employees that the agency's 
cost-cutting plans would not jeopardize their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders, however, did not learn of the letter's contents until striking 
employees began calling the union office Friday morning. Finally, about 2 p.m., 
the letter was faxed to union representatives at the Burbank Airport Hilton 
Hotel, where negotiations with MTA representatives had been under way for five 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Bujosa, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union, said the letter 
was handed to him while he was eating. "That was the end of lunch," he said. 
"We were stunned." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood, who had been told about the letter Thursday, said he assumed it was an 
innocuous appeal for a quick settlement. Instead, he said, he was surprised to 
learn that it contained "specific items that were discussed in confidence" at 
the parties' last bargaining session -- a six-hour marathon Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Franklin White wants to represent mechanics, then goddammit he ought to 
learn how to become a diesel mechanic, give up his $175,000-a-year job and 
stand for election," said Wood, who described the letter as a breach of 
negotiating protocol. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference Friday evening, White said he had cleared the letter 
beforehand with the MTA board and its legal advisers, who told him there was 
nothing inappropriate about directly contacting his own employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is customary," said White, who took over as MTA chief last year. "The 
issue is not Frank White. The issue is what are we going to do for the . . . 
riders in Los Angeles every day." 
</P>
<P>
 In the two-page document, White had sought to allay striking mechanics' fears 
about layoffs from subcontracting, saying that anticipated savings would make 
the agency financially healthier and better able to offer job security. The 
MTA's proposed contract, he wrote, "provides two years of job protection, with 
no reduction in pay," for all union members whose work has been subcontracted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite what you may have been told, I want you to know that no current ATU 
employee will lose his or her job," White wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, an MTA board member, said he had read a 
copy of White's letter before it was mailed and saw no breach of 
confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ATU needs to have a large dose of reality and live in the real world," 
Antonovich said. "The letter was reasonable and allowed members of the union to 
understand the board's position. It took away the rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Patsaouras, an alternate MTA board member, added: "The letter is an 
excuse -- it's not a reason to walk away from the table." 
</P>
<P>
 With the walkout now entering its sixth day, the financial impact of the 
strike -- both the hardships and some unexpected benefits -- is also becoming a 
central issue of the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 While strikers brace for lost wages, the walkout has bestowed a windfall on 
the MTA, which estimates it has saved about $500,000 each day the bus fleet has 
been grounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The financially pinched agency has been forced to spend about $200,000 a day, 
most of it on private rental buses, but it continues to take in about $700,000 
a day in tax revenues. Even with the large sum that MTA officials have spent on 
newspaper and radio ads attacking the unions, the transit agency still has 
reaped benefits totaling more than $2 million since workers walked off the job 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're sitting Downtown and laughing at us," said Darin Bailey, a striking 
driver, outside the MTA bus yard in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 White, in an earlier interview, acknowledged that his agency was "in the 
curious position of actually saving money," although he was quick to add: "I 
hope everybody understands that we're not failing to agree because we want to 
save money." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, those savings are almost as much as the MTA hopes to recoup 
through subcontracting and other salary cuts -- the key issues behind Los 
Angeles' first transit strike in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Zarian, MTA vice chairman, said Friday that the agency hopes to save an 
estimated $2 million to $3 million a year through subcontracting, the practice 
of hiring less expensive private companies to perform certain tasks. The agency 
wants to save an additional $1 million, he said, by lowering the pay for newly 
hired service attendants from $15 an hour to $10. 
</P>
<P>
 Although those cutbacks are at the core of the labor dispute, they represent 
only a fraction of the MTA's nearly $3-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're doing this on the backs of the people -- the people who need transit, 
and on us," said Cecil Bard, 47, a mechanic-machinist for the last 19 years. As 
he picketed outside the Highland Park bus yard, the 47-year-old father of five 
said his wife had already begun eliminating expensive cuts of meat from her 
supermarket trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yep, we're looking for real deal meals," Bard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mechanics, who earn an average of $44,000 a year, are receiving no strike 
pay from their union, whose coffers were depleted during the 1990 Greyhound 
strike. The MTA's bus and train drivers, who generally earn a bit less than the 
mechanics, are getting $8.50 a day in strike pay from their international 
union. Clerks, who have joined them on the picket line, will begin receiving 
$20 a day next week if the strike continues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm calling all my bill collectors and telling them that I'm on strike and 
I'm hurting," Tim Shephard, a striking driver, said outside the South-Central 
bus yard on 54th Street. "They don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Navarre, a 40-year-old mechanic from West Covina, tried to comfort him. 
"We'll just have to bunk it at each other's homes," said Navarre, who is 
considering moving back in with her mother if the strike drags on. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders are eager to resolve the dispute before next Friday, when checks 
will be handed out -- minus last week's wages. Charles Mosby, the assistant 
business manager for ATU Local 1277, said workers are not too worried now, 
because they got their last paycheck July 21. But if next Friday's checks come 
and workers are still on strike, he said, he feared their resolve might begin 
to slip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our big concern is trying to get paychecks into the pockets of these 
individuals," Mosby said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' first transit strike since 1982 began at 12:01 a.m. Monday, when 
the MTA's 1,900 mechanics walked off the job. Their picket lines have been 
honored by 5,000 drivers and clerks, crippling the nation's second-largest 
public transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
 By retraining veteran supervisors and contracting with private school bus 
companies, the MTA has managed to put about 20% of its 1,900-bus fleet on the 
road. The result has been snarled traffic for freeway commuters and major 
disruptions for the legions of commuters who do not have cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the MTA originally had planned to suspend service this weekend, the 
agency announced late Friday that it would offer limited service on several key 
routes in response to the concerns of Downtown merchants, especially along the 
Broadway corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Added were: Bus Lines No. 30 on Pico Boulevard, No. 45 on Broadway, No. 21 on 
Wilshire Boulevard and No. 204 on Vermont Avenue, as well as rail service on 
the Red Line subway and Blue Line trolley. 
</P>
<P>
 Service will be from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. today and Sunday. Officials expect to 
return Monday to their weekday strike service, which includes about 30 of the 
MTA's 200 routes.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS UNVEIL UNIVERSAL HEALTH MEASURE; REFORM: GEPHARDT STRESSES THAT 
BILL IS DISTINCT FROM CLINTON PLAN. IT FACES A BRUTAL FIGHT, UNCERTAIN FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 House Democratic leaders on Friday unveiled their formula for national health 
care reform, introducing legislation that satisfies President Clinton's demand 
for universal coverage and calls on employers to pay up to 80% of their 
workers' health premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The House leadership described the battle that lies ahead in historic terms, 
comparing it to the monumental legislative struggles to enact Social Security 
and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also took great pains to distinguish their initiative from "the 
Clinton bill," because they are aware that anything carrying that label is 
drawing stiff opposition across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, the bill we are presenting today is a brand-new 
bill," said Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), the chief architect of 
the leadership measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also underscored the differences, saying that House leaders "chose a 
pragmatic and more moderate path." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans quickly ridiculed that representation, with House Minority Leader 
Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) saying: "They may have rearranged a few parts, but 
the heart of the bill is Clinton and all the damaging things it would do to 
health care in America." 
</P>
<P>
 And business groups seemed as adamantly opposed to the Democratic bill as they 
were to the earlier Clinton proposal. U.S. Chamber of Commerce Vice President 
Jeffrey Joseph called it a "Bride of Frankenstein." 
</P>
<P>
 Many business organizations have resolutely opposed any requirement that they 
pay any amount for workers' health premiums. Under the House Democrats' bill, 
their contribution would vary according to the size of the firm and its average 
wage level. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a firm of five employees earning an average of $11,000 a year 
would pay $1,275 per year -- or 61 cents an hour -- for each worker's premium. 
By comparison, a 6,000-worker company with annual wages averaging $39,600 would 
pay the maximum $2,625, or about $1.26 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The share that individuals and families pay would vary according to their 
income level and which type of coverage they chose. A family of four earning 
less than $16,000 a year would be eligible for government subsidies that would 
reduce their premium cost to nothing, for example, while the same size family 
earning more than $38,400 would pay the full $1,134 a year for the same basic 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic leaders said that their legislation offers less bureaucracy, milder 
price controls, fewer taxes and more choices to consumers than the White House 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also would create a vast new government program -- called Medicare Part 
C -- as its chief means of expanding coverage to those who do not have it now. 
By some estimates, more than half the population could wind up in a 
government-financed health program if the bill becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle on the House floor, which is expected to begin the week of Aug. 8, 
promises to be brutal, and the outcome is far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
 On the safe assumption that not a single Republican will vote with them, the 
leadership can afford to lose no more than 39 Democratic votes. The bill's fate 
is likely to hinge on winning enough votes among Democratic moderates, many of 
whom are decidedly lukewarm to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think that the President's (plan) would fly and I don't think this 
one will either," said Rep. J. Roy Rowland (D-Ga.), who is attempting to build 
a bipartisan coalition for a scaled-back measure that would not reach Clinton's 
goal of assuring that all Americans have coverage by a date certain. 
</P>
<P>
 Many House Democrats are looking warily at the Senate, insisting that they 
will not put their careers on the line by voting for an employer mandate if the 
Senate is not likely to do the same. Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) is putting the finishing touches on his bill, which he expects to make 
public early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The House Democratic bill, closely modeled on one passed last month by the 
Ways and Means Committee, retains the most controversial element of the Clinton 
plan, which is his requirement that employers pay 80% of their workers' health 
insurance premium costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of criticism that the so-called employer mandate would be too much 
for small businesses to pay, the bill includes tax credits for those with 50 or 
fewer workers, with the most relief being offered to those paying an average 
wage of $12,000 a year or less. 
</P>
<P>
 It also delays the onset of the mandate for small employers until 1999, which 
is two years later than the date that big companies would be required to pay 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsidies would also be available to help those earning up to 240% of the 
federal poverty level -- or $38,400 for a family of four -- pay their share of 
their health benefits. Additional funds would also be available for children 
and pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
 To answer criticism that the Clinton plan would rob consumers of the ability 
to choose their doctors and hospitals, the House Democrats' bill requires 
employers to offer their workers a managed-care plan under which consumers are 
required to seek treatment within a network of providers; a traditional, 
higher-cost plan in which they would have unlimited choice and bare-bones 
catastrophic coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The catastrophic coverage would be combined with a concept known as a "medical 
savings account" in which workers and their employers would set aside money to 
pay for health care and workers would be allowed to keep any part of their 
contributions that were not spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Deductibles under the traditional fee-for-services would be $500 for 
individuals and $750 for families in a year.  
</P>
<P>
 The legislation would reform insurance laws to guarantee that workers could 
take insurance with them if they changed jobs. It also contains provisions that 
would provide prescription drug benefits for the elderly who are now covered by 
Medicare and that would start a program of home- and community-based long-term 
care in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, firms with 100 or fewer workers would give their employees an 
opportunity to join Medicare Part C and the widely praised plan available to 
government workers, including members of Congress and the executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
 While only sketchy details of the plan's benefits were released, other 
features of the bill include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A single guaranteed benefits package, which includes those now covered by 
Medicare, along with prescription drug coverage, preventive care and mental 
health and substance abuse benefits. For now, the bill would also cover 
abortion but that provision stands a good chance of being deleted on the House 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 * The elimination of the Medicaid program. Beneficiaries instead would join 
the new Medicare Part C program. Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), a 
champion of the Medicaid program, said that the change would be "a real boost 
to people under Medicaid because it will allow them to get access to the 
doctors of their choice." 
</P>
<P>
 * A provision giving states the option of establishing a so-called 
"single-payer" system -- in essence a government-financed health care system, 
similar to Canada's. 
</P>
<P>
 * Widely agreed-upon reforms in the insurance market, including one preventing 
insurance companies from denying coverage to people with known illnesses such 
as cancer and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 * No coverage, beyond emergency services, for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In most respects, those features resemble the Clinton plan. However, the House 
leaders followed the lead of several congressional committees and jettisoned 
many other elements of the President's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone, for instance, are the mandatory government-organized purchasing 
cooperatives through which most Americans would have been required to purchase 
coverage. Instead, "alliances" would be voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Clinton would have had the government impose limits on the growth of 
premiums, the House Democratic leaders' bill would establish a commission to 
recommend cost-containment measures that could be rejected by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most controversial parts of the bill is the Medicare Part C 
program, which would be available to part-time and seasonal workers, low-income 
people and those who work for small firms. 
</P>
<P>
 It probably would be about 20% cheaper than comparable private plans, which 
means that it would be an attractive option to all those groups. Yet critics 
called it another big-government approach to a social problem, carrying risks 
of out-of-control costs and inefficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, like Medicare, it could wind up paying providers less than their 
costs -- forcing them to shift those excess costs onto their paying patients 
from the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the debate is the fact that, because Medicare Part C is an 
untested concept, it is almost impossible to get a reliable estimate of how 
many people would use the program and what it would cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many of the financial details of the entire bill are yet to be 
estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.  
</P>
<P>
 To raise the money to pay for the bill, House leaders turned to a variety of 
sources. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * A 45-cent-a-pack increase in the cigarette tax, scaling back the 75-cent 
hike proposed by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 2% excise tax on health insurance premiums. It would be dedicated to 
funding large teaching hospitals, biomedical research and public health 
programs. The tax, like other levies, might be passed along to the consumer in 
the form of higher costs or be borne by the worker through wages that are lower 
than they would otherwise be. Comparing the Plans 
</P>
<P>
 First category shows where the debate started -- what Clinton proposed. The 
second shows Gephardt's proposal, and the third shows what the fights are 
likely to be about. 
</P>
<P>
 PAYING FOR UNIVERSAL COVERAGE 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton: By 1998, require all companies to provide insurance to all workers. 
Employers to pay 80% of premiums, workers 20%. Increase cigarette tax by 75 
cents per pack. Levy 1% tax on insurance premiums. End "tax saver" or "flexible 
spending" accounts that allow excluding a portion of pay from taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gephardt: By 1999, require all companies to provide insurance to all 
workers. Employers to pay 80% of premiums, workers 20%. Increase cigarette tax 
by 45 cents per pack. Levy 2% tax on insurance premiums. End "tax saver" or 
"flexible spending" accounts that allow workers to exclude a portion of their 
pay from their taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fights to Come: Proposals will be made to reduce the employer mandate to 50% 
of insurance premiums instead of 80%, and to lengthen the phase-in period. 
Others will try to eliminate the mandate entirely. Tobacco-state 
representatives may try to scale back the cigarette tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
 IMPACT ON MEDICARE 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton: Would expand Medicare coverage to include prescription drugs. Begin 
new long-term care program for some elderly Americans. Would put new limits on 
payments to hospitals and doctors to rein in the rate of increase in Medicare 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gephardt: Same, except the long-term care program would be at the option of 
each state, and could be expanded to cover non-elderly severely disabled 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fights to Come: Critics say that the prescription drug benefit and the 
long-term care program are too expensive, and will try to eliminate them. The 
efforts to scale back Medicare cost increases may face stiff opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 SUBSIDIES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton: Would provide subsidies to businesses, depending on size and 
average payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gephardt: Would provide tax credits for companies with 50 or fewer workers. 
Subsidy amount varies by company size and average payroll. Would offer small 
businesses two options other than arranging for insurance on their own: Enroll 
workers in the new Medicare Part C program or let them buy into existing 
federal employees health program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fights to Come: If opponents cannot eliminate the employer mandate 
altogether, they may move to exempt small business from mandatory 
participation.  
</P>
<P>
 REFORMING INSURANCE MARKETS 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton: Would require all but the largest companies to buy insurance 
through purchasing pools called health alliances. Would forbid insurance 
companies from charging some customers more than others. Would eliminate 
pre-existing condition exclusions. Would require all insurance plans to offer 
at a minimum a nationally guaranteed package of benefits. Would give states the 
option to set up single-payer systems in which the government would pay all 
health bills. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gephardt: Would allow states to establish either voluntary or mandatory 
purchasing pools. Would forbid insurance companies from charging some customers 
more than others. Would eliminate pre-existing condition exclusions. Would 
require all insurance plans to offer a nationally guaranteed package of 
benefits. Would give states the option to set up single-payer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fights to Come: Eliminating the pre-existing condition exclusion is widely 
popular. All other key provisions are controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 COST CONTAINMENT 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton: Effective immediately, would establish standby federal price 
controls on insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gephardt: Effective in 2001, would authorize the government to establish 
standby price controls on insurance premiums if a national commission deemed 
them "necessary." Congress could vote to reject the price controls. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fights to Come: Insurance companies strongly oppose any form of standby 
price controls. 
</P>
<P>
 ABORTION 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton: Would include abortions in the national package. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gephardt: Would include abortions in the national package. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fights to Come: House leaders concede that they will have to water down 
abortion coverage, and perhaps eliminate it entirely, to win passage of a bill.

LATIN AMERICA; ARGENTINA'S HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE UNDERCUTS MENEM'S FISCAL 
SUCCESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Argentines like to describe their life experiences in extremes. They live 
through the best and the worst, often at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Such seemed to be the case this week: As the country enjoys brisk economic 
growth, unemployment has soared to its highest level since President Carlos 
Saul Menem took office in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not good news," Juan Llach, a senior official with the Argentine 
Economy Ministry, said as he announced unemployment figures that showed 10.8% 
of the nation's work force is not working. 
</P>
<P>
 The high unemployment rate exposed the weak flank of the government's vigorous 
free-market economic program. The currency has been stabilized, inflation has 
been brought under control and the economy is growing. But with a huge trade 
deficit and foreign investment still sluggish, job creation is not keeping 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the estimated 2.8 million people who are jobless got that way when the 
government, as part of its program, began selling off state companies with 
bloated payrolls. Tens of thousands of employees were laid off as entities such 
as the telephone and oil companies were privatized or sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10.8% rate reflects unemployment in May, up from 9.9% a year earlier. In 
October of last year, unemployment was at 9.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 The government, putting its best spin on the data, said that while more people 
than ever are out of work, there are more jobs than ever. As the economy is 
being restructured, the officials say, many of the new jobs being created 
require skills that Argentines are in the process of acquiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, in the past five years or so the work force has been inflated by women 
returning to the workplace, immigration and the decision of many retirees to 
take jobs to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (the level of unemployment) is a little worrisome," Menem told reporters. 
"I say 'a little,' because in a country that is growing, producing and 
consuming like Argentina, this can be overcome. . . . Unemployment as a product 
of recession is one thing; unemployment as a product of growth is something 
else altogether." 
</P>
<P>
 A certain amount of unemployment is acceptable, he said, because computers and 
"robots" are replacing people. 
</P>
<P>
 Computers don't have families to feed, however, and Menem was reminded of that 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In the largest demonstration in more than three years, tens of thousands of 
Argentines marched July 6 on the Casa Rosada, the presidential palace, to 
protest the widening gulf between rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators, many of whom were from the country's neglected provinces, 
complained that the president's policies had thrown many of them out of work. 
And they charged that those who do have jobs have discovered that their 
salaries are no longer covering their basic needs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new challenge to the government, opposition unions have called a strike 
for Tuesday that threatens to shut down public transportation, schools and many 
public offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The angry workers are protesting the decline in their buying power and 
proposed labor laws that they fear would erode their benefits. The president 
was seeking to have the strike declared illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo defended the government's program, saying 
that steady growth in the economy in the last three years -- at an annual rate 
of about 8% -- has created more than a million jobs. He contended that the 
government has also reduced poverty and slowed what was once runaway inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Argentina's legendary inflation -- it reached nearly 5,000% in 1989 -- 
was just 7.4% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many in the middle and working classes are feeling pinched. 
</P>
<P>
 "You work, you get by," said Angel Picone, a 70-year-old retired clothing 
manufacturer who started driving a taxi to supplement his $300-a-month pension. 
"You have to work."

EUROPE; PARTY'S ADS FAIL TO SOCK IT TO 'EM; CONTROVERSIAL ANTI-LEFTIST CAMPAIGN 
BY GERMANY'S RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS DRAWS FIRE FROM WITHIN. 
</P>

<P>
 The Cold War, it turns out, is not entirely over. 
</P>
<P>
 After parading with President Clinton through Brandenburg Gate to celebrate 
the end of communism, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has revived its specter to 
slap his main opponents in federal elections this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl's Christian Democratic Union launched a new ad campaign last week 
accusing the Social Democrats of making a pact with the devil by forming a 
minority government in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt with the leftist 
Greens and help from former Communists. 
</P>
<P>
 The chancellor set the tone for the final months of his reelection campaign by 
charging that the Social Democratic Party "broke with the decades-old consensus 
of all democrats in Germany not to work together with extremists on the left or 
the right." 
</P>
<P>
 One of his party's new posters revives Cold War rhetoric to warn of a "leftist 
front" on the national level. Another billboard shows a red sock hanging on a 
clothesline and says: "Off into the future . . . but not in red socks." 
</P>
<P>
 The sock ads have been controversial among conservatives in Kohl's own party 
-- not because they seem outmoded, but because they seem to easterners in 
particular to make light of a perceived "red" threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Democratic leader Rudolf Scharping is not exactly out defending his 
party's tacit alliance with the Party of Democratic Socialism -- the reformed 
East German Communist Party. Playing to voters who fear communism, Scharping 
denied plans to come to national power with such a coalition, and his party 
accused the Christian Democrats of having made their own pact with the 
Communist devil. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Democratic campaign manager Guenter Verheugen said a majority of 
eastern Christian Democratic members of Parliament came from the old East 
German Christian Democrats, a puppet party of the former East German 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Communists, meanwhile, are enjoying the brouhaha that has given 
them considerable free advertising and fueled their hopes of winning seats in 
the federal Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saxony-Anhalt vote was a surprise to all parties and presents another 
scenario -- unlikely but not impossible -- for the formation of a new federal 
government after the Oct. 16 election. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian Democrats won the most votes, but their partners in the 
governing coalition, the liberal Free Democratic Party, did not win enough to 
return to the state legislature, leaving the Christian Democrats without a 
majority to elect a state premier. 
</P>
<P>
 After much negotiation, the Social Democrats agreed to join forces with the 
Greens, who in several state votes now have become the third political force. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a risky decision for the Social Democrats, who fear losing centrist 
voters throughout the country, but they managed to stave off a "grand 
coalition" with the Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Communists won a stunning 20% of the state vote, presumably among 
easterners disillusioned with the high cost of capitalism. Seven members of the 
Party of Democratic Socialism voted for the Social Democratic premier, Reinhard 
Hoeppner, and the others abstained. Hoeppner will need the party's support to 
pass laws. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after losing the state, the Christian Democrats put out their "red" ads. 
They represent a change in strategy for Kohl, who has been leading in opinion 
polls with a campaign based on his experience as a statesman and on upbeat 
economic predictions.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Kohl wishes he had stuck to the old strategy. Party chiefs in all five 
eastern states have announced they will not be using the sock ads.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CHRISTOPHER, CONTACT GROUP FACE HARD CHOICES IN BOSNIAN 
CONFLICT; BALKANS: THE MEDIATORS DIFFER IN THEIR APPROACH FOLLOWING SERBS' 
REJECTION OF LAST-CHANCE PEACE DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb rejection of a last-chance peace plan and attacks on U.N. 
soldiers have cornered world powers into choosing between military punishments 
they have no stomach for or less-daunting actions that risk worsening the 
Balkan bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than demonstrating international resolve to end the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, today's diplomatic grappling among U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher and four European foreign ministers is expected to bolster 
Serbian nationalists' confidence that no outside power will intervene to stop 
their land grab. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher and his counterparts from the five-nation Contact Group, as the 
latest assemblage of mediators in the Balkan conflict is known, are gathering 
here to ponder a response to the Serbs' spurning of a proposal aimed at forcing 
peace in Bosnia by ethnically segregating its diverse peoples. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian gunmen loyal to warlord Radovan Karadzic have underscored their 
opposition to the partition terms by reimposing a total blockade of Sarajevo, 
firing on civilians in the U.N. "safe haven" of Gorazde and attacking U.N. 
soldiers and aircraft attempting to deliver humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher and the foreign ministers of Russia, Britain, France and Germany 
warned earlier this month of serious consequences for any Bosnian faction 
refusing to endorse their formula for a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sarajevo government representing Muslims, Croats and others committed to 
an integrated Bosnia reluctantly conceded to the Contact Group's proposal to 
roughly split their republic with rebel Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic's nationalist gunmen, who have conquered and "ethnically cleansed" 
more than 70% of Bosnia, rejected the plan earlier this month because they want 
more territory and the right to add their war spoils to an emerging Greater 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony before Congress on Thursday, prior to his departure for this 
Swiss lakeside city, Christopher said the Serbs' intransigence means the 
Contact Group nations might be compelled to lift an arms embargo that has left 
the Bosnian government army unable to acquire weapons for defense against the 
heavily armed Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 But French Defense Minister Francois Leotard warned the Senate Armed Services 
Committee that such action would trigger an immediate widening of the 
27-month-old war that has already killed 250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Leotard said France would not rule out providing arms to the Muslim-led 
government as a last resort, but he made clear his nation's preference for a 
phased response to Serbian defiance. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you lift this arms embargo, we are on the side of the Muslim Bosnians and 
against the other parts (of the conflict)," Leotard told reporters in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing British concerns for international peacekeepers already deployed in 
Bosnia, Leotard said taking sides against the Serbs would expose the U.N. 
Protection Force to unacceptable risks. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly 40,000-strong peacekeeping force maintains a neutral stance in the 
conflict. Its only task is to escort aid convoys and monitor cease-fire 
agreements worked out by the warring sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern for British and French soldiers in Bosnia has also made those two main 
troop-contributing nations reluctant to endorse NATO air strikes to force 
Bosnian Serbs to abide by U.N. Security Council resolutions aimed at protecting 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Reluctance to use military force against the Serbs has been palpable since two 
token North Atlantic Treaty Organization air strikes against rebel artillery in 
April spurred a wave of hostage-taking and harassment of the U.N. force. 
</P>
<P>
 British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd earlier this week made clear his 
reservations about further use of air power when he pushed for a tightening of 
economic sanctions against the rebels and their patrons in neighboring Serbia 
instead of NATO bombing sorties that might again put peacekeepers in peril. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia is also opposed to any use of force against the Serbs, fearing 
repercussions at home among nationalist politicians who accuse President Boris 
N. Yeltsin of kowtowing to the West rather than coming to the aid of Serbs, 
with whom Russians share the Orthodox religion and a Slavic heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 With virtually no support among the allies for military intervention to 
eradicate the nationalist virus, and amid obvious internal squabbles about 
lifting the arms embargo or conducting further air strikes, Christopher and his 
European colleagues appear to be leaning toward more symbolic measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic sanctions levied against the rebels' patrons in the rump Yugoslavia 
more than two years ago have not dented the Serbian drive to forcibly annex 
huge swaths of Bosnia and Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet officials of the Contact Group who met here Friday to prepare for the 
foreign ministers' meeting said they were focusing on measures that would first 
tighten the ineffectual existing sanctions, then raise the prospect of further 
use of NATO air power later if the rebels persist with attacks on Bosnian 
civilians and U.N. personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 With no credible threat of punishment for a series of deadly actions by the 
Bosnian Serbs over the past few weeks, the rebels are expected to again wait 
out the international attention now fleetingly focused on the intractable 
crisis then press on with their campaign to build an expanded Serbian state.

PALESTINIANS BAN PRO-JORDAN NEWSPAPER 
</P>

<P>
 A decision by Palestinian authorities to prevent the distribution of a 
pro-Jordanian newspaper in Gaza and Jericho raised a storm of protest among 
editors and opposition figures Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first instance of overt censorship by the newly formed Palestinian 
Authority, police seized all issues of An Nahar, a newspaper known for its 
pro-Jordanian leanings, when they were trucked into Gaza before dawn Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a policy of dark regimes," An Nahar's editor, Othman Hallaq, told the 
Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot accept a collective punitive measure that suppresses publication or 
distribution of a paper," said Hanan Mikhail-Ashrawi, a former Palestinian 
peace negotiator who now heads a civil rights commission formed to monitor the 
new leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Freedom of expression and the press must be respected," Mikhail-Ashrawi told 
the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Another pro-Jordanian publisher said he decided to cease publication after 
learning his newspaper would also be banned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have stayed in Europe and published my paper, as so many Arab editors 
do, but I thought there would be freedom of expression and democracy under the 
Palestinian authorities," said Nasser Eddin Nashashibi.  
</P>
<P>
 Nashashibi said he has been publishing his weekly, Akhbar al Balad, for five 
months, and he makes no apologies for being pro-Jordanian. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are my views," he said. "I conveyed the invitation of (former) 
Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek to (Jordan's) King Hussein to visit Jerusalem, and 
I conveyed the invitation of Mayor Ehud Olmert to the king to visit. I am 
friends with the king. Why shouldn't I express my views?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yasser Abed-Rabbo, minister of information and culture for the Palestinian 
Authority in Gaza, told the Associated Press that he had no knowledge of the 
decision to stop distribution of An Nahar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not approve of it, whether banning the paper or confiscating it. 
Freedom of the press is sacred," Abed-Rabbo said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nashashibi said he has yet to hear such reassurances directly from any 
senior Palestine Liberation Organization official. 
</P>
<P>
 "All it would take is for a senior official to say something publicly, that 
this is not true. But they have said nothing," said Nashashibi, who said he 
received "hundreds" of telephone calls from supporters across the Palestinian 
political spectrum Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The move comes at a time when relations between PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and 
King Hussein are at a low. Hussein says Arafat has failed to coordinate with 
Jordan on the expansion of Palestinian control in the Israeli-occupied 
territories, and Arafat faults the king for laying claim to Muslim holy sites 
in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions between the two leaders were exacerbated when Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin acknowledged Hussein's role in Jerusalem's Muslim holy sites in a 
formal document signed by Rabin and Hussein at the White House this week. The 
Palestinians say that only they should have political control over mostly Arab 
East Jerusalem, which they claim as the eventual capital of a future 
Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
 The censorship fracas also comes at a time when Arafat is facing increasing 
criticism from Palestinians inside and outside the territories for his 
leadership of the Palestinian Authority.

MMM LEAVES BITTER TASTE OF CAPITALISM IN RUSSIA; FINANCE: INVESTORS PANIC AFTER 
FUND'S COLLAPSE, AS SHARES WORTH $50 DAYS EARLIER DROP TO VALUE OF 50 CENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 MMM. The three letters were on everyone's lips all week long, zigzagging 
across headlines in every national newspaper, dominating top-level meetings in 
the Kremlin and humming through a monstrous Moscow line of more than 17,000 
people and smaller ones across Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The name sounds like a candy treat or dairy product. But MMM is something far 
more sinister -- a financial Frankenstein that taught Russians one of their 
most painful lessons yet on capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise and fall of MMM, this country's largest investment fund, is a drama 
on a typically Russian grand scale. In half a year, the secretive fund rose 
from nothing to claim 10 million investors, gather $1 billion, according to 
very rough estimates, and force the government into an unprecedented battle for 
market control. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the MMM pyramid wobbled late last week -- in response to belated 
government warnings to investors and the news that the tax police had hit the 
firm with a fine of $25 million -- the panic reached a grand scale as well. It 
spawned the kind of lines of frightened investors that America has not seen 
since the bank closings of the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the crash came. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside MMM's central Moscow office, some of the more than 17,000 people in 
line had been waiting three days and nights in hopes of selling their shares 
back to the company at the promised price of about $50. At midday, the 
devastating news came: They could sell out, but the company, which had formerly 
furnished about 100% profit per month, was paying only about 50 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Some elderly women wept, their meager savings gone. Some enraged investors 
briefly blocked traffic. A few threatened to immolate themselves. Most 
investors, in one of the mysteries of the Russian mentality, blamed the 
government rather than themselves or MMM. 
</P>
<P>
 "My pension is 61,000 rubles (under $30) a month after working 37 years in a 
defense factory," said pensioner Nina Petrovskaya, 55. "Can you live on that? 
No, you can't. But the government doesn't care. The government never cares if 
you get poor. It only cares if you get rich. MMM was my only hope in life." 
</P>
<P>
 If the investors learned the first lesson of Capitalism 101 -- the greater the 
profit, the greater the risk -- the Kremlin too learned what happens when 
securities are allowed to run wild without regulation.  
</P>
<P>
 Most economists held that Russian investors were painfully naive but that the 
government had only itself to blame for the greatest private financial scandal 
post-Communist Russia has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 The MMM collapse had long been brewing, but it accelerated late last week, 
when the tax police announced that MMM owed them $25 million in fines and the 
Finance Ministry disavowed all responsibility for MMM's dealings. Stories on 
MMM suddenly dominated the media, and feverish selling of MMM shares began at 
Moscow's stock exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 The panic quieted on Monday, but on Tuesday, MMM closed most of its offices, 
claiming lack of cash and poor security, and began complaining loudly of 
government persecution. 
</P>
<P>
 In a direct challenge to President Boris N. Yeltsin, MMM President Sergei 
Mavrody turned the stock fund into a political weapon in hopes of fending off 
attempts to regulate him. 
</P>
<P>
 If the government continued to attack the firm, Mavrody said, MMM could call 
on the support of up to 50 million Russians -- the 10 million shareholders plus 
their relatives. It could also launch a referendum, he said in an apparent 
veiled threat to call for early elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "A new political force has appeared in Russia, one so powerful that to stand 
against it is hardly possible," Mavrody, who never makes public appearances, 
warned in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Although MMM share prices have dropped to rock-bottom, the company may yet 
resurrect itself. The line to sell had turned into a line to buy Friday 
afternoon, and Mavrody was promising that share prices would rise every day and 
be back to $50 within a couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing the Kremlin has done so far would prevent that, leaving it with a 
no-win dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 If the firm does grow and grow, millionaire businessman Artyom Tarasov 
conjectured, "the number of investors could reach 40 million, and MMM could 
just take over running the country's finances from the government." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the government tries to close MMM, it will again incur the wrath of 
millions of remaining shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper Izvestia compared the government's position as it watched MMM 
grow to colossal size to that of decent parents who find out their high 
school-age daughter is four months pregnant.  
</P>
<P>
 "What to do now that things have gone so far?" it asked. "Sue? Punish? 
Forgive? Help?" 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday, the MMM crisis had grown so acute that the Cabinet devoted more 
than an hour to discussing it, then conveniently leaked some of its choicer 
comments denouncing the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 MMM "is a group of skilled swindlers who take advantage of flawed legislation 
to bamboozle people and fill their own pockets," tax police chief Sergei 
Almazov reportedly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its harsh words, the Kremlin appeared to be opting for low-key action 
-- hoping MMM will collapse of its own weight and meanwhile writing a fast 
decree that would prevent another MMM from growing. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not they are swindlers, the leaders of MMM are clearly masters of 
manipulation. They took advantage of the confusion in Russian law and lack of 
legislation on securities to sell an estimated $2 million of shares a day in a 
company that has virtually no publicly disclosed assets. They reportedly 
managed to bungle their books so badly that tax inspectors could make no sense 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Unknown as recently as last year, MMM launched a saturation advertising 
campaign over the winter, promising the average Ivan Ivanovs of Russia that 
they could get rich quick if they invested in the company. The latest ads, 
still running on Russian TV, feature a dream trip to San Francisco for the MMM 
Everyman hero, known as Lyonya Golubkov. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike normal stock market shares, the prices of which are decided by the 
market, MMM set the prices itself, and they shot up and up, averaging a jump of 
about 100% a month since May. With inflation dropping but still running at 5% a 
month, few could resist, despite warnings from economists that MMM and other 
funds like it were merely classic pyramid schemes that depend on pulling in new 
suckers to pay dividends to initial investors. All such scams eventually 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Boris Raizberg said conservative estimates put MMM's worth at up to 
5 trillion rubles, or about 2% of the Russian state budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Reformists worry that the MMM scandal will undermine faith in the 
market-driven system they are trying to create in post-Communist Russia and 
damage the already shaky investment climate. 
</P>
<P>
 The political exploitation of the MMM crisis has already begun. Members of 
ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky's faction in Parliament on Thursday 
called for a special session to discuss MMM.

BOUCHARD'S WIFE WAS RAISED IN ORANGE COUNTY; UNPOLITICAL: SHE IS A 
SELF-DESCRIBED 'NAVY BRAT' FROM LOS ALAMITOS WITH A FRENCH MOTHER AND AN 
AMERICAN FATHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TURNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Lucien Bouchard seems the unconventional politician, then Audrey Best 
Bouchard is the equally unconventional political wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in France on the Cote d'Azur to a French mother and American father and 
raised a "Navy brat" in Los Alamitos, she holds both U.S. and French passports, 
but not Canadian citizenship. This means she can't vote for her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 While she has campaigned with him in Quebec, she is no fan of the numerous 
political dinners, meetings and other events that can quickly fill his 
schedule, and she avoids many of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Audrey Bouchard rarely gives interviews, and the Canadian press seems unsure 
what to make of her. Often, writers here fall back on Southern California 
cliches, with references to her blond hair or labeling her the "Valley Girl" 
(though she never lived in the San Fernando Valley). 
</P>
<P>
 With barely suppressed dismay, Bouchard declines to discuss in detail her 
depiction by Canada's press: "I guess they've portrayed me the way they see me, 
but it's not always the way I see myself. . . . I don't mean to complain about 
their attention, but I would prefer to be completely out, really." 
</P>
<P>
 She laughs, however, at well-meaning friends who lament what they assume is 
her lonely life with two children in Montreal while her husband works in 
Parliament in Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say I'm very independent, first off, and . . . I enjoy my solitude 
immensely. . . . I have two small children, and that's difficult, of course, 
raising my children when I'm alone a lot, but when I put the kids to bed and 
I'm all alone in the house, I'm very happy," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a booster of life in Quebec, extolling the charms and ease of living in 
Montreal. But she concedes there is much about Southern California that she 
misses "terribly," mainly family, friends and, in the depths of a Canadian 
winter, the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Her family moved to Orange County when she was 2, after her father, James 
Best, a U.S. Navy officer, was transferred from his Mediterranean posting. When 
they arrived in the United States, Bouchard's mother, Marie-Josee Massay, spoke 
little English. Though she subsequently learned, to this day she speaks to her 
daughter in French, and Bouchard replies in English. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a similar bilingual pattern developing with the Bouchards' sons, 
Alexandre, 4, and Simon, 3. While French is the predominant language at home, 
Audrey Bouchard spent the spring working to improve her children's English, so 
they could more easily make friends this summer while visiting her parents in 
Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from high school, Audrey attended Cypress College for a year, 
then went to work at McDonnell Douglas in Huntington Beach. In 1986, with her 
first marriage to her high school sweetheart ended, she quit and traveled for a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 While flying from Paris to London for a connecting flight to California, she 
dropped a magazine into the aisle. The man in the seat across from her picked 
it up and struck up a conversation. He was, he told her, Lucien Bouchard, a 
Canadian diplomat in Paris headed to Calgary on business. He asked her to 
breakfast in the London airport while they waited for their respective flights, 
but she hesitated.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was real leery," she recalls, "I didn't know this gentleman at all." 
</P>
<P>
 She did give him her California address, and it wasn't until the first letter 
arrived that she learned he was Canada's ambassador to France. When she moved 
to Paris to live with her grandmother and perfect her French, they began 
dating. Two years later, they were married. 
</P>
<P>
 Never personally involved in politics, Audrey Bouchard admittedly had a 
difficult time understanding why her husband would want to leave the 
ambassadorship and, at Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's request, return to 
Canada to run for Parliament. "But I could see he was very tempted by it, and 
he had already been over two years in Paris and was ready to move on," she 
says. "I didn't try to dissuade him." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple have stolidly accepted his up-and-down political career since, the 
explosive controversy he provokes and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
bodyguard assigned to him. In separate interviews, they expressed very similar 
sentiments: This is the life we've chosen. It comes with risks as well as 
opportunities. It's worth it. Let's get on with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The one resentment they both admit to is the separation from the children 
enforced on Lucien Bouchard by his career. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, Audrey Bouchard said, is that, when he is home, the children "have 
the run of the house, everything. . . . It's pure fun, and that's OK, because 
it's so rare."

ITALIAN EX-PREMIER CONVICTED OF FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Italy's sweeping corruption scandal claimed its highest-ranking figure Friday 
as former Prime Minister Bettino Craxi was convicted of fraud and sentenced to 
8 1/2 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Craxi denounced the in absentia conviction from self-imposed exile in Tunisia, 
saying it was "preordained" by his political enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, a close friend and confidant of Craxi, 
scrambled to keep his 11-week-old coalition government together, pledging to 
put his stake in a firm under investigation into a blind trust in order to 
avoid accusations of conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Berlusconi's brother Paolo surrendered to authorities investigating 
alleged bribes and tax fraud at the prime minister's firm.

TORY AUTHOR ARCHER CLEARED IN INSIDER-TRADE INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Best-selling novelist and Conservative politician Jeffrey Archer declared 
Friday that he is "grateful to have been exonerated" after Britain's Department 
of Trade and Industry cleared him of any suspicion of insider trading in stock 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The department announced that Archer was under investigation just weeks before 
a Cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister John Major.Archer had been widely 
expected to receive a government post or the Conservative Party chairmanship, 
but the announcement foreclosed his chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade and Industry Minister Michael Heseltine received the investigators' 
report a day before last week's Cabinet changes but declined to disclose the 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Heseltine, a political rival of Archer's, has been criticized for making the 
investigation public in the first place and then not immediately revealing that 
Archer had been exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers speculated that Archer was the victim of political "dirty 
tricks."

SENATE BACKS BREYER CONFIRMATION, 87-9; JUDICIARY: VOTE ENSURES THAT HE CAN 
JOIN THE SUPREME COURT FOR START OF ITS FALL TERM IN OCTOBER. HE IS EXPECTED TO 
TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE NEXT WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate voted overwhelmingly Friday to confirm Stephen G. Breyer for a seat 
on the Supreme Court, making him President Clinton's second appointment to the 
high court in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 87-9 vote ensures that Breyer, 55, who has been chief judge of the U.S. 
1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, can join the court for the start of its 
fall term in October. He is expected to be sworn in next week, when he will 
become the nation's 108th justice. He replaces the retiring Harry A. Blackmun. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer, who received news of the vote at the White House, pledged that he 
would "help make the law work better for people." 
</P>
<P>
 "The responsibility of that position is awesome, rather humbling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 All the votes against Breyer were cast by Republicans, but he won support from 
33 GOP senators. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate heaped bipartisan praise on Breyer, who was chief counsel of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee before being appointed to the federal bench in 1980. 
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the panel's ranking Republican, called Breyer "a 
man of immense qualifications, a man of immense integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Breyer won unanimous approval from the committee's 10 
Democrats and eight Republicans. Commending Breyer on his fairness and his 
skill in explaining complex issues, Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) said: 
"These qualities should serve Steve Breyer well on the Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer's principal opponent, Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), said that the 
nominee had underestimated his financial liability and the possible conflicts 
of interest that could result from an investment in Lloyd's of London insurance 
syndicates. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Breyer dismissed the investment as insignificant during his 
confirmation hearings, Lugar said that Lloyd's insures industrial polluters, a 
situation that could force Breyer to recuse himself from toxic-waste and 
asbestos cases that may come before the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer said that he would extricate himself from the investment as soon as 
possible. Hatch and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said that the committee 
had thoroughly examined the issue and found that it posed no judicial or 
ethical problems for Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Another opponent, Sen. Robert C. Smith (R-N.H.), said that Breyer had placed 
too much emphasis on the principle of separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot, in good conscience, vote to confirm a nominee whose personal 
background, judicial record and testimony indicates he will move the Supreme 
Court away from . . . conservative decisions," Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
 During three days of testimony before the committee, Breyer took generally 
liberal positions on such issues as affirmative action and the separation of 
church and state. But he also suggested that he could support capital 
punishment and stiff prison sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer and his wife, Joanna, have a net worth of $6.5 million, according to 
financial disclosure reports they filed with the Senate. They have a son and 
two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer was considered briefly for a Supreme Court vacancy last year before 
Clinton selected Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was confirmed last August.

CISNEROS SUED BY EX-LOVER OVER SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros was sued Friday by a 
former campaign aide who claimed he reneged on a promise to pay her $4,000 a 
month after they ended an affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Medlar filed suit in Lubbock, Tex., where she now lives.She said the 
affair continued for two years after she was hired as a fund-raiser in 1986 by 
Cisneros, who was then mayor of San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros said he paid her for about three years, but stopped when he was 
nominated to become HUD secretary in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I explained to Ms. Medlar that I would now be on a fixed government salary 
and would not be able to assist as I had, but would use some of my savings to 
give her some assistance so that she could transition to a job over the 
forthcoming year," Cisneros said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 He added in an interview that he offered to help Medlar for another year but 
"she insisted she wanted three years at a minimum and I was just not in a 
position to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 At some point, he said, "you can't give in to the threat if you don't have the 
money." Cisneros is paid $148,400 a year as HUD secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Medlar claims in her lawsuit that Cisneros made their affair public and she 
"was held up to public ridicule and scorn, and was publicly and thoroughly 
humiliated." 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorneys said Cisneros has paid close to $200,000. The lawsuit seeks 
$256,000 in actual damages and unspecified punitive damages.

VIDEO GAME MAKERS UNVEIL CONSUMER RATING SYSTEM; RETAIL: LAWMAKERS CHEER MOVE 
DESIGNED TO KEEP OBJECTIONABLE MATERIAL FROM CHILDREN. LABELS ON COMPUTER 
SOFTWARE ARE LIKELY TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to head off federal intervention in their industry, the nation's 
largest video game makers Friday jointly introduced a rating system to warn 
consumers of graphic violence or explicit sexual content in their products. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials said that parents trying to keep objectionable material out 
of their children's hands can expect to see games labeled with rating icons, 
which will explain whether certain video games are appropriate for different 
age groups. Text describing the game's content also will be printed on each 
package or cartridge. 
</P>
<P>
 However, parents buying personal computer software likely will have to face a 
second set of ratings, which were also unveiled Friday by computer game makers, 
who plan to label their products with different symbols and textual warnings of 
violence, nudity and profanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers and child-development experts cheered the release of the ratings but 
said that development of a single set of labels would serve consumers better. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a rating system, parents will have at least a fighting chance to control 
what comes into their homes," said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), who has 
spearheaded the drive for video game ratings since the release of controversial 
games such as Mortal Kombat, which contains scenes showing a martial-arts 
fighter tearing the spine out of an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The video game labeling system will affect titles scheduled for release this 
holiday season and afterward, including Doom, in which a player wielding 
weapons from a handgun to a chain saw attacks opponents, and possibly Mortal 
Kombat II. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials projected that 40% of the games sold this Christmas season 
and virtually all games sold next fall will carry the ratings. But the labels 
will not apply to games already in stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, announcement of the ratings comes as a crucial step for an industry 
that is struggling to maintain credibility with parents and a responsible 
public image. A spokeswoman for Nintendo of America said that about 40% of 
American households have a Nintendo game machine and she estimated that 20% of 
the most popular games are somewhat violent. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman and Sen. Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.) introduced legislation earlier this 
year to set up a national commission to regulate the industry but said they 
would withdraw the plan if game makers police themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of federal regulation sent Nintendo, Sega of America Inc. and other 
game makers, who sell about $5 billion worth of cartridges and compact disc 
games annually, scrambling to develop their own warning labels but video game 
industry officials said they now plan to fold the individual rating plans into 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 However, officials from the Interactive Digital Software Assn., which 
represents Nintendo, Sega, Acclaim Entertainment Inc. and other video game 
publishers, have been unable to reach an agreement with the Software Publishers 
Assn., which represents computer game makers, on how the ratings should work. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the software association's system, game makers would submit videotapes, 
story boards, scripts and other material detailing the most extreme content of 
their games to panels of three "demographically diverse" people, each of whom 
must be at least 21 years old, at the newly created Entertainment Software 
Rating Board in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Game makers could be fined or barred from selling a product if they try to 
hide extreme material. 
</P>
<P>
 The panelists, who will undergo training in the rating system, will recommend 
which label each game should carry after studying the materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The software association has spent more than $1 million developing the ratings 
but said the board will be independent and will become self-sufficient by 
charging game makers $500 per game. Each review is expected to take about a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Before games are shipped, they will be classified for five age groups: early 
childhood, which includes games for children 3 and older; children to adults, 
for those 6 and older; teen, for 13 and older; mature, for 17 and older; and 
adults only, for 18 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 "Early childhood" games would contain no objectionable content and could 
include games featuring characters such as Barney the Dinosaur. "Kids to 
adults" games could include cartoon-style violence. "Teen" games could include 
scenes of graphic violence with minimal blood, similar to Street Fighter, a 
popular sparring game. "Mature" games could feature graphic, Mortal 
Kombat-style violence. "Adults only" games could include extremely graphic 
violence or sexual themes, such as those portrayed in Night Trap, which 
contains bloody attacks on scantily clad women. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Software Publishers-designed plan, reviewers would not view game videos 
for content and would not label the games according to age groups. Instead, 
computer game makers would respond to questionnaires about their products from 
a new Recreational Software Advisory Council and attest that they had answered 
honestly. 
</P>
<P>
 Toys R Us and Wal-Mart, the nation's two largest retailers of video games, 
have vowed to sell only rated products and a Wal-Mart official said Friday that 
the company will not carry any sexually explicit games. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart plans to display signs explaining the new video game rating system in 
its stores, but enforcing the ratings by demanding proof of age with each 
purchase would probably be "cumbersome," the company official said. 2 Types of 
Video Warning Signals 
</P>
<P>
 Prototypes of the two rating systems developed by video and computer game 
makers to warn parents about content: 
</P>
<P>
 IDSA SYSTEM: 
</P>
<P>
 IDSA includes Nintendo, Sega, Atari and nine other game makes. The games are 
played on units hooked up to a television. 
</P>
<P>
 Labels will designate the age group fro which the game is designed. 
</P>
<P>
 SPA SYSTEM: 
</P>
<P>
 The SPA represents makers of games played on personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence: Destruction of living things. 
</P>
<P>
 Nudity/Sex: Revealing attire 
</P>
<P>
 Language: Mild expletives 
</P>
<P>
 Symbols will rate level of violence, nudity, sex and language on scale of 1 to 
4.

 President Clinton condemned the shotgun murders Friday of a doctor and another 
man outside an abortion clinic in Pensacola, Fla., as "domestic terrorism" that 
must be ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am strongly committed to ending this form of domestic terrorism that 
threatens the fabric of our country," the President said in a written 
statement. "I encourage a quick and thorough investigation into this tragic 
incident as the local officials work closely with the resources of the federal 
law enforcement community," he said.

MILITARY TO OPEN 260,000 NEW JOBS TO WOMEN 
</P>

<P>
 About 260,000 new jobs in the military will be opened to women in the coming 
years, but the ban against entering ground combat will probably keep them from 
top promotions, a Pentagon officer said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be quite honest . . . because of the prohibition against ground combat, it 
is not likely that in the next 25 or 30 years there will be a female chief of 
staff of the Army," said Edwin Dorn, the Defense Department's assistant 
secretary for personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 But a woman might be able to compete, that in itself a first, for top jobs in 
the Air Force and Navy because of changes made in the last 18 months, Dorn 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Those services have opened slots on combat ships and in combat aircraft, where 
most of the chances for promotion and high-level awards and recognition will 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Women in the Army and Marine Corps will be allowed to fly on combat 
helicopters, but will continue to be barred from those services' primary 
missions -- ground combat in infantry, armor and artillery units.

ALTMAN LIED ABOUT PROBE CONTACTS, GOP SENATORS SAY; WHITEWATER: ATTACKS CONFIRM 
THEY WILL FOCUS BULK OF FIRE AT HEARINGS AT TREASURY AIDE. THEY ALLEGE THAT HE 
GAVE WHITE HOUSE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman "deliberately lied" to Congress about 
the nature and extent of information he gave to the White House on the federal 
investigation of a failed Arkansas savings and loan with ties to President 
Clinton, several Republican senators charged Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee opened its hearings 
into the Whitewater controversy, GOP lawmakers quickly confirmed that they 
intend to direct most of their fire at Altman because of questions that have 
arisen about his role in a series of controversial contacts between White House 
officials and federal regulators looking into the failure of Madison Guaranty 
Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 From critical comments -- even by several Democrats on the panel -- it also 
became clear that the Administration is in for a much rougher time during the 
Senate hearings than it has experienced so far in the House, where parallel 
hearings took place this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman, a close personal friend of Clinton since their college days, "has 
become the eye of the storm," said Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.). 
</P>
<P>
 Although the White House has vowed to stand behind Altman, speculation was 
growing among lawmakers that his career may not be able to withstand many more 
questions about his involvement in Whitewater-related matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest allegation -- that he provided confidential information about the 
status of the investigation to the White House at a crucial time during an 
inquiry by the Resolution Trust Corp. -- could be particularly damaging, they 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman was swept into the center of the controversy earlier this month when 
discrepancies emerged between his earlier testimony before the Senate panel and 
sworn statements since given to investigators by one of his senior aides, 
Treasury Department Counsel Jean Hanson. 
</P>
<P>
 Contradicting Altman's earlier assertions that he did not learn of the 
contacts until March of this year, Hanson said that Altman had instructed her 
the previous September to keep White House officials informed about the RTC 
inquiry into allegations that Madison Guaranty funds had been illegally 
diverted both to Clinton's 1985 Arkansas gubernatorial campaign and to the 
Whitewater Development Corp., an Ozarks real estate project. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, were partners with Madison 
Guaranty owner James B. McDougal in the 1970s resort development. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 meetings and phone conversations took place between Hanson and 
other regulators and White House officials during a six-month period ending in 
February. The congressional panels are interested in the meetings because of 
suggestions that the White House might have sought to interfere with the RTC 
investigation or to obtain confidential information about it. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony before the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee 
this week, White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler and the 10 former and current 
White House aides who participated in the contacts all denied that 
Administration officials had sought to impede the investigation and said that 
the only information they received from the regulators could have been obtained 
from news reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler said that the contacts violated no ethics rules because their only 
purpose was to help the White House prepare for queries from reporters as the 
Whitewater story was unfolding. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the Senate hearings began, Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) said that 
the committee had taken a deposition from a senior White House aide who 
testified that Altman had provided him and other officials at a Feb. 2 meeting 
with a key piece of confidential information that had not appeared in news 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a deposition by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold M. Ickes as 
his source, D'Amato said that Altman had told a White House meeting that the 
RTC would not be able to complete its Madison Guaranty inquiry before the 
expiration of a deadline for filing civil claims at the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Congress not later extended the deadline to the end of 1995, White House 
knowledge that the RTC was not prepared to file suit could have undermined the 
case by removing any incentive for the Clintons to cooperate with federal 
investigators until after the statute of limitations for civil complaints had 
expired, D'Amato contended. 
</P>
<P>
 "This evidence makes it clear that Mr. Altman deliberately lied to Congress 
regarding the Feb. 2 White House meeting," he charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to D'Amato's charges, Altman issued a brief statement denying that he 
had given Ickes or any other officials at the meeting any information about the 
status of the RTC investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sen. D'Amato's statement today is simply incorrect. I did not have any such 
information. No information of any kind was provided on the status of the 
investigation," Altman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Treasury Department official added that, while he had not seen Ickes' 
deposition, the "most accurate" account of what transpired at the Feb. 2 
meeting was the one that Cutler gave to the House committee on Tuesday. In that 
account, Cutler reaffirmed what Altman said about the meeting when he first 
testified before the Senate committee on Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, Cutler said, was requested by Altman solely to give White House 
officials "the same information related to the statute of limitations issue 
that the RTC had been providing to the Congress and the press." It was purely a 
procedural briefing that did not discuss either the status or "the substance or 
merits of the Madison (Guaranty) matter," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials also noted that at that time the Administration also supported 
the extension of the statute of limitations, which affected not only the 
Madison Guaranty case but hundreds of other civil cases that the government was 
pursuing against failed S&Ls. 
</P>
<P>
 But other GOP senators joined D'Amato in insisting that the Ickes deposition 
-- which has not been made public but from which they cited excerpts -- proves 
that Altman misled them when he testified in late February. 
</P>
<P>
 Ickes, they said, quoting from the deposition, asked Altman about "the 
progress of the inquiry being conducted by the RTC." Altman answered, according 
to the excerpts, that it was "going to take a longer period of time to 
conclude" and that it was "unlikely that the investigation could be completed 
and a recommendation made by the general counsel prior to the expiration of the 
statute of limitations." 
</P>
<P>
 Altman, who is scheduled to testify at the Senate hearings Tuesday, will "have 
a lot of explaining to do," conceded a Democratic committee aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Democratic senators, while saying that Altman should be given a chance 
to explain himself before he is publicly accused, admitted to serious doubts 
about some of the contacts in which Altman was involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it appears no criminal violations have occurred, I am deeply 
troubled by the conduct of some of the Administration aides," said Sen. Richard 
H. Bryan (D-Nev.), a member of the Senate banking panel who also chairs the 
Senate Ethics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 While D'Amato's charges highlighted the opening of the Senate hearings, the 
lawmakers spent most of the day reviewing the investigation of Whitewater 
special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. into the death of White House Deputy 
Counsel Vincent Foster last June. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he was working on Whitewater-related matters at the time, Foster's 
death precipitated controversy -- as well as a host of conspiracy theories. But 
both Republicans and Democrats on the committee declared their support for 
Fiske's conclusion that Foster committed suicide as a result of depression 
unrelated to the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning from the committee, federal investigators from both the FBI 
and the U.S. Park Police said they had found no evidence that the death of 
Foster, who was found in a public park with a gun still in his hand, was 
anything but a suicide.

WATERS-KING VERBAL SLUGFEST SPILLS OVER ONTO HOUSE FLOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The highly partisan Whitewater hearings ignited a two-day bout of verbal 
fisticuffs between Rep. Maxine Waters and a New York Republican that continued 
on the House floor Friday, bringing proceedings to a brief halt when the Los 
Angeles Democrat wouldn't stop talking. 
</P>
<P>
 After a huddle with parliamentarians, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) 
ruled Waters out of order for not heeding the repeated requests and urgent 
gavel-poundings of the lawmaker in the chair, Rep. Carrie Meek (D-Fla.). Waters 
was then allowed to resume, but had nothing more to say. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict began Thursday evening during the House Banking Committee 
hearings into Whitewater when Waters told Rep. Peter T. King to "shut up" after 
she objected to his pointed questioning of witness Margaret Williams, Hillary 
Rodham Clinton's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, an angry King took to the House floor to chide Waters, saying the 
remark, "even for the gentlelady from California, went to a new low." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not going to tell me to shut up. She's not going to tell the American 
people to shut up. And I'm not going to stop until we get to the root of 
Whitewater," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Waters got up and accused King of badgering Williams. "I'm pleased I 
was able to come to her defense . . . the day is over when men can intimidate 
and badger women." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans objected to the word badger , and then Waters triggered a 
parliamentary uproar when she continued speaking after Meek's attempts to halt 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, House business ceased for about 20 minutes as Foley effected a 
solution: It was OK to say badger , but it was not OK to keep talking. Waters' 
remarks after the gavel fell were stricken from the record. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters said she never intended any disrespect to the chair and mistakenly 
thought Meek was telling the upset Republicans to hush. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole affair spoke volumes about the state of sexual equality in Congress, 
Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are new to this place. Women are supposed to know their place. I 
exercise my rights and it's new for men. It's not easy for them to accept women 
as equal partners," she said.

MARINES WILL BE SENT TO FIGHT FIRES THAT DESTROYED NEARLY 100 HOMES

<P>
 Two battalions of U.S. Marines from Camp Pendleton in California will be 
dispatched to help fight raging fires in the Northwest that have destroyed 
nearly 100 homes and other structures, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines will assist the nearly 8,000 people now battling to contain 30 
major fires burning in Washington state and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp Pendleton spokeswoman Shelly Roberge said 500 Marines will leave Sunday 
and a second group of 500 will depart Monday. The Marines are expected to be on 
assignment a minimum of 15 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The fires, which were sparked by lightning last weekend, have blackened more 
than 130,000 acres of timber and grassland. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton told reporters Friday that 320 fires were burning in seven 
states and that the federal government had mobilized more than 330 fire crews 
and more than 200 fire engines, helicopters and air tankers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two battalions of Marines have begun training today and will be deployed to 
fight the fires as soon as possible," Clinton said. "Our hearts go out to all 
those who have been displaced, or who have lost property in these fires." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen homes and 79 barns and other structures have been burned and more than 
700 people have been evacuated, many of them visitors who were vacationing at 
resorts around Lake Chelan in the north-central portion of Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather forecasts have offered little cause for hope. The National Weather 
Service on Friday forecast below normal rainfall in the Northwest and above 
normal temperatures for August. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller fires continued to burn in Idaho and Montana. According to the 
National Fire Center in Boise, Ida., 11,500 firefighters, 600 fire engines, 100 
helicopters and 19 air tankers are now deployed to fight fires in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tyee Creek fire, the largest in the region, has nearly tripled in size in 
three days and is estimated to have burned more than 70,000 acres in the 
mountains of central Washington, officials said.

1786 PORTRAIT OF JEFFERSON STOLEN FROM POLAROID WAREHOUSE SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 1786 portrait of Thomas Jefferson on loan to the Polaroid Corp. to be 
photographed was reported stolen Friday from a warehouse safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The theft was discovered at the Polaroid Museum Replica division when an 
employee noticed the eighth-floor safe had been dismantled, apparently with a 
hammer and chisel, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-by-36-inch painting by Mather Brown shows Jefferson from the waist up, 
holding some papers, with a statue in the background. It was in a gold-colored 
frame. 
</P>
<P>
 The painting, owned by a descendant of John Adams, is believed to be worth 
between $1 million and $3 million, police spokesman Robert O'Toole said. 
</P>
<P>
 The safe did not have an alarm and no security guards patrolled the eighth 
floor of the waterfront warehouse at night, O'Toole said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Museum Replica division makes reproductions of valuable paintings for 
personal or commercial use, said Sam Yanes, a company spokesman. Nothing else 
was stolen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the book "Life Portraits of Thomas Jefferson," the painting is 
owned by Charles Francis Adams of Dover, Mass. Telephone calls to Adams' home 
in suburban Boston went unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist was a descendant of Cotton Mather, the clergyman and writer. Brown, 
who lived from 1761 to 1831, was a Boston native who moved to England in 1781, 
said Dorinda Evans, an art history professor at Emory University in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1786, Jefferson, then ambassador to France, visited London to meet with 
John Adams, Evans said. Jefferson paid Brown 10 pounds for the portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams liked the painting so much that he asked Brown to paint a copy. 
Jefferson returned to Paris, leaving the work behind so Brown could copy it for 
Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 The original was apparently left by Jefferson in France. Its whereabouts is 
unknown.

LAWMAKERS BLISTER CLINTON WELFARE PLAN; CONGRESS: MODERATES ARE ESPECIALLY 
DERISIVE, STUNNING THE WHITE HOUSE. USUALLY FAITHFUL HOUSE DEMOCRATS CALL THE 
INITIATIVE SIMPLISTIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's welfare reform initiative is coming under unexpectedly 
broad attack on Capitol Hill -- particularly from moderates in both parties 
whose support is critical to its fate. 
</P>
<P>
 At hearings on the plan before a House subcommittee this week, usually 
faithful Democrats were accusing the Administration of pandering to public 
sentiment with simplistic political slogans rather than devising a system that 
would help the people who need it. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials seemed stunned by the reaction, which appeared to 
forecast a difficult trip though Congress for an initiative that the 
Administration has characterized as one of its most popular with the public and 
a sure bet with Congress.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the Administration's harshest critics is Rep. Robert T. Matsui 
(D-Sacramento), who generally is regarded as a team player on important White 
House initiatives. During a hearing this week before the Ways and Means human 
resources subcommittee that began Tuesday, Matsui has pounced on element after 
element of the proposal, accusing Administration officials testifying about the 
President's plan of forgetting their own research and drafting policy based on 
public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
 In the style of a tough prosecutor, Matsui forced a co-chairman of the 
Administration's welfare reform team, Assistant Secretary of Health and Human 
Services David Ellwood, to admit more than once that there had been no studies 
on the impact of cutting off cash welfare after two years, a central tenet of 
the President's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you discuss this in a way that I'll be confident that these people will 
not be screwed?" an obviously angry Matsui asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of the Administration's team, including Ellwood, were clearly 
"shaken" by the intensity of the "Matsui tour de force ," according to one 
official who requested anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
 The Administration had contended that its plan would receive support from both 
sides of the aisle, but Republicans joined in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 One Republican lawmaker assailed a provision that would cut off all money to 
welfare recipients who had taken subsidized jobs but did not show up for work. 
"What about the children?" asked Rep. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.). 
</P>
<P>
 Another Republican questioned whether authors of the proposal had considered 
the clear constitutional problems raised by their decision to apply the 
two-year time limit only to the youngest welfare recipients. To contain the 
cost of the President's reform package, the time limit provision and most other 
elements would be phased in by applying it only to those born in 1971 or later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to write a reform that will work in reality and not in theory," 
declared Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.), another influential liberal on the 
subcommittee. "Reform here is critical, and we have to make sure we do it 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Reed, one of three senior officials who guided Administration welfare 
planning, defended his view that there is broad political consensus around the 
President's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been all kinds of points of common agreement," said Reed, who did 
not appear at the hearings. But in an interview, he cited only a Republican 
congressman's mention of a similarity between the subsidized work programs 
outlined in the Administration's measure and a major Republican bill. 
</P>
<P>
 During four days of hearings this week starting Tuesday, members of the House 
lauded aspects of at least nine competing welfare reform plans. "There are a 
lot of people who are just going to use this as a political football," said 
Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Others said it reflected the array of opinions about what ails the Aid to 
Families With Dependent Children program, the cash assistance program for poor 
families, and what should replace it. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have consistently claimed that they can count on the 
support of a large number of Republicans in Congress. But Republicans made it 
clear in the hearings that they want legislation that costs less, does more to 
deter teen-age pregnancy and forces a greater percentage of welfare recipients 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a consensus will be reached," said one Republican legislative aide. 
"But it is not around the Administration's bill." 
</P>
<P>
 What the Administration did not predict, analysts suggested, was that no 
matter how conservative its bill, Republicans would not be satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President's bill would have been viewed as extreme two years ago but, 
because of the ways the terrain keeps shifting, it can now be denounced as 
modest and tepid," said Mark Greenberg, senior attorney for the liberal Center 
for Law in Social Policy. 
</P>
<P>
 When the President unveiled his legislation earlier this summer, the 
conventional wisdom was that Congress would not take up the issue in earnest 
until next year. But since then, the new Ways and Means chairman, Rep. Sam H. 
Gibbons (D-Fla.), has said that he wants to deliver a bill before members face 
voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can do it," Gibbons said at a news conference this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Matsui said there are major drawbacks to proceeding now. "We could do 
significant damage" by tackling welfare reform during an election year -- when 
some in Congress might see political advantage in bashing welfare recipients, 
he said.

 Attorney Abbey Hairston said that Executive Director Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. 
believed that he had "full authority" to make such a payment from the treasury 
of the financially strapped organization. Only $80,000 has been expended so 
far, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "A full report will be made to board members and they will have a chance to 
work their will," Hairston said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis, who is returning from an overseas trip, "never tried to hide this from 
the board," Hairston said. She said that a former NAACP employee, Mary E. 
Stansel, has accused Chavis of reneging on a promise to her of a better job and 
of promoting male employees instead. But no sexual harassment charges have been 
raised, Hairston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 64 board members of the civil rights organization are up in arms 
and demanding an explanation. Joe Madison, who has often had disputes with 
Chavis during the executive director's first year in office, told reporters 
Friday that no such agreement could be entered into without a board vote. 
Another member, Mark Steppe of Detroit, called it "a moral fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, said Friday that they were willing to wait for an explanation 
from Chavis. Kelly Alexander Jr., a North Carolina board member, said: "I think 
it's premature for anybody to react." 
</P>
<P>
 Some board members complained that Chavis had not mentioned the case to them 
when he was asked about pending lawsuits during a convention in Chicago earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Hairston, however, said that notice of this lawsuit was not provided to Chavis 
in a timely fashion. "He didn't know about it when he went to Chicago," she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Chavis previously has come under criticism for announcing NAACP plans without 
first informing board members. In addition, the nation's oldest and largest 
civil rights organization has encountered financial problems as membership has 
dropped from a high of 1 million in the 1960s to under 500,000 in the early 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Board Chairman William F. Gibson, however, has come to Chavis' defense, 
declaring that the agreement was within his "executive authority."  
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Gibson said that Stansel's threatened lawsuit came as Chavis 
"was embarking upon the development of new strategies to redress the critical 
socioeconomic conditions facing the African American community." The settlement 
"removed the threat of disruption of the operation of the NAACP," Gibson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hairston said that Stansel, having been given a temporary six-week position 
last year, was "embittered" when she was not hired permanently. After she 
threatened to go public with a damaging suit against him, Chavis agreed last 
November to reach a monetary settlement with her and to help her find another 
job outside the organization, Hairston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stansel, who is a lawyer, could not be reached Friday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hairston, the settlement called for Stansel to be paid two 
installments of $25,000 each and then $5,400 a month for six months. If she did 
not have a job offer after six months, the NAACP was to pay her $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But the attorney said that Chavis felt confident "from the very beginning that 
he could get her a job and that this settlement was therefore the best course 
of action. He discovered, however, that despite his best efforts he could not 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Chavis "put Ms. Stansel on notice that he was having a difficult time 
finding work for her and the monthly payments stopped in June," she said. She 
described Stansel as a former supporter of Chavis who had helped him win 
election last year as executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Failing in his employment efforts, Chavis asked Stansel to give him a better 
resume that described her job qualifications in more detail "but her response 
was: I want my money," Hairston said. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 30, Stansel filed a civil lawsuit in District of Columbia Superior 
Court claiming that the NAACP owed her an additional $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Hairston said she has been told that Stansel "may have a litigious 
background," having lost a sex-discrimination case against now-defunct Eastern 
Airlines and having sued or threatened to sue a bar association in Alabama 
until officials there paid her $10,000.

GAMBLING ON NO. 21; RIDERS ALONG WILSHIRE ROUTE SHOW OPTIMISM, DISMAY AND ANGER 
AS THEY TAKE THEIR CHANCES ON CATCHING THE LAST BUS OF THE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Catching the last bus of the night home had become a high-stress game of 
not-so-musical chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Antoine Williams, 17, figured himself among the losers. Bus No. 2264 had 
rolled up shortly after 6 p.m., the last scheduled time for strike-shortened 
service on Friday at Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Street. 
</P>
<P>
 A few cries went up -- "Last bus!" -- and several dozen commuters jammed every 
seat and all the aisle space, leaving the doors to slam closed in Williams' 
face. Reacting in apparent frustration, he tried to kick the doors open, 
managing only to knock out a small window. He nearly fell as his foot went 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big hassle, man," Williams said from under his headphones moments 
later on the littered sidewalk east of MacArthur Park, where he contemplated 
walking -- until, surprise, bus No. 2116 pulled up at 6:15. 
</P>
<P>
 When still another bus arrived at 6:20, only three stragglers boarded for the 
genuine last ride of the night on Route 21, a 10-mile venture west down 
Wilshire to Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Under normal circumstances, Route 21 operates 24 hours and transports 60,000 
passengers a day through the high-rise Wilshire corridor, making it one of the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority's busiest lines, an MTA spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week's transit strike had turned the crowded MacArthur Park stop -- 
the eastern tip of the circuit, where buses made their U-turns -- into a point 
of confusion. The last bus? Around and 'round they'd go, but just when service 
would stop, nobody could know. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's another one coming pretty soon," Mary Morris, 40, said after the last 
bus had left, sitting on a bus bench that suddenly had become crowded again. 
She was only six or seven blocks from her destination and imagined she would 
just walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, nearly three dozen commuters were clustered again around the bus 
shelter, bound for points from South-Central to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Binder, 65, was only going to the Mid-Wilshire district a few miles 
away. But he had started home at 4, he said. And so Binder stood on the curb 
toting a plastic bag of tomatoes and grapefruit, peering into traffic with 
dying hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm wondering whether another bus is going to come," he said somberly at 6:45 
p.m. The retired Caltrans worker, who volunteers at a food bank in Highland 
Park, usually makes it home in about an hour, he said. But on Friday, Binder 
said, he had been forced to wait more than an hour for an earlier bus, which 
messed everything up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have to walk," he acknowledged finally, mentally tabulating 
another 30 minutes onto his commute time. 
</P>
<P>
 The confusion caused only concern among some travelers and outright 
exasperation among others. A woman who identified herself only as Mary, wearing 
a black bandanna and mirrored sunglasses, had missed the final transport. 
</P>
<P>
 She used words that were unprintable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way in hell the (MTA) should have allowed a strike, because people 
depend on the bus," she said. "Look at this chaos. It's a city in chaos." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary said she usually has to change buses to reach her destination on 42nd 
Street in South-Central. "And that's a long way." 
</P>
<P>
 House painter Ron Green, 49, whose car had broken down, had been relying on 
the bus to get to day jobs and back home. He had missed the last bus earlier in 
the week and ended up staying overnight with a friend Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a serious situation," Green said. "I live clear out in Studio City, 
which is a long ways from here. How do you get home in a situation like that? 
You don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Roselyn Protas, who had left Brea at 3:30 p.m., travels on parts of six bus 
routes to get home to Hollywood. By the time she had reached MacArthur Park, 
she had been on the road for 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little worried -- definitely," Protas said shortly after 6 p.m., but 
she was one of the lucky ones. Two buses came even after she stepped aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 On it went, into the evening, winners and losers. 
</P>
<P>
 Near 7 o'clock, Ibrahim el-Sayyed, 27, a visiting teacher from Israel making 
his first visit to the United States, sat alone on a bus bench near Wilshire 
Boulevard and Normandie Avenue. He read a newspaper and waited with apparent 
patience for the bus that surely would be along to whisk him to Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one picks up all the time, No. 21," he said confidently, repeating what 
he had heard about the route. Then he learned what so many commuters already 
knew, that the last bus was not just a fact of life -- but it was already long 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a problem," el-Sayyed said tersely. "It's a very bad experience."

SEISMOLOGISTS DISMISS CONCERNS ABOUT RECENT SWARM OF QUAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A swarm of about 200 small earthquakes, the largest a magnitude 3.4, have 
shaken an area southwest of the San Bernardino Valley town of Fontana in the 
last two weeks, but scientists at Caltech and the U.S. Geological Survey doubt 
that they are omens of a large quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because these earthquakes are so shallow and most larger earthquakes start on 
deeper parts of their faults, we see no particular connection between these 
swarms and larger earthquakes," said a statement written by seismologists 
Lucile M. Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey and Egill Hauksson of Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
 They also noted that this is the fourth quake swarm to strike a two-mile area 
centered five to seven miles southwest of Fontana in the last three years but 
that so far there have been no serious seismic consequences from any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 A quake swarm is a large number of quakes occurring in the same narrow area 
over a fairly short period of time. Many swarms last only hours, but some -- 
like the current one -- can last much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Hauksson said only 20 of the 200 quakes since July 13 in the Fontana 
area have registered magnitude 2.0 or above. A quake usually must be 2.5 or 
stronger to be felt by human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 The quakes have all been very shallow, occurring in the top three miles of the 
earth's crust, and scientists said they are certain that none has been an 
aftershock of either the 1992 Landers-Big Bear quakes, or January's Northridge 
quake.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; WILSON CRIME AD PROMPTS ANGRY REPLY FROM BROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson aired a new television commercial Friday that seeks to 
portray Democrat Kathleen Brown as opposing tougher prison terms for rapists 
and child molesters. Brown called the commercial a lie and said it was evidence 
that Wilson would do anything to get reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown fielded a new ad of her own Friday that focuses on the economy. Brown's 
campaign strategists believe the economy will be the pivotal issue in Southern 
California in the Nov. 8 gubernatorial election. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial, which says that Wilson "did nothing, year after year" as the 
recession racked Southern California, is running only in the Los Angeles 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the crime issue that prompted one of the bitterest exchanges of the 
campaign, in which Democrat Brown, the incumbent state treasurer, is trying to 
deny Wilson's bid for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-second Wilson TV spot portrays the Republican governor as an 
uncompromising crime fighter pushing for a "one strike" bill that would 
sentence rapists and child molesters to prison for life without parole on a 
first conviction. Brown opposed "Wilson's 'one strike' law," the ad says. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Rose, a deputy district attorney, appears on the screen to comment: 
"It's unconscionable that Kathleen Brown could oppose the 'one strike' bill." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Wilson's "one strike" bill ran into so much opposition in the 
Legislature that its author had to agree to substantial amendments for it to 
have any chance of passage. Brown opposed the original version but supports the 
amended bill, sponsored by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), Brown 
campaign officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The present bill would double the length of sentences for a first offense and 
impose a term of 25 years to life for a first-offense sex crime involving the 
use of a deadly weapon or causing serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual move, the campaign issued a statement from Brown, saying: "Pete 
Wilson's new ad is a lie! But it's just the most recent example of Pete's 
phoniness and political expediency." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, any response to Wilson campaign ads or statements comes from her 
campaign manager, Clint Reilly, or one of her press aides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have to be lectured by Pete on the importance of tougher rape laws 
and child abuse laws," she said. "That's why I support the tougher, smarter, 
more responsible 'one strike' law." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson campaign manager George Gorton said: "We believe it is fair and 
accurate to characterize her as opposed to the governor's original bill and 
fair and accurate to question her support for the compromise bill." 
</P>
<P>
 A Wilson campaign statement said Brown had "avoided taking a public position 
on the compromise legislation," but whenever Brown officials were asked her 
position on the amended legislation, they said she supported it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has said he would sign the Bergeson bill into law as an interim step, 
but would continue to push for a tougher measure that mandates a life term 
without parole for first-time rapists and child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and other critics of the Wilson proposal, including many district 
attorneys, said it was impractical because it would make it more difficult to 
prosecute many offenses such as acquaintance rape and spousal rape. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wilson's new ad on crime did not tell the whole story of the "one strike" 
issue, neither did Brown's new ad concerning Wilson's response to the 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad shows Brown speaking to an audience and gesturing dramatically as she 
says that "Wilson did nothing, year after year" as Los Angeles County lost 
450,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "While your family's been hurting," Brown adds, "he's taken $1 billion in 
vital services from L.A., raised taxes on the middle class and is giving an 
$800-million tax break to the rich." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown does not mention that she supported most of the budget solutions she 
criticizes.  
</P>
<P>
 The $800-million tax break for the rich also is misleading. Wilson and the 
Legislature added a temporary income tax surcharge for the richest Californians 
to help solve the massive budget deficit in 1991 and 1992. The surcharge is due 
to expire at the end of 1995. Brown says Wilson is giving a tax break to the 
rich by opposing extension of the surcharge.

WHITE HOUSE WON'T CHALLENGE COURT RULING ON WELFARE; LAW: ADMINISTRATION 
DISMISSES WILSON'S CONCERN THAT APPELLATE DECISION WOULD HARM CALIFORNIA REFORM 
PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move certain to anger Gov. Pete Wilson, the Clinton Administration 
decided Friday not to challenge a federal appeals court ruling that halted an 
effort by California to shift money from one welfare program to another. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had pressed the Administration to request a rehearing on the issue, 
which he says has huge financial implications for the state and threatens 
welfare reform experiments across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 After studying the ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San 
Francisco, however, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna E. Shalala 
declared that it will have no financial impact on the state and that it will 
not significantly affect welfare reform programs in California or elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has already petitioned the court for a rehearing, but the Clinton 
Administration's decision not to join in that request could reduce the 
likelihood that it will be granted, according to Clare Pastore, an attorney for 
the Western Center on Law and Poverty, which sued the state and federal 
government in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is a 1992 waiver granted to the state by the Bush Administration as 
part of a nationwide effort to give states more flexibility in dealing with 
welfare. President Clinton also supports greater flexibilty and experimentation 
by states. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had argued that the court ruling would limit the federal government's 
power to allow states to change welfare programs to encourage people to work 
and take responsibility for supporting their children. "The impact of the 9th 
Circuit's decision is not limited to my state," Wilson said in a letter to 
Shalala. "Welfare reform efforts in 15 states across the nation will be placed 
in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials insisted Friday that the ruling does not support 
Wilson's fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rest assured, the President would not have allowed this decision not to seek 
a rehearing to have been made if it had any implications for welfare reform in 
California or elsewhere," Avis LaVelle, an assistant secretary of health and 
human services, said. "The Administration is strongly committed to state 
flexibility in welfare reform and the use of waivers." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton told a meeting of governors last week that he would work with them to 
respond to the court decision: "I am determined not to permit that court 
decision to become an excuse to slow down the dramatic increase in 
experimentation we have at the state level in health care and welfare reform," 
Clinton said in a speech to the National Governors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing its decision not to join California in seeking a rehearing, the 
federal government said the ruling applied only to a waiver of existing federal 
rules so that California could increase Medi-Cal spending and reduce the size 
of cash benefits under Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the main 
welfare program for poor families. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulations permit Medi-Cal increases only if the state maintains AFDC 
benefits at 1988 levels -- unless a waiver has been granted. California reduced 
the size of AFDC benefits from $633 per month in 1988 to $607 per month for a 
family of three, but never increased Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruled that the administrative record regarding this specific waiver 
did not demonstrate that the federal government had taken into account public 
comment opposing the waiver and that the department must now reconsider the 
waiver in light of those objections. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalala concluded that the ruling only requires California to create an 
administrative record to support its previous decision and does not, as Wilson 
said in a letter to Shalala, "jeopardize all of the innovations" in the state's 
welfare system, including a program that gives teen parents rewards for staying 
in school and another that encourages work by allowing working welfare 
recipients to keep more of their cash assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastore, in an interview, agreed that the ruling does not immediately 
invalidate the state's welfare cuts but, he contended, it could eventually 
force the state to increase welfare benefits to the 1988 level. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wilson spokesman said the governor had just received Shalala's letter late 
Friday afternoon and was withholding comment until he had time to consider it.

BLOCKING KILLERS' PAROLE CAN'T BE RETROACTIVE, JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling into question a key component of Gov. Pete Wilson's anti-crime 
platform, a federal magistrate judge has ruled that Wilson cannot block the 
parole of convicted murderers whose crimes occurred before 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 If the magistrate's recommendation to U.S. District Judge David Levy is 
affirmed, the state could be forced into freeing up to 30 men and women serving 
time for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Magistrate Judge Gregory G. Hollows said in a ruling made public Friday that 
Wilson cannot apply a 1988 initiative granting California governors the power 
to block parole to prisoners whose crimes occurred before enactment of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 88, which went into effect in 1989, was passed by voters in the 
wake of failed efforts by then-Gov. George Deukmejian to block the parole of 
former Death Row inmate Archie Fain in a case that drew wide attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollows found that Wilson's policy of applying the initiative retroactively 
"without a doubt has actually disadvantaged . . . a class of prisoners whose 
offenses were committed prior to the effective date of Proposition 88." 
</P>
<P>
 "The court finds," Hollows wrote, "that the substance of the governor's power 
was intended to, and has worked to, retrospectively make (the prisoners' 
sentences) more burdensome. In this respect, California's law violated the ex 
post facto clause of the federal Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the governor denounced the ruling and vowed to fight it. But 
the lawyer for the prisoners hailed it as affirming a cornerstone of U.S. 
constitutional law -- that new laws cannot be applied retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here comes the federal government sticking its nose in the state's business 
again," said Sean Walsh, a spokesman for Wilson. "It's an outrage. . . . We're 
talking about keeping dangerous dirt bags in prison for the life terms they 
were sentenced to." 
</P>
<P>
 The incendiary nature of parole again became apparent when, earlier this year, 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown, Wilson's Democratic challenger, attacked the 
Republican incumbent for not taking steps to block the parole of serial rapist 
Melvin Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter received a specific determinate sentence of 25 years for his crimes, 
and he was released after serving half of that term because of penitentiary 
work and good behavior. By law, Wilson says, he had no power to stop Carter's 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor contends however that he does have the power to block release of 
convicted murderers serving "indeterminate sentences" -- and he instituted a 
policy to that effect upon taking office in 1991. Most people convicted of 
murder are given such sentences that can be as long as life in prison. But 
under sentencing law, they can seek parole for the prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 People sentenced to an indeterminate life sentence appear before the Board of 
Prison Terms after serving a set number of years. The board rarely grants 
release dates. But Wilson's policy has been to review decisions in which the 
board granted parole dates, and then rescind or modify them so prisoners' 
release dates are delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, it is important," Walsh said of the governor's policy of revoking 
the parole dates of murderers serving such sentences. "Those are 30 murderers 
who could be on the street plying their trade again, and that's something the 
governor does not want. He doesn't want any murderers getting out and having 
the opportunity to do it again." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, after Wilson blocked the release of one of the prisoners, San 
Francisco attorney Dennis Riordan wrote to the governor warning that his policy 
blatantly violated the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan brought the suit challenging the policy in state court, where a state 
court of appeal affirmed Wilson's policy. The attorney turned to federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't going to lose political points for it," Riordan said. "He wanted to 
be a governor who could say, 'No one gets out on my watch.' He was clearly 
wrong. The magistrate speaks a very simple truth. This is a case that cannot be 
lost in any federal court because the Constitution could not be clearer on the

 Hollows' decision came in a case involving Robert Johnson, convicted of a 1977 
murder. Johnson had a parole date and was on the verge of walking out of prison 
when Wilson intervened.

<P>
 Riordan said the governor did the same to five other prisoners about to 
released in 1991. If the recommendation is affirmed by higher courts, all six 
would be freed, Riordan said.

HUBER CASE EVIDENCE ON WAY TO O.C.; COURTS: IN SEPARATE HEARINGS, FAMALARO 
HEARS FIRST-DEGREE MURDER CHARGES AND JUDGE ORDERS TRANSFER OF TRUCKLOAD OF 
MATERIAL FROM ARIZONA.

<P>
 A judge on Friday informed John J. Famalaro that he faces charges of 
first-degree murder and kidnaping in Orange County in connection with the death 
of Denise Huber and set an extradition hearing in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate hearing, another judge approved the transfer of all evidence in 
the case to Costa Mesa, directed Famalaro to provide blood, saliva, hair and 
handwriting samples to prosecutors and ordered all local law enforcement 
personnel to preserve their notes from the investigation for possible use by 
the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa police detectives Linda Giesler and Frank Rudisill, who have spent 
nearly two weeks in Prescott working on the case, are scheduled to drive a 
moving van filled with evidence, including the 23-cubic-foot freezer in which 
Famalaro allegedly stored Huber's battered body for three years, back to Orange 
County today. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. Ron Smith and the two detectives spent more than two hours Friday 
evening loading carefully labeled boxes, filing cabinets and lumber from a 
dismantled cabinet in Famalaro house into the 17-foot truck outside the Yavapai 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost filled to the roof," Smith said as he carried out a box. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's body is scheduled to be flown today from Phoenix, where an autopsy was 
conducted, to South Dakota, where her family is planning a funeral Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber, a 23-year-old waitress from Newport Beach, disappeared after a rock 
concert June 3, 1991. Police discovered her bludgeoned body wrapped in trash 
bags in the freezer in a stolen Ryder truck outside Famalaro's Prescott Country 
Club home earlier this month. Famalaro was arrested on murder charges, but on 
Thursday, authorities filed papers to move the case to Orange County, where 
they believe Huber was kidnaped and killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking gaunt in a bright orange jail uniform, Famalaro, 37, stood during the 
five-minute hearing Friday afternoon in Yavapai County Courthouse with his 
hands shackled to a chain around his waist, clutching a Manila envelope his 
attorneys said contained legal paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 When Prescott Justice of the Peace Robert W. Kuebler Jr. asked whether he 
understood the California charges and the Arizona fugitive warrant, Famalaro 
responded, "Yes, your honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuebler then read him his Miranda rights and asked again if he understood. 
"Yes, your honor," Famalaro repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuebler then set a hearing for extradition to California for Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Kelly, Famalaro's Arizona defense attorney, and Leonard Gumlia, the 
deputy public defender assigned to handle the case in Orange County, both said 
later that they are unsure whether Famalaro will attempt to block his 
extradition to California. They said a decision on that is likely within two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yavapai County Deputy Counsel Thomas Lindberg said that prosecutors in 
California had already set in motion the process of getting a governor's 
warrant to force Famalaro's transfer, should he protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia and two assistants from the Orange County public defender's office 
spent Friday in Prescott, talking with Famalaro and his mother, visiting the 
site where the body was discovered, meeting with Kelly and co-defense counsel 
Warren Darrow, and sorting through newspaper clippings about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks very challenging, very intriguing, and it may involve a man who's 
innocent," Gumlia said, cautioning that he had not had a chance to review any 
of the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second hearing connected to the case Friday afternoon, Yavapai County 
Superior Court Judge Raymond W. Weaver Jr. rejected Kelly's effort to keep 
Famalaro from providing the samples to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly pointed to a provision in the Arizona Constitution that protects 
suspects from giving evidence that might incriminate them. But Lindberg 
countered with case law in which the "evidence" referred to has always been 
interpreted to mean testimony.  
</P>
<P>
 Lindberg said the hair, blood, saliva and handwriting samples would be taken 
from Famalaro at the jail Monday.

MOST IN FORMERLY QUIET TOWN ARE GLAD TO SEE MURDER CASE GO; REACTION: SOME LIKE 
THE EXCITEMENT, BUT MANY DON'T WANT THE EXPENSE OR BAD PUBLICITY OF A 
HIGH-PROFILE TRIAL. 
</P>

<P>
 Sitting on a bench in the grassy, shady park that surrounds the Yavapai County 
Courthouse, 16-year-old Eric Moore said he had been counting on John J. 
Famalaro's murder trial to liven up what has been a lackluster summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping it would stay in town so we would have something going on," the 
ponytailed teen-ager said Friday between bites of french fries. 
</P>
<P>
 But there aren't many other locals who share Moore's disappointment that the 
house painter charged with killing Denise Huber and stashing her body in a deep 
freezer will stand trial in Orange County instead of here. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents say good riddance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born and raised here, and back then we didn't have bodies in freezers," 
said resident Marge Weiland." It's a grisly thing and I'm glad it's going back 
to California." 
</P>
<P>
 Others said they didn't want to pay the cost of a high-profile murder trial 
when the murder didn't even happen here. Many just want their quiet town to 
return to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need the publicity," said 52-year-old Art Mendibles, a Prescott 
native. "I just want to live my life. I don't watch the news or read the 
newspaper. I don't even care about O.J." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime resident Helen Maze, out shopping downtown with her grandchildren 
Friday, smiled broadly when she learned that the murder trial will be held in 
Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's just great, and you know why? Because I just know I would have 
been called on to sit on that jury," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Famalaro was indicted here last week, authorities decided to move the 
trial to California after blood tests showed that Huber may have died in a 
Laguna Hills storage bin where Famalaro was living. It was unknown Friday 
whether the former Lake Forest handyman will fight extradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Maze said the murder case has been the talk of the town ever since Huber's 
frozen, handcuffed body was found in a freezer inside a stolen rental truck 
parked outside Famalaro's Prescott Country Club home. Huber, 23, had vanished 
alongside the Corona del Mar Freeway more than three years ago after a tire 
blew out on her car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's all so tragic," Maze said." This is a small town and people care 
quite a bit about things that happen here. At the beauty shop, that's all 
anyone talks about. I always thought we would be exempt from this kind of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Prescott Mayor Daiton Rutkowski, 50, was busy mixing milkshakes and 
belting out a Jimmy Buffet tune behind the counter of his De Ja Vu soda 
fountain. The mayor and several of his loyal customers agreed that the trial 
was something they didn't need. 
</P>
<P>
 "A person should be tried where they committed the crime," Rutkowski said. 
"It's also been a lot of undue attention. You don't like negative publicity to 
put a stigma on your community." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Garrow, a 50-year-old real estate salesman, echoed the mayor's sentiments 
and said he had been particularly concerned about the financial strain on the 
county had the case been tried in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it belongs in this community just because the body was 
discovered here," Garrow said. "Economically, we should not have been strapped 
with a crime from another state." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Yavapai County Courthouse, which has been besieged with media and other 
out-of- towners since Famalaro's July 13 arrest, employees expressed relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing has just jolted me out of my seat," said 56-year-old Joanne 
Remender, a deputy clerk." It's usually so quiet here, so reserved and serene 
and peaceful. It's a different pace than in California. Some days it got so bad 
that I just had to go outside and sit in the park just to get away." 
</P>
<P>
 For Yavapai County sheriff's spokeswoman Laurie Berra, saying goodby to the 
case is an overdue pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so maxed on overtime, I'm above the level that's allowed by the county," 
said Berra, who has fielded calls from the local and national media during the 
past two weeks. "I've got to take some time off -- and I need some."  
</P>
<P>
 In the six years she has worked for the Sheriff's Department, Berra said, she 
has never seen a case like this, with radio, television and newspaper reporters 
swarming around her office seeking any new bits of information. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very relieved because now I can get back to my family and work eight 
hours a day instead of 12 or 15," she said Friday morning. "There's a point 
where you're getting paged at 10, 10:30 at night, 12 at night -- it tries your 
patience." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, life at the sheriff's office was returning to normal, with local 
folks buzzing about a disturbance in the jail Thursday afternoon in which a 
group of inmates -- not including Famalaro -- stomped on the floor, stuffed 
linens in the toilet and started a small fire. This, Berra said, is typical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they didn't like the tuna," Berra said. "They just get cranky and 
they put their sheets down the toilet and it leaks onto our desks. We've had to 
pump out our office a few times." 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the cell where the trouble occurred were denied visitors, mattresses, 
blankets and hot food for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Yavapai Sheriff Buck Buchanan: "This is a jail, not a hotel."

BUDWEISER BACKS OUT OF LATINO SOCCER TOURNEY; RECREATION: LOSS OF CORPORATE 
SPONSORSHIPS IS A FINANCIAL BLOW TO SEVERAL STRUGGLING BUT ACTIVE COMMUNITY 
ORGANIZATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For the county's Latino soccer leagues, the World Cup was a blessing and a 
curse. The high visibility granted to Latin America's No. 1 sport had offered 
the struggling leagues hope they might inch their way into the mainstream and 
improve the dusty fields they play on. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also means that Budweiser won't be sponsoring Orange County's annual 
four-month tournament of Latino leagues as it did in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the brewery's Orange County wholesaler contributed about $80,000 to 
the event, $18,000 of it in prize money, and Anheuser Busch Inc., Budweiser's 
parent company, matched the final game admission earnings to generate thousands 
of dollars in scholarships for local Latino youth. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, though, the marketing drain of the international championship left 
the company with little to spend on community events. 
</P>
<P>
 "The World Cup was here, and we spent millions of dollars just to advertise. 
All our dollars went into that," said Fred Arriaga, special markets manager for 
Straub Distributing Co., Budweiser's wholesaler here. He estimated that 
Budweiser paid $10 million alone just to capture the designation as the 
official World Cup beer. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup's drain on corporate coffers complicates an increasingly grim 
situation for Latino community events in Orange County. A weak economy, coupled 
with the fear that Latino street fairs could spawn the kind of melee that 
marred a Los Angeles Cinco de Mayo festival, is prompting big corporate 
sponsors to bow out of showcase celebrations they have backed for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's cutting back," said Arriaga, who helps decide which community 
events Budweiser sponsors here. "The economy is bad. The more cases of beer we 
sell, the more money we put aside for events, and sales are down." 
</P>
<P>
 The dearth of key financing is leaving local organizers scrounging for new 
backers and small-business donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, in an action that shocked downtown Santa Ana merchants, 
Hispanic America Advertising backed out of a five-year contract to promote 4th 
Street's Sept. 16 celebration. Three-fourths of the corporate sponsors that 
supported the event last year had failed to come through. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade, street fair and entertainment extravaganza commemorating Mexican 
Independence Day have attracted more than a million people over the past two 
years. Last year, Hispanic America reeled in big money from 42 corporate 
sponsors, including R.J. Reynolds, Pepsi and Kimberly Clark, said President Ray 
Garza, who hopes to regain the contract next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The event has even been beamed to 200 million television viewers around the 
world by Televisa. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, a majority of the sponsors decided to step aside, opting to put 
their dollars instead into retail sales promotions, and citing a disturbance at 
Los Angeles' Fiesta Broadway Cinco de Mayo celebration as a reason to bow out, 
Garza said. 
</P>
<P>
 At that May 1 event, at least 18 people were injured, none seriously, after 
youths started throwing rocks and bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 "In very diplomatic words, (the sponsors) wanted to see how other events would 
be handled. With half a million people attending, something could happen," 
Garza said, even as he stressed that Santa Ana's Sept. 16 events have always 
been family oriented and have never generated any trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fiesta Broadway fracas also prompted the cancellation of the Orange County 
Mariachi Festival and Fair a bit later; after learning of the problems in Los 
Angeles, some corporate sponsors of the mariachi festival backed out at the 
last minute, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this has been the toughest year yet," Garza said of corporate 
involvement in community events. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the blows, business leaders are still struggling to hold the 
events. But the last-minute scramble has not been easy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Downtown Santa Ana Business Assn. has hired Sergio Velasquez, the 
publisher of Santa Ana's Spanish-language weekly Miniondas , to take over 
Hispanic America's role in promoting the Sept. 16 event. Velasquez is also 
working to find promoters for the soccer tournament, held by an association of 
14 of the county's Latino leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 But Velasquez says he is facing troubles of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even for my own business, it's a setback. There were a lot of advertisements 
for the World Cup before. Now I need to find some other kind of sponsorship," 
Velasquez said. "For everyone, the World Cup absorbed a lot of money. All the 
big corporations, they want a break." 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez and downtown businessman Luis Mendoza said they still have a few 
corporate sponsors up their sleeves for the Sept. 16 event, but declined to 
name them because none have committed yet. 
</P>
<P>
 But downtown organizers concede that this year's event will be smaller in 
scope, if it happens at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get sponsors, we'll probably just have enough money to put our booths 
together," said Teresa Saldivar, vice president of the downtown association. 
</P>
<P>
 The association plans to meet Wednesday with Velasquez and Roger Kooi, Santa 
Ana's director of downtown development, to determine whether it has enough 
commitments to start planning or if must cancel the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Kooi said the merchants must come up with at least $50,000 in commitments by 
Wednesday. He estimated it would cost about $100,000 for a basic two-day street 
fair with booths, music, a carnival and parade -- a marked contrast to the 
$500,000 Garza's company spent last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kooi said his efforts to find last-minute sponsors for the soccer tournament 
have also fallen flat. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the tournament's final game packed the 8,000-seat Santa Ana 
Stadium and last year's event drew about 5,200 spectators, Arriaga said. 
Together, the two games generated about $15,000 for scholarships awarded by the 
National Hispanic Scholarship Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriaga said a secondary factor in the company's decision to withdraw its 
sponsorship was a concern that the association of soccer leagues was not well 
organized, but he emphasized that the main reasons were Budweiser's enormous 
expenditures on the World Cup and a general economic downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 Tournament organizers are now making a desperate plea for support for the 
games, which usually begin in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big operation and it costs money, and it's money that we don't have," 
said Humberto Lopez, president of the Santa Ana-based Restaurant and Hotel 
Workers Soccer League and a tournament organizer. "It's hard to ask friends for 
$40,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez is more circumspect. For now, the soccer association will have to 
piece together the games on its own, he said, and concentrate on presenting a 
good proposal to the corporate giants to convince them to participate next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking now only for sponsors for the uniforms and small things," he 
said. "We'll make small prizes this year, just to keep it together."

TASK FORCE TAKES AIM AT DRUNK DRIVERS; SAFETY: SHERIFF'S UNITS AIDED BY A STUDY 
GRANT HAVE BEEN PATROLLING SEVEN SOUTH COUNTY CITIES INTENSELY. THE FIRST 
CHECKPOINT OPENS TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Drivers might not know it, but specially assigned sheriff's deputies have been 
patrolling seven South County cities with the sole purpose of arresting drunk 
drivers. And tonight, Part 2 of their attack begins. 
</P>
<P>
 A sobriety checkpoint will be set up in Mission Viejo, the first of a series 
of checkpoints that will be conducted in South County under a two-year program 
that may be unique in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Office of Traffic Safety awarded the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department a grant of $377,620 after officials there said they had never seen 
an entire region try to marshal forces to attack drunk driving, said Sheriff's 
Sgt. Fred Lisanti. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said it was unique," Lisanti said of the proposal he wrote with 
Sheriff's Sgt. Hal Brotheim. "They said no one from a sheriff's department that 
contracted with seven cities had ever asked for one. That caught their eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the seven cities also will contribute $18,000. They are Mission Viejo, 
Lake Forest, Laguna Hills, Laguna Nigel, San Juan Capistrano, Dana Point and 
San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the roving patrols began Jan. 1, deputies have arrested 85 people on 
suspicion of drunk driving, the bulk of them in recent months, about 15% more 
than in the previous six months, Lisanti said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer the proactive approach and saving lives rather than focusing on the 
reactive, where we're picking up bodies, prosecuting someone for vehicular 
manslaughter or even second-degree murder," said Robert D. Breton, a Mission 
Viejo city councilman who works as a prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a very innovative, comprehensive way that enables us to 
coordinate with the other South County cities to combat a problem that knows no 
city boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Van Haun, a Lake Forest councilwoman, said she also welcomed the 
multi-pronged program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always a tragedy when someone is drunk, gets behind the wheel and causes 
a wreck," Van Haun said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each city decides when to conduct roving patrols. A city can put from two to 
six patrol cars on the streets to search for drunk drivers, Lisanti said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The roving patrols are the enforcement tool," he said. "There's no ifs, ands 
or buts about it. They pull you over. If you're drunk, you go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
 The patrols have netted more than a quarter of the 315 drunk-driving arrests 
in the seven South County cities made from January to the end of June, Lisanti 
said. In the previous six months there were 270 arrests made for drunk driving, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's first sobriety checkpoint will be set up from 10 p.m. until 3 a.m. 
at a undisclosed location. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisanti said that at least five sobriety checkpoints will be conducted in each 
of the seven Orange County cities by Dec. 31, 1995.

PROPERTY TAX DECLINE TO HAVE LITTLE IMPACT; FINANCE: OFFICIALS SAY THEY EXPECT 
THE STATE TO ABSORB MOST OF THE $30 MILLION IN LOST INCOME RESULTING FROM 
HISTORIC SLIDE IN THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE IN THE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The county auditor-controller office will be crunching numbers this weekend to 
gauge the impact of the historic drop in Orange County property values on 
government coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.95-million drop reported this week by the county assessor is believed 
to be the first overall decline of property values in Orange County, reflecting 
the region's soft economy between March, 1993, and March, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we can tell it is the first time ever in the history of the 
county," county Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs said. However, local officials said 
Friday that they don't believe the resulting loss of about $30 million this 
year in tax revenue will deal a severe blow to the county, cities or special 
districts. Rather, they say, the state will absorb most of the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, they said, is that in recent years the state Legislature has 
shifted most property tax revenue from local government to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, most Orange County school districts will not notice any decline 
in revenue, financial officers said, because under state law schools are 
guaranteed a fixed level of annual funding based on attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 The exceptions are Laguna Beach Unified School District and Newport-Mesa 
Unified School District, which rely entirely on property taxes to meet their 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our reliance on the property tax dollar is not as great as it was once, so 
the property tax valuation drop hurts, but it is not a killer," said Chuck 
Hulse, the county's chief deputy auditor controller. 
</P>
<P>
 County government now receives only 6% of the county's property tax revenue, 
down from 18% two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Hulse said his office was running the assessment figures through its property 
tax accounting system and multiplying the valuations by the differing tax 
levies in each city to determine how much each jurisdiction will get. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should know by next week," Hulse said. "Since the assessor had been 
predicting a shortfall, it will not be a shock." 
</P>
<P>
 Auditor-Controller Steve E. Lewis estimated that the total loss to all Orange 
County jurisdictions will be about a $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that more than half the property tax revenue now is earmarked for 
education, he said, "What it really means is the state will have to make up 
more money for schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Giritz, controller for the Santa Ana Unified School District, said 
although property values in Santa Ana dropped 3.63%, second only to Stanton 
where it dropped 3.8%, he expects "virtually no effect" on the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't do anything differently because we know we will get enough money 
from the state to make up the difference," Giritz said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, property taxes are the life's blood of Newport-Mesa Unified 
School District, acknowledged Mike Fine, the district's director of fiscal 
services. In the last three years, he said, the district has had to make 
"tremendous cuts," including staff layoffs, because of declining property 
reassessments. But this time, he said, he believes the district is prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 The devaluation "has potential to translate into loss of materials and 
programs and larger class sizes, but I don't expect it to in that we planned 
for a reduction," Fine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa City Manager Allan L. Roeder estimated that the $187-million drop 
in property values there will translate into a loss of about $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it will have a big effect because of other expenditure cuts we 
have made," he said. Moreover, he said, the loss may be more than recovered by 
a resurgence of sales tax revenue in the latter part of 1993 and first half of 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs said the happiest calls to his office this week have come from 
homeowners who expect to pay lower property taxes this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs said 115,000 properties in the county, most of them residences, were 
reassessed after it was determined that their market value had declined below 
their assessed value. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, the assessed value of another 142,000 properties will 
not be raised 2% this year, as is automatically the case under state law, 
because to do so would raise the assessment above market value. 
</P>
<P>
 He said property owners who have been calling his office "know lower value 
means lower taxes, and that means they are going to keep more money in their 
pockets."

POLITICAL RACES MAY BE LOST IN THE TRANSLATION; CAMPAIGNING: THE SOARING COST 
OF CANDIDATES STATEMENTS IN VOTER GUIDES MAY HURT UPSTARTS AND FAVOR

 Sherri Butterfield's campaign for Mission Viejo City Council is being run from 
a spare downstairs bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 A family friend will manage her race for political office because she doesn't 
want to spend the $4,000 to $6,000 most professional consultants want. But 
there is one expense she and most other candidates for local office will have 
to come up with: the cost to place their own statement in an election pamphlet 
the county sends to all registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 What Butterfield and these candidates didn't figure on, however, was that the 
fee for printing the statement would soar since the 1992 general election. 
</P>
<P>
 The county wants $900 from Mission Viejo political hopefuls for a 200-word 
essay in the voters guide. Two years ago, the fee was $550. 
</P>
<P>
 The increases are being felt throughout the county, with the exact amount 
varying because the fee is pegged to the number of registered voters in each 
election district. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, in the county's largest two-year-college district, Saddleback 
Community College, candidates paid $2,600 in 1992 for a 200-word statement, and 
will pony up $3,500 this year. In Anaheim, candidates will pay $1,400, up from 
$900 two years ago. In smaller Laguna Beach, incumbents and challengers saw the 
filing fee raised to $650 from $300. 
</P>
<P>
 The increases were prompted by a 1992 amendment to the federal Voting Rights 
Act, which requires the county registrar of voters to print voter guides in 
Vietnamese and Spanish, the predominant local minority languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the fee hike, candidates and political watchdogs fear that 
cash-poor campaigners might now think twice about running for public office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grass-roots candidate is getting priced out of the political process," 
said Shirley Grindle, a political reformer who has succeeded in getting many 
county campaign laws revamped. "It's going to become nearly impossible to get 
first-timers to run for office." 
</P>
<P>
 Translating and typesetting the statements into Vietnamese and Spanish is 
expensive and accounts for most of the increase, say registrar of voters 
officials. Printing costs are relatively small because the bilingual pamphlets 
are sent only to voters who request them. 
</P>
<P>
 A candidate may, however, pay an additional fee and have bilingual statements 
sent to every voter in the election district. It costs $300 to send the Spanish 
or Vietnamese versions, and $600 to send both. 
</P>
<P>
 Some candidates say it isn't fair to force candidates to pay such high fees, 
especially in cities such as Mission Viejo, which has a minority population of 
less than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's outrageous," said Norman P. Murray, a former Mission Viejo mayor 
who is considering another run for office. "It's a shame that candidates have 
to pay for voters who are either unwilling to understand the language or 
unwilling to go to school to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should this be so non (politically correct)?" he asked. "The ballot 
should be in English." 
</P>
<P>
 But the registrar of voters points out that federal law requires that 
bilingual ballot material be available to all voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a requirement for us; it isn't an optional thing," said County 
Registrar Don Tanney, who estimated that more than half of all candidates file 
a statement. "This is kind of eye opening for everyone because it's the first 
time it has really hit" the candidates in the county, Tanney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal amendment went into effect in time for the 1992 general election 
in November, but when the county tried to bill candidates for the extra costs, 
several protested. As a result, the county absorbed the increase. But no 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county is passing along the fee hike for this election, Tanney 
said there is a way to get out of paying it. 
</P>
<P>
 Statements aren't required, he said. "That's their own decision. A candidate 
might decide local mailers and flyers are better." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to financing a mailer, the candidates statement is still a bargain, 
Butterfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Production costs for a two-sided political mailer run at least $3,000 to 
$5,000 plus postage fees for about 20,000 households in Mission Viejo, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's more than I'll spend in my whole campaign," Butterfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, some candidates believe the 200-word essay has a legitimacy that is 
missing in mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates statement is "really not optional," said Mark Gaugan, who is 
running for the Saddleback Community College District board of trustees. 
"Without that statement, voters immediately have the impression that you're not 
a serious candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley McCracken, a declared challenger for the Anaheim City Council, 
remembers that a neighbor once told her, "I'm not voting for a person that 
didn't even put a statement. That looks like they're not interested in the 
election." 
</P>
<P>
 For local candidates, the statement fees come due at a bad time -- essentially 
before fund raising can pump resources into a campaign fund, Butterfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee is payable when candidacy papers are filed. Countywide, the deadline 
for turning in candidates papers is August 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Catch-22 is, until you've filed, people don't want to contribute," 
Butterfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 And three weeks before the deadline, her campaign war chest is empty. Like 
other candidates interviewed, Butterfield expects to cover the fee with a 
personal check and get the money back once she starts fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the opening of a race, this is a very large sum to come up with," she 
said. "And for a grass-roots local candidate, it takes a lot of checks for $5 
and $10 to come up with $900" for the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Grindle said the higher fees "definitely give an edge to the incumbents," who 
already know how to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 While she realizes the county is going through financial hard times and can't 
absorb the costs, Grindle said the county ought to be lobbying Washington to 
seek relief for local candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a federal requirement, but the way other laws get changed is by state 
and local people working (to lobby lawmakers)," she said. "When the county or 
state doesn't like something, they get plenty of laws passed on their behalf." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaugan favors a plan similar to the voluntary $1 donations to political 
campaigns that taxpayers can designate generically through their income tax 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all, we're not all like Mike Huffington (the millionaire candidate for 
U.S. Senate who is self-financing his campaign)," Gaugan said. "We have to 
allow for those who want to serve but are less able to fund a local campaign." 
Running Gets More Expensive 
</P>
<P>
 To defray the expense of printing federally mandated Spanish and Vietnamese 
versions of voter pamphlets, candidates in November's election will pay much 
more than they did in 1992 to publish a statement. Fees are based on the number 
of registered voters in a city or district. Cost of a 200-word statement in 
cities with elections in 1992 and this November: 04,21,17,10,09 1994 Registered

$2.7 MILLION AWARDED IN AIDS FRAUD; COURTS: HOSPITAL, DOCTORS ARE ORDERED TO 
PAY DAMAGES IN EXPERIMENT ON FIVE PATIENTS INVOLVING HOMEMADE DRUG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Climaxing the first AIDS medical fraud case to come to trial in the United 
States, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury ordered North Hollywood Medical 
Center on Friday to pay $1.8 million in punitive damages for allowing an 
"unethical medical experiment" on five patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision brought total damages to $2.7 million after jurors earlier this 
week found the hospital and two doctors liable for negligence, fraud, 
conspiracy and violation of state medical codes in administering the 
controversial, homemade drug Viroxan. 
</P>
<P>
 In that earlier verdict, four of the five patients who brought the civil suit 
were awarded a total of $925,000 for their physical injuries as well as pain 
and suffering. Although the jury found that the fifth patient was also wronged 
by the hospital and doctors, he was not awarded damages because the jury felt 
he sustained no harm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury made it abundantly clear that the doctors were guilty of AIDS fraud 
and that the hospital conspired with them," said Ray Henke, lawyer for the 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.8-million punitive award will be divided between two of the patients, 
Mark Addy and Roderick Garcia. They were found to have been the victims of 
"oppressive, malicious or fraudulent" conduct, which made them eligible to 
collect the punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the hospital, a 165-bed facility owned by American Medical Institute, was 
asked to pay punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Henke said that the doctors -- both of whom had their medical licenses revoked 
by state authorities because of the Viroxan treatments -- would probably be 
unable to pay large punitive awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The patients charged that Dr. Valentine Birds and Dr. Rajindra Sethi, a 
surgeon, had given them the drug, which was invented by an Orange County 
radiologist in his home laboratory, to gather data on its effects. Viroxan has 
not been approved for any medical use by the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit charged the hospital with "indifference to its legal, ethical and 
professional duties," in allowing the treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer for the hospital, Alan Rushfeldt, placed the blame solely on the 
doctors. "The hospital was not at fault, not at all," he said. "If you look at 
the initial verdicts, the jury said the hospital should pay only a small 
percent of the damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason they said the hospital should pay all the punitive damages 
was because the doctors said they were broke." 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors and the lawyers representing them could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The patients who brought the suit are still alive and none of them are 
currently in the hospital. But because their health is fragile, their lawyer 
said at least some of them may not live long enough to collect any money. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this goes to appeal, three of my clients will certainly not survive that, 
and the other two, it's not sure," Henke said. All five of his clients are 
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and three of them have 
full-blown AIDS, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The inventor of Viroxan, Dr. Stephen D. Herman, was arrested in 1990 in what 
state medical authorities said was the first action taken against AIDS quackery 
in California. He was later pressured by state officials into giving up his 
medical license. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman was originally named in the suit but was dropped from it on the eve of 
the five-month trial when he declared bankruptcy, complicating any action taken 
against him. He now lives in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deliberated for almost a month before reaching the verdicts.

CITYSCAPES / MATHIS CHAZANOV: VENICE BEACH JUGGLER DECIDES TO GIVE HIS CHAIN 
SAW THE AX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even the Venice Beach chain saw guy is not immune to mid-career crisis. After 
11 years of parlaying his stupid human trick into a modest level of renown, 
Robert Gruenberg is putting away the Sears Craftsman. 
</P>
<P>
 Off it will go into the garage (his landlady thinks he's in the gardening 
business), along with the bowling balls and a five-foot-long fake fish, all 
props for a wacky juggler who has long been a mainstay of the grungy stretch of 
beachfront tourist attractions. Gruenberg's loony, menacing persona is still on 
view for now, as he wears wraparound shades and flings machetes, bowling balls 
and offensive gibes with abandon. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gruenberg, 35, a sidewalk comic who made his shtick into a widely accepted 
metaphor for self-inflicted, death-defying stupidity, is not kidding about his 
decision to hang up the chain saws. After the tourist season, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 The gas-powered gag is artistically limiting, he says. Besides, his back 
hurts, he is tired of the chain saw guy's hostile nature, he wants to provide 
better things for his 4-year-old daughter and he is dreaming of a transition to 
a "Seinfeld"-like TV show called "Chain Saw Dad" or simply, "Gruenberg." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to leave while I have a hand left to wave," he says. "That's sort 
of a cute line, but it's also sort of pathetic that I'd have to do something 
that could hurt me to get people to watch me when I just want to be a 
comedian." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there are tourists to taunt, old ladies to threaten ("Don't pretend 
you don't know me, Mom!") and members of racial and ethnic minorities to insult 
-- whatever it takes to hold the attention of the fickle masses who drift up 
and down the beachfront like clumps of seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the hard part: crowd control ("Watch my show or I'll kill you") and 
accounts receivable ("Kids, if your parents don't give you some money for me, 
it means they don't love you."). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Torrance resident says he developed the chain saw routine to keep his mind 
focused on his juggling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was such a good juggler inside my bedroom, but when I got out in front of 
people, I would drop everything," he says. "But with the chain saw, I was so 
afraid that I would hurt myself that I was able to conquer my fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Gruenberg's debut came at the height of a boom in boardwalk visits linked to 
the increased popularity of seaside roller-skating, says Bob Goodfader, 
longtime owner of the Sidewalk Cafe and other beachfront enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain saw act has loomed particularly large, Goodfader says, because "it's 
an extreme, which Venice is. He's one real extreme and he's got a show that 
people really watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Gruenberg plans to quit despite a profitable run that included jobs 
in Las Vegas, TV commercials, appearances at corporate dinners and a spot on 
Johnny Carson's "Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Gruenberg says he intends to bid farewell to the boardwalk sometime in 
September, with a final flourish -- nude chain-saw juggling -- if friends will 
donate $10,000 to benefit AIDS care and research. 
</P>
<P>
 Gruenberg, who won some unfavorable ink when the IRS came after him one April 
on felony charges of understating his revenues (he pleaded guilty to a 
misdemeanor), takes up the collection before the whirring chain saw starts 
flying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on, damn it," he mutters. "I've got a Porsche." (The former operator of 
a used car lot really drives a secondhand Mercedes he bought for $700.) 
</P>
<P>
 Then he tapes shut the throttle and does his thing, flipping an egg, a 
half-eaten apple and the 15-pound machine from hand to hand, behind his back 
and under a leg. A skeptical volunteer from the crowd, meanwhile, lies beneath 
him on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm insane," says Gordon Taub, 23, who volunteered twice last week. "He just 
picked me out of the crowd. I'm looking for work but I'm not looking for this." 
</P>
<P>
 Why is the image of the chain saw juggler so striking? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like a metaphor come alive," says Leo Braudy, a USC literature 
professor and author of "Frenzy of Renown," a study of fame. "It's like someone 
made up the joke and he decided to do it . . . to pull together an image of 
chaos and turn it into some kind of artistic shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Mankin of Petaluma, a former machete juggler turned juggling impresario, 
says: "It has the element of risking everything for something trivial, for the 
enjoyment of the crowd. He should bill it as 'Chain Saw Juggler -- A Farewell 
to Arms.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Venice civic leaders recently named Gruenberg beachfront entertainer of the 
month, an honor worth $200 in prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 But they say his departure will not mark a turning point for the popular 
seafront strip. "I've seen more new acts this summer than in the last two 
years," says Mark Ryavec, executive director of the Venice Boardwalk Assn. 
"We're down one chain saw juggler, but we still have Chad." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Chad Taylor, who occasionally jokes and juggles on the boardwalk, has 
also wielded a chain saw from time to time. But he, too, is leery of defining 
himself by mastery of the noisy machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Gruenberg) is the main guy on the boardwalk," Taylor says. "I'm not that big 
on the Venice Beach chain saw title. I got into it because everywhere you go 
and do a juggling act, people ask: 'Why aren't you juggling the chain saw?' "

EPA TO SPONSOR EXAMS FOR RESIDENTS NEAR TOXIC SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will arrange health testing for 
residents of a South Bay neighborhood who have long complained of health 
problems that they fear are caused by chemicals from two nearby toxic waste 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 A top EPA official notified residents Friday that the agency has agreed to 
test their blood for DDT and other chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents, reporting ailments such as rashes, nausea and dizziness, have 
repeatedly called on the federal government to evaluate them medically to see 
if their problems are caused by chemicals. They have complained that although 
the EPA last month unveiled a $1.7-million plan to test the soil, air and tap 
water in their neighborhood, the government was not screening people for 
possible toxic effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Those to be tested will include the 33 families from West 204th Street east of 
Torrance who remain temporarily relocated in hotels after chunks of DDT were 
discovered buried behind two homes this spring. The neighborhood sits near a 
former DDT factory, now a federal Superfund site, as well as a former synthetic 
rubber plant site that is a proposed Superfund site. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leader Cynthia Babich said she was heartened to receive a letter 
Friday from EPA Assistant Administrator Elliott P. Laws notifying her of the 
impending testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very, very optimistic," Babich said. "It's definitely a first step, and 
we definitely appreciate the fact they're going to come out here and do some 
testing." But she added that some residents need more sophisticated testing, 
such as tissue sampling, in addition to simple blood tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Still to be determined are how many West 204th Street residents will be tested 
and the chemicals for which they will be screened. At least 100 people could be 
tested, encompassing the relocated residents and their immediate neighbors. The 
decision to launch a medical program was made after Laws visited the site July 
16 and heard residents complain that many could not afford expensive medical 
screening to determine if their health problems are linked to chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to Babich, Laws wrote: "I have witnessed time and time again the 
health traumas that communities like yours are experiencing, and I recognize 
that we in the federal government have an obligation to ensure that these 
issues are addressed." 
</P>
<P>
 The tests will be conducted by federal, state and county health officials, 
said William Nelson, senior regional representative for the federal Agency for 
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. He said that although such health 
screening is not highly unusual, "it's not something that occurs routinely." He 
added that he does not think his agency has been involved in such screening 
before at a Superfund site in Los Angeles County. He estimated that such 
medical care has been provided at eight to 10 Superfund sites in the past two 
years in the EPA's four-state western region. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide the test 
analysis, and the program will be conducted in conjunction with Los Angeles 
County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, according to Laws' letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA is investigating whether residents of West 204th Street will have to 
be relocated permanently. The street borders two toxic chemical sites now under 
intense federal scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 The former site of DDT-manufacturing Montrose Chemical Corp., now a vacant 
lot, sits to the northwest of the street. Directly to the north is the Del Amo 
Study Area, once home to the synthetic rubber factory operated by Shell Oil and 
Dow Chemical, among others. Most of the area is now an industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
 Montrose is included on the Superfund list of the nation's 1,200 most 
hazardous toxics sites, and Del Amo is a Superfund nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA, contending that the DDT found in the two yards came from the Montrose 
factory, has attempted to make the company pay for the estimated $2-million 
disposal of the contaminated soil dug from those yards during a federal cleanup 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 But Montrose contends that it is not responsible. In a compromise agreement 
reached with the EPA this week, Montrose has agreed to transport the more than 
1,000 tons of tainted soil to Arizona for testing.

QUICK REACTION FOILS KIDNAP ATTEMPT; CRIME: THREE MEN DRAG A 2-YEAR-OLD GIRL 
INTO A CAR AND THEN RELEASE HER UNHARMED AFTER BEING CHASED BY A MAN WHO 
THOUGHT THE CHILD WAS HIS. 
</P>

<P>
 It's the best mistake that Art Casas ever made, no mistake about that. 
</P>
<P>
 When Casas heard neighbors shout that a child was being kidnaped, he thought 
they meant his 5-year-old son. So he jumped in his pickup and chased after the 
old station wagon that was disappearing down South Shipman Avenue in La Puente. 
</P>
<P>
 But it turned out that little Johnny Casas was not the one whom three men had 
grabbed Thursday night from the sidewalk next to Northam Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Casas caught up with the fleeing station wagon a few blocks away, 
two of the men had jumped out and run away. The victim -- who was released 
unharmed -- turned out to be a 2-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators said the 2-year-old was unhurt in 
the brief abduction. They declined to identify her or her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said the toddler was with several other children playing on the 
sidewalk when the station wagon pulled up and one of the men commented on how 
cute she was. After failing to coax the girl into his arms, the man grabbed 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Casas, who was across the street at his sister-in-law's house, heard the 
youngsters' screams. He glanced up and down the street for his son, and when he 
did not see him, feared the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 When the kidnapers saw Casas jump in his truck to chase them, they pulled over 
about a block away. The girl was released and two men fled. Then the third man 
sped off with Casas closing in from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Casas, he feared that his son was still in the station wagon when 
he raced in front of it and forced it to the curb near Valley Boulevard. After 
discovering that the boy was not inside, he made note of the man's description 
and the station wagon's license number and turned around to hunt for the other 
two men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't wait for the police," the 36-year-old mechanic said. "I thought 
they had my boy." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Casas learned that his son was safe: his mother-in-law had given 
Johnny permission to go for a walk with some neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the boy had been unaware of the neighborhood drama "until he saw his 
dad drive by real fast" chasing the kidnapers, said his mother, Dolores Casas. 
At home a few blocks away, she had rushed to her sister's house after neighbors 
telephoned with the erroneous news that Johnny had been abducted. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw my boy walk in, I passed out," said Dolores Casas, 32. "I'd been 
so frightened." 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' parents have thanked him for his role, Casas said, and sheriff's 
deputies Friday were praising him as a good Samaritan. On Friday evening, 
deputies were continuing to search for the station wagon and the driver, 
described as Latino, between 28 and 34 years old, about 5 feet, 8 inches tall 
and about 170 pounds. The station wagon was described as a brown 1980-85 
Chevrolet, possibly with license number 2GLR280.

$1.2 MILLION AWARDED IN PERMIT FIGHT; COURTS: FORMER SOUTH PASADENA MAYOR IS 
GRANTED DAMAGES AGAINST CITY AND OFFICIALS WHO RESCINDED PERMISSION TO EXPAND 
HIS HOME AFTER WORK HAD BEGUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former South Pasadena Mayor Lee D. Prentiss had already cut up a wall and 
poured new concrete foundations for an addition to his Craftsman-style home 
when city officials abruptly revoked his building permit. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they wanted to make sure the changes would not spoil the 
86-year-old home on the state Historic Resources Inventory. But Prentiss 
charged that it was a reprisal by political enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury sided with Prentiss on Friday, returning a $1.2-million 
verdict in his favor, finding that city officials violated his civil rights by 
conspiring to revoke the permit to expand his home. Of the amount awarded 
Friday, $1.06 million was for actual losses and $150,000 was for emotional 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, ex-Mayor Evelyn Fierro, Councilman Harry Knapp, his wife, Clarice 
Knapp, a Cultural Heritage commissioner, and Transportation Commissioner Joanne 
Nuckols are liable for the damages. In addition, the jury found on an 11-1 vote 
that Fierro, Nuckols and Clarice Knapp acted with "malice or oppression" 
against Prentiss. Judge J. Michael Byrne scheduled a hearing Monday for the 
jury to decide on punitive damages against the three. 
</P>
<P>
 After the verdict was announced, Prentiss embraced his 17-year-old daughter, 
Leann, and wept. His wife, Shirley, was emotionally spent and did not attend 
the hearing, Prentiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sad day for South Pasadena because it shows what their political 
leaders have been doing," said Prentiss, who alleges that he lost his building 
permit because of his conservative political views. "These people were vicious 
and they tried to destroy me." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's lawyer, David D. Lawrence, declined to comment on the verdict, 
noting the upcoming hearing Monday for punitive damages. Councilman Knapp and 
his wife, who were present for the verdict, declined to comment. Other 
defendants could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal battle began in September, 1990, when a council majority -- Fierro, 
Knapp and ex-Mayor James C. Hodge Jr. -- voted in a closed session to revoke 
the building permit issued the month before. The permit allowed Prentiss to 
build a three-story, 1,750-square-foot addition to his house. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the permit was revoked, Prentiss had cut a new arch in a wall, 
removed concrete and bricks and had poured new foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they had to revoke the permit because an environmental 
review was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the state Supreme Court last July let stand an appellate court ruling 
that the city had improperly revoked the permit to expand the 3,500-square-foot 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthlong Superior Court trial got off to a fiery start when former City 
Manager John Bernardi testified that the council majority decided to revoke 
Prentiss' permit against the advice of then-City Atty. Charles S. Vose. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi also testified that Fierro, a liberal voice on the council, told him 
it was time to pay back the conservative Prentiss. Prentiss decided not to seek 
reelection when his term expired in 1988, the year Fierro became a 
councilwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Other key testimony came from activist Tom Biesek, who said that he came up 
with the idea of pulling Prentiss' permit and first discussed the plan with 
Clarice Knapp and Nuckols. The three then lobbied Fierro and Councilman Knapp 
to take action, Biesek testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried to get back at Prentiss for his political activities," said 
Prentiss' lawyer, David P. King. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury decided that Councilman Knapp did not act with malice when he voted 
to revoke Prentiss' building permit. Hodge, who also voted to revoke the 
permit, was dismissed from the suit by the judge because of insufficient 
evidence.

STATE DENIES SCENIC STATUS FOR VENTURA FREEWAY AREA; ROADS: LOCAL OFFICIALS HAD 
SOUGHT THE DESIGNATION SINCE 1990. THE CALTRANS PANEL'S REJECTION IS A FIRST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For civic boosters from Thousand Oaks to Calabasas, the Ventura Freeway is a 
refreshing, bucolic thoroughfare worthy of the highest honor -- state 
designation as a scenic highway. 
</P>
<P>
 But Caltrans sees it otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Two field inspectors who drove the 21-mile freeway segment between Thousand 
Oaks and Calabasas five times on June 1 had this to say in a staff report: 
"This segment rated low visual quality since it had a high amount of 
development." 
</P>
<P>
 And that was just for starters. 
</P>
<P>
 They took note of power lines, auto malls, drainage canals, billboard blight, 
pole signs, sound walls, office buildings, shopping centers and fast-food 
outlets. Using a scale of 1 to 5 -- in which 5 represented "outstanding vistas, 
flora or other features that afford pleasure to the highway traveler" -- they 
gave most of the roadway a grade of 1 to 2.9 (low scenic value). No portion 
received the highest rating of 4.1 to 5 (high scenic value). 
</P>
<P>
 So on Friday, after four years of debate between city officials and the state, 
Caltrans' Transportation Advisory Committee issued its first thumbs down ever 
on a request for scenic highway designation. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as it wanted to promote California's roadways, the committee said, the 
Ventura Freeway is simply too built-up and blighted to earn a scenic highway 
designation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're looking at an eight-plus-lane highway going through a commercial 
establishment, with high-rises and everything," committee member Kenneth B. 
Brown said in urging a no vote. "In 1963, it probably was a scenic roadway -- 
but it certainly isn't anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee said it prefers to reserve the California poppy-decorated 
scenic-highway signs for the state's lesser-traveled byways. Up to 175,000 
vehicles drive the Ventura Freeway in Calabasas daily; in Thousand Oaks, daily 
traffic volume drops to 140,000 vehicles, Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago said. 
</P>
<P>
 Business community members spoke in opposition to the designation, saying they 
feared it might lead to restrictions on private enterprise. Most said they 
suspected civic leaders would use scenic highway status to reduce the number of 
signs and billboards along the freeway, although officials said that was not 
necessarily the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scenic designation is for the purpose of removing signage," said attorney 
Robert M. Aran. "I believe this is just another effort to use a state agency to 
help cities remove pole signs." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Jackson of the Sign Users Council of California said he was representing 
small businesses along the Ventura Freeway corridor in protesting the cities' 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big, big, big tax dollars come off the freeway into the community," Jackson 
said. "With so many cities having financial trouble today, how can someone 
propose more restrictions on business?" 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-5 vote in favor of denying the request dashed the hopes of local 
officials who sought the label since 1990, believing it would boost tourism, 
promote good planning and aid in controlling future sign construction. Mostly, 
they said, it would have helped ensure orderly economic growth in the four 
cities along the freeway corridor -- Thousand Oaks, Westlake Village, Agoura 
Hills and Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's discouraging to me," Calabasas Mayor Karyn Foley said of Friday's 
decision. "It's a constant battle between the economy and the environment, and 
no one seems willing to negotiate a settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Mayor Pro Tem Jaime Zukowski said the state panel erred in 
judging urban freeways with the same standards it applies to rural roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some of the committee members were focusing on the original criteria 
for scenic highways," Zukowski said. "Those days are gone. There will be very 
few highways left in that kind of pristine condition." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling left some of the local officials who flew up to Sacramento to make 
their case feeling that they had been misled. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been stringing us along," said Fran Pavley, an Agoura Hills 
councilwoman. "It's been real weird." During most of her quest for the scenic 
designation -- which dates back to securing original legislation in 1988 -- 
transportation committee members seemed to be on her side, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Friday's no vote appeared to be a hard one for committee members to 
deliver. Several praised Pavley's and others' dedication to controlling urban 
blight along the freeway while encouraging economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 In casting their votes, committee members also directed Chairman Paul B. 
Albritton to come up with some other way to give recognition to the communities 
along the western Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep doing the planning work you're doing," said committee member O. Warren 
Hilgren. "Because that's what matters -- not whether you have poppy signs."

RATTLESNAKE IN ATTIC BITES HOMEOWNER IN NECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 A 64-year-old man stuck his head through a trapdoor into the attic of his home 
Friday to check on mouse traps and came face-to-face with a rattlesnake, which 
bit him on the front of the neck, critically injuring him. 
</P>
<P>
 The snake, which was on the same level as the homeowner's head as he peered 
into the attic, lunged for the man's neck "so fast, he probably didn't even 
know what happened until it was too late," said Capt. Ron Hamilton of the Los 
Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was identified as Donald L. Mathews. He was listed in critical 
condition Friday at Antelope Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews was alone in his home in the 40000 block of 107th Street West in the 
Leona Valley, a remote mountain area just west of Palmdale, when he was bitten. 
</P>
<P>
 He called 911 and was airlifted to Antelope Valley Hospital about a half hour 
after the 1:30 p.m. incident, Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told him to sit down, calm down and relax so the snake's venom wouldn't 
run through his body," said Hamilton, who said Mathews was agitated and 
perspiring when paramedics arrived to treat him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was coherent, but we don't know how much venom was injected." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton said it was the worst snake bite he had seen in 23 years as a county 
firefighter because of the man's age and the location of the bite. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1 1/2-foot-long snake was captured by an Animal Control officer Friday 
evening, said Mathews' wife of 37 years, Betty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very unhappy snake," Betty said after she witnessed the reptile's 
capture in her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband had a severe reaction to the bite, causing his face, neck and 
chest to swell dramatically, and he was placed in intensive care, Betty Mathews 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had six or seven snakes on our property over the past 19 years that 
we lived here," she said. "But never one in the house. Never." 
</P>
<P>
 Snake authorities say that more than 95% of human rattlesnake bites strike 
arms, legs, feet or hands. It is rare for humans to be bitten indoors, 
authorities say, although a 20-month-old girl was bitten on the finger inside 
her Santa Clarita home two years ago. She survived.

LEGISLATORS GET CALLS TO SERVE THE PEOPLE; FAVORS: TOURISTS ASK THEIR 
CONGRESSMEN FOR VIP TREATMENT AND HARD-TO-FIND WHITE HOUSE TOUR TICKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The constituent on the line was livid: He wanted his White House tour tickets 
and he wanted them now . 
</P>
<P>
 What he didn't want were those same lame excuses -- that each congressman is 
allotted only a handful of White House tickets each month. And that they go 
quickly on a first-come, first-served basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was calling us every name in the book," recalled the chief of staff for 
one San Fernando Valley congressman. "He insisted we were withholding his 
tickets because he had written the congressman disagreeing on his stands and 
that this was our form of retribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "He threatened to go to the media and blow the cover off our scam. He said, 
'This guy's a congressman. He can call the President and get what he wants. Now 
give me the tickets or I'll do what I have to do.' It was a conversation 
straight out of the 'Twilight Zone.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It's summertime in Washington, when tourists throughout Southern California 
flock to the nation's capital, eager to climb the steps of the Lincoln 
Memorial, visit the Supreme Court, maybe enjoy an afternoon at the Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
 Constituents by the hundreds approach their congressmen in search of VIP 
tickets, hoping to avoid those aggravating long lines at the district's most 
popular sights, including the House and Senate galleries, the White House and 
FBI offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Between June and August, politicians are deluged with requests that run the 
gamut from the courteous to the outrageous to the downright funny. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the time when the word congressman is spelled concierge . 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning each January, the calls and letters come: from constituents who want 
those hard-to-get White House tickets -- for the next day. Or the Valley 
plumber seeking a presidential audience to offer his solutions on health care. 
Or the voter who wanted tickets to the tour beneath the Lincoln Memorial -- a 
public loop that doesn't even exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the man who insisted that the Capitol is connected to nearby 
hotels by a labyrinth of tunnels used by politicians for lunchtime trysts with 
their mistresses. He wanted one local congressman to book him into one of those 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Some callers have done their homework. Others couldn't distinguish the Capitol 
building from the Washington Monument. Still others are like scenery sponges: 
They want it all, like the busload of Valley grandmothers who wanted tickets to 
everything there is to see. 
</P>
<P>
 By far, the hottest tickets are for the White House tour. Congressional staffs 
operate a computer system to trade the tickets like baseball cards, trying to 
fill the demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are never enough to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those tickets make us more enemies than they do friends," said one aide. 
"Because we end up turning away far more people than we can help." 
</P>
<P>
 The huge demand for tickets brings up a sticky issue for many congressmen and 
their staffs: Just why were they sent to Washington, anyway? To make laws and 
lead the nation? Or to book constituents' reservations at the local Holiday 
Inn? 
</P>
<P>
 Many congressmen use junior staffers to coordinate requests from visiting 
constituents. The job includes answering letters, securing tickets when 
possible, mailing brochures and arranging audiences with the representative. 
</P>
<P>
 Staffers see such gestures as a service, not an inalienable public right. The 
image many voters have of their congressman's Washington office, aides say, is 
a full-service gas station where staffers are expected to not only check the 
oil, but wash the windshield. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think their congressman is there to help make their vacations 
a better time. They think, 'By golly, I helped put him in office and he owes me 
one now,' " said one Capitol staffer. "Thank God a relative few actually make 
ticket requests because, considering the total number of constituents back 
home, not many know they can do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'd get on my hands and knees to beg you not to tell them. It's a 
terrible burden to us. It takes time and taxpayer dollars. We're not paid to be 
travel agents." 
</P>
<P>
 President Franklin Roosevelt managed his New Deal during the Great Depression 
with a staff of only four, historians tell us. Today, there are 3,000 
presidential aides. Capitol Hill employs an army of 30,000 staffers to assist 
435 representatives and 100 senators -- not counting aides in politicians' 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, each fields a request from one of the folks back home. Each year, 
depending on the size of the district, each of the five San Fernando 
Valley-area congressmen hears from 1,000 or more constituents, especially 
during the summer months. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the public relations value of such requests, congressmen often 
personally return calls to letter-writers and meet with groups for photo 
sessions on the steps of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Many see such occasions as a break from Washington's power games. Often, on 
the Capitol steps, several representatives can be found addressing groups of 
visitors, explaining the lawmaking process -- their voices trained like 
high-priced tour guides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather do this than the other things I have to do," Rep. Anthony 
Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) said after speaking with 53 Valley-area teen-agers 
on tour -- his shirt sleeves rolled up, his suit jacket draped over his arm on 
a steamy July morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "For good reasons and bad, people have less trust in government today. It's 
reassuring for them to see their congressman as a rational and caring human 
being, even if they disagree with his stands." 
</P>
<P>
 During Beilenson's speech, the junior high schoolers from Valley Student Tours 
fidgeted and fanned themselves with their guidebooks. They represented the 
diversity of Southern California: Asians, blacks, Latinos and surfer 
look-alikes wearing earrings and braces, Wayfarer shades, French berets and 
high-top sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
 While some didn't know the name of their local congressman, their questions 
were as insightful as those at presidential press conferences: What was your 
vote on the Brady gun-control bill? What's the hardest decision you've ever had 
to make? If you cast 10 votes a day, how can you possibly research them all? 
</P>
<P>
 Alison Rosenberg was confounded by her first glimpse of a Washington insider. 
Here was someone comfortable with power, yet smiling, easygoing and down to 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's obviously a really influential person," she said. "But he was really 
nice. He reminded me of my dad." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Michael Barrett of Sherman Oaks: "He's a busy man, so it's nice he took 
time to talk to us. He just talked too long." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, of course, is a city of connections. The best touring 
opportunities go to people with a long-lost uncle who's the night janitor at 
FBI headquarters. Or, on the other hand, those who can write an engaging letter 
to their congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Lisa Henley did. The fifth-grade teacher at Skyblue Mesa 
Elementary School in Canyon Country wrote to Rep. Howard (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa 
Clarita) asking for 50 tickets to the White House for her students' trip last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 And -- voila! -- she got them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, that's service," she said. "I had to pinch myself to believe it was 
really happening." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon even met with her students on the Capitol steps. "He took the time," 
Henley said. "The year before we met with Sen. (Barbara) Boxer, who dismissed 
us as fast as lightning. She said, 'Study hard,' and then she was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We elect our politicians to pass laws but also to take care of constituents 
when they visit Washington, to represent us as voters, whatever that means. It 
meant a lot to the kids. One boy said he really had fun -- that he was going to 
miss his memories." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Doolittle called his congressman back in March requesting White House 
tickets for a visit he and his wife would be making on the Fourth of July, then 
followed up with a letter in April. When he didn't hear back, he dropped by 
Beilenson's office when he got to Washington. Luckily, he got some tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reseda resident has mixed emotions about the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need somebody to be responsible for constituent needs. I don't expect 
the congressman to do it -- he's got enough to do already," he said. "But if 
the White House tour tickets go so fast, they ought to do something about it, 
like create more tours. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people in Washington apparently don't realize how important a visit 
like that is for people back home." 
</P>
<P>
 Some staffers do. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will call up and say, 'I'm a World War II veteran and I've never asked 
for anything in my life, but can I have two tickets for the White House tour 
this afternoon?' " recalled Eric Nasarenko, a Beilenson staffer. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you say to something like that, when you just don't have the tickets? 
It's hard. These people have served their country. It might be their first time 
in Washington. So you do what you can for them. You go the extra mile." 
</P>
<P>
 David Jorgenson, chief of staff for Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), 
hasn't forgotten what it was like to see Washington for the first time. It's an 
image he keeps in mind when constituents call. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see tourists in this city walking and gawking in aimless awe and you 
realize that if these were cars, we'd have accidents," he said. "I just wish 
the product in Washington was as good as its edifices. We try to make that 
happen."

RELIGION; TAKING COMMAND; SALVATION ARMY GEN. RADER IS REGARDED AS AN INNOVATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Salvation Army Gen. Paul A. Rader, the newly chosen top brass for an 
organization known best for its relief work, Christmas kettles and uniformed 
street corner musicians, is expected to bring some unorthodox ideas developed 
in Southern California to the staid global church body. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army center in Northridge has been one test tube for these 
innovations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rader, who has been commander of the 13-state western territory based in 
Rancho Palos Verdes since 1989, was called "innovative" and "a visionary" by 
Salvation Army workers in the San Fernando Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
 The lean, 60-year-old Rader became the first American-born officer to win the 
top Salvation Army post in a special election last Saturday in London, where 
the army was born and is still headquartered. He returned to Los Angeles from 
London on Friday evening to prepare for his permanent move back to take 
command. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be on the cutting edge of evangelism and the social service," 
Rader said in an interview after being greeted by a Salvation Army band at Los 
Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is always a tendency for a 129-year-old organization to settle 
down in comfort, but our track record here has been to encourage innovation . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 As head of the western territory, Rader launched five experimental New Life 
Centers aimed at attracting "unchurched" baby boomers to informal, 
music-and-discussion sessions without the usual quasi-military trappings. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Sept. 3, the Northridge New Life Center, nine months in the making, 
will launch "Nite Life," a weekly Saturday night gathering for music, 
discussion and gourmet coffee -- but no hymns, no prayers, no uniforms, 
according to Cecil and Joy Sellers, the envoys, or noncommissioned officers, in 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Gen. Rader's brainchild," said Cecil Sellers, whose Northridge home 
has so far served as headquarters. "Ours is the fifth New Life Center started 
in the western territory and only the second in California -- quite a bold 
venture for the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't see a need for a worship service until we have believing Christians 
who want to come to services," said Cecil. At last count, the Salvation Army 
had 450,000 members in more than 1,150 congregations in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at the rather conventional Salvation Army congregation and community 
center in Van Nuys, a Saturday night coffee house featuring a different 
Christian entertainer each week was added in April to the usual Sunday worship 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Troy Trimmer, newly assigned to Van Nuys with his lieutenant-wife Analene, 
said that attendance has been small but should improve with better publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Trimmer said that the army's new general will stay with tradition where it 
continues to work well, but "if certain methods don't reach people, we won't 
stick with them just because tradition is involved." 
</P>
<P>
 This strategy comes largely from concepts Rader was exposed to after 
interrupting his missionary work in South Korea for two years to study for a 
doctorate in missiology at the School of World Mission in Pasadena's Fuller 
Theological Seminary. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came to us quite discouraged because he saw the Presbyterian churches 
growing and the Salvation Army was not," said Arthur F. Glasser, a former dean 
at Fuller who was Rader's mentor from 1971 to 1973. At the end of that time, 
"he produced a dissertation that was very practical and beautifully written," 
Glasser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Pierson, who followed Glasser as dean of the school of world mission, 
said that Rader "really re-energized the Salvation Army in Korea when he 
returned." 
</P>
<P>
 After Rader and his wife, Kay, ended 22 years of service in South Korea in 
1984, they took posts in the eastern United States. He rose to the rank of 
territorial commander, briefly heading the eastern territory, then came to 
California to assume command of the western territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school of world mission, which has had more than 3,000 graduates since 
1965, named Rader alumnus of the year in 1992 in recognition of his 
achievements," said Pierson, who is currently interim pastor of Bel Air 
Presbyterian Church in Encino and teaches part-time at Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army, best known for its social service and emergency relief 
work, has been ever present during a series of California earthquakes and 
fires. Even here, Rader was not always the conventional leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the 250,000 gallons of water, 140 tons of clothing and other 
assistance provided by the Southern California division following the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake, Rader canceled officer training classes at headquarters 
for two weeks so that 90 cadets and 30 faculty members could join in relief 
tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a hands-on leader, remembers people and is a very fine speaker," said 
Capt. Stephen Hartt, who administers the army's 84-bed Adult Rehabilitation 
Center in Van Nuys, part of the army's nationwide network of alcohol and drug 
recovery centers. 
</P>
<P>
 In remarks to the press this week in London, Rader said the Salvation Army 
remains a theologically conservative, evangelical denomination with a 
pronounced social conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 "All across the world our mission is the same: to preach the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ and to live it out in compassionate service to the neediest among us," 
he said. "We specialize in the hard cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Salvation Army founder William Booth, a former Methodist, began the 
organization in London in 1865. The American branch was created in 1880. A 
daughter, Evangeline Booth, headed the U.S. movement from 1904 to 1934. When 
she was chosen to lead the international organization from 1934 to 1939, she 
had already become an American citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 But American-born Salvationists, as they often call themselves, were shut out 
of the top post in later years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears there had been a reluctance to pick a general of the international 
army from the largest and wealthiest of the army branches," said Diane Winston, 
who is completing a doctoral dissertation at Princeton University on the 
Salvation Army and U.S. popular culture. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Raider waved away any suggestion of an anti-American bias in the 
army. "In recent years, we've had Canadians and Australians, a Swede and a 
Finn, as general," he said. "I like to think it's always been the right person 
for the moment."

VOLUNTEERS REACH OUT TO HOMELESS VETS; RELIEF: THREE-DAY 'STAND DOWN 1994' AT 
VENTURA COLLEGE OFFERS FREE MEDICAL CARE, LEGAL HELP AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES. 
IT'S A WAY OF SAYING 'THANKS.' 
</P>

<P>
 It was a homecoming that Joe Gonzales had waited nearly two decades for. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ventura College football field, in a tent city opened Friday for 
homeless veterans, the 36-year-old ex-Marine was feeling good about having 
defended his country. 
</P>
<P>
 By noon, he and his two boys had received free meals and free legal help. 
Their afternoon agenda included medical exams, dental checkups and haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In all the years since leaving the Marine Corps, Gonzales hasn't gotten much 
help as a veteran. That changed dramatically in just a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what all of us needed," the Vietnam veteran said. "I feel like 
somebody is finally saying, 'Thank you.' Nobody ever said that to us." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 120 homeless veterans from throughout Ventura County took part 
Friday in "Stand Down 1994," a three-day relief effort offering free medical 
care, legal help and other social services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hell of a setup," said 42-year-old Lonnie Ellis, picking out a new 
pair of shoes and a new set of clothes at the college gym. "It kind of makes a 
vet feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 Stand down is a military term used when a unit is shifted from a combat 
situation to one of safety and security. While the program has been held around 
the country since the late 1980s, it made its first Ventura County appearance 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety veterans took part in that event. To boost this year's attendance, 
organizers embarked early on an advertising campaign. And on Friday, volunteers 
scoured the county, offering free rides to participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Amundsen was the only one to take advantage of the offer in the east 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuffing nearly all he owns into a plastic grocery bag, the Simi Valley man 
boarded a van on loan from First Interstate Bank. He and bank officer Phillip 
Hicks then stopped at advertised pickup points in Moorpark and Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real disappointed there weren't more people," said the 55-year-old 
Amundsen, a former Navy man. "It sounds like a really nice thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the sideline of the basketball court in the school's gymnasium, a trio 
of student hairstylists from Ventura's Lu Ross Academy drew a crowd. Many 
merely wanted their short, military style haircuts shaved down. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with long hair tended to steer clear. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nearby classroom, Ventura County Municipal Judge John E. Dobroth presided 
over a makeshift courtroom. His bench was the front desk, where the teacher 
ordinarily would sit. Off to one side, a computer and printer spit out 
paperwork fished directly out of the records system at the Hall of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Most cases involved unpaid traffic tickets and other minor violations. In most 
cases, Dobroth heard the veteran's explanation, then assigned community service 
to be done during the three-day event. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, the defendant was homeless and stuck with a fine he could not 
pay. Prepared for the worst, he stepped before the judge and asked him to go 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to have to work pretty hard for three straight days," Dobroth 
responded. "That's a pretty good deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Back on the football field, Al Sanchez supervised the chow line. It was during 
last year's "Stand Down" that Sanchez attended his first Alcoholics Anonymous 
meeting. He has been sober ever since and is back this year as a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 "No more blackouts. No more tunnel vision," he said proudly. "All I can tell 
you is that it works." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 "Stand Down 1994" will continue today and Sunday at Ventura College, 4667 
Telegraph Road, Ventura. Today, the relief effort offers homeless military 
veterans from throughout Ventura County medical care, legal help and a variety 
of other social services. On Sunday, event organizers are inviting all veterans 
to take advantage of those services.

CAMP AIMS TO HELP YOUTHS COME TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are unwritten rules for Ventura County gang members about mixing with 
teen-agers from other towns. Probably the most important one is not to mix all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't like them, and they don't like us," said Daniel, a 14-year-old 
Moorpark gang member who asked not be fully identified. 
</P>
<P>
 That cardinal rule of separation will be broken this weekend as local gang 
members and non-gang members alike gather for two days at an isolated Santa 
Barbara County campground. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp sponsor is a local group called Lucha. Formed in 1979 by 
self-described Chicano activists, Lucha now claims as members many educators, 
probation officers and social workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has worked as an advocate for Latino youths in police abuse cases. 
But the co-ed camp-out is its only formal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 For two weekends each summer for 14 years, the group has brought together up 
to 120 high school and junior high students from tough neighborhoods in 
Moorpark, Oxnard, Port Hueneme, Ventura, Fillmore and Santa Paula -- and sent 
them camping. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many are gang members, other campers were picked by recruiters 
because they come from neighborhoods plagued by violence or are from families 
that could not afford a summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take kids from the barrio -- gang-bangers and kids who've had a rough life 
-- and let them experience the peace and quiet of camping in the country like 
other kids," said Gabino Aguirre, Lucha vice president and principal of 
Moorpark's continuation high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day outing at a beach campground is filled with workshops and 
activities meant to help the youngsters see that even though they are from 
rival neighborhoods, they have a great deal in common. 
</P>
<P>
 They just talk some of the time. But most of the weekend is filled with 
discussions about legal rights, AIDS prevention, cultural awareness and drug 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the trips began in 1980, there has not been any violence, Aguirre said. 
The worst incident involved a few youths last year who tried to collapse a tent 
as a prank, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp-out remains peaceful because the youngsters are in a 
non-confrontational setting and are surrounded by volunteers, Aguirre said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no turf up there," he said. "Once they realize they're on neutral 
ground with nothing to prove, things quiet down." 
</P>
<P>
 Maury Acosta, 16, an Oxnard gang member going on the trip for a second time, 
said he has made many friends. But he was skeptical about its lasting effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just two days," he said. "You do make a bunch of friends, but I don't 
think it changes anything. We might get along up there. And we might stay 
friends. But when we get back we're still in different gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if it is only for a weekend, said Gabe Serrano, president of Lucha, the 
camp-out is worth weeks of planning and its $6,000 cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these kids go on to finish high school, some go to college, and some 
do wind up in the criminal justice system," said Serrano, a county probation 
officer. "Maybe it doesn't turn them (all) around. But even those that I've run 
into in my work all say they remember Lucha's camp-out. And that they had a 
good time." 
</P>
<P>
 For Serrano, the most important work of the trip is teaching the youngsters 
about "Chicano" Latino history and culture. "We try to give them some context 
for why they're so (angry), and how they can overcome that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano said part of the problem is institutional racism and a school system 
that does not allow Latino youths to be proud of who they are. He said many of 
the teen-agers are thought of as criminals before they do anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the 'gang' label," he said. "It's like the old term 'savages'. 
It dehumanizes people. A lot of these kids get the label and are written off." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that a group of white youths dressed in surfers' clothes or 
lettermen's jackets who get caught committing a petty crime would not 
automatically be labeled as gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not telling them that they shouldn't be held accountable for their 
actions," he said. "But I do put some of the blame on this society that 
prematurely criminalizes a whole sector of our youth." 
</P>
<P>
 During the camp-out, Oxnard attorney Jorge Alvarado will discuss the 
youngsters' rights when involved in a police encounter. Another presentation by 
a Native American is meant to stress the teen-agers' connections to indigenous 
cultures in Mexico and the U.S. These are lessons that Serrano admits might not 
reach some of the campers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same boring stuff over and over," said Gera, a 17-year-old Oxnard 
gang member who said he is going to the camp to meet girls. "When it comes down 
to it, we just don't kick it with those other guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Gera's attitude, most of the youths seem willing to suspend hatred or 
suspicion for a weekend. And many even see the camp leading to greater self 
esteem -- and eventually to political power. 
</P>
<P>
 Campers who are members of an Oxnard high school group called Students For 
Cultural and Linguistic Democracy said they will try to help others realize 
that they all have the same problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming from an ex-gang member's point of view, people of our age shouldn't 
have to worry about always watching their backs all the time," said Cindy 
Gutierrez, 18, a camp-out volunteer. "Instead of fighting each other, we should 
be fighting for each other."

VANDERKOLK LAUDS USE OF PROP. 172 REVENUES; BUDGET: SUPERVISOR SAYS VENTURA 
COUNTY HAS DONE MORE THAN OTHERS TO EXPAND PUBLIC SAFETY. SHE OPPOSES 
INITIATIVE BACKED BY SHERIFF AND D.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the claims of angry law enforcement officials, Ventura County "stands 
head and shoulders" above other California counties in using Proposition 172 
revenue to expand public safety, Supervisor Maria VanderKolk asserted Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I find so astonishing about the recent controversy over how the Ventura 
County Board of Supervisors has handled its share of the Prop. 172 revenue is 
that we are one of a handful of counties that have actually significantly 
augmented and enhanced public safety services," wrote VanderKolk on Friday in a 
letter to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 She urged voters to move slowly before tying the Board of Supervisors' hands 
with a proposed ballot initiative, which would limit spending of the special 
half-cent sales tax approved by voters last November. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, suggested Thursday by the sheriff and district attorney, would 
require that all the new revenue go toward expanding -- rather than maintaining 
-- criminal justice and fire services. 
</P>
<P>
 After researching the topic for her master's thesis, VanderKolk agreed that 
many counties simply substituted the Proposition 172 revenue for the county 
money once devoted to law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura County pledged $24 million to restore past cuts and hire new 
employees in law enforcement agencies, she said. When the Board of Supervisors 
voted to take back $1.2 million of that money earlier this week, it drew 
criticism and the initiative threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials say it doesn't matter what other counties have done 
with the Proposition 172 money. What is important, said Sheriff Larry 
Carpenter, is that the supervisors made a commitment, on at least three 
occasions, to using all the new revenue to expand public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of public trust," Carpenter said. "I believe that we're going 
to pursue an initiative, and I believe the voters will find that an acceptable 
solution." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk acknowledged that the supervisors boxed themselves by making those 
commitments. "But we did it all in the name of public safety," she said in an 
interview. "Even after (the cuts) we did last week, they still have millions 
more than they got last year." 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff's budget, she calculated, gets $5.2 million more than it did in 
the last fiscal year. The district attorney's office has about $2 million more, 
as does the Corrections Services Agency. And the public defender gets a 
$746,100 increase. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the supervisors provided $8 million toward operating the new 
county jail, which opens in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now if these actions aren't enhancements to public safety, I don't know what 
is," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Los Angeles County merely added the sales tax revenue into the 
budgets of the sheriff and district attorney and then subtracted the same 
amount of money coming from property taxes, VanderKolk said, quoting a letter 
from the L.A. County board. 
</P>
<P>
 She pointed out that all counties lost property tax revenue to the state, and 
many saw Proposition 172 as a way to make up some of that money. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk, who is not seeking reelection this year, said she is working on a 
master's degree in public administration and chose Proposition 172 as her 
thesis topic. In the process, she concluded that Ventura County exceeded most 
other counties' efforts toward boosting public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials were initially satisfied with the supervisors' 
approach. But they grew angry when the board at the last minute transferred 
$1.2 million from the public safety budgets to pay for related functions, 
namely the medical examiner's office and legal services for children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue isn't really a financial issue this year," Carpenter said. "The 
issue is really the broadened definition of public safety." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk argued that the sheriff, himself, had broadened the definition when 
he agreed to assume control of the medical examiner's office. Now he's paying 
for the office, without controlling it, she said. "The only difference is one 
builds his empire and the other one doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter argued that he planned to cross-train deputies to do the coroner's 
work, saving money for the county. "It's cheaper to send one person to a crime 
scene, than two," he said. "That's simple math." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, VanderKolk said, the county had competing priorities to fund, such 
as libraries, health care and mental health. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been far, far easier to submit to the demands of the sheriff 
and the D.A. as regards Prop. 172," VanderKolk wrote. "I have been their 
supporter for four years and in making the decisions I felt compelled to do 
last week, I was fully cognizant of the fact that good relationships would be 
soured."

OJAI MAY LOSE ITS BOWLING ALLEY IN BID BY PAY LESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ojai's only bowling alley faces closure if city officials approve an 
application to convert the aging lanes into a Pay Less Drug Stores outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Pay Less executives already have submitted preliminary plans and expect to 
present their proposal at a public hearing before planning commissioners next 
month, said city Planning Director Bill Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of the property have reached an agreement to sell the 6,000-square-foot 
building to Pay Less if the city agrees to let the retail chain move in, Prince 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pay Less spokeswoman Dana Vanderzanden confirmed that an agreement had been 
signed to buy the property but had no other details. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants opposed to the move have banded together with the bowling alley's 
operators in an effort to stop the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 members of the Ojai Valley Retailers' Assn. met Thursday to plan a 
campaign aimed at preserving the bowling alley, said Joy Grove, who owns a 
surplus store on the city's east end near the bowling alley. 
</P>
<P>
 O Grove said many of the merchants are concerned that the loss of Ojai Valley 
Bowl will leave the small tourist town with few family recreation 
opportunities. Ojai Valley Bowl has operated for 30 years and draws scores of 
enthusiastic bowlers for league competition, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A bowling alley is a traditional thing to have in a small town," Grove said. 
"It's a community gathering spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Grove, vice president of the merchants group, said some store owners also are 
afraid their businesses will be hurt by the presence of a chain drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
 Pay Less, which has 545 stores in 11 Western states, buys merchandise in 
quantity at steep discounts, so it can undersell nearly anything being sold in 
a small drugstore, Grove said. And the chain recently merged with Thrifty 
drugstores, with 487 outlets, boosting its buying power even further. 
</P>
<P>
 Small, quaint drugstores have their own allure, Grove contended. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go into them and it's like Mayberry, R.F.D.," she said. "The druggist 
knows your name, or if you're new, he learns it real fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Borgaro, who has run Ojai Valley Bowl for the past seven years, said he 
learned only this week that Pay Less may take over his building. Borgaro said a 
still-soft economy and recent changes in Ojai's smoking ordinance have hurt 
profits in the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 A tough anti-smoking ordinance enacted in February forced Borgaro to trim back 
hours at the bowling center's coffee shop because many patrons who smoked 
stopped coming, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bowling lanes remain his biggest moneymaker, the loss of business 
from the coffee shop ate into his profits and he fell behind on rent, Borgaro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He sensed that the property's owners, Carol and Winfred Boersch, were becoming 
impatient, Borgaro said. But he had no idea that they might sell the building 
until he read about the Pay Less proposal in a local paper this week, he said. 
His business has a month-to-month lease, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're determined, at least, to let the public know that we want to stay," 
said Borgaro, 40, of Santa Paula, who runs the lanes with his 37-year-old wife, 
Cherie. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the public doesn't want to keep the bowling lanes, there's no sense 
fighting (the Pay Less proposal)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Director Prince said Pay Less executives first approached the city a 
few months back about opening a store in Ojai. They settled on the Ojai Valley 
Bowl site after looking over several properties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pay Less is thinking they can make a success of the conversion of the bowling 
alley to a drugstore," he said. "I'm sure they've done all the marketing 
studies to prove they are right." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the merchants' contention that Ojai cannot afford to lose a family 
recreational facility, Prince disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can ride bicycles, and there are facilities for swimming and tennis," 
he said. "Only the dedicated bowling groups will see a loss." 
</P>
<P>
 "The property owner has a right to sell the building," Prince said. "The city 
doesn't try to interfere with the private enterprise system. It just supports 
whoever comes up with the best plan." 
</P>
<P>
 One concern of City Council members and planning commissioners is the 
appearance of the building and its parking lot, which have fallen into 
disrepair over the years, Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The property hasn't been well-kept," he said. "I think it's fair to say 
that."

SIMI BOY, 14, GETS 4 YEARS IN SLAYING; COURTS: PARENTS OF STABBING VICTIM CHAD 
HUBBARD CALL PHILLIP HERNANDEZ 'A MONSTER.' THEY STRONGLY DENY THEIR SON WAS A 
BULLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a bitter, tear-filled hearing, a 14-year-old Simi Valley boy who fatally 
stabbed a classmate was called dangerous and impulsive by a judge who sentenced 
him to four years in a California Youth Authority facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minor does act out of impulse. The minor does have poor judgment. And I 
don't think all 14-year-olds have poor judgment," Superior Court Judge Allan 
Steele said of Phillip Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my view that the minor . . . is dangerous," the judge said. "In whatever 
fashion you wish to take it, he took a human life." 
</P>
<P>
 The sentencing came nearly six months after Chad Hubbard, a Valley View Junior 
High School baseball player, was knifed in the chest on campus after classes. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Steele found Hernandez guilty of involuntary manslaughter instead of 
murder, which prosecutors had sought. The sentence was the maximum allowed 
under state law for manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele decided on the lesser conviction after hearing testimony that Hubbard 
had started the fatal altercation by punching the defendant and challenging him 
to a fistfight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're unhappy with the original verdict," said the victim's mother, Jackie 
Hubbard. "We're happy with the sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 At Friday's hearing, Hubbard and her husband, Scott, vigorously denied that 
their son was a bully, and criticized Hernandez, his family, the judge and 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 In riveting statements to the judge, the Hubbards called Hernandez "a monster" 
and said his parents did a terrible job raising him. They also said that Steele 
should have convicted him of murder and that Deputy Dist. Atty. James Ellison 
did not defend their son strongly enough against claims he was a bully. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking down in tears, Jackie Hubbard placed a large, framed picture of Chad 
on the counsel table and said the boy went out of his way to make people smile 
and feel comfortable. "He was a comedian of sorts," Hubbard said. 
</P>
<P>
 She spoke of acts of kindness by her son, such as the time he insisted on 
being part of his family's effort to help a poor family at Christmas. She spoke 
of the problems her three remaining children -- ages 6, 7 and 10 -- have every 
day coping with Chad's death. 
</P>
<P>
 And she spoke of her own difficulties understanding his senseless murder and 
sitting through the two-week trial, where it was revealed that Hubbard had a 
.06% blood-alcohol level after the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see why it's called the criminal justice system," she said. "It's justice 
for the criminals, and there's no justice." 
</P>
<P>
 The mother read a letter to the court that she received from Gov. Pete Wilson 
after writing him about her son's death. The governor assured her he is trying 
to sponsor legislation to prosecute offenders as young as 14 as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 What seemed most on her mind, though, was countering the defense's 
characterization of her son as a bully. 
</P>
<P>
 She maintained that Hubbard -- at 5-foot-9 and 170 pounds -- was not larger 
than Hernandez, whom she described as 5-foot-8 and 180 pounds at the time of 
the incident. Hernandez was described by his attorney as much smaller than 
Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chad is not a bully," his mother said. "He is the farthest thing from that. 
He is a protector." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at Hernandez, she called him incorrigible. "Phillip," she said, 
sitting across a table from him, "you could have been my son's brother. But 
instead you were his killer. For that, I and hundreds of others hate you." 
</P>
<P>
 In his comments, Scott Hubbard defended his son against unkindly images that 
surfaced during the trial. "Understand," he said, "Chad was not a bully." 
</P>
<P>
 After directing comments to the defendant, the judge and both attorneys, the 
father refused to say anything directly to the Hernandez family "because they 
created this monster." 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing that, Phillip Hernandez dropped his head and appeared to cry as his 
attorney draped an arm around his shoulder in assurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez's uncle, Ray Martinez Hernandez, told the judge that the Hubbards 
were wrong in their portrayal of his nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't think to this day that he is a monster or there is no place 
for him in heaven," he said. "I really miss Phillip." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Donna L. Forry pleaded with the judge to place her 
client in a local juvenile facility, where he could be rehabilitated and not 
just punished. 
</P>
<P>
 She said he has had a troubled life, including behavioral problems at school, 
but no other criminal activity. She said his problems stemmed from growing up 
in a dysfunctional family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, your honor, my feeling about Phillip is that he has been deprived 
of a fair shake," Forry said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; 6 TAKE OUT PAPERS FOR COUNCIL RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Six potential candidates, including two former city council members, have 
obtained nomination papers for November's City Council election. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates will compete for two seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent John M. Gullixson, whose term expires this year, is among the group 
that has already picked up candidacy papers. Councilman Henry W. Wedaa, whose 
term also expires this year, has not taken out papers and is not expected to 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 Former councilmen Gene Wisner and Anton (Doug) Groot have obtained nomination 
papers. Wisner was appointed to the council in 1983 for one year. He was then 
elected from 1984 to 1992. Wisner did not run for reelection in 1992 because he 
supports a limit of two consecutive terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisner said he would like to serve as a conciliator on a council recently 
plagued by animosity. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents who have picked up candidacy papers are Todd Tande, Brett 
Barbre and Christopher Hively. Tande, 35, is a county fiscal analyst. The 
others could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing period for nomination papers ends Aug. 12. If Wedaa does not pick 
up and return nomination papers, the filing period will be extended until Aug. 
17. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa promised not to run for reelection if members of the League of 
California Cities agreed to keep him on as chairman of the Air Quality 
Management District until his council term expires in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa had come under fire by some cities for stridently enforcing AQMD 
regulations. In a compromise, he retained his spot on the AQMD in exchange for 
his pledge not to seek reelection. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MAYOR, 
POLICE UNION SIGN CONTRACT INCLUDING 7% RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City and police union leaders have signed the new police contract, formally 
ending two years of contentious negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The 77-page contract was signed by Mayor Richard Riordan and Danny Stagg, 
president of the Police Protective League, giving officers a 7% pay increase 
over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't 100% please either side, which probably means it's very 
reasonable," Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-year contract covers 7,400 officers, sergeants, detectives and 
lieutenants. The contract's first 2% pay raise is retroactive to July 1. The 
police rank-and-file also get a $1,500 equipment allowance, and patrol officers 
get a 2% bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had staged sickouts and a work slowdown to pressure city officials to 
increase the raise they were offering. The raise was increased but fell short 
of the union demand for a 9% increase over three years. Officials said the city 
was too broke to offer that much. 
</P>
<P>
 During this year's talks, Riordan and the City Council rejected the union's 
call for arbitration, saying it would give control of city money to a third 
party. Union leaders say they plan to sponsor a ballot initiative that will 
make binding arbitration part of the city's negotiating process.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH BAY; POLICE 
ARREST SUSPECT IN 12 TICKLISH BURGLARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A quirky cat burglar who occasionally tickled the feet of residents as they 
slept was arrested recently after Redondo Beach police observed him stealing a 
bicycle from a yard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Collins Jr., 20, of Redondo Beach is suspected of burglarizing 12 homes 
in Redondo Beach and Lawndale since April, Police Sgt. Rick Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cat burglar would enter homes through unlocked windows and occasionally 
pilfer purses, leaving them in nearby yards after removing cash, Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they began to suspect Collins of the burglaries after observing 
him in the area late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover police observed Collins peering through windows and walking through 
yards before taking a bicycle from a yard Wednesday near the 2700 block of 
Rockefeller Lane, police said. They arrested him about 2:30 a.m. after he fled 
to a roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they found evidence in Collins' home that linked him to several 
recent burglaries in Redondo Beach. Collins, who allegedly admitted several of 
the burglaries, is being held on $30,000 bail, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 During four of the burglaries, residents awoke after they were tickled, saw 
the suspect and called police. In each case, the suspect fled, Petersen said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LANCASTER; 66 INMATES 
SEEK $660,000 FOR INJURIES IN CRACKDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A prisoners' rights law office filed claims Thursday seeking more than 
$660,000 for 66 inmates at Lancaster state prison who said they were shot with 
wooden pellets and forcibly removed from their cells by guards during a violent 
crackdown earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feb. 2 incident stemmed from an investigation into a tip that several 
inmates in a special unit for problem prisoners were conspiring to stab a 
sergeant. According to claims filed by the San Rafael-based Prison Law Office, 
a daylong series of "cell extractions" to search for weapons left at least four 
inmates with broken bones and one with a severed finger. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of the operation, one of the guards used a gas-propelled gun 
that fires wooden bullets to force uncooperative inmates from their cells, 
according to the claims filed with the state Board of Control. "The guards were 
vicious and used far more force than necessary," said Steven Fama, an attorney 
for the private law office near San Quentin state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lancaster prison Warden John Ratelle on Thursday defended the operation in 
which 13 guards also suffered minor injuries. The incident was never reported 
to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done an internal affairs investigation on that whole incident," Ratelle 
said. "There was no excessive force." He described the inmates as "totally 
uncooperative" and said they threw urine and feces on guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of the prisoners pulled from their cells that day were transferred 
from Lancaster to high-security units at Pelican Bay and Corcoran state 
prisons, according to the claims filed on behalf of 66 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Eve Shapiro, another lawyer working on the case, said one prisoner received no 
medical treatment for a broken foot until he arrived at Pelican Bay two days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratelle denied that any prisoners with apparent injuries were taken away from 
Lancaster without medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the inmates we knew of who were injured were treated here at the 
institution before they were transferred," he said, adding: "They get better 
medical care than you or I do."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; WITNESSES' 
NAMES WITHHELD IN HALLOWEEN MURDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge refused Friday to reveal the names of confidential witnesses in the 
case of five men accused of killing three boys during last year's Halloween 
night ambush in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "To allow the names (of informants to be released) would be putting a warrant 
of death or injury to these people," Superior Court Judge J.D. Smith said in 
denying the defense request. "I couldn't do that, in good conscience." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Lorenzo Newborn, Aurelius Bailey, Herbert McClain, Soloman Bowen 
and Carl Holmes argued that not knowing the names has made it difficult to 
prepare for trial. Smith listened to more than two hours of closed-door 
testimony from the confidential witnesses earlier this week to determine if 
there is a real danger to them. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Friday that he is more than convinced that the people who have come 
forward to provide information about the Oct. 31 shooting deaths of Reggie 
Crawford, Stephen Coats Jr., both 14, and Edgar Evans, 13, face a genuine 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Some witnesses have already been threatened, Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony Myers 
said in court. The prosecutor said they have had to move because they are so 
frightened. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he would make his courtroom available "at the right time" before 
the trial to allow the defense to interview witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The five men, who sat in the jury box handcuffed and shackled together during 
Friday's hearing, were indicted in March on three counts each of first-degree 
murder, as well as on charges of attempted murder and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims, who had been to a Halloween party, were walking home with three 
friends when gunmen who had been hiding in nearby bushes sprayed the boys with 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors theorize that the defendants, supposedly members of a 
Pasadena-based gang, mistook the victims for other youths involved in a fatal 
shooting of a gang member three hours earlier.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; RIORDAN'S 
CHIEF PRESS AIDE RESIGNS IN LATEST SHAKE-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's director of communications was forced to 
resign Friday in the latest shake-up for the year-old Administration, which has 
struggled to stabilize its media operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's office released a statement late in the day saying that David Novak 
was leaving after less than seven months "to return to the private sector."But 
sources said that he had been asked to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Two high-ranking Riordan Administration officials said that Novak's skills as 
a speech writer are no longer needed as Riordan, a novice politician, is 
becoming more comfortable speaking in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Novak's resignation is the fourth major departure from Riordan's press office. 
Previous communications chief Annette Castro resigned and took a top staff job 
with Councilman Richard Alarcon. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro's aides, Tom Kruesopon and Mike Monasmith, were pressured into finding 
new jobs.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: EL TORO MARINE BASE; RESIDENTS WARNED OF CONTAMINATED 
WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station are alerting residents in an 
off-base housing area that their tap water could be contaminated with the E. 
coli bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 The base's preventive medicine team discovered the bacteria Monday after 
residents at one home noticed a foul odor in their tap water. 
</P>
<P>
 Base spokeswoman Lt. Beth Newman said the contamination appears to be confined 
to that one home. She added that preliminary tests have shown no indication 
that the bacteria has spread to nearby houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are thinking it is just in that one home," she said, noting that more 
definitive test results are expected today. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials say the bacteria -- found in the intestines and feces of 
humans and animals -- produces a range of symptoms, from mild diarrhea lasting 
six to seven days to bloody diarrhea. It can also cause severe abdominal 
cramps, low-grade fever and, in some cases, vomiting or even death. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Young, general manager of Irvine Ranch Water Authority, which provides 
water to the base and its housing areas, said when officials learned of the 
contamination, a series of tests were conducted to determine the cause, but no 
immediate answers were found. 
</P>
<P>
 "We checked our system from the supply side and we haven't been able to find 
any other similar contamination," he said. "It didn't come from us and from 
what I understand theirs was limited in scope. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it is a bacteria, you look for a source of contamination," Young 
said. "You just don't know what that is until you find it. But the first thing 
to test would be for a possible leak in the sewage system." 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1993, more than 500 illnesses and four deaths were attributed to 
the E. coli bacteria in Washington and Nevada after a fast-food chain served 
contaminated, undercooked hamburgers. JAIME ABDO

CHIPPENDALE'S OWNER ADMITS MURDER; COURTS: MAN WHO BEGAN MALE STRIPPER REVUE 
PLEADS GUILTY TO HOMICIDE, RACKETEERING CHARGES. HE WILL GET 26 YEARS IN 
PRISON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of Chippendale's, a touring company of male strippers, pleaded 
guilty in federal court Friday to arranging the murder of an award-winning 
television producer and to a racketeering charge growing out of an attempted 
arson at a Marina del Rey restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 By pleading guilty to a murder-for-hire charge, Somen (Steve) Banerjee 
admitted that he was responsible for the April, 1987, murder of Emmy 
Award-winning television producer Nick Denoia in New York City, said Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Sally L. Meloch. 
</P>
<P>
 Denoia, once choreographer for Chippendale's touring dance company, was shot 
in the face at his mid-town Manhattan office. An unidentified assailant was 
hired by Banerjee and another man for an undisclosed sum, according to the 
indictment charging Banerjee with murder for hire. 
</P>
<P>
 Banerjee, 47, also pleaded guilty to orchestrating the 1984 attempted burning 
of the Red Onion Restaurant and Bar in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 Banerjee's guilty plea "brings to an end an extensive four-year investigation 
during which FBI agents traveled worldwide to build a prosecutable case," said 
Charlie Parsons, special agent in charge of the bureau's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of Friday's plea bargain, Banerjee, who lives in Playa del Rey, 
will be sentenced to 26 years in prison and he must forfeit his interest in 
Chippendale's, Meloch said. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Banerjee was arrested and charged with hiring a man in 1990 to 
kill three of his former Chippendale's associates, but those men, who had 
defected to a rival male dance revue, were not killed. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, he was also charged with orchestrating De Noia's murder and with 
violating the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) 
through a pattern of racketeering activity that included murder, murder for 
hire, solicitation to commit murder and arson. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic theme of the October indictment was "that anybody or anything that 
got in Banerjee's way, he would hire somebody to kill or burn the competitor," 
Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Banerjee, a native of Bombay, India, bought a failing bar on Overland Avenue 
on the Westside in 1975 and renamed it Chippendale's. He launched his "Male 
Exotic Dance Night for Ladies Only" four year later, and the club quickly began 
drawing overflow crowds of women who came out to see muscular men who stripped 
to their G-strings. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually the club closed, but Banerjee continued to operate the touring 
company of male dancers from an office in Santa Monica. At the height of his 
success, Banerjee also had clubs in New York, Dallas and Denver.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; RESCUE GROUP SEEKS OWNERS OF 2 LOST DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DOYLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a last-ditch effort, a dog rescue outfit from the Lucerne Valley is 
circulating flyers to San Fernando Valley veterinarians hoping to find the 
original owners of two dogs that have been homeless since the January 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, several dogs scheduled to be put to sleep were rescued from the 
Chatsworth Animal Shelter by the Life Is For Everything Foundation of Lucerne 
Valley, a nonprofit animal rescue organization.Attempts to reunite the animals 
with their families were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 The LIFE group adopted them and placed them in foster homes, intended for 
temporary care only. Two of the dogs, which have been renamed Red and 
Valentino, are among the animals that remain in foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 Red is a golden retriever-German shepherd mix with a thick, reddish coat. He 
is blind in one eye and more than 5 years old. Valentino is an 8-year-old 
German shepherd-Siberian husky mix. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation said that both dogs show signs of coming from loving homes, and 
that Valentino may have had some obedience training. 
</P>
<P>
 If the original owners do not reclaim the animals, the dogs will remain with 
their foster family. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information on the whereabouts of the owners may contact the LIFE 
Foundation, Lucerne Valley Substation, P.O. Box 1350, Lucerne Valley 92356.

GLENDALE/BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; NEIGHBORS DEFENDING THEIR LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the sun began to rouse Glendale resident Elizabeth Molo from her sleep, she 
heard a low and ominous rumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, there was a loud pounding at the front door. Molo bolted out of bed 
and rushed into the street to protect one of the neighborhood's most prized 
possessions -- four antique lampposts. 
</P>
<P>
 Molo joined about 20 of her neighbors on Marion Drive in the Adams Hills 
neighborhood Thursday in successfully saving the four lamps from a demolition 
crew. The light fixtures had been on their street since the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 The "stay of execution" was granted by Glendale City Councilman Larry Zarian, 
who rushed to the scene on Marion Drive on Thursday. Then, the Public Service 
Department decided against tearing down the lampposts at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love those lampposts," Molo said. "They are a small part of our history 
that is virtually disappearing." 
</P>
<P>
 One Adams Hill resident, Rebecca Rees, who is six months pregnant, volunteered 
to chain herself to one of the posts if necessary. "I had the chain and my 
bicycle lock all ready for it," said Rees, who had gathered a portable toilet, 
water, food and a hat for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody else wanted to do it, and I was raised in the '60s, so it didn't 
bother me," said Rees. 
</P>
<P>
 Zarian said the lampposts were to be removed because of the potential for 
safety and liability risks. But after the commotion by irate neighbors, the 
lamps were re-examined and pronounced safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to let this happen until hell freezes over," Zarian said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Molo learned earlier this week that the lampposts were in danger, she 
contacted the city Public Services Department, which told her that nothing 
would be done until Monday at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel greatly enraged," said Molo, who was among those neighbors caught by 
surprise Thursday, when the wrecking crew arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Adams Hill residents were informed that some of the streets in 
the neighborhood would be widened, but were assured that nothing would happen 
to their lampposts, Rees said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zarian attributed the confusion over the fate of the posts to a "lack of 
communication." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Margaret Hammond of the Adams Hill Homeowners Assn. and the 
Glendale Historical Society, other antique lampposts removed from Glendale have 
been spotted in the city of Perris, Calif., and even in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 Zarian explained that when the city hires a company to remove an object, it 
also pays for it to be disposed of and, therefore, the objects end up being the 
property of the company doing the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, Zarian said, "I'm not going to Alaska to find out." MAKI BECKER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; VISITORS GET CLOSE-UP LOOK AT OVAL 
OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Ronald Reagan was President, he rarely removed his suit jacket in the 
Oval Office because "casual attire seemed out of place there." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the recently reopened Oval Office exhibit at the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library near Simi Valley, there is no dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 This week a group of camp youths and visitors from Taiwan were among the first 
to examine the new exhibit, which allows tourists for the first time to enter 
the famous surroundings for a closer look. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've decided to move toward more environmental exhibits," said Stafanie 
Salata, a library spokeswoman. "We want people to experience what it is like to 
be President -- or at least to visit the White House." 
</P>
<P>
 As visitors enter the Oval Office exhibit, a greeting recorded by Reagan meets 
them at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 On the four-minute tape, the former President tells a bit of the history of 
the office, first occupied by William Howard Taft in 1909. 
</P>
<P>
 For the children visiting Friday, the office exhibit was interesting and 
informative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're getting a real good look at what the White House is like," 
said Joel Hoffschneider, a counselor at an Oxnard summer camp. "And I think the 
older kids are getting a better understanding of the political history." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks resident Zsay Shing took two visitors from Taiwan to the library 
and was surprised to be able to walk into the Oval Office exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last time I could only stand at the door," he said. "Now we can get a closer 
look and really see the detail." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally opened in 1991, the exhibit allowed visitors only as close as the 
doorway. Now a walkway with a guardrail allows a whole tour group to enter at 
once. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just what people wanted," Salata said. "They wanted to be able to 
walk in there and see it up close." MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: POINT MUGU; IDEAS TO BE POOLED FOR JOINT AIRFIELD PLAN

<P>
 An information clearinghouse is being organized for the proposed joint 
civilian-military use of the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station, officials 
have announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The Joint Use Citizens Advisory is being organized and will soon schedule a 
series of meetings where questions will be answered by specialists working for 
the Joint Use Investigative Committee in an informal atmosphere, said Gerry 
Northfield, a spokesman for the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, hourlong public "briefings" on the airfield proposal are being 
planned before each of the monthly meetings of the executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our intent to make this a conduit in which members of the public can get 
information straight from the horse's mouth, so to speak," Northfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy has offered to share the air station's runway with the county to help 
defray operating costs. The plan calls for joint military, civilian airline and 
civilian air cargo use of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 A study being conducted by the Southern California Assn. of Governments on the 
proposal is in its second phase. The study's first phase, released earlier this 
year, found the joint use feasible and indicated that as many as 2.5 million 
passengers would use the facility annually if built. 
</P>
<P>
 A 24-hour information line on the Point Mugu proposal -- 339-4000 -- has been 
established. J.E. MITCHELL

<P>
 A late night party in Burbank turned violent Friday when an 18-year-old 
uninvited guest stabbed two party-goers, seriously wounding one of them, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank police arrested the alleged attacker, Jamie Gonzalez of Glendale, 
about four hours after the stabbing.Authorities declined to identify the 
victims but said that both are Burbank residents who knew the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what exactly started the argument," Lt. Larry Koch said. "We 
know at least they were acquainted with each other before, and it appears the 
suspect was acquainted with other people at the party." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez and a friend arrived unannounced at the party at a house in the 1000 
block of Clybourn Avenue, police said. They then began arguing with two guests 
at the party. The argument escalated into a fistfight shortly after midnight, 
then the stabbing occurred, Koch said. 
</P>
<P>
 One victim, a 21-year-old man, was in guarded condition at a local hospital 
after being stabbed in the chest, Koch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other, a 16-year-old boy, suffered multiple cuts to his neck and arms and 
was treated and released from another hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez was booked for attempted murder and is being held on $1 million bail 
at the Burbank City Jail. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; SHOOTER HOPED TO BE KILLED, ATTORNEY 
SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 46-year-old woman opened fire on a Thousand Oaks neighborhood in December 
because she wanted police to kill her and end years of battling alcoholism and 
depression, the woman's attorney said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What she did was a culmination of her life, a life that hasn't been very 
pleasant," attorney Jenny Scovis said in court, describing her client, Kathleen 
Ann Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the very lowest moment of her life." 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn pleaded guilty in April to nine charges in connection with the shooting 
that injured no one, but sent bullets through three car windows and five 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch postponed sentencing Quinn 
on Friday, sending her instead for a 90-day evaluation by the state Department 
of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 Scovis contended that Quinn should be given probation because she lacked a 
criminal record and has attended daily Alcoholics Anonymous meetings since the 
shooting. She also said Quinn had been abused as a child by her father, and 
could benefit from counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Simon argued that Quinn should receive a state 
prison sentence because of the seriousness of her actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn is scheduled to return to court for sentencing after her 90-day 
evaluation. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; WOMAN ARRESTED ON MOLESTATION CHARGE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 45-year-old Newbury Park woman has been arrested on suspicion of molesting a 
14-year-old boy after hiring him to help her move and then showing him nude 
images of herself, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Ann Arden was arrested Wednesday after sheriff's deputies learned she 
was living at the E-Z 8 Motel in Newbury Park, said Sheriff's Detective Mike 
Powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Bill Montijo said several videotapes, computer disks and other computer 
equipment were confiscated in Arden's room. 
</P>
<P>
 Powers said Arden is unemployed, but apparently posed for sexually explicit 
films and magazines as recently as a several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would appear that they were at least statewide publications," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Powers, Arden had sex with the boy twice in April and May after 
she hired him to help her move out of a rented room on White Oak Lane in 
Newbury Park. Arden allegedly showed him nude images of herself on a computer 
screen and in a magazine, then suggested they have sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's detectives began investigating the case in May after the 14-year-old 
boy's mother became suspicious when Arden called the family's home asking for 
her son. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy admitted to having sex with Arden after being questioned by his 
mother, who then called the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy met Arden through a friend who was referred to Arden by a youth 
employment agency in the Conejo Valley, said Powers, who declined to name the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Montijo urged anyone with information about the case to call the Sheriff's 
Department. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SCHOOL DISTRICT SUES BUILDERS OVER 
DISPUTE

<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District is countersuing two developers it 
formed a partnership with three years ago, claiming the firms were not 
straightforward about a legal dispute they had with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In closed session this week, the school board decided to countersue CSA Real 
Estate Development Inc. and Lederer Development Inc. because they did not 
reveal information about a pending lawsuit Lederer had against the city over a 
separate matter."When we interviewed, they said they had a great relationship 
with the city," board member Judy Barry said. "They were not straightforward 
with us." 
</P>
<P>
 The district entered into a partnership with the firms in 1991, hoping to 
generate revenue for local schools by developing a vacant site on the corner of 
Tapo Canyon Road and Alamo Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The district and the developers wanted to build a shopping center and houses 
on the land, but the plan was rejected by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers filed a lawsuit against the district in May, seeking $4.1 
million in damages resulting from a loss of construction and profits because

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; LAYOFF, HOURLY CUTS TRIM BUDGET 
$100,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has laid off one employee and cut the hours of four others to trim 
$100,000 from the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 A full-time senior planner was laid off this week, while three full-time 
community service coordinators and a full-time secretary in the city manager's 
office saw their hours reduced to between 20 and 35 hours per week, City 
Manager George Scarborough said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts were not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the City Council trimmed about $100,000 from programs in 
the Community Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $40,000 was then to be cut from personnel in that department -- and 
$60,000 elsewhere -- to help the city meet its $10.2-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarborough said the five employees affected this week have been offered 
severance packages and other assistance. Scarborough said there are 75 
full-time employees, down from 80. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very, very difficult decision and one we struggled and agonized 
with," Scarborough said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Jeff Vasquez said the personnel moves were not as severe as 
those in some cities but could be a precursor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that you'll probably see more changes in the future," Vasquez 
predicted. "I don't see the picture getting better." JEFFREY BEAN

<P>
 City Councilman Jeff Vasquez said Friday that he will not be running for a 
second term. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old Vasquez, who owns a photography and video business, said he 
felt it was time to let someone else seek a seat on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one of the things I was able to bring to the council was a fresh 
perspective and the vigor to make changes to the city," Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things wrong with government is that some people stay in it too 
long." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said he was proud to help make City Hall more responsive to residents 
and make decisions from the voters' perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez becomes the second incumbent not to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Councilman Gary L. Hausdorfer said he would not be running again. 
</P>
<P>
 Three seats are up for election in November. Only incumbent Gil Jones has 
filed nomination papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Six people have obtained nomination papers as of Friday, according to City 
Clerk Cheryl Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 If an incumbent doesn't file by the Aug. 12 deadline, the filing period is 
extended to Aug. 17, Johnson said. JEFFREY BEAN

<P>
 The principal of Brea Olinda High School announced a $500 reward Friday for 
the name of the person who took a box containing about $4,800 from the textbook 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 The box disappeared between 12:15 and 12:30 p.m. Thursday when the textbook 
clerk, Dorothy Rosendale, left it unattended to shelve some books. 
</P>
<P>
 The box contained hundreds of cards with $20 bills stapled to them. The money 
belonged to students who deposited $20 for every textbook they used for summer 
school classes. Students began coming to the textbook room to get their 
deposits back on Thursday, the day before the last day of summer school, 
Rosendale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who did not get their money because of the theft will receive their 
deposits back in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosendale said she left the box, which is normally kept in a vault, on a 
counter after returning a deposit about 12:15 p.m. She then began putting books 
on a shelf when, about 15 minutes later, a student called out, asking for her 
deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rosendale returned to the counter, only the box lid was there, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Rueben Hernandez said the case is being investigated as a grand 
theft felony. MIMI KO

<P>
 Neighbors who succeeded in getting the Volunteer Center of Greater Orange 
County evicted from its Chapman Avenue office couldn't believe that Caltrans 
employees and trucks helped it move to a new office down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sort of glad they're gone, but I'm mad because they used government 
trucks and workers to move," said Bruce Spielbuehler, an architect who works in 
an office in the building from which the Volunteer Center was evicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Other employees in the same business complex yelled at the Caltrans employees 
and volunteers, asking if they would provide the same service for private 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Caltrans officials said they offered to move the Volunteer Center because 
it saves taxpayers about $250,000 a year by providing court-referred volunteers 
to clean up the highways in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Miranda, a Caltrans spokesman, said he thought the critics "are just 
not seeing the benefit this organization provides the entire community. The 
moving assistance we gave them doesn't even compare to the benefit they 
provide. The volunteers clean up our roads and make them safer for everyone to 
drive." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol R. Stone, president and chief executive officer of the nonprofit 
Volunteer Center, said Caltrans is just one of 1,200 local organizations that 
are provided with volunteers from the center to keep the groups operating. 
</P>
<P>
 Her former business neighbors, however, said they did not like the people who 
had been sentenced by the court to perform community service and who went to 
the center for their assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were getting a lousy crowd of people coming here," said Paul Janzen, a 
tenant of the business complex. "Some of them wore baggy clothes, flashed 
secret handshakes and made lewd remarks to the ladies who work here." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone called Janzen's remarks offensive and stereotypical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am really appalled," Stone said. "I don't understand why these (critics) 
are so upset. The volunteers are not bad or evil people." 
</P>
<P>
 Janzen said he plans to complain to the Orange County Board of Supervisors and 
question why the county court system doesn't handle community - service 
sentences itself. MIMI KO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; COUNCIL SEEKS STUDY OF THEATER PROPOSALS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As it considers approval of a second major cinema complex, the Calabasas City 
Council has ordered a study of whether two theater centers could be supported 
by local moviegoers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need all the information we can get at our fingertips," said 
Councilman Marvin Lopata."It's a tricky problem. And I don't know how far we go 
as a city to infringe on free enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to vote as early as Aug. 10 on whether to approve an 
eight-plex theater complex as part of a planned, 1.5-million-square-foot office 
and retail project known as Calabasas Park Centre at the corner of Calabasas 
Road and Parkway Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1992, the council approved an eight-theater movie house as part 
of a 190,000-square-foot commercial center near the corner of Las Virgenes and 
Agoura roads, about two miles west of the Park Centre project. Neither project 
has begun construction. KURT PITZER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SATICOY; COMPLETION OF BRIDGE WILL BE CELEBRATED

<TEXT>
<P>
 A parade of antique cars will roll across the Saticoy bridge today in 
celebration of the completion of improvements to the bridge and the 
long-troublesome California 118 through the tiny community. 
</P>
<P>
 Festivities, including the parade, speeches by dignitaries and a street 
festival, begin at 10 a.m. at the reconstructed bridge, which spans the Santa 
Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration then heads north to the intersection of Los Angeles Avenue and 
Violeta Street where formal dedication ceremonies are planned at 10:30 a.m., 
said Patricia Reid, a spokeswoman for the California Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 At noon, a street festival in the community's Old Town section will begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Saticoy have waited a long time for this," Reid said. "These 
improvements will serve to make motorists' lives easier and safer." 
</P>
<P>
 Reid said the $22-million, two-phase project started in 1991 and saw the 
complete renovation of the bridge and the widening and realignment of 
California 118, which doglegged through the town, causing traffic tie-ups at 
rush hours. J.E. MITCHELL

 Pledging to improve and renovate many of the city's streets, highways, sewer

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; SUNDAY HOME TOUR BATTLES BLIGHT LABEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some west-side residents are so tired of having their neighborhood described 
as "decaying" that they have embarked on an unusual campaign to improve the 
area's image. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, residents will sponsor a walking tour of 14 homes in the district, 
which is off 19th and Victoria streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour will detail the history of the neighborhood and highlight the lengths 
that some residents have gone to transform their cookie-cutter tract homes into 
distinctive living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the event will help pay for an upcoming volunteer effort to 
paint and landscape some of the neighborhood's homes that need repair, which 
activists say gives the entire area a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to explode the misconception that this is a run-down area," said Mary 
Fewel, who helped organize the tour. "This is a nice neighborhood two miles 
from the beach. We want to show that people take pride in the area and care for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fewel and other residents said the west side's bad reputation comes from a 
relatively small number of poorly maintained apartments and homes. The area is 
safe, they insist. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood -- located on bluffs above the Santa Ana River -- was built 
in the 1950s by Freedom Homes. Most of the houses are about 1,000 square feet 
and contain three bedrooms and one bathroom. The lots are a spacious 7,000 
square feet or larger -- a luxury that residents have taken advantage of by 
building additions and planting lavish gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Most homes resemble L-shaped boxes. "Mid-Century California Stucco," as one 
architect described the design to Fewel. "In other words, no character." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents admit their homes aren't likely to appear in Architectural Digest, 
but they said the area is a nice place to raise a family. Some residents have 
added second stories with views of nearby Canyon Park. Others have created 
front courtyards and exotically landscaped back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this year, residents hope to spruce up some of the more visible homes in 
the neighborhood by painting the exteriors and planting greenery. Neighborhood 
leaders are in the process of asking the owners of those homes for permission 
to make the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewel, like many newer west-side residents, moved into the neighborhood during 
the real estate boom of the late 1980s. Her family was renting in Newport Beach 
at the time and was looking for an affordable home close to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the neighborhood looks better today than it did five years ago, in 
large part because residents have joined together to demand improvements. They 
fought to have Victoria Elementary School reopened and to have some local roads 
widened and cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-guided tour will take place from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Sunday. Tickets 
and maps can be purchased at the corner of Victoria Street and National Avenue 
and at the entrance to Canyon Park. Tickets are $5. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; MAYOR DECIDES NOT TO SEEK OFFICE AGAIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gene Beyer, mayor since 1990, announced this week that he will not seek 
reelection for a third term. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's race now includes Councilwoman Joanne Coontz, who opened her 
mayoral campaign in May, and Councilman Fred L. Barrera, who announced his 
candidacy as soon as he heard Beyer was not running. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyer, 66, has struggled with heart problems and arthritis for a number of 
years. He said in a prepared statement that he wants to spend more time with 
his family when his term ends. 
</P>
<P>
 He said in the statement that he made the decision "with a great deal of 
sadness and regret" after talking with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 He thanked residents and his supporters and added that he is "truly honored to 
have been elected as your councilman and mayor -- a total of five times since 
1980." 
</P>
<P>
 Barrera, 72, had said he would only run if Beyer did not enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have only admiration for that man," he said. "In 20 years, I've served a 
lot of mayors as pro tem and Gene had a lot of style." 
</P>
<P>
 Coontz has served two four-year terms on the City Council and she recalled 
meeting Beyer when he was principal of the Peralta Junior High School in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "The story of his life is giving to his community," she said. "I know it was a 
hard decision for Gene because he's been involved in community service all of 
his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Coontz, 65, said she has been active in the community since moving to Orange 
in 1961. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; RICHARD SIMMONS HAS SENIORS STRUTTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Armando Rodezno had been feeling down lately and he was not enthusiastic when 
his wife suggested they go to see Richard Simmons' exercise show at the Secure 
Horizons' Wellness Festival on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But by noon, the 70-year-old Buena Park resident was waving his arms to the 
music along with some 1,200 other seniors. His pelvic rolls in a Gypsy Rose Lee 
number earned him the title Mr. Sensuous Silver Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 When Simmons handed Rodezno a $100 bill as a prize, he exclaimed, "This man 
doesn't want $100. This man wants my job!" 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons and seniors have always had a mutual attraction and he was a natural 
selection to promote the festival for Secure Horizons, the HMO for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was raised by seniors," said Simmons, wearing his trademark hot pink 
spangled tank top and striped running shorts. His father was 50 when he was 
born and his mother was almost 40, he explained. "When I was little and cute, 
the older people thought I was just adorable. My peers just thought I was fat." 
</P>
<P>
 A self-described food addict, Simmons performs 300 exercise shows annually in 
malls and auditoriums such as Buena Park's Sequoia Athletic Conference Center. 
</P>
<P>
 His performance resembles a 12-step program -- he hands out cards that urge 
people to admit their love for food but with an irresistible sense of joy and 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
 During his performances, Simmons is swamped by older women who want to hug and 
kiss him. He estimates that he kisses about 400,000 people a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mae Minick of Anaheim became an official senior this year when she passed 65 
and she can understand the attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "He speaks from the heart," she said, still teary-eyed from Simmons' emotional 
speech about his mother. "I feel if he loves his mom as much as he says he 
does, then his mother has raised a beautiful son. He's just an inspiration to 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 That inspiration was the goal of the wellness program, which also offered a 
variety of free health checks and educational pamphlets. 
</P>
<P>
 Caroline Kelly, the program's manager, cited research showing that lack of 
exercise, more than age, makes old people frail. "Age has nothing to do with 
your ability to increase muscle mass," she said. "We believe it's better to 
teach people how to exercise instead of putting them in a hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Price, 71, of Tustin agreed with the value of exercise for all ages, 
even though he eyed Simmons a little skeptically as the exercise guru signed 
autographs and flirted with his fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I worked, I always walked a lot," Price said. "But I lost the spring in 
my step." He now swears by the aerobic exercise regimens offered by the health 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons can offer little explanation for his addictive enthusiasm. "I have no 
idea why I'm this way," he said. "I'm afraid to find out. I'm afraid to go to a 
therapist. I just love life, I guess." LESLEY WRIGHT

 A 64-year-old Leona Valley man stuck his head through a trapdoor to his attic 
Friday and came face to face with a rattlesnake. 
</P>
<P>
 The snake, at the same level as Donald L. Mathews' head, bit him on the 
neck.Mathews was listed in critical condition late Friday at Antelope Valley 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews was alone in his home in the remote mountain area just west of 
Palmdale when he peered into the attic to check on some mousetraps, said Capt. 
Ron Hamilton of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was bitten about 1 p.m., he called 911 and was taken by helicopter to 
the hospital. He arrived about half an hour later, Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was coherent, but we don't know how much venom was injected," Hamilton 
said. Because of the bite's location and the man's age, Hamilton said, it was 
the worst snakebite he had seen in 23 years as a county firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1 1/2-foot snake was captured by an animal control officer Friday evening, 
said the victim's wife, Betty. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews was placed in intensive care at the hospital, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had six or seven snakes on our property over the past 19 years," she 
said. "But never one in the house. Never."

CALTRANS PANEL SAYS VENTURA FREEWAY IS NOT A SCENIC RIDE; TRANSPORTATION: FOR 
THE FIRST TIME EVER, AGENCY DENIES A REQUEST FOR STATE ROADWAYS' HIGHEST HONOR. 
INSPECTORS RATED MOST OF THE STRETCH FROM CALABASAS TO THOUSAND OAKS AS BEING 
OF LOW VISUAL QUALITY. 
</P>

<P>
 For civic boosters in four cities straddling the Ventura Freeway west of Los 
Angeles, the freeway is a refreshing, bucolic thoroughfare worthy of the 
highest honor -- state designation as a scenic highway. 
</P>
<P>
 But Caltrans sees it otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Two field inspectors who drove 21 miles of the Ventura Freeway from Calabasas 
to Thousand Oaks five times June 1 had this to say in a staff report: "This 
segment rated low visual quality since it had a high amount of development." 
</P>
<P>
 And that was just for starters. 
</P>
<P>
 They took note of power lines, auto malls, drainage canals, billboard blight, 
pole signs, sound walls, office buildings, shopping centers and fast-food 
outlets. Using a scale of 1 to 5 -- in which 5 represented "outstanding vistas, 
flora or other features that afford pleasure to the highway traveler" -- they 
gave most of the roadway a grade of 1 to 2.9 (low scenic value). No portion 
received the highest rating of 4.1 to 5 (high scenic value). 
</P>
<P>
 So on Friday, after four years of debate between city officials and the state, 
Caltrans' Transportation Advisory Committee issued its first thumbs down ever 
on a request for scenic highway designation. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as they wanted to promote California's roadways, the committee said, 
the Ventura Freeway is simply too built up and blighted to earn a scenic 
highway designation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're looking at an eight-plus-lane highway going through a commercial 
establishment, with high-rises and everything," committee member Kenneth B. 
Brown said in urging a no vote. "In 1963, it probably was a scenic roadway -- 
but it certainly isn't anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee said it prefers to reserve the California poppy-decorated scenic 
highway signs for the state's lesser-traveled byways. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-5 vote in favor of denying the request dashed the hopes of local 
officials who sought the label since 1990, believing it would boost tourism, 
promote good planning and aid in controlling sign pollution. Mostly, they said, 
it would have helped ensure orderly economic growth in the four cities along 
the freeway corridor -- Thousand Oaks, Westlake Village, Agoura Hills and 
Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Mayor Pro Tem Jaime Zukowski said the state panel erred in 
judging urban freeways with the same standards it applies to rural roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some of the committee members were focusing on the original criteria 
for scenic highways," Zukowski said. "Those days are gone. There will be very 
few highways left in that kind of pristine condition." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling left some of the local officials who flew up to Sacramento to make 
their case feeling like they had been misled. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been stringing us along," said Fran Pavley, an Agoura Hills 
councilwoman. "It's been real weird." During most of her quest for the scenic 
designation -- which dates back to securing original legislation in 1988 -- 
transportation committee members seemed to be on her side, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Friday's no vote appeared to be a hard one for committee members to 
deliver. Several praised Pavley and others' dedication to controlling urban 
blight along the freeway while encouraging economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 In casting their votes, committee members also directed Chairman Paul B. 
Albritton to come up with some other way to give recognition to the communities 
along the western Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep doing the planning work you're doing," said committee member O. Warren 
Hilgren. "Because that's what matters -- not whether you have poppy signs."

$100,000 OFFERED IN 4 SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council offered $100,000 in rewards Friday for 
information leading to the arrest and prosecution of suspected gang members who 
are responsible for four recent execution-style murders southwest of Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 All four slayings are believed to be linked to a vicious turf war between a 
prison gang and another gang based in the so-called South City neighborhood, 
south of Koreatown. The maximum possible reward for each murder case is 
$25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as seven additional murders during the last year or so may also be 
connected, said Deputy Chief Mark A. Kroeker, operations chief for the LAPD's 
South Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Control of lucrative drug sales in the district is probably behind the 
killings, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The series of murders is considered especially violent, police said, even by 
the bloody standards of Los Angeles street wars. The extent of the carnage -- 
and the fact that the drug battle may claim additional victims -- prompted the 
council to authorize the rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 "These evil criminals must be apprehended to save others from being 
victimized," said Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who held a news conference 
Friday with police at 24th Street and Vermont Avenue, a few blocks from the 
sites of the killings. The violence, Ridley-Thomas said, "has terrified the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Police declined to identify the groups involved, but sources said the 
protagonists were the Mexican Mafia, a prison-based gang whose control 
stretches to neighborhoods in Los Angeles and elsewhere, and Harpys, a longtime 
neighborhood street gang whose name is painted in stylized graffiti lettering 
throughout the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The hope, authorities said, is that the rewards will encourage witnesses or 
others with knowledge to come forward. By offering financial incentives, police 
are attempting to crack the violence-enforced wall of secrecy that has long 
discouraged informers from talking to authorities about organized criminal 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The multiple-murder case, Kroeker said, is "on the verge of being solved." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say rewards, whatever their value, are often not enough to encourage 
fearful witnesses to come forward. In fact, many rewards in criminal cases go 
unclaimed, despite the existence of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the rewards, police said, authorities are offering protection to 
those who provide information that helps crack the murder cases. Assistance 
could include relocation of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Sergio A. Robleto, a homicide detective who is investigating the murders, 
said witnesses and others who have knowledge of the murders may be in danger 
whether they come forward or not. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, police said that the most recent murders may have been an effort to 
eliminate a witness in an earlier pair of slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest two killings occurred on the evening of July 6, police said, when 
gunmen drove up in a car and opened fire on Marco Jasso, 27, and his niece, 
Erika Briseno, 17, in the 2900 block of South Walton Avenue. The killers fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Police theorize that Jasso may have been killed because he possibly saw or had 
knowledge of two earlier killings -- those of Xavier Flores, 25, and Mario 
Miranda, 24. Both were shot dead July 3 during a dispute at a neighborhood 
residence, police said. Jasso's niece was probably a victim of circumstance who 
just happened to be accompanying her uncle when he was targeted, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information on the case is asked to contact detectives at (213) 
237-1310, or the Drop a Dime on Murder Hotline, (213) 237-1776.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: TRIATHLETE BEATS 'FLESH-EATING' STREP INFECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In front of the media Friday, Bernie Donner was witty and upbeat. When the 
cameras turned, though, the emotions came. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you for saving my life," he whispered in a choked-up voice, wrapping 
his arms around internal medicine specialist Dr. Peter Miao. 
</P>
<P>
 The amateur triathlete walked out of the Sherman Oaks Hospital Burn Center on 
Friday afternoon, hobbling on crutches back to life as it was before the 
so-called "flesh-eating bacteria" threw him into the medical spotlight and 
briefly threatened to take his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel healthy. I feel strong," he told a crowd of reporters, doctors, nurses 
and other burn-ward patients. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than three weeks of skin grafts and scrubbings, the 35-year-old 
private investigator and insurance adjuster admitted to being "a little 
nervous" about leaving the safety of the hospital and heading home to Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," he said, "I feel like a free man." 
</P>
<P>
 Donner became the focus of intense media attention in early July when he 
contracted the infection known as "necrotizing fasciitis" and went from healthy 
athlete to near death in just three days. 
</P>
<P>
 A tabloid news frenzy had recently predicted medical doom after the deaths of 
seven people in Gloucester, England, from the bacteria, and Donner became one 
of the first victims in the Southland after that spate of publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 The strep infection -- which according to doctors typically causes little more 
than a sore throat -- apparently entered Donner's body through a nick he 
suffered while shaving his legs before a bicycle ride, a common practice of 
road cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sort of thinking twice about shaving again," he said Friday. "The 
hairy-leg look is back in for me." 
</P>
<P>
 By the day after his ride, he began feeling like he had a cold or the flu, 
Donner said. Two days after that he was admitted to the hospital in critical 
condition and in shock, Miao said. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, the bacteria had eaten a 6-by-12-inch swath of fascia -- tissue 
that connects skin with muscle -- in his right thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Donner said Friday that while the damage to his leg was serious, early reports 
of massive muscle loss were exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't lose any muscle," he said. "It was mostly fatty tissue, and I don't 
mind losing fat. I'll be bicycling down here to say hello to everybody" within 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
 While at least three other Southlanders have been infected with the bacteria 
in the last month, burn center director Dr. A. Richard Grossman said the 
disease is extremely rare and that people should be more worried about lighting 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if Donner was susceptible to a another infection, the silver-haired 
doctor flashed a wry smile, and made a modern comparison utilizing one of the 
key players in the O.J. Simpson saga. 
</P>
<P>
 The chances of that happening are "about the same as Al Cowlings getting 
indicted," he said. ERIC SLATER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; CHARTER TEACHERS EXPRESS CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest murky relationship to emerge from the uncharted waters of the 
charter school movement, teachers at the San Fernando Valley's two charter 
schools and teachers' union officials are struggling to define their respective 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried that their concerns were not being adequately addressed by United 
Teachers-Los Angeles, teachers from the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center in 
Pacoima and Fenton Charter School in Lake View Terrace met with union officials 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meeting, teachers told union officials of health benefits they have 
been denied, and raised other concerns about their on-leave status from the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the charter school teachers, as employees of the fiscally 
autonomous charter schools, are on leave from the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 But teachers say the leave status has caused a host of problems. Many had 
their names deleted from health benefits lists, for example, and have been 
denied medical and dental services. Some say they hoped the union would work 
harder to help them resolve such issues. "I'm tired of feeling as if we were a 
step-child of the district," said Vaughn teacher Carol Haasis. "I would like to 
feel as if our union represents us." 
</P>
<P>
 But union officials say the charter school members, like all members of the 
union, must raise their voices louder in order to have their concerns heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them the same thing I tell every school," said John Perez, UTLA vice 
president. "Because we are a service organization, if we don't hear from a 
school, we assume they don't have a problem. We have enough problems that we 
don't go looking for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Some charter school teachers, who do not believe UTLA will fight for their 
best interests, say they are considering a break from the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask 'why are we paying dues to a union that does not support us' ," 
said Brenda Nyx, a UTLA representative at Fenton. "We're paying the same amount 
and not getting the same services." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said the vagueness of the charter law is in part to blame for the 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think like everything relative to charter schools, this is an evolving 
process and will take some time," he said. SUSAN BYRNES

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; ROAD PROJECTS SETTLE IN FOR A LONG HAUL 
</P>

<P>
 Every weekday, city construction crews take over Thompson Boulevard in 
downtown Ventura -- digging, drilling and obstructing traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 And they aren't going away anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's engineering department began construction projects on Thompson 
Boulevard in April, and city officials say they are not scheduled to finish 
until the end of October. The project area stretches from Garden Street to 
Kalorama Street. 
</P>
<P>
 From 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., city workers are busy replacing underground water lines 
and linking all the street's traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
 "That way, if you hit one green, you can hit all the greens," explained Mark 
Watkins, a city engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic signal portion of the project, begun in April and finished three 
weeks ago, cost the city $330,000 in traffic improvement funds, Watkins said. 
The water line replacement project started May 9 and will end about Halloween, 
he said. Funds to cover the $880,000 improvements are coming from residents' 
water bills, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason the construction will take so long is because crews go on 
hiatus during the Ventura County Fair -- Aug. 17-28 -- so as not to further 
clog up already congested streets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But construction on Thompson Boulevard will not end when the city workers 
finish their job. 
</P>
<P>
 Once that is done, utility crews will begin burying power, telephone and cable 
lines. The work will begin by the end of the year and will take up to six 
months to complete, Watkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 City workers are also revamping Figueroa Street in downtown Ventura this 
summer as part of the city's downtown redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
 Financed by the city's redevelopment agency budget, the $285,000 project 
includes laying designer sidewalks and putting in decorative planters and palm 
trees, Watkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 That project started June 6 and will end the first week in September, he said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; TRAFFIC LIMIT FOES BLOCK GENERAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opposition from property owners is delaying the adoption of Westminster's 
General Plan, the document that guides the city's growth and development. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than two years, the city is not close to adopting the document 
because property owners are objecting to a key provision that requires future 
developments to meet traffic limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed General Plan, properties designated as "planned 
development" are assigned ADTs, or average daily trips, which serve as a kind 
of quota of how much traffic that property is allowed to generate. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say that is necessary to avoid congestion, minimize pollution 
and maintain the quality of life. But property owners say it's a prescription 
for slow growth or no growth that would drive property values down. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a well-accepted idea," said Hal Mintz, a mobile home park 
consultant on the ADT requirement during a public hearing this week in which 
the General Plan was again presented to the City Council for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you nail down everything on numbers," Mintz told the council, "you'll be 
making a serious mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say no other city in Orange County has adopted ADTs as a 
foundation for its General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody seems to be against it," Mayor Charles V. Smith said. "I see no 
good reason to keep it." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Fry Jr. said traffic limits would restrict growth and "turn 
the city to a slum." 
</P>
<P>
 "This puts a burden on the property owners," Councilman Tony Lam said. "ADTs 
are a handicap in the use of the land." 
</P>
<P>
 The council directed the Building and Planning Department to find ways to 
eliminate the ADT requirement without scuttling the rest of the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed changes to the General Plan will be the first since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has hired a consultant, Lightfoot Planning Group, to help prepare the 
document, which addresses such issues as land use, circulation, housing, open 
space, conservation, safety and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning and Building Director Mike Bouvier said that the city has spent about 
$360,000 so far in the preparation of the document. BERT ELJERA

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; PARKING CHARGES CUT AT TEMPORARY LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A parking nightmare-in-the-making has been nipped in the bud. 
</P>
<P>
 La Reina Fashion Plaza had agreed to provide replacement parking for a public 
lot that closed on July 11. But a week later, La Reina started charging for its 
parking. 
</P>
<P>
 One merchant complained to Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's office, and by July 21 
the problem had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time I have had such swift response from the city 
councilman's office," said David Montes, manager of Tower Records, on the 
corner of Ventura Boulevard and Cedros Avenue. "Miss Rescalvo really came to 
our aid." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Montes, Yaroslavsky aide Vivian Rescalvo seemed very concerned 
when he informed her that the La Reina Fashion Plaza began charging parking 
rates of 75 cents per half-hour and $2 per day. Parking at the old lot behind 
Tower Records cost 25 cents an hour and $1 for 10 hours.

<P>
 A parking shortage in the area concerns retailers, who say it is hurting their 
business. Sherman Oaks Services Corp. is building a senior housing project over 
the public parking lot, preventing its use until June, 1995. The developer 
arranged for replacement parking at La Reina until Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The store manager said that on July 18, some customers said a La Reina parking 
attendant told them they should not be parking at the shopping center, while 
others were upset when they discovered that Tower Records could not validate 
their parking tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "My customers were livid because there was nowhere to park," Montes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's office contacted Trans-Pacific Partners Co., the 
asset-management company that represents La Reina's owner, and by the afternoon 
of July 21, the shopping center was allowing motorists one hour free parking in 
its subterranean parking lot. Drivers are being charged 75 cents for every 
additional half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Hlebasco of Trans-Pacific said that under his company's agreement with 
Sherman Oaks Services, La Reina was allowed to charge market rates for parking. 
But after considering the council office's concerns, the company decided to 
offer below-market parking rates, Hlebasco said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're good citizens," the asset manager said. "Vivian (Rescalvo) had 
indicated that some people in the community were disappointed. We try to do our 
best to balance my interest as a landlord at La Reina and the interests of my 
tenants and their shoppers with what everybody considers to be a valuable 
community asset -- which is a senior citizens home." KAY HWANGBO

 Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick proposed Friday that the city 
immediately buy new vans so the Police Department can transport to local 
stations special training equipment called for by the reformist Christopher 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment, similar to simulators used to train airline pilots, will help 
teach officers the appropriate use of force by simulating encounters with 
suspects and other scenarios.The $270,000 equipment arrived three weeks ago, 
but is being stored at the Police Academy because the LAPD has no vans to 
transport it to stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick, who discovered the situation when she was touring the academy last 
week, wants the council to spend $40,000 on new vans. The council is set to 
vote on the issue Friday 
</P>
<P>
 The Christopher Commission investigated the LAPD after the March 3, 1991, 
beating of Rodney G. King and found evidence of brutality and racism in the 
department. TRACEY KAPLAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; FISHERMAN WHO DROWNED IDENTIFIED

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who slipped into the Ventura River and drowned while fishing with a 
friend has been identified as 41-year-old Alfredo Escoto of Oxnard, authorities 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Escoto slipped from the riverbank into water about 7 feet deep around 6 p.m. 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told sheriff's deputies he had been pulling on a tree branch to 
clear the way for his fishing line when he lost his grip and fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Coroner Dale Zentzis said Escoto did not know how to swim, nor did his 
friend. By the time the friend ran to get help and returned with two employees 
from the nearby Ojai Rubbish Co., Escoto was underwater. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were lots of branches underwater. We were trying to feel for the body 
with our feet," said Brady Bonsworth, a foreman at the rubbish company. "(My 
partner) felt something, and I went in his direction. Then we both grabbed the 
body and pulled it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Zentzis said Escoto had been submerged for 10 to 15 minutes by the time he was 
pulled from the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took him to shallow water and tried to get the water out of him and start 
to revive him," Bonsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within seconds, sheriff's deputies and firefighters arrived and took over 
rescue efforts, but it was too late. JULIE FIELDS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; EFFORT RENEWED TO CUT SPEED LIMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of residents plans to meet with City Manager Jerry L. Bankston next 
week to discuss whether the speed limit can be reduced along a stretch of Seal 
Beach Boulevard where a 12-year-old was struck and killed earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The boulevard, the main link between the San Diego Freeway and central Seal 
Beach, has long been viewed as a safety hazard by some residents, especially a 
portion that runs in front of McGaugh Elementary School and Seal Beach Naval 
Weapons Station housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Schneider was waiting to walk his bike across the boulevard en 
route to McGaugh Elementary on Tuesday afternoon when a car jumped the curb and 
hit him. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said suspected drunk driver Cynthia Kaye Lietz, 28, of Seal Beach 
caused the accident by suddenly swerving out of her northbound traffic lane, 
forcing another driver to lose control of his car and hit the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday night, friends and family of Christopher held a vigil in his memory 
at Seal Beach Boulevard and Anchor Way, near the accident site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to do this for Christopher and we want to make people aware of 
people who drive drunk and how dangerous they are to our children," said Vicki 
Gallagher, whose son was a friend of the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear whether the speed of the cars played a role in Tuesday's 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the city fought successfully to have the speed limit on Seal 
Beach Boulevard reduced from 50 to 45 m.p.h. in front of McGaugh School. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's private meeting with Bankston is expected to be attended by 
Christopher's father, Dean Schneider, a petty officer first class at the 
weapons station, and Councilwoman Gwen Forsythe, who has long pushed for 
reducing the speed limit near the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Handler, a Marina Hill resident who witnessed the accident, said she and 
others are also organizing a community meeting on the subject Friday at 7:30 
p.m. at the Mary Wilson Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community is mobilizing around this tragedy," said Handler, noting that 
350 children live just off Seal Beach Boulevard in military housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lietz faces various felony charges including reckless driving and driving with 
a suspended license. Police are awaiting the results of tests that will 
determine whether she was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. SHELBY GRAD

CONCERT AN ACT OF FAITH FOR NOVICE PROMOTERS; MUSIC: CAREY WONG AND GEORGE 
JEROME MAY BE BEGINNERS BUT THEY HAVE LINED UP AN ARRAY OF TALENT HEADLINED BY 
CARMAN FOR A FOUR-DAY FESTIVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With more than 50 Christian artists and musical groups booked, including 
headliner Carman and the rock group Petra, Summer Praise '94 is being promoted 
heavily among evangelicals, who have turned out in respectable numbers for 
contemporary Christian music concerts and a recent series of crusade rallies in 
the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 But the event set for Aug. 11-14 at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center is still 
a risk for its organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 The promoters are an unusual pair of novices -- Carey Wong, 31, a Glendale 
financier and ex-banker, and George Jerome, 50, owner of a Chatsworth computer 
business. Wong is a Baptist, while Jerome is not a believer but a 
self-described religious searcher. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't have a track record with big-name evangelical backers, although the 
World Vision relief agency has lent its name as a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor can they offer festival-goers a lot of comfortable stadium seating. 
Although they hope to attract at least 25,000 ticket buyers, the Equidome seats 
only 4,000. Another 8,000 can stand on the dirt infield for the featured 
performances. Three other stages will be set up in open-air areas and 
concert-goers will be encouraged to bring blankets or folding chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the festival does have an array of names from Christian music. Besides 
Carman and Petra, the roster includes Crystal Lewis and groups such as 4 Him, 
Newsboys, Guardian and Dakoda Motor Company. Black Christian artists include 
Larnelle Harris, Helen Baylor and Ron Kenoly. Latino Christian performers 
include Patty Cabrera and Chuckie Perez. A dozen artists in the country 
Christian genre will also perform. 
</P>
<P>
 A lineup of speakers reflecting a conservative evangelical perspective on 
social issues includes the Rev. E. V. Hill, a nationally known Baptist pastor 
from South-Central Los Angeles, and William J. Murray, the Christian convert 
son of atheist leader Madalyn Murray O'Hair. Carman is expected to promote his 
petition campaign calling for a constitutional amendment to permit prayer in 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Evangelism is a low-key aspect of the festival, although the Summer Praise '94 
literature says that its goals include affording participants "a life-changing 
experience that will affirm their faith in Christ" and that "the unsaved 
(non-Christians) . . . would come to know our Savior." 
</P>
<P>
 Wong, smiling at his co-promoter during the interview, added: "Maybe even 
George Jerome will see it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The two men became acquainted through business relationships. Jerome said he 
hopes that if Summer Praise '94 makes any profit, part of the proceeds would 
launch a pet project of his to house, train and employ homeless people as food 
cart vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-time promoters said they will have invested nearly $300,000 of their 
own money by the time of the festival, despite much more modest plans at the 
start. "This took on a life of its own," Jerome said. "We're now controlled by 
the festival rather than controlling it -- a poor way to do business." 
</P>
<P>
 Wong predicted a turnout of 25,000 to 40,000 people. But Jerome is hoping for 
more than 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The five largest annual Christian music festivals in the country attract 
30,000 to 60,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatively low ticket prices for Summer Praise '94 may help boost attendance. 
For all four days, the price is $35 at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Headliner Carman, twice named by Billboard magazine as Contemporary Christian 
Artist of the Year, once drew 26,000 to a concert at the Six Flags Over Georgia 
amusement park, according to the Gospel Music Assn. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The biggest single-night crowd at the June 1-5 San Fernando Valley Crusade 
featuring evangelist Luis Palau was 11,200 for the Saturday youth-oriented 
night featuring contemporary Christian music -- not the opening and closing 
days of the crusade, which normally get the biggest crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 At the recent Harvest Crusade backed by nearly three times as many churches as 
supported the Valley crusade, evangelist Greg Laurie preached to 128,000 at 
Anaheim Stadium over three nights. Country music star Ricky Skaggs and pop 
singer Deniece Williams were among artists who performed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Summer Praise festival might have been fatally jinxed had the promoters 
followed original plans to book singer Michael English, whose Christian music 
career collapsed over a sex scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months ago, Wong and Jerome had a tentative agreement with English as the 
featured singer. But English was actually their second choice. They were really 
seeking Carman, a proven big draw on the Christian circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day in late March, I said, 'If we don't get Carman by 2:30 p.m., then 
let's move forward with Michael English,' " said Wong, whose job was to acquire 
talent. "Carman's agent called a minute or two before our deadline and said 
Carman would be available." 
</P>
<P>
 English was named best male vocalist of the year at the Gospel Music Assn. 
Dove Awards April 28 in Nashville. But within a week, English returned all of 
his awards, admitting that he had an affair with a married woman, another 
gospel singer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have had to change all our advertising," Wong said. "We definitely 
would have scaled down the event." 
</P>
<P>
 With the commitment by Carman, a five-time Dove Award winner, Wong said, "a 
lot of Christian musicians who were saying they were unavailable all of sudden 
became available." 
</P>
<P>
 Wong suggests divine providence was at work. "I believe in God's grace," he 
said.

JESUS ON THE TALK SHOW CIRCUIT? CLERIC WRITES SCRIPT; WHIMSY: MINISTER'S BOOK 
IMAGINES CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE SON OF GOD AND A RAFT OF CELEBRITIES, 
INCLUDING RUSH LIMBAUGH AND THE MATERIAL GIRL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Madonna? Let those without sin cast the first stone. Rush Limbaugh? He who 
mocks the poor shows contempt for their maker. David Letterman? Sorry, Johnny 
gets the 11:30 slot in the hereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Jesus would not be tongue-tied if he returned to sit down with some of the 
biggest celebrities of our age. In a gentle, humorous new book, "What Jesus 
Would Say . . .," a minister at one of the nation's largest evangelical 
churches imagines some of those what-if meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget about a wrathful Lord leaving bodies strewn in his path as he tramps 
through the vineyards of pop culture. The Jesus envisioned by the Rev. Lee 
Strobel takes a sympathetic look at some of the betes noires of conservative 
Christians -- Madonna, Bart Simpson and President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Strobel, a minister at Willow Creek Community Church in suburban Chicago, 
wants to show readers of the book to be released next month by Zondervan 
Publishing House that religion is more about love than condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public perception of God tends to be so judgment-oriented," Strobel said. 
"I think he does it through grace and love that helps our heart as opposed to 
slam-dunking people because they have messed up." 
</P>
<P>
 Take Madonna, whose capacity for self-promotion and mixing religious and 
sexual imagery knows few bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Son of God walked into one of her "Girlie Shows," Strobel admits, "I 
think a lot of people think the first thing Jesus would do is to slap her 
face." 
</P>
<P>
 But Strobel believes that Jesus would treat the Material Girl as he did the 
adulterous women at the well in the Gospel of John, offering her redemption and 
challenging those who are without sin to cast the first stone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesus was harshest on the religious leaders of the day because he saw such 
hypocrisy at throwing stones at other people," Strobel said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the political front, Strobel indicates that Jesus would call Clinton to 
account for any infidelities and his stand in favor of legalized abortion. But 
he would also be pained by evangelicals who gloat over the Administration's 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Biblically, we're called as Christians to give honor to those in government. 
We should be praying for them," Strobel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh -- the mouth that roars and roars -- would be told to put a sock in 
it when it comes to denigrating the poor, "femiNazis" or people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "He who mocks the poor shows contempt for their maker," Jesus, quoting from 
Proverbs, might remind Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 That this is not your typical evangelical self-help book also is evident in 
the Top 10 list of things that Jesus would say to David Letterman. No. 10: 
"Sorry, Johnny gets the 11:30 slot in eternity." And No. 5: "Behave yourself or 
I'll reveal to the world that you were Chip on 'My Three Sons.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Strobel, 42, a former atheist who left a newspaper career for the ministry in 
1987, said the idea came to him when some ministers at Willow Creek were 
talking and someone wondered what Jesus would say to the TV character Murphy 
Brown. Everyone laughed, but he later developed the idea into a series of 
sermons on the loving ways of Jesus.

KOREAN PASTORS SAY L.A. MARATHON KEEPS WORSHIPERS AWAY; SERVICES: CLERGY CITE 
TRAFFIC CONTROLS, WANT EVENT SWITCHED TO ANOTHER DAY. RACE ORGANIZER OPPOSES 
THE SUGGESTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Declaring that traffic controls during the Los Angeles Marathon make it 
difficult for hundreds of worshipers to attend church, Korean pastors have 
urged organizers of the annual sports extravaganza to hold it on another day. 
</P>
<P>
 Held on the first Sunday of March since its inception in 1986, the race drew 
more than 19,000 runners this year from around the world. An estimated 1.3 
million spectators lined the 26.2-mile route. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the gaiety and goodwill, the pastors said street closures, detours 
and throngs of onlookers make it difficult for members of as many as 300 Korean 
American churches of various denominations to attend worship services on time, 
if at all. The course includes a leg through Koreatown. An estimated 400 city 
streets were closed for the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congregations are late or absent on that Sunday. That brings a serious 
inconvenience to our churches," said the Rev. Chung Lee of Union Evangelical 
Church, located in the Pico-Union district near Downtown Los Angeles. He said 
Sunday is observed by the faithful as "the day of the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
 The pastors, who include Presbyterians, Methodists and Episcopalians, said 
they speak for 200 to 300 Korean and ethnically mixed congregations and hope to 
enlist the support of non-Korean religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
 St. James Episcopal Church and Wilshire United Methodist Church, both with 
either non-Korean or ethnically mixed congregations on Wilshire Boulevard, said 
they share the concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 A petition urging a change in the day of the race has garnered an estimated 
2,500 signatures, the Korean pastors said. They have also organized the "Change 
L.A. Marathon Day Committee" and said they plan to bring up the issue in a 
meeting with Los Angeles City Council members soon. 
</P>
<P>
 But the clergy, who met with marathon officials June 28, are getting little 
sympathy from the founder and president of the marathon, William Burke. Nor is 
everyone in the Korean community in agreement with the pastors. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke charged that the pastors are more exercised about their collection 
plates than the exercise of religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking about an issue here of denial of the practice of religion," 
Burke said in an interview. "What we're talking about here is an economic issue 
-- it diminishes their collections. When you get down to it, I pray at home and 
I'm sure God hears me," Burke said. "What we're talking about is some ministers 
who want to make sure their collections maintain a certain level." 
</P>
<P>
 Burke's remark about the collection plate was sharply criticized by the Rev. 
Peter Kim, the pastor in charge of administration and public affairs at 
Young-Nak Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles, the largest Korean American 
congregation in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The possible impact on offerings was "not even a thought for a moment that 
came into our minds," Kim said. "We are just very much interested in our church 
members." He urged Burke to apologize for his remark. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a Koreatown civic leader said the pastors do not represent the 
thinking of a majority of Koreatown residents. If anything, he said, he is 
promoting greater participation in the race among Korean volunteers, 
entertainers and runners. 
</P>

 "I don't want any disputes to happen between the Korean community and the L.A. 
Marathon," said Yohng Sohk Choe, adviser to the Koreatown Association and 
secretary-general of the Koreatown Public Safety Association. "That might be a 
few pastors' opinions, but it's not the general opinion of the whole 
community." He also said he believed only 50 to 60 Korean churches were 
actually affected by street closures. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke and his staff said that the marathon helps religious groups in 
fund-raising efforts. For six years, marathon officials said, the Roman 
Catholic Archdiocese has used the marathon to recruit men and women into the 
religious life. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said officials try to take the needs of churches into account in traffic 
control decisions. But, he said, Sunday is the day when city traffic is at a 
minimum. He also noted that marathon races are held on Sundays in New York, San 
Francisco, London and Chicago. Boston holds the race on a Monday.

RESEARCHER FINDS SURPRISES IN MISSION WALLS; HISTORY: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
CHURCH'S INTERIOR WAS BUILT OF VOLCANIC TUFF, NOT SANDSTONE AS PREVIOUSLY 
BELIEVED. 
</P>

<P>
 The old mission church in San Juan Capistrano has been eroding for so long, 
most people thought it was all crumbly sandstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all, says an archeologist who has been trying to stop the deterioration 
and has turned up several surprises working on the 188-year-old ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 For one, the interior of the Great Stone Church is made of volcanic tuff, not 
sandstone. 
</P>
<P>
 For another, inside walls were painted with brightly pigmented lime washes 
that previous researchers may have mistaken for dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an idea it was a subtle palette of pinks, whites and turquoise," said 
Frank Matero, director of the Architectural Conservation Laboratory at the 
University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 Matero said he had never seen a building in North America made of tuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stone is so soft, it can be carved with a penknife, and it's very 
lightweight so it could be hoisted up," said Matero, a team leader on one part 
of a $2-million, 10-year restoration project. 
</P>
<P>
 Matero said the group was coming up with new information on how to preserve 
sandstone, tuff and old plaster. They are experimenting with epoxies and other 
binders to find the best materials for saving the ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission is famous as the nesting place for swallows who migrate each 
spring from South America. Its Great Stone Church was begun in 1797, finished 
in 1806 and destroyed in an 1812 earthquake that killed 40 people at Sunday 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear where the mission builders got the volcanic rock, which is 
found throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 But Matero said there was evidence that Native American craftsmen helped 
finish the church after Spanish master mason Isidro Aguilar died. Their lack of 
experience may have contributed to the collapse, the archeologist said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mission has a combination of very traditional Spanish techniques, but 
there's some very idiosyncratic techniques in the construction that suggest 
uneducated local input," he said.

SOME DENOMINATIONS CUT BACK MINISTRIES FOR DISABLED; FINANCES: THE REDUCTIONS 
OCCUR BECAUSE DONATIONS TO SOME NATIONAL CHURCHES ARE DECLINING, OFFICIALS SAY. 
ADVOCATES WORRY THAT GAINS ARE BEING ERODED. 
</P>

 No one in Ginny Thornburgh's church ever asked why she left her third son at 
home during Sunday worship. They didn't ask about the mentally retarded boy, 
and she assumed he would be unwelcome. 
</P>
<P>
 But just how little her church cared about her disabled child became clear 
when Thornburgh's fourth child was born. This baby was not handicapped, and her 
fellow congregants told her all about the nursery and implored her to bring the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when it hit me, and I've never rested since," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornburgh, wife of former Atty. Gen. Richard Thornburgh, is now the director 
of the religion and disability program of the Washington-based National 
Organization on Disability. Her son, Peter, goes to a church where he assists 
the minister at worship. 
</P>
<P>
 But such gains may soon be in danger of slipping away as several denominations 
cut back on disability ministries because of budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the disability ministry office 
has been cut back from full- to part-time, and in 1995 it will be eliminated. 
The Episcopal Church has already done away with a disability ministry office at 
its New York headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), a halftime position was eliminated 
and the job given to another staff member who is able to devote less than a 
tenth of his time to disability ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 Disability programs -- and other ministries -- are suffering painful cutbacks 
as donations to national church offices in many large Protestant denominations 
have dropped, church officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I disagree with the notion it was an easy cut," said Dennis Busse of the 
Lutheran Office for Disability Ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say the severity of the cutbacks indicate that handicapped ministries 
took a disproportionate but not unexpected hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church has a continual record of failing to recognize people with 
disabilities," said Mark Wendorf, executive director of the Presbyterian 
Health, Education and Welfare Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 What concerns advocates for the disabled is the very thing that they have been 
fighting for -- increased visibility and recognition of the disabled -- will be 
undermined as national church bodies do away with offices that forced 
denominations to be sensitive to such ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until a person experiences a disability themselves or has a family member 
with a disability, it's far from their consciousness," says Alonna Gautsche 
Sprunger, a consultant to the Committee on Disabilities of the National Council 
of Churches. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, churches may on their own become accessible to the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's our goal, but there's a lot of concern we're not at that point yet, 
and . . . there are a lot of people being lost on the way," said Sprunger, who 
is also director of advocacy programs for the Mennonite Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook is not all bad. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest Protestant 
denomination, a disability ministry staff person and publication lost to budget 
cuts earlier this year were restored after an outcry from the pews. 
</P>
<P>
 And some churches are considered to have model programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian Reformed Church, for example, has pledged to conform with the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, although churches are exempt from many of its 
provisions. A church subsidiary, Friendship Ministries, promotes one-on-one 
relationships with mentally disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone must have his or her opportunity to bless the church with what he or 
she has been given," said the Rev. James Vanderlein, director of the church's 
Committee on Disability Concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Jane Owen, executive director of the National Catholic Office for Persons 
with Disabilities, said most dioceses have their own disability ministry 
offices, and increasingly those are being expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am encouraged. I am not discouraged," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the United Methodist Church has kept its disability ministry staff 
despite budget pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very saddened by the fact that many of our sister denominations have 
cut back," said Kathy Reeves, executive secretary for ministries with people 
with physically and mentally challenging conditions in the United Methodist 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Society may glorify perfection, but Jesus's ministry is clear that people of 
all physical and mental abilities should be included in the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Where both disabled people and churches will benefit, she and other advocates 
say, is when people with disabilities are looked upon as untapped resources for 
the church, rather than as liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people basically want is that they are part of the community," she said. 
"Not just to give to that person but to receive the gifts that person has to 
offer."

1 CRITICALLY HURT IN LAGUNA CANYON ROAD CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 27-year-old Costa Mesa man was critically injured Friday when he tried to 
make a U-turn on Laguna Canyon Road and was broadsided by a 1994 Ford Explorer 
behind him in the southbound lane, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Canh Nguyen, who was driving a 1986 Toyota, was airlifted to Mission Hospital 
Regional Medical Center following the 3:30 p.m. crash, about a mile south of 
the San Diego Freeway, Irvine police Sgt. Craig Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen was in critical condition late Friday with major head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Canyon Road, the scene of numerous traffic deaths in recent years, was 
closed for four hours between El Toro Road and the San Diego Freeway as a 
result of the collision. 
</P>
<P>
 A passenger in the Toyota, 18-year-old Thao Nguyen of Costa Mesa, received 
minor injuries and was treated for back and leg pain at Irvine Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the Explorer was unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that neither alcohol nor excessive speed were factors in the 
crash. For an unknown reason, the Toyota slowed and began to make a U-turn, 
Smith said. The other driver, following several car lengths behind, tried to 
evade the Toyota.

BRUSH FIRE CONTAINED AT 700 ACRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A brush fire that broke out alongside the Golden State Freeway just north of 
the Los Angeles County line was contained at 700 acres, Kern County fire 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was ignited by a disabled car that caught fire Thursday on the 
freeway shoulder in Tejon Pass, near Fort Tejon. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze jumped the eight-lane highway and burned along steep hillsides near 
Los Padres National Forest, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No buildings were damaged, but the fire at one point threatened an elementary 
school on the edge of the town of Lebec, which has a population of 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 "The winds were in our favor," and the blaze was contained shortly before 
midnight Thursday, said Capt. Kent Harper of the Kern County Fire Department. 
"The whole western U.S. is hot and dry and it was amazing that we got it 
contained this fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Five-hundred firefighters from the Kern County Fire Department, U.S. Forest 
Service, Bureau of Land Management, California Department of Forestry and Los 
Angeles County Fire Department fought the fire, Harper said.

WOMAN TO BE TRIED IN RENT FRAUD SCHEME; LANCASTER: MARY LOUISE JOHNSON 
ALLEGEDLY TOLD WOULD-BE TENANTS AND BUYERS SHE PURCHASED FORECLOSURE HOUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Palmdale woman accused of running a fraud scheme in which she collected rent 
from tenants at houses she did not own was ordered Friday to stand trial on 
three counts of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 After a preliminary hearing that focused on complex real estate documents, 
Antelope Municipal Judge Chesley N. McKay Jr. found that there was sufficient 
evidence to order a trial for Mary Louise Johnson, who has also used the name 
Mary Thedford. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have alleged that Johnson told prospective tenants and buyers 
that she was a buyer of foreclosure homes. She persuaded low-income residents 
and others who were unsophisticated in real estate matters to rent or buy these 
properties without getting permission from the lenders, who had taken 
possession of the houses, investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen Horowitz, a legally blind woman who testified at the hearing, said she 
rented a house from Johnson, then gave her a $6,000 down payment toward the 
purchase of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Johnson appeared to be "a church lady" who presented herself as the 
legitimate owner of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a cruel act to take money, especially from people who can least afford 
it," Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph D. Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Lawrence Miller, argued that his 
client was legally entitled to sell the house to Horowitz because she had 
purchased a quit-claim deed from the previous owner, who had lost the house 
through foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no evidence of any intent to defraud," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sheriff's Detective Jan Carroll testified that the lending institutions 
that took possession of the foreclosed houses had not given Johnson the right 
to rent or sell the dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Carroll said she is looking into fraud allegations involving 
Johnson and at least six other victims, which may lead to additional charges. 
</P>
<P>
 She said deputies had seized "milk crates full of files on homes" after 
obtaining a warrant to search Johnson's home. She said these files will be 
reviewed as part of a continuing investigation into Johnson's real estate 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the court hearing, McKay ordered that Johnson remain in jail, in 
lieu of $500,000 bail, pending her Aug. 12 arraignment in Lancaster Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller argued that Johnson's bail was excessively high, particularly in a case 
in which the alleged losses totaled only about $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But McKay refused to reduce the bail, saying Johnson, who has used several 
different names, posed a flight risk, and that questions still surround her 
financial assets. The bail bond company that posted her original $100,000 bail 
returned her to custody because Johnson allegedly used a house she did not own 
as collateral, authorities said.

14-YEAR-OLD KILLED, 3 HURT IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Palmdale teen-ager was killed and three others were injured when the car in 
which they were riding veered out of control and rolled over, authorities said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany Daproza, 14, was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident, which 
occurred at 5:50 p.m. Thursday on Avenue P, just east of 10th Street East. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car, Scott Ibbotson, 20, of Palmdale was arrested on 
suspicion of vehicular manslaughter and reckless driving. On Friday, he 
remained in jail in lieu of $25,000 bail at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department's Antelope Valley Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said Ibbotson was driving west in a 1989 Honda Civic, erratically and 
at high speed, when the car went out of control, slid into the dirt shoulder 
and rolled over, ejecting Daproza and Sara Woleslagle, 17, also of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Woleslagle was reported in good condition Friday at Lancaster Community 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Her sister, Amy Woleslagle, 15, and Ibbotson, who both remained in the car 
when the accident occurred, were treated at Palmdale Hospital Medical Center 
and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Daproza was a student at Palmdale High School, as are the other two girls.

 A sidewalk rally by about 60 supporters kicked off the Antelope Valley's first 
gay pride festival Friday evening. A large protest demonstration announced by 
critics of the event failed to materialize.

 Shortly after plans for the festival were announced in April, conservative 
activists, including a group called the Alliance Against Immmoral Conduct in 
Public, vowed to picket the Antelope Valley Fairgrounds, where the event was to 
be held. 
</P>
<P>
 But only three men and a 7-year-old boy showed up Friday evening to protest 
peacefully. One man said homosexuality was sinful, and another said it was 
contributing to the destruction of the nation's moral character. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message I'm trying to share is that Jesus loves sinners," said protester 
Saunders Swaski of Lake Los Angeles. "It's obvious that if people are 
supporting this, they're professing to be sinners, and they need Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters, standing on one side of a parking lot entrance, did not make 
much of an impression on the dozens of festival supporters on the other side 
who cheered and waved signs at passing cars and trucks. Many of the motorists 
honked their horns or gave thumbs-up signs, apparently to show support for the 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little evidence of the anti-gay sentiment that has surfaced 
elsewhere in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the city councils of Palmdale and Lancaster have taken stands 
against gay rights legislation, and a Lancaster church produced "The Gay 
Agenda," a nationally distributed anti-homosexual video. More recently, a 
number of residents have criticized the festival in calls to local radio shows 
and in letters to a local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Dicey, a board member of the Antelope Valley Gay and Lesbian Alliance, 
which organized the event, said she was pleased that so few protesters showed 
up Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 'I felt that was a lot of hot air," Dicey said. "I think it just shows us what 
they're all about. Maybe they've become educated, and wouldn't that be nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Maxey, a Lancaster resident who helped organize the demonstration in 
support of the festival, said more protesters may show up before the event 
concludes. "It's not over," he said Friday night. "We still have tomorrow and 
Sunday. Nothing would surprise me." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, which features an exhibit on gay history, speakers, refreshments 
and musical entertainment, opens at noon today and Sunday at the fairgrounds, 
Division Street at East Avenue I.

AIRPORT READIES FOR NEXT DISASTER; AGUA DULCE: JANUARY QUAKE MADE OFFICIALS 
REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF PREPAREDNESS, SO THEY ARE UPDATING EMERGENCY PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling themselves "dreadfully naive" in their preparations for a catastrophe, 
officials at a tiny airport here are updating their 15-year-old disaster plan 
in the wake of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Agua Dulce Air Park's revamped plan, which will catalogue community 
resources and emergency volunteers, includes the purchase of new radio 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 It also resurrects a decades-long squabble over the small airport's possible 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the airport was used frequently in the days after the Jan. 17 
earthquake, those coordinating airport activities realized they would have had 
little idea what to do if, for example, telephone lines had been damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had an emergency plan in place for several years," said Stewart 
Aleshire, a pilot and regular user of the Agua Dulce airport. "During the 
Northridge earthquake we really found out how inadequate it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials are now making a list of pilot addresses, the fuel and 
passenger capacity of planes stored there and the location of on-site emergency 
generators. A list is also being compiled with the names of elderly and 
disabled Agua Dulce residents who might need special attention after a major 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport authorities have also contacted Santa Clarita government officials so 
the two agencies can coordinate efforts in the hours immediately after a 
disaster. They are hoping to arrange to have a bulldozer on hand to repair 
possible damage to the air park's dirt runway. 
</P>
<P>
 A simulated disaster drill is scheduled Aug. 14 at the airport to test newly 
purchased radio equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big thing we found out after the quake was . . . the airport was really 
important when the freeways were destroyed and the Santa Clarita Valley was 
locked off from the L.A. Basin," said Vic Crowe, member of the Agua Dulce 
Airport Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other thing we learned was that if communications go out, we will need 
radios," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The disaster plan discussion also raised a long-running debate among 
residents, pilots and government officials over the future of the 25-year-old 
air park, which is up for sale by its longtime owner, James Annin. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County officials want a general aviation facility in the Santa 
Clarita Valley, but many residents want the air park either to shut down or to 
remain a small facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots say county purchase of the airport would prevent the facility from 
being closed and the land being developed. But those living nearby fear county 
ownership would bring more planes, traffic and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Northridge earthquake, the airstrip was used to transport five law 
enforcement officers from Santa Clarita to San Fernando and Santa Monica, 
airport officials said. Insurance adjusters and utility company representatives 
also used the airstrip, as did pilots who flew supplies to family and friends 
in Los Angeles who were difficult to reach because of earthquake damage to 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters hailed it as proof of the airport's value in an emergency. But 
critics said nearly all flights after the quake were by helicopters, which do 
not require a runway.

REPORTER MISSED MARK ON MOON TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During moon astronaut Eugene A. Cernan's talk at the Reagan library in Simi 
Valley on July 26, I was fortunate to be able to ask a question about his 
experience on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been interested in space exploration for a long time.I went to Florida 
and saw the launch of Apollo 11 and have seen most of the videos and 
photographs taken on the moon's surface from lunar orbit. Some of these 
pictures show a hint of color ranging from blue to orange depending upon the 
film used and the sun angle, so I asked the astronaut how the lunar surface 
appeared to his eye. His answer was that the moon is essentially colorless, 
showing only shades of gray. The one exception to this was the orange soil 
found on his mission, Apollo 17, which landed in the Taurus-Littrow area 
bordering Mare Serenitatis. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow this exchange, along with a short conversation with a reporter, was 
misinterpreted. Incredibly, The Times article on the following day stated that 
I "harbored doubts whether man actually had walked on the moon." To set the 
record straight I have never doubted the manned lunar landings and frankly 
can't imagine how anyone could.

MUSIC TEACHER IN STEP WITH STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to express my gratitude for the article about Bob Wiles' 
retirement from Thousand Oaks High School. I was one of Mr. Wiles' students and 
choir members from 1972 until 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Wiles always had a lot to share with his students. He spent quite a bit of 
his own personal time and money on the students in his various groups. I feel 
that I was fortunate to have been able to sing under his tutelage. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob devoted himself to his vocal groups. He was always working on some new 
place for us to sing, setting up trips, ticket sales and anything else that 
would keep us busy. Music seemed to be his life at TOHS. 
</P>
<P>
 I am now a soldier in the U.S. Army and though singing is not a prerequisite, 
it has paid off for me. Calling cadence is important to soldiers marching or 
running. It causes a group to bond together as well as to regulate breathing 
for long-distance running. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who didn't take advantage of the music program at TOHS missed out on a 
great thing. Those coming into TOHS are going to miss out on more because of 
Bob's retirement. His replacement will have some large shoes to fill.

SERVING UP DOUBTS ON 'TACO BASHING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First it was "immigrant bashing," now it's "taco bashing." What next? 
</P>
<P>
 The Center for Science in the Public Interest is launching a 
"behind-the-scenes" attack on tacos and burritos.Its objective is to discredit 
Mexican food. I don't think it will have an impact on the taco industry. Tacos, 
burritos and enchiladas are here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970-71, I was one of 20 teachers from the Southwest who trained as 
counselor-consultants for minorities at Texas Tech University in Lubbock. We 
heard rumors that the Texas Tech home economics department was trying to 
convince barrio ladies that the Mexican diet was not a healthy one. Four of us 
met with TTU home-ec. heads and instructors; the results were heartwarming. 
</P>
<P>
 We compared a typical Mexican breakfast, lunch and dinner with typical 
"American" ones. The findings convinced these fine educators that 
ounce-for-ounce, minerals-vitamins, etc. the Mexican diet was a more healthful 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 My mom and dad (living in the U.S.) passed away at ages 83 and 89, 
respectively; their diet was 90% Mexican. Two of my dad's brothers (living in 
Mexico and easting Mexican food) died at ages 105 and 106.

EVENTS LEADING TO ROCKETDYNE BLAST DESCRIBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although they have pieced together the events leading up to an explosion that 
killed two scientists this week, officials at Rockwell International's 
Rocketdyne division Friday said the cause of the blast remains a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had two experts conducting these tests," Rocketdyne President Paul B. 
Smith said. "That raises a lot of questions. This should never have happened, 
so we must ask ourselves what went wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, speaking at Rockwell's Canoga Park facility, said the two chemicals 
being tested Tuesday at Rockwell's Simi Hills test site are well-known rocket 
propellants that never before have been known to combust without being ignited. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 9:07 a.m. blast, he said, five workers were preparing for the third 
of five identical experiments testing the shock waves emitted when the chemical 
mixture burns. 
</P>
<P>
 The two earlier trials had gone according to plan: The two chemicals had been 
placed in the bottom of a shallow aluminum pan coated with sawdust. As a 
security precaution, the researchers withdrew to a secured building while one 
other researcher brought in an ignition device and placed it in the aluminum 
pan. He then retreated to the secured building. 
</P>
<P>
 A detonator in the secured building was then unlocked, and the ignition device 
set off. What followed in those first two trials was a rapid burn, the 
chemicals consumed in a matter of seconds, and the shock waves were recorded by 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the third run-through, the chemicals exploded without warning. They 
mysteriously ignited before the researchers had retreated to the "blockhouse" 
and before the ignition device had been brought out. Killed were physicist 
Larry A. Pugh, 51, and engineer Otto K. Heiney, 53. 
</P>
<P>
 A third worker, Lee Wells, remained in stable condition Friday at Sherman Oaks 
Hospital and Health Center's burn center. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said tests are continuing to determine the exact contents of the shallow 
pan. But he added that there is a "high likelihood" that the pan held only the 
two chemicals meant to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and Mike McHale, Rocketdyne's vice president of directed energy and 
imaging, also provided more details of the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Heiney, a Canoga Park engineer with the company for 10 years who was an expert 
in solid propellant research, was responsible for the aluminum pan and its 
contents -- the 10 pounds of the thick liquid, glycidal azide polymer, or GAP, 
and nitrocellulose, a fibrous white solid. Heiney was about two feet from the 
metal pan and probably making his way with the rest of the workers toward the 
blockhouse when the explosion occurred, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pugh, who had been with Rocketdyne for 17 years, was in charge of the 
recording instruments, which transmitted data during the burn through wires to 
the blockhouse. At the time of the blast, he was about six feet from the pan, 
near his instruments.

STUDY THROWS COLD WATER ON DAM PLAN; ENVIRONMENT: REPORT CITES IRREPARABLE HARM 
TO WILD CLAVEY RIVER NEAR YOSEMITE. RECOMMENDATION DOES NOT NECESSARILY DOOM 
THE PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concluding that a plan to dam the wild Clavey River near Yosemite would cause 
irreparable environmental harm, a pivotal federal study released Friday 
recommends against construction of the huge hydroelectric project. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which rarely has sided 
with environmentalists on river preservation, praised the pristine river canyon 
and advised the dam's proponents to look for other power sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "We conclude that the proposed project would not develop sufficient public 
benefits to compensate for the environmental impacts associated with its 
construction and operation," the report said. "Therefore, we recommend that the 
proposed project not be licensed." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists fighting the plan to build the 413-foot-high dam said they 
were thrilled by the recommendation. They say one of the last free-flowing 
rivers in California deserves protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been saying all along that if ever there was a project that FERC 
would find indefensible, it would be this project," said Johanna Thomas, 
executive director of the San Francisco-based Tuolumne River Preservation 
Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation does not necessarily doom the project. The commission will 
accept public comment for 90 days, issue a final environmental report and then 
vote on whether to adopt the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Turlock Irrigation District, which proposes damming the Clavey to produce 
peak summertime power for homes, farms and canneries in the Central Valley, 
acknowledged that the recommendation is a setback but said it is too early to 
say whether it will abandon the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's environmental study, while rejecting the Clavey dam, called 
for further analysis of two other alternatives, which could involve building a 
smaller diversion dam on the Clavey River. 
</P>
<P>
 Under these scenarios, water from the Clavey would be pumped to a nearby dam 
that would be built on either the North Fork of the Tuolumne River or Hunter 
Creek. Like the Clavey, they are both tributaries of the Tuolumne River. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to look at the two alternatives very closely," irrigation 
district spokesman John Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists said those proposals also are flawed and would cause 
considerable environmental damage to the Clavey and the river chosen as the new 
dam site. They called on the irrigation district to solve its long-term energy 
problems through better conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington, D.C.-based environmental group American Rivers lists the 
Clavey as one of the country's 10 most endangered rivers. That status would not 
change with either of the alternatives proposed by the commission, said Tom 
Cassidy, a vice president of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists said they will continue pushing Congress to give the Clavey 
protected status.

ALAMO'S RETURN FOR TRIAL DELAYED; COURTS: CULT LEADER IS CHARGED IN LOS ANGELES 
WITH CHILD ABUSE. HE IS IN MEMPHIS, APPEALING A TAX CONVICTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new lawyer hired by cult leader Tony Alamo following his conviction for 
federal tax violations in Memphis, Tenn., told a judge Friday that it will be 
months before the evangelist returns to Los Angeles to face child abuse 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Appeals in the federal case will keep Alamo, 59, the flamboyant leader of the 
Saugus-based Holy Alamo Christian Church, in Memphis for at least six more 
months, and "probably longer," attorney Susan James told Los Angeles Superior 
Court Judge William Pounders. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo's church started as a street ministry in the 1960s and earned millions 
of dollars in later years through communes and church-owned businesses. In the 
latest of several legal battles, Alamo was convicted June 8 of falsifying his 
1985 income tax returns and failing to file returns for the next three years. 
He is scheduled to be sentenced in the federal case Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo is charged in Los Angeles with ordering four men via telephone to strike 
Jeremiah Miller, then 11, 140 times with a large paddle in 1988 at the Saugus 
church. But pretrial proceedings were interrupted when federal officials 
arrested Alamo in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo, whose real name is Bernie Lazar Hoffman, faces up to six years in 
prison and a $550,000 fine in the federal case. He remains in custody pending 
sentencing and the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, he is charged with felony child abuse and inflicting corporal 
injury on a child. If convicted on those charges, Alamo could receive up to 12 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John Asari said he would like to bring Alamo to Los Angeles 
following his sentencing in the federal case. But he said discussions with 
James started Friday to seek "an ending other than a trial" on the child abuse 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Asari said the prosecution's willingness to offer a plea bargain, or dismiss 
the case altogether, might depend on the sentence Alamo receives in the federal 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 A status conference on the abuse case is scheduled Sept. 26. Asari said the 
frequent delays might cause problems at trial, another reason he might be 
willing to negotiate an ending to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, it harms or hinders the prosecution," he said. "I think witnesses 
tend to forget things, or they become frustrated, and that's something we will 
certainly take into account while we're deciding what course of action to 
take." 
</P>
<P>
 James said Alamo has expressed no interest in a plea bargain, although she 
will continue to keep options open. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo fired Tulsa, Okla., attorney Jeffrey Dickstein following the 
evangelist's conviction on tax charges. James, a Montgomery, Ala., attorney, 
declined to speculate on the reason for the change in attorneys, except to tell 
Pounders, "Mr. Alamo has wanted a change of counsel." 
</P>
<P>
 Dickstein could not be reached for comment Friday.

 Alamo and his wife, Susan, founded the Holy Alamo Christian Church in the 
1960s, taking in young dropouts and drug users off Hollywood streets and giving 
them food, shelter and anti-Catholic sermons. During the next two decades, the 
church prospered, especially with earnings from glitzy clothing such as 
rhinestone-studded jackets that sold for as much as $600 in fancy boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Alamo died of cancer in 1982 and her body was placed on display in the 
Alamos' Arkansas mansion for several weeks after she did not rise from the dead 
as rumored. Her body was stolen from a marble mausoleum in 1991 and has not 
been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Alamo has since married eight of his followers, including one woman who 
already had a husband, and at least two 15-year-old girls. 
</P>
<P>
 The church is still operating in Saugus and led, to the extent possible, by 
the imprisoned Alamo, said Don Sweat, a church volunteer at Friday's hearing. 
He said Alamo's religious convictions have not been dampened by the years of 
legal battles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more persecution he endures, the more resolute he gets," he said.

AMERICAN LEGION AREA 6 BASEBALL PLAYOFFS; WESTLAKE-ROYAL FUMBLES AWAY LEAD, 
GAME IN NINTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 You'll find a record of Friday's Westlake-Royal game filed under "Ouch." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal made four errors in the ninth inning and helped Arcadia rally 
for a 6-5 victory in the American Legion Area 6 playoffs Friday night at UCLA's 
Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal began the inning with a 2-1 lead and closer Scott Morris on the 
mound. After a leadoff single, the team made errors on three consecutive plays, 
allowing Arcadia (32-7) to tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
 One out later, Morris walked Pete Paciorek with the bases loaded, forcing in 
the go-ahead run. 
</P>
<P>
 After Justin Stewart doubled home two more runs, Westlake-Royal made another 
error, allowing the sixth run. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's baseball for you," Morris said. "I have all the confidence in the 
world in our defense. It's an unfortunate thing to happen, but that's just 
baseball."  
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal (26-6-1) scored three runs in the bottom of the ninth, but 
Aaron Tapking grounded out with the bases loaded to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost our composure a little defensively and my guess is we're going to 
learn from that . . . when we lose at least we're entertaining," said Mike 
McClure, coach of Westlake-Royal. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal will play Valley North in an elimination game at 10 a.m. today. 
The winner will play again at 6. Westlake-Royal, which was three outs from 
being in the tournament driver's seat, now must win four straight games in two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal seemed destined to win after escaping a jam in the seventh, 
when first baseman Matt Pitstick made a leaping catch of Paciorek's 
bases-loaded line drive and stepped on the bag for an inning-ending double 
play, preserving the 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Both starters pitched well. Westlake-Royal's Todd Singleton went seven 
innings, giving up one run and four hits. He struck out six. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitstick started the eighth and got two outs. Morris (1-1) recorded the third 
out, but had the game blow up in his face in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia's Jason Cly pitched seven innings and gave up five hits and two runs. 
Left-hander Greg McClelland (7-3) picked up the victory in relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo 4, Westchester 1 -- Right-hander Manuel Chavira, who pitched 
primarily against the weaker District 16 teams during the regular season, gave 
up only five singles in eight brilliant innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavira (8-0), who will be a junior at Rio Mesa High, gave up one unearned 
run. He struck out five and did not walk a batter. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Soliz pitched the ninth to pick up a save. Soliz had said he didn't 
want to pitch in the Area 6 playoffs because he wanted to save his arm for the 
Area Code Games tryouts on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked (Chavira) how many innings he wanted to go and he said eight, so I 
said I'd go the ninth," Soliz said. "I didn't want any of our pitchers who 
might be able to go tomorrow to have to pitch today." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Camarillo (27-7) has no more pitchers. Besides Soliz, Dan Martinez 
also said he won't pitch before the tryouts. Soliz and Martinez were the team's 
top two starters during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nobody else that has pitched this year," Coach Ron Regalado said. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo will play Arcadia at 2 p.m. today. If Camarillo wins, it will 
advance to Sunday's championship. If it loses, it will play again at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo broke a 1-1 tie on an unusual play in the fourth inning. With one 
out and runners at first and third, Eric Flores hit a liner to first baseman 
Doug Espinoza, who dropped the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza stepped on first to record one out, then threw to second for another. 
Because the third out at second was a tag play and the runner touched home 
before it was recorded, the run counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Adamson and Rick Collier each had two hits for Camarillo. Adamson drove 
in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North 11, St. Bernard 1 -- Jim DeBiase (6-1) helped Valley North avoid 
elimination by pitching a six-hitter and striking out 10 in eight innings. The 
game was then called because of the 10-run rule. 
</P>
<P>
 DeBiase's complete game provided a much-needed rest for Valley North's 
pitching staff. The team was playing its eighth game in 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
 It could get worse. If Valley North is to win the Area 6 title, it will need 
to play four more games in the next two days, winning them all. 
</P>
<P>
 The game Friday was scoreless through five innings, but catcher Brandon Murphy 
gave Valley North the lead with a run-scoring single in the sixth. Valley North 
led 3-1 going to the bottom of the eighth, but scored eight runs in the inning 
to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North had only two hits in the inning, but St. Bernard (14-7) made four 
errors and walked four batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Montiel was four for five with an RBI for Valley North. Rod Daryabigi and 
Murphy each had two hits. Luis Enriquez had two RBIs.

VENTURA RACEWAY; WOODWARD CLAIMS CRASH-MARRED MINI STOCK FEATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Ventura Raceway's annual Demolition Derby is not scheduled for 
another three weeks, the racers in Friday night's stock car program gave the 
fans a preview of things to come with eight spectacular crashes in the first 
four main events. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the drivers involved were injured, however, and some racing actually 
did take place between crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's Fred Woodward went wire-to-wire in the 15-lap Mini Stock feature, 
defeating defending champion Gary Hubert of Somis, while Camarillo's father-son 
team of Cliff and Jim Tietz both flipped their cars during the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Tietz was forced into the backstretch wall on Lap 5 by Camarillo's Gary 
Curtis, and the car flipped back out on the track, landing on its roof and 
stopping the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Tietz' father, Cliff, flipped on the eighth lap, stopping the race a second 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 20-lap Street Stock feature, Malibu's Adail Gayhart picked up his 
second victory in similar fashion to Woodward's. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's Dan Seabert flipped into the first turn wall on the first lap, 
stopping the race for five minutes, and there were 13 more incidents, although 
only four were serious enough to bring out the caution flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard's Tayo Sahagun, competing for only the second time, led every lap but 
the 11th in winning his first 15-lap Pony Stock main event.

CHANCE MEETING WITH BASEBALL FAME RECALLED; MEMORIES: WINNING THE CY YOUNG 
AWARD IN 1964 IS A GAME-RELATED MILESTONE IN THE STORIED LIFE OF FORMER ANGEL 
PITCHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dean Chance, that big-lug-of-a-former-pitcher, remembers the fall of 1964 very 
well. One night in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 Roused from a deep sleep, Chance found Bo Belinsky and an unknown woman on his 
doorstep. No surprise here. He had seen Bo with many an unknown woman during 
their days with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was different. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had beaten Bo out of all his money playing gin," Chance said. "Bo wanted 
me to play her and get his money back. I won the first game and then she 
cleaned me out in nine minutes. Turned out, she lived with Troy Donahue and 
played cards all the time in Gardena." 
</P>
<P>
 A week or so later, Chance received the Cy Young Award as the best pitcher for 
the 1964 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Chance pitched 11 seasons in the major leagues, winning 128 games. But his 
legacy can be boiled down to three things -- Bo Belinsky, card games and that 
Cy Young season. 
</P>
<P>
 Those three elements came together again last Sunday at Anaheim Stadium, where 
the Angels honored Chance on the 30th anniversary of his sensational season. 
Chance, who lives in Ohio, had come in from Las Vegas with Belinsky for the 
event. He left shortly after the ceremony because of a pressing engagement -- a 
gin game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can never pin Dean down," Belinsky said. "Like tonight. We had dinner 
plans and someone said, 'Hey Dean, let's go play gin.' You can forget about it, 
he's gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Chance, 53, has changed little since leaving baseball after the 1971 
season because ofan arm injury. Oh, he's a little heftier -- OK, a lot heftier 
-- but he still shows shades of that gosh-darn country boy who was signed by 
the Baltimore Orioles out of Northwestern High School in Wayne, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 He wandered through one post-baseball endeavor after another. He lost money 
managing boxers, helped run his family's farm and spent some years working the 
carnival circuit, at state and county fairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chance had his past, no matter what his current occupation, and it always 
seemed to be around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a week goes by that someone doesn't ask me what Bo is doing," Chance 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 His friendship with Belinsky, the legendary philanderer and occasional 
pitcher, often overshadowed Chance's own accomplishments. The two became 
friends in 1962 and roomed together out of necessity. Manager Bill Rigney said 
he didn't want to screw up two rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Belinsky grabbed the headlines when he pitched a no-hitter in 1962. His legend 
grew with antics off the field. But when the topic is 1964, even Bo has to take 
a back seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine a pitcher having such a year, especially now with the way the 
pitching is in baseball," Belinsky said. "Dean rendered hitters totally 
helpless. I was in awe." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rigney: "People don't realize how great Dean was that season. He flashed 
on the pages so quickly and was gone. But he was maybe the best right-handed 
pitcher I ever managed." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the Orioles thought along those lines when they offered Chance a 
$30,000 signing bonus -- a substantial amount in 1959. Chance seemed worth the 
money. He struck out 18 in one minor league game in 1960. The next night, 
teammate Arnie Phorsland struck out 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles could only protect 25 of their 40 players on the major league 
roster. They chose Phorsland over Chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Best thing that ever happened to me," Chance said. "There were too many good 
players with the Orioles. I finally got to get the ball and pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 As a pitcher, Chance was good. He won 14 games for the Angels in 1962 and 13 
in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 As a card player, he was great. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dean was a great gin player, a super gin player," said Philadelphia Phillie 
General Manager Lee Thomas, who played with the Angels from 1961-64. "I don't 
know if he cheated or not, but either way, you didn't want to play cards with 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Chance said he didn't and doesn't cheat. But the topic did come up, according 
to Belinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 One time, when the two were living together, a friend suggested they drill a 
hole in the ceiling to spy on players' hands. They decided against the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the story apparently got around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, when he plays gin, everybody plays with an umbrella over their head," 
said Belinsky, who lives in Las Vegas. "But Dean doesn't need to cheat because 
he's good. He's not lucky, he's just talented." 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case on the field in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Chance started slow. He was 5-5 at the All-Star break, then won nine 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished with 20 victories, including 11 shutouts. He won six 1-0 games and 
had a 1.65 earned-run average. He led the league in victories, ERA, shutouts 
and complete games (15). 
</P>
<P>
 Chance had a wicked fastball, made more difficult to hit by an across-the-body 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never really looked at home plate until the last minute," Rigney said. 
"Hitters hated that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Belinsky: "He had a heavy fastball and when it hit you, it felt like a 
cinder-block. He put some pitches under a few chins that season and they didn't 
want any part of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Chance almost cost the New York Yankees the pennant, beating them four times. 
The Yankees won it, finishing one game ahead of the White Sox, but scored only 
one run in 50 innings against Chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey Mantle, whose home run accounted for the Yankee run, has called Chance 
the toughest right-hander he ever faced. But then, Chance had to be tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got to remember he was pitching for the Angels," Belinsky said. "You had 
to make do with whatever runs you got." 
</P>
<P>
 In one game against the Yankees, Chance pitched 14 shutout innings, allowing 
only three hits. The Angels lost in the 15th, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "One night we got a run in the first and Dean went down the bench telling 
everyone, 'That's going to be enough,' " Rigney said. "It was. We won, 1-0." 
</P>
<P>
 Before 1967, only one pitcher was given the Cy Young award. Chance received 17 
of the 20 votes. Larry Jackson, who won 24 games for the Chicago Cubs, got two 
votes and the Dodgers' Sandy Koufax, who was 19-5 with a 1.74 ERA and seven 
shutouts, got one. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day after I won, the Merv Griffin Show had me on with Anita Bryant," 
Chance said. "They had me pitch to her. She hit the ball and damn near broke a 
camera." 
</P>
<P>
 Chance remains the only Angel to win the Cy Young Award. But he didn't remain 
an Angel. The club that became notorious in recent years for letting talent get 
away, let Chance go in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 He averaged 15 victories during his five seasons with the Angels before being 
traded to Minnesota in 1967 for first baseman Don Mincher, outfielder Jimmie 
Hall and pitcher Pete Cimino. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall and Cimino were gone in a year, Mincher in two. Chance won 20 games for 
the Twins in 1967 and pitched in the playoffs in 1969. An arm injury that 
season nagged him until he retired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of luck," Chance said. "What I remember of 1964 is Jim Fregosi at 
shortstop, Bobby Knoop and Buck Rodgers catching. Those guys made it easy. I 
remember Joe Adcock winning about five games for me. I remember pitching in 
Dodger Stadium, that big ballpark. I remember Bo and me having fun. All of that 
contributed to my success. Yup, there's nothing like old Lady Luck." 
</P>
<P>
 With cards, Bo or baseball.

ANDERSON SEEKS TO RECAPTURE GLORY DAYS; RAMS: WIDE RECEIVER, WHOSE BEST SEASONS 
WERE 1989-90, WANTS TO BECOME BIGGER PART OF GAME PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Wide receiver Flipper Anderson cruises around the Rams' training camp at UC 
Irvine on one of those radical, state-of-the-art bikes, complete with 21 gears 
that will take you from zero to 20 m.p.h. in a matter of seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 So how fast have you got that thing going, Flipper? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, about 70 m.p.h.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's estimate is more than just a little exaggerated, but his outlook on 
his career is perfectly clear -- he's changing gears. 
</P>
<P>
 A seventh-year pro, Anderson vanished from the Ram game plan last season, no 
longer the deep threat he was in 1989, when he set an NFL record for receiving 
yards in a game with 336 against New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 He surpassed that total last season by little more than 200 yards, catching 
only 37 passes for 552 yards and four touchdowns. He caught only one touchdown 
pass in the final 10 games, leaving fans to wonder if he would ever return to 
the level he played in 1989, when he caught 44 passes for 1,146 and helped the 
Rams reach the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very frustrating last season," Anderson said. "It was like I was just 
floating around out there. I was going to practice every week and I felt like I 
was part of the game plan, but the ball wasn't coming my way." 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, it could be. Henry Ellard, the Rams' leading receiver, has 
departed to Washington via free agency. Quarterback Jim Everett has been traded 
to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 They left behind Anderson, who has vowed to become the Rams' top receiver this 
season in an offense built around tailback Jerome Bettis and the 
high-percentage passing of Chris Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a put-up or shut-up year for me," Anderson said. "I really 
haven't put up any kind of numbers the past three years because of a 
combination of a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, everybody had their theory on Anderson's disappearance in the 
offense: 
</P>
<P>
 Theory No. 1 -- Everett lost it, became shaky in the pocket and could no 
longer throw the ball deep like he once did. Was it a case where Anderson just 
wasn't making a connection with Everett, or had the receiver actually lost 
faith in his quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a combination of both," Anderson said. "Jim and Henry had a special 
rapport, so whenever Jim got into trouble, he would just throw it to Henry." 
</P>
<P>
 Theory No. 2 -- Anderson played flanker in assistant coach Ernie Zampese's 
offense and didn't always run the type of routes that worked to his strengths. 
But this season, Anderson lines up at split end, Ellard's old position, in 
offensive coordinator Chick Harris' system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that position gets a few more balls than the flanker," Anderson said. 
"It's a role I look forward to handling. It puts a little more responsibility 
on me and I'm up to the task. I'm old enough and mature enough to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Theory No. 3 -- With Bettis challenging Dallas' Emmitt Smith for the league 
rushing title, the Rams were looking to run through the second half of the 
season. As a result, fewer deep pass routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerome had a great season and we started emphasizing the running game," 
Anderson said, "and I just kind of got lost out there. I was always ready to go 
if my number was called. But I wasn't getting anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Theory No. 4 -- Anderson lost the speed he once had. No true, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My speed is still good," he said. "You still have to respect me." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram wide receiver coach Steve Moore, who coached Steve Largent in Seattle, 
said has been impressed with Anderson's work ethic so far in practice. 
Anderson, who's in the final year of his contract, participated in informal 
off-season workouts this year for the first time that many on the Ram staff 
could remember. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Willie will have an incredible year so long as these three things 
come together," Moore said. "First of all, he has to play up to his ability 
level, which he has been practicing at. 
</P>
<P>
 "Secondly, he has to have rapport with the quarterback, not just on a personal 
level but on coordination on the field. And finally, the team has to win. We've 
had great players go unrecognized on teams that didn't win. Once we started 
winning, suddenly, those same players were in the Pro Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 If he and Miller make a connection, Anderson is confident he can improve upon 
his statistics from 1990, when he caught a career-high 51 passes for 1,097 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want my numbers way up," he said. "I want to surpass those 51 catches that 
by 20 or 30, get about 1,200 to 1,500 yards, 15 touchdowns and get the team to 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the kind of ball Miller throws, I think it would be easy to get a lot of 
touchdowns. Miller's coming from Atlanta, where Andre Rison was always leading 
the league in touchdown catches." Rise and Fall 
</P>
<P>
 Flipper Anderson, once a deep threat in the Rams' passing offense, all but 
vanished last season, catching only one touchdown pass in his final 10 games. 
Anderson hopes to make a comeback this season with help from a new quarterback, 
Chris Miller, and tailback Jerome Bettis, whose running could open up some 
one-on-one coverages. A look at Anderson's yearly statistics: 
06,08,07,06,07,06,05 Year G-S Rec. Yds. Avg. TDs 1988 16-1 11 319 29.0 0 1989

PRO BASEBALL / JEFF WONG; HANKINS DOES IT HIS WAY IN WINNIPEG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF WONG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in a long while, baseball is fun for Mike Hankins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley High and UCLA graduate, now with the Winnipeg Goldeyes, is 
batting .354, second best in the independent Northern League, and has started 
all 45 games at shortstop this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hankins, 26, was granted his release from the New York Yankees' organization 
after he was told in spring training he would be sent to double-A Albany in the 
Eastern League. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been his second consecutive season at Albany, for which he was a 
part-time player in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't going anywhere," he said from a hotel room in Sioux Falls, S.D. 
"They just had their bonus babies and their favorites. I wasn't one of them, 
and when I saw I was going back down again I asked for my release." 
</P>
<P>
 Hankins, a minor league veteran, knew what he was getting into when he signed 
with the Yankees in 1990. His father, Terry, spent five years in the Atlanta 
Braves' farm system (1968-72). 
</P>
<P>
 "The minor leagues are rough," Terry said. "I built Mike up for it. There's no 
glamour until you get to the big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why Hankins' younger brother, Ryan, turned down an offer from the 
Philadelphia Phillies and will play at Nevada Las Vegas next season.  
</P>
<P>
 Ryan was selected in the 33rd round by the Phillies after batting .483 with 
nine home runs and 27 runs batted in for Simi Valley High. He was selected the 
1994 Ventura County player of the year by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Mike seemed stuck in the New York organization. He enjoyed his best 
year in 1991 with Class-A Prince William, batting .263 with 37 RBIs, but a 
second year at double-A seemed daunting, especially if he wasn't assured of 
starting. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving a big-league organization for the uncertainty of life with an 
independent team seems like a gamble, but Hankins says the guaranteed playing 
time is worth the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've had some good years," Hankins said. "It's a little different (in 
Winnipeg). I'm having a lot more fun, and having fun has helped me play 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe another organization will notice, or so Hankins hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fast fact: One player battling Hankins for the Northern League batting title 
is familiar to Los Angeles fans: Pedro Guerrero. The former Dodger is playing 
for the Sioux Falls Canaries, batting .343 (sixth in the league) with five home 
runs and 33 RBIs (fourth). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Face in the crowd: Keith Smith of Newbury Park might be the leading high 
school passer in state history, but at Bristol, Va., in the rookie-level 
Appalachian League, he is just another prospect trying to get noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith had no trouble attracting attention during his high school career. He 
threw for 9,971 yards in his football career and hit .352 with three home runs 
and 19 stolen bases to lead Newbury Park to the Marmonte League title last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned down a football scholarship at Arizona after being drafted by the 
Detroit Tigers in the fifth round. The 6-foot shortstop signed for $200,000 on 
June 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going pretty good," he said from Bristol. "I'm slowly starting to get 
used to it. The pitching out here is pretty good. I've never seen some 
fastballs like the ones out here. It's just crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has struggled in the 22 games he has played, batting .210 with eight 
RBIs in 76 at-bats. He has one hit in his last 18 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just accepted that it was going to be tough," he said. "I haven't played 
this game for a while. A lot of these guys are 21, 22 years old and I just 
turned 18." 
</P>
<P>
 Things could definitely be better for Smith, not the least of which is the 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was raining in California the way it was here, we would have been 
rained out for three days," he said. "But here, we just played. It just clears 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just his luck: After waiting for what seemed like an eternity to be promoted 
to the San Francisco Giants' Phoenix affiliate in the triple-A Pacific Coast 
League, former Ventura College standout Brent Cookson has had to wait just a 
bit longer to get a chance to really play. 
</P>
<P>
 Cookson, 24, was promoted to Phoenix on June 20 after finishing the first half 
of the season with double-A Shreveport, but the outfielder aggravated an injury 
to his right hand and was put on the disabled list Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 His first stint on the disabled list was July 2-14 after he injured his right 
hand while batting against Las Vegas on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have some ligament damage but it's nothing serious," he said. "It's just 
one of those things where all you can do for it is give it a little rest." 
</P>
<P>
 Cookson has played 14 games at Phoenix, batting .279 with one home run and six 
RBIs in 43 at-bats. He should be able to play again by early August. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm right where I want to be right now," he said. "I know I can do well up 
here. I'm anxious to show everybody what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In today, out tomorrow: Former USC catcher and Notre Dame High graduate Bobby 
Hughes was moved back to Class-A Stockton in the California League on July 20 
after getting called up to the Milwaukee Brewers' double-A affiliate at El Paso 
on July 6. Hughes was filling in for injured El Paso catcher Mike Stefanski. 
</P>
<P>
 When Stefanski returned to the lineup, Hughes was demoted. Hughes is batting 
.266 with 11 home runs and 52 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best of the minors: The most recent issue of Baseball America highlighted the 
best minor league prospects in every class and league according to skills (best 
batting prospect, best defensive first baseman, best breaking pitch, etc.) in a 
section called "Tools of the Trade." Nine area players were mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Triple-A: Chatsworth High graduate Rich Aude was named the American Assn.'s 
best defensive first baseman. But he's not too shabby offensively, batting .299 
with 14 home runs and 62 RBIs for the Pittsburgh Pirates' affiliate at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh traded first baseman Brian Hunter to the Cincinnati Reds on 
Wednesday, which might clear the way for Aude to make it to the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 In the International League, Tim Laker (Simi Valley, Oxnard College), was 
named best defensive catcher. In 79 games, he has batted .308 with six home 
runs and 41 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochester's Damon Buford (Birmingham) was selected the International League's 
best defensive outfielder. In 75 games, the former USC standout is batting .265 
with 12 home runs, 43 RBIs and 24 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
 The list must have merit. Jeff Cirillo and Andrew Lorraine are now in the big 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Cirillo (Providence), now playing for the Milwaukee Brewers, was selected best 
fielding third baseman in the American Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine (Hart) was best pitching prospect in the Pacific Coast League. He is 
now in the starting rotation for the Angels and was the losing pitcher Thursday 
when Kenny Rogers of Texas pitched a perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
 Double-A: Joe Rosselli (Alemany) was chosen the best pitching prospect in 
Texas League. At Shreveport, he was 7-2 with a 1.89 earned-run average in 14 
starts. In 90 2/3 innings, he gave up 67 hits and 17 walks while striking out 
60. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosselli since has been promoted to the San Francisco Giants' affiliate at 
Phoenix in the triple-A Pacific Coast League. In six starts, he is 1-3 with a 
4.26 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Loretta (St. Francis), who is playing for the El Paso Diablos, was chosen 
the Texas League's best defensive shortstop before he was promoted to triple-A 
New Orleans in the American Assn. on July 11. 
</P>
<P>
 With New Orleans, he is batting .213 with five RBIs in 13 games. At El Paso, 
he batted .315 with 38 RBIs in 77 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Class-A: Scott Richardson (Cal State Northridge) was named best baserunner in 
the California League. Richardson is batting .268 with 37 stolen bases in 95 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Ordonez, a Cuban defector who lives in Sylmar, was selected best defensive 
shortstop in the Florida State League while he was with the St. Lucie Ports.  
</P>
<P>
 Ordonez is now with double-A Binghamton in the Eastern League. At St. Lucie, 
he batted .309 with two home runs and 40 RBIs in 79 games. With Binghamton, he 
is batting .250 with eight RBIs in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Short hops: Garret Anderson (Kennedy) had two hits in his major league debut 
with the Angels on Wednesday after he was promoted from triple-A Vancouver. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Hernandez (Poly, Cal State Northridge), who underwent surgery June 6 
for a herniated disk in his neck, will not begin throwing again until next 
spring.  
</P>
<P>
 The Florida Marlins' reliever had a 2.70 ERA with nine saves while filling in 
for the injured Bryan Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez is wearing a neck brace and said his toughest task is trying to 
drive a car in reverse.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW: JIM GATTIS; HE TOOK INTENSITY TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL; 
BASEBALL: WITH FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE CAME A MELLOWING. NOW IT'S NOT QUITE LIFE 
OR DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The wheels of Jim Gattis have seen plenty of miles. Grab an atlas, pick a page 
and Gattis has been there as a ballplayer or coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever rubber meets the road, Gattis has been there: California, New York, 
Florida, Alaska, Canada. Lately, though, it's been one blowout after another. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the other day, Gattis bought two new tires for his Jeep, then blew a 
tire. He replaced it, then blew out the replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I ran over an elk horn or something this time," Gattis said.  
</P>
<P>
 That's entirely possible, because Gattis, 41, is the baseball coach at the 
University of Wyoming. He is no deer in the headlights, though, frozen in place 
and waiting for something to happen. As usual, Gattis is making something 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
 During his career as manager or head coach in the minor leagues and college, 
Gattis has won four pennants in three different leagues. Then again, a manager 
in the low minors could win every game and few would ever know. 
</P>
<P>
 Not with Gattis, though. Not since 1984, a year after noted baseball author 
Roger Kahn bought the Class A Utica Blue Sox of the New York-Penn League, the 
team Gattis managed. Kahn detailed the frenetic 1983 season in a bestseller 
called "Good Enough to Dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Colorful? Gattis was paisley. A graduate of North Hollywood High and a former 
first-round draft choice, Gattis hated the book for years. Made him look like a 
lunatic, he said. Kahn embellished too many facts and incidents, he told his 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Gattis called it a pile of you-know-what. 
</P>
<P>
 Years rolled by before Gattis again picked up the book. A lightning bolt 
called perspective struck him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I got a raw deal," he said. "But I read it again a couple of years 
ago. You know what? It's more accurate than I cared to admit at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Gattis has softened, to be sure. College players aren't paid professionals, 
after all. Many actually play for, ahem, fun. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "For some of these guys, baseball's not life or death," Gattis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now listen up, everybody," Gattis said.  
</P>
<P>
 He was a powerful 6-footer, 31 years old, with straw hair and a remarkably 
mobile face. He had firm, even features and a lantern jaw and sometimes under 
his straw-colored hair the manager, Jim Gattis, looked like a movie version of 
a grown-up Huckleberry Finn.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, when his blue eyes raged and his mouth set and his jaw jutted, Jim 
Gattis was a sadistic drill sergeant. He looked at his charges with equal 
measures of hatred and contempt.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball," he would say, "is not like life. It IS life. The games are a 
three-hour lesson in life every day.". . .  
</P>
<P>
 The young players were startled by Gattis' eruptions . . . certain players 
would wonder if Gattis' single-mindedness did not exceed the bounds of reason, 
and perhaps, sanity.  
</P>
<P>

</P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Gattis learned to battle, scratch and claw when he was young. His parents died 
before he turned 15. His brother, Rick, 10 years his senior, became his 
guardian while Gattis grew up in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents being deceased is probably why I really, really got into sports," 
Gattis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardship as a kid taught him to appreciate the value of a buck, too. After 
years of grinding out a living as a minor-league coach while trying to support 
a family, Gattis has spent the past three years building his own little 
business empire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm currently a rich bastard," he said. "I was once a highly debted bastard. 
That I'm still a bastard is the constant." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "One year I found out that Volvos weren't selling around Tucson, (where I 
lived)," Gattis said. "Not at all. But out here in Beverly Hills, the Volvo is 
a hot car for people who can't afford a Mercedes.  
</P>
<P>
 "So I borrowed some money from a friend and bought a Volvo in Tucson for 
$8,000. Then I drove it here and sold it for $11,000. I must have done that 
with six or seven cars."  
</P>
<P>
 -- R.K. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gattis' chain of espresso coffee shops in Orange County -- five of them, to be 
precise -- is so successful, he doesn't need to coach. At least, there's no 
financial need. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no desire to be a famous baseball coach," he said. "This is just about 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 When Gattis took over the Wyoming program in January 1993 -- just a few weeks 
before the season began -- it didn't much resemble a baseball team at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Gattis had never managed a team that finished lower than third in his eight 
years of pro ball. Though the Cowboys jumped to a surprisingly fast start, 
Gattis was acutely aware that reality would eventually set in. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyoming traveled to Cal State Northridge in the spring of '93, surrendered 44 
runs and was swept in a three-game series. Gattis' eldest son, Luke, watched 
from the stands and wasn't getting much positive feedback from Valley-area 
fans, some of whom remembered his dad. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, son approached father and issued a Luke-warm review. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad, there were some guys talking in the stands," said Luke, now 15. "They 
said, 'That Gattis guy used to be a good coach. I wonder what happened. I guess 
he's no good anymore.' " 
</P>
<P>
 While trying to keep a straight face, the coach said: "Geez, give your old man 
a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, Dad," Luke said. "I think they might be right." 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. The Cowboys finished 19-31 in Gattis' first year, but it didn't take 
long for him to work his mercurial magic. Last spring, Wyoming turned heads 
across the nation by giving heavily favored Brigham Young all it could handle 
in a battle for the Western Athletic Conference East Division title. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, had Wyoming swept a doubleheader from BYU on the final day of the '94 
season, the Cowboys would have won the division title. 
</P>
<P>
 Gattis didn't walk away empty-handed, though. He was named the division coach 
of the year for a team on which seven starters played out of position. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyoming improved to 32-23, which made Gattis a man of considerable stature in 
a state with 500,000 residents and one major university. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was infamous last year and famous this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a toss-up as to which he was in the minors -- probably a little of both. 
</P>
<P>
 Gattis couldn't turn off the emotional spigot. He took each game home, 
ruminated on the day's successes and failures, and let it eat away at him. He 
started as a minor league manager at age 28 in Victoria, Canada, soon after his 
minor-league playing career sputtered to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had pretty good instincts for the game," he said. "It was on-the-job 
training. I admit that I had a burning desire to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was reasonably well-prepared. Not necessarily emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He had the managerial tools. Good head for strategy. Strong instructional 
capabilities. English major with an ability to communicate. A steel-trap memory 
for the names and tendencies of the opposition. A cool head at all times. Well, 
maybe not the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a very poor loser," he said. "That can be helpful, that can be 
detrimental." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Sox coach, after a defeat, was sometimes blue in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tomorrow had a lot of yesterday in it," Gattis said. "Things would eat me up. 
Things would terrorize me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The year before (in 1982), Gattis had gone wild on at least two occasions when 
he felt the umpires were weighting their decisions against the Blue Sox. After 
a fiery protest got him nowhere one night, he uprooted second base, walked out 
to right field and scaled the bag over the wall.  
</P>
<P>
 On another protest, he walked to second base, took off his spikes and 
pretended they were hand grenades. Biting off an imaginary firing pin, he 
hurled the spikes in the general direction of the umpires. . . . The fierce 
Utica grenade thrower was given a week of enforced rest.  
</P>
<P>
 -- R.K. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Gattis' playing career affected his temperament. He once had the 
professional game in the palm of his hand, but it slipped away. 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior at North Hollywood High in 1970, Gattis was a standout quarterback 
and third baseman. He was cut from the football team as a freshman at Nevada 
Las Vegas, however, and came home to play baseball in the spring of '72 at 
Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, scouts remembered the name. In fact, he was atop the talent list. 
The Atlanta Braves selected Gattis in the first round of the June amateur draft 
in '72. The Braves dangled dollars in his face. He said no thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have some regrets," Gattis said. "Since both of my brothers had gone to 
college, they wanted me to go to college too. I could have taken the money. 
Then, who knows what happens?" 
</P>
<P>
 What did happen, in fact, was horrific. While playing for UC Santa Barbara in 
the spring of 1973, Gattis was beaned in the cheek, near the eye socket. 
</P>
<P>
 A surgeon painstakingly pieced his cheekbone together, with the help of some 
wires and hardware. Teammates called him Plate Head for years, though Hard Head 
also would have applied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not a pretty picture at the time," said Gattis, who was sidelined for 
six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Black and blue became his least-favorite colors. His senior year was marked by 
a series of nagging injuries. By the time June rolled around again, scouts 
decided that he hadn't improved much since his days at Valley. Gattis, who 
graduated with an English degree, was not drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 Gattis signed with an independent team with no big-league affiliation, not 
unlike the club he would later manage at Utica. The fiery third baseman played 
well -- he was named the most valuable player of the Northwest League in 1978 
-- but not well enough to catch on with a big-league organization. He retired 
in 1979 and was offered the managerial position with Victoria a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real easy to say yes," Gattis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gattis' first three minor league teams finished second in their respective 
leagues. Gattis insists his teams had the talent to finish first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had 'em wrapped too tight," he said. "They were too intense. I was too 
intense." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One still, hot August afternoon, I heard my name called with great urgency. It 
was Gattis, who said he was worried because the team was unresponsive to his 
latest assortment of fight speeches.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm gonna do something now that will set fire to this team's butt," Gattis 
said. "I'm gonna activate myself as a player. I may not run well anymore, but I 
still know how to hit."  
</P>
<P>
 "With intensity," I said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not kidding. I want to get in this pennant race with my bat," Gattis 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the season ended, Gattis inserted himself into the lineup five times. 
He did not hit safely once. I remember thinking that intensity alone was not 
enough.  
</P>
<P>
 Then I resolved to give the word "intensity" a good long rest over the winter.

 Gattis was demonstrative, Gattis was demanding, Gattis was occasionally 
demented. Of course, Gattis also won. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, while managing the North Pole Nicks, a team composed of college 
hotshots in the Alaska Summer League, Gattis decided he didn't like the overall 
effort during a loss to the Fairbanks Goldpanners. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Cline, now the baseball coach at Camarillo High, batted cleanup for the 
Nicks, a team that included Eric Karros of the Dodgers and Luis Gonzalez of the 
Houston Astros. At the time, Karros and Cline were teammates at UCLA, playing 
under mild-mannered Coach Gary Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 When Karros and Cline learned they would be playing in the summer for Gattis, 
they spent an evening vigorously leafing through Kahn's book, reading passages 
aloud and wondering what they'd gotten themselves into. 
</P>
<P>
 There, in vivid detail, was the story of Roger Kahn and his coach, Genghis 
Khan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd heard a lot of stories," Cline said, laughing. "Gary is more low-key. It 
was like going from night to day." 
</P>
<P>
 After the loss to Fairbanks, it was midnight when the bus arrived at North 
Pole and players were anxious to catch some shut-eye. Not so fast, said Gattis, 
who called a practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The burg of North Pole is located near the Arctic Circle, land of the midnight 
sun. Bad news for the players: Gattis' practice didn't end until 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we spent most of the four hours running around the bases," Cline 
said. "He was demanding, a perfectionist, but his way worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned more about baseball than I had in a long time. We learned about 
growing up, too." 
</P>
<P>
 So did the coach, eventually. After coaching at Miami of the Florida State 
League, Gattis served as an assistant at Pepperdine from 1985 to 1988. A wife 
and three kids kept his feet better planted on terra firma, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Taylor has run across Gattis at three different stages of the coach's 
career. Taylor, a 1982 graduate of Rio Mesa High, played for Gattis at Salt 
Lake City in 1986, then served as an assistant under Gattis in Miami three 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, a former head coach at Oxnard College, is now an assistant at Wyoming 
and can testify that change has indeed been effected. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has definitely mellowed," said Taylor, 30. "I think he communicates better 
with players now. At a lower volume. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still a little Bobby Knight in him, though." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like a souped-up engine with plenty of miles on it, Gattis maintains that his 
high-compression days are over. Evidence supports the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a different team directed by Gattis was roughed up this week and the 
coach didn't utter a word. It was the season finale and Gattis' crew finished 
eighth in a 12-team league. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one won't go on my resume," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the game ended, Gattis didn't rant or rave. Heck, he took the team out 
for ice cream, whereupon his small army of Little Leaguers aged 7-9 mobbed him 
like he was Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
 Believe it. Gattis was hitting fungoes to the very same pee-wees a few weeks 
back when he noticed something curious. The ball went one way, the players 
another. Gattis spoke to his youngsters, carefully choosing his words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, you know, you can't catch a ball if you keep running in the other 
direction," Gattis said, making a point to be upbeat and constructive. 
</P>
<P>
 Blank stares all around. Finally, from under the bill of an oversized ball 
cap, a kid piped up: "Yeah, but if I wait until it stops rolling, it can't hurt 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Gung-ho Gattis was speechless, believed to be a career first. What the heck 
could he say? After all, it was only baseball, not an all-or-nothing 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Message received. 
</P>
<P>
 "I accepted it as being absolutely right," Gattis said with a laugh, "and we 
moved on from there." The Jim Gattis File

IRVIN WAS UNAWARE OF EARLIER SCHEDULED COURT DATE; JURISPRUDENCE: ATTORNEY SAYS 
FORMER RAM DEFENSIVE BACK MISSED APPEARANCE BECAUSE OF MISCOMMUNICATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A breakdown in communication between LeRoy Irvin and his former attorney led 
to the arrest of the former professional football player July 21 on suspicion 
of spousal abuse, his new attorney said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Milton Grimes said Irvin, a Cal State Northridge assistant coach last 
fall and former All-Pro defensive back for the Rams, was arrested because he 
failed to appear in court earlier this month for a preliminary hearing on the 
same charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said Irvin was in custody for six days in Los Angeles County Jail until 
he was freed after posting $10,000 bail Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvin then returned to an unspecified drug-and-alcohol rehabilitation center 
to complete treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvin is scheduled to appear at a preliminary hearing Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said he didn't know if Irvin planned to continue coaching at Northridge 
and Matador Coach Bob Burt said he hadn't talked to Irvin for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to comment on that without knowing all the facts," Burt said. 
"He wasn't with us for spring practice. He said he would be back in the fall, 
but I haven't talked to him since June." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvin was first arrested on suspicion of spousal abuse after an argument with 
his estranged wife in February. Grimes said Irvin was unaware he missed the 
July 7 court date until last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went to court and posted a $5,500 bail (in June)," Grimes said. "He then 
went into rehab on (June 29) and called his (former) attorney to tell him but 
couldn't reach him, so he left a message. He didn't know then that he had a 
court date on July 7." 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said Irvin later learned through the friend who posted his original 
bail that he missed the court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gets to court on (July 21), walks in on his own, and they arrest him and 
lock him up with a $10,000 bail," Grimes said. "He wasn't trying to flee or 
anything. He just didn't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes, who said that Irvin's estranged wife wants to drop the charges, found 
the $10,000 bail exorbitant. 
</P>
<P>
 He attempted to have the amount reduced but failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the prosecution or the judge would have been as adamant about 
the (amount of the) bail if it wasn't because of the (O.J.) Simpson case," 
Grimes said. "Especially in light of the fact that the wife didn't want to 
pursue it."

OLLIE SLAM-DUNKED BY SAT MINIMUM; BASKETBALL: FORMER NORTH HOLLYWOOD STAR TAKES 
DIVISION I SKILLS TO SANTA MONICA COLLEGE AFTER FAILING TO SCORE 700. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It was not supposed to end up this way for Damon Ollie. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood High's best player the past three seasons, the 6-foot-5 post 
player seemed headed to a Division I college basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
 George Washington wanted him, but instead of the nation's capital, Ollie will 
be headed to Santa Monica College this fall. In four attempts, he failed to 
score 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, the NCAA-required minimum to qualify 
for an athletic scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very disappointed," Ollie said. "But going to a (junior college) for 
two years and after that, you know, who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 Before he starts his college career, Ollie will compete with some of Southern 
California's top college freshmen-to-be when he plays in the Southern 
California Summer Showcase, an all-star exhibition at UC Irvine's Bren Center 
today at 5:15 p.m. The game will precede an NBA rookies Summer Pro League 
all-star game scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school game features 28 players from Southern California, including 
Jason Hartman of Thousand Oaks and Alex Lopez of Campbell Hall. Both are bound 
for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Ollie might not be headed to a four-year school but he belongs in the all-star 
game, according to North Hollywood Coach Steve Miller. Ollie, a Times 
All-Valley selection, averaged 20.1 points, 18 rebounds and 4.5 blocked shots 
last season. The Huskies were 68-10 in Ollie's three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was our captain, he was the glue that kept our team together, mentally and 
physically," Miller said. "He was a very hard worker, never missed a practice 
and never missed a game." 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter how many preparatory courses Ollie took, the SAT was one 
opponent he could not conquer. His highest score was 670. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every player that comes into my program sets goals in terms of education and 
college," Miller said. "Damon worked hard in the classroom . . . but for 
whatever reason, it was just hard for him to pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Ollie at first rejected the idea of attending a junior college but Miller 
coaxed him into realizing it was his only option. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about pros like Larry Johnson, guys who have gone to a JC and 
developed into good pros," Miller said. "There is life after junior college. If 
he gets his two years of regular college classes out of the way, maybe he will 
be more sought after than he is now." 
</P>
<P>
 Ollie has worked out with some of his Santa Monica teammates and seems to have 
accepted the challenge that awaits him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get along with all the players, I like the campus," Ollie said. "Everything 
is cool and I'm just ready to go."

GARRISON JACKSON LOOKING BEYOND MATCH POINT; TENNIS: ASIDE FROM HELPING HER 
FOUNDATION TEACH INNER-CITY CHILDREN THE SPORT, SHE'D LIKE TO HAVE CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Zina Garrison Jackson is 30 now. She has won more than $4 million in her 
tennis career. But she still plays every shot as if a Grand Slam singles title, 
which has eluded her, is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 She has the same driving spirit and enthusiasm for the game she did more than 
a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But she has been on the pro tour for 12 years, and is starting to think 
seriously about the day all this ends: the glamour, the attention, the big 
victories and, yes, the unrelenting travel, the constant practice and the 
emotion-draining pressure that have been so much a part of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Her determination has not waned. But her priorities are beginning to shift. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really want to have kids of my own," said Garrison Jackson, the youngest of 
seven children. She has been married since 1989 to Willard Jackson, who founded 
a hazardous-waste disposal company in Houston, and she says they are ready for 
their own family. 
</P>
<P>
 "In September, I have to make out a new schedule for next year, and I'm going 
to probably put down the minimum amount of tournaments," she said. Garrison 
Jackson said she might retire by the end of the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to having her own children, she also wants to be more active in 
the group she founded in Houston that provides funds for the homeless, youth 
organizations and anti-drug groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the foundation's work is to provide tennis programs in the inner-city 
areas where she grew up. She started playing when she was 10 in a similar 
public-parks program conducted by her longtime coach and friend, John 
Wilkerson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a year-round program at two parks in Houston, and the mayor and the city 
council have really gotten behind it now," she said. "Some of the kids who have 
been in the program for a while have improved so much it's amazing. Another 
thing I really want to do is have my own homeless shelter in Houston for 
families, too. I have a real love for kids, and there are a lot of them who are 
homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Garrison Jackson is committed to giving tennis her best 
effort. "I want to give it all I've got until I finally decide I'm not ready to 
play anymore," she said. "The worst thing for me would be to feel I'm not able 
to give it my best. I feel I give it 100% every time I go out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I want to enjoy it and have fun, more than anything else right now. I'll 
try to continue to improve my game. But I don't think it helps that much at 
this stage to have big goals. If you just work on your game, the rest will 
come." 
</P>
<P>
 She says one of her concerns is staying healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison Jackson, who is playing World TeamTennis for the Dukes and will play 
in the Virgina Slims tournament at Manhattan Beach in early August, suffered 
from shoulder problems earlier in the Dukes' season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little tired after Wimbledon," she said. "I had played so much before 
Wimbledon to get ready. I had the shoulder trouble after that, then I went over 
on my ankle. Fortunately, it was only a mild sprain. Through the years, though, 
I've been blessed that I haven't had any major injuries. " 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison Jackson lost in the Wimbledon quarterfinals to Gigi Fernandez after 
beating Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in three sets in the round of 16. "I still felt 
I had a good tournament, though," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison Jackson says she is enjoying playing in Billie Jean King's team 
tennis league this month. "I really like it, although I don't like the 
traveling, being in a city for only one night and then out again," she said. "I 
played it for 10 days last year, and saw the difference it made in my game. I 
had a pretty good year, and wanted to see what would happen if I played it a 
full year." 
</P>
<P>
 The playing format, which has no-ad scoring, puts a heavier emphasis on each 
point, and the match winner is determined by total games won in men's and 
women's doubles, men's and women's singles and mixed doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for me because it gets me out of the same routine," she said. "When 
you get older you need to have different things to motivate you. In this 
format, you can't have any mental lapses, the kind we all have sometimes, when 
you can't seem to hit a ball on the court for a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison Jackson wishes some of the TeamTennis emphasis on cheering and lively 
crowd involvement could somehow be part of the regular tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to have a rush, the way fans feel after they've come out of a good 
basketball game," she said. "Especially the younger people need something to 
capture their attention. I looked up into the crowd the other night, and some 
of the younger kids were doing the wave and some stuff like that. You have to 
find ways for them to get into it, to keep their attention, instead of when 
they go to a match everyone saying, 'Shhhh, be quiet. And don't stand up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison Jackson believes tennis' stodgy image is one of its biggest problems. 
But she also sees others. She thinks the new high-performance rackets have 
turned men's tennis into such a power game that it has lost some of its luster. 
She feels average players are having more trouble identifying with it. 
</P>
<P>
 She thinks the new rackets actually have been more beneficial to the women's 
game, where the added power has made points far more lively than the days when 
Chris Evert and her opponents of that era constantly were hitting "moon balls" 
from the base line. "The women are putting the power and touch together well 
now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Evert has been in retirement for almost five years now, Martina 
Navratilova will be on the sidelines soon, and Garrison Jackson might not be 
far behind. Where will the game find new life?  
</P>
<P>
 "There are other personalities out there who are able to give the women's game 
a lift," Garrison Jackson said. "Mary Pierce has had a lot of people noticing 
tennis lately, and Arantxa is good at that, too. Gabby (Gabriela Sabatini) 
always has been a good draw." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison Jackson hopes some young newcomers to the tour will learn some things 
from the older players that she did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned a lot from Chris and Martina about the off-court things," she said. 
"When I first came on the tour everyone thought I was shy, but I was quiet 
because I was observing everything. It was more a matter of me watching Chris 
and Martina than anything they actually said to me. I'd watch them go into a 
room full of people and make sure they talked to everyone, and they always 
seemed to want to help the game move forward. It opened my eyes. It's not just 
about being good on the tennis court. It's doing good things off the field, as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now everything is about what your management group thinks you should do, and 
how you should act like this or like that. And when you call somebody, you've 
got to call five different people before you're able to reach them. I mean, 
like pleeeeease . One time I tried to talk to a player, and I had to go through 
10 different people and never did get in touch with her. And she wasn't even in 
the Top 10 at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison Jackson thinks an athlete being someone for kids to look up to is 
fine, as long as the athletes don't portray themselves as someone they're not. 
"I feel I'm the same person on and off the court," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 King said Garrison Jackson has been a "perfect role model." 
</P>
<P>
 "I did a clinic with her in Houston, and that's where she's great . . . 
working with the kids," said King. "She's passing down her legacy to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zina is one of those players who gives something back to the game, and I 
really like that. Other players put their names on things, but they don't put 
the effort into it the way she does. She's just been great." 
</P>
<P>
 Larisa Neiland, who has played doubles with Garrison Jackson this season in 
TeamTennis, says she has been impressed with her as a person as much as she has 
as a player. 
</P>
<P>
 "She tries to help everybody and to be nice to everyone . . . starting with 
kids as well as regular people," Neiland said. "You can see it's inside her, 
not something she feels she has to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of what happens in her career in the future, Garrison Jackson said 
she will be pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 She has won more than 500 matches on the pro tour, becoming only the 12th 
woman ever to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, she defeated Monica Seles and Steffi Graf in dramatic back-to-back 
three-set matches to reach the Wimbledon final, losingto Navratilova at a time 
when Navratilova was virtually unbeatable in big matches. Garrison Jackson 
became the first black woman to reach the singles championship match in a Grand 
Slam event since Althea Gibson won Wimbledon in 1957 and 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, Garrison Jackson won the bronze 
medal in singles, and the gold medal in doubles with Pam Shriver as her 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have a tendency to say, 'Well, you never won a Grand Slam,' and 
it's like your career is nothing if you haven't won a Grand Slam," she said. 
"But I feel I've been fortunate. I've been around a nice group of people who 
have accomplished a lot. I've had a good career, and I'm still playing, and 
anything can still happen."

BROTHERS IN ARMS; EX-SAN DIEGO SOCKERS GIVE THE SPLASH A CHAMPIONSHIP ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raffaele Ruotolo was a skinny 18-year old when he joined the San Diego Sockers 
in 1984. George Fernandez was among 100 participants in an open tryout in 1987. 
Ralph Black was a free agent from Portland who was coveted by the Sockers' 
coach in 1988. Rod Castro was a star in a rival league, where he played 
alongside his brother until 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 All share common threads. 
</P>
<P>
 All played in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectively, they own 10 championship rings from their days with the Sockers, 
a team that has won 10 of the last 12 indoor titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll never see that kind of domination again," Black said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the Splash is banking on -- it hopes to unlock the Sockers' grasp 
on indoor titles, and will take a major step toward that end tonight at The 
Pond of Anaheim when the top two teams in the Continental Indoor Soccer 
League's Western Division meet for the second of their three regular-season 
games. The Sockers won last week, 9-6, in the burgeoning rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash (11-5) plays in San Diego (11-5) on Aug. 13, too, in the middle of 
a seven-game trip -- which puts additional importance on tonight's game and 
Monday's against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to come down to us and San Diego in our division," said Castro, 
who spends his off hours earning a law degree. "If they beat us (today), 
they'll be ahead of us psychologically, which is especially important in the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro, Black, Ruotolo and Fernandez know any championship hopes go through 
San Diego, because they once were part of the Socker Dynasty. Because of that 
dominance, few CISL players have won titles, and the Splash's ex-Sockers have a 
special bond. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like some sort of mental telepathy -- you've been there, they've been 
there," Fernandez said. "It's some kind of synergy. You know what it takes, 
they know what it takes . . . and you pretty much want to drag everyone with 
you because you know what that (championship) feeling is like." 
</P>
<P>
 The contributions of Dale Ervine, Denis Hamlett and Doug Neely aside, the 
Splash wouldn't be knocking on the Sockers' door without the contribution of 
its collection of ex-Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro is among the league's top goal-scorers. Ruotolo is among the top 
point-scorers. Black, a defender, is the team captain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys are pulling their weight and more," said Tim Orchard, Splash 
co-governor/director of player personnel. "I've got to tip my hat to (Socker 
Coach) Ron Newman. I really respect him and it says a lot to have a player that 
formerly played for the Sockers -- you feel better about that player because 
you know that player has been exposed to methods that have obviously proved to 
be successful, and they know what it takes to win. Knowing how to win is very 
important." THE STORIES 
</P>
<P>
 * George Fernandez roomed with Orchard at Cal State Hayward and was the easy 
choice to coach the Splash. Fernandez played last year with Sacramento in the 
CISL and with Cleveland in the National Professional Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
 With Cleveland, Fernandez won a fourth indoor championship -- his first three 
came in San Diego, where he caught the fancy of Newman because of his hustle 
and work ethic during an open tryout. By midseason, he was playing, became a 
crowd favorite and was named the Unsung Hero of the 1988 championship series 
against Cleveland. He began a consecutive game streak that set the team 
standard, 132 games, until he left as a free agent in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez is Newman's favorite because of the way he made the team: "American 
players, the first time they have trouble, want to become doctors or lawyers. 
George wouldn't quit. I didn't really need him, but I was going to give him a 
shot and it was the best bloody move I made in years." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, 32, practices with the Splash during drills. 
</P>
<P>
 Said midfielder Mike LaPosha: "George may be the coach, but he's also the best 
player on this team." 
</P>
<P>
 * Rod Castro, captain of then-NCAA power Indiana University, was drafted by 
the Sockers but instead played alongside his brother, Diego, in Memphis of the 
American Indoor Soccer Assn. Nicknamed "The Rocket" for his powerful leg, 
Castro scored 68 goals in 62 games before joining the Sockers in 1989 and 
played alongside Black and Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 A complement to star Branko Segota, he made one of the greatest goals in 
Socker history in Game 3 of the 1991 finals in Cleveland. Castro scored twice 
in the final two minutes of the third quarter to tie the game -- the latter 
came when he curved a free kick from the top of the penalty arc around a 
three-man wall and into the upper right corner in the quarter's final seconds. 
San Diego scored once in the fourth quarter, won the game, 6-5, took a 2-1 
series lead and eventually won. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning two titles in two years, Castro left for Baltimore, where he was 
an all-star for the first time. He joined the Los Angeles United midway through 
the 1993 season and led the team with 34 points in 17 games, and was the first 
player signed by the Splash when the franchise moved to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ralph Black has played 15 indoor seasons though he's only 30 years old. 
Newman loved Black, a three-time all-star in Tacoma (Wash.), and signed the 
free agent the first chance he got. 
</P>
<P>
 Black was in San Diego for two years, won two championships, and then returned 
to Tacoma because the real-estate dollar stretched a lot further in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 * Raffaele Ruotolo never cracked the starting lineup in San Diego. He was 
there four years, a 145-pound teen-ager when he made the team, and won three 
titles, but never got the chance he thought he deserved. A dwindling salary cap 
didn't make it prudent for the Sockers to develop him any more. 
</P>
<P>
 He disappeared after the 1988 season, ran youth soccer camps, coached a high 
school girls' team and played in amateur leagues until United Coach Gus Mokalis 
called him last year. He led the United with 24 goals. Ruotolo has added 30 
pounds and has become a heavyweight talent, with 21 goals and 24 assists in 15 
games; in his previous five seasons, he had only 46 goals and 25 assists. THE 
STAKES 
</P>
<P>
 Castro and Ruotolo had a personal sense of rivalry with San Diego last year, 
but the United (6-22) was so bad, there was little at stake. It didn't prevent 
Castro from getting into a fight and taking a red card, though. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Splash is a far cry from the United. Different ownership, different 
coach, different players, different agenda. The Splash has the talent to 
actually displace San Diego as the top team in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty nervous about them coming down (last week); I thought it was the 
game of the year for us and now (tonight's) game is the game of the year," 
Newman said. "Obviously, they're the best team in our division." 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash won a preseason tournament game that featured a bench-clearing 
brawl.  
</P>
<P>
 Also at stake is the home-field advantage in a three-game playoff series 
should both reach their expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams have created a revolving I-5 Cup to go to the winner of the season 
series. But clearly, there is more at stake than just the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Las Vegas, it was a pretty heated exhibition," Orchard said. "A rivalry is 
borne out of the history with our players more than anything. We could be from 
Kalamazoo, but the fact remains our coach is an ex-Socker, Castro's an 
ex-Socker, Black's an ex-Socker, Ruotolo's an ex-Socker. Those are key cogs in 
our team and that's what contributes to a rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our young players don't know the San Diego Socker mystique, but they 
can look in the eyes of George and Rod and Ralph and Raffe and see that this 
game means a little more. The rivalry is borne out of those four key 
individuals and the rest of us are coming along for the ride."

 For the corporate executive who is overwhelmed and stressed out -- and can 
afford to pay $175 an hour for help -- two New York psychologists offer therapy 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought up the idea of coming to the client and using every moment of time 
while in transit," said psychologist Ursula Strauss.She started Mobile 
Psychological Services in April with partner Shelley Lennox. 
</P>
<P>
 Before, an executive might stop for a martini after work. "Now it's life on 
the move," Strauss said. "Instead of the martini, they're getting intense 
therapy." 
</P>
<P>
 A fully equipped but unmarked van comes to the executive's office. Many execs 
receive treatment on the way to a business meeting or to the airport or 
commuting home.  
</P>
<P>
 "We tell the driver to keep at a slow pace, stay in the right-hand lane, avoid 
rapid turns," Strauss said.

JAWS DROP ALONG WITH GAVEL AS FCC'S PAGER AUCTION ENDS; COMMUNICATIONS: THE 
$617 MILLION BID FOR LICENSES IS BEYOND ALL PREDICTIONS. INTERACTIVE VIDEO 
DRAWS ANOTHER $196 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A gangbusters auction by the Federal Communications Commission for 10 
nationwide paging licenses defied all predictions by the time the gavel dropped 
Friday afternoon, collecting $617 million from major investors that will go to 
the U.S. Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the pager licenses, the FCC auctioned 518 licenses for 
interactive video and data services that raised $196 million as of late Friday 
afternoon, as bidding came to a close. The two auctions raised a total of more 
than $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The auctions, the first in a series of landmark sales of the radio spectrum, 
began Monday and lasted several days longer than originally planned, as major 
corporations dug in their heels and kept upping the stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday, bidders joked that the affair had become a "hostage crisis," and 
one wag hung a sign over a coffee pot, advising, "If you go over $1 billion, 
the refills are free." 
</P>
<P>
 The whopping bids for the pager licenses reflect the fact that major 
corporations see a significantly higher value in the developing industry than 
anybody had expected. Winners exuded confidence Friday that they had not laid 
down a single penny too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bullishness in the auction has to be a harbinger of the bullishness in 
the business community for personal communications services," said FCC Chairman 
Reed Hundt, who noted that it was not "lawyers and lobbyists" setting up 
back-room deals for licenses but "businessmen bringing cash into an auction 
room." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 licenses all went to major corporations, whose winning bids ranged from 
$38 million for a one-way license -- permitting communications in only one 
direction -- to $80 million for each of four two-way licenses that allow 
back-and-forth communication. The large allocation of new spectrum will permit 
innovative new two-way paging systems that will usher in a variety of new 
communications services. 
</P>
<P>
 Paging Network of Virginia, the nation's largest provider of paging services, 
won the maximum allowable three paging licenses. Meanwhile, Pagemart II Inc. 
put down the smallest bid, at $38 million, for its license for one-way paging.  
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the auction, the communications industry had estimated that the 
winning bids would range from $5 million to $40 million, less than half what 
was ultimately put on the table. At least some of the bidders were clearly 
surprised by the high-stakes action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every company would get on the phone at night to their headquarters and say, 
'We need more money, we need more money,' " said Kathleen Q. Abernathy, vice 
president for federal regulatory matters for AirTouch Paging. "Back at 
headquarters, people were crunching the numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the extra money that AirTouch, a unit of AirTouch Communications of 
San Francisco, put down for its license, Abernathy said the company achieved 
its goal of getting a license that will expand its market coverage and increase 
the numbers of subscribers. AirTouch, a spinoff of Pacific Telesis, won the 
cheapest two-way license, at $47 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith St. Ledger-Roty, outside counsel to Paging Network, a Plano, Tex.-based 
firm, said many of the low expectations about the auction came from people who 
had no clue how the industry would ultimately value the licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were operating in a vacuum, but there was nothing we could do about that 
without compromising our competitive strategy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paging Network plans to use its three licenses to develop a new system that 
will allow users to receive voice messages through small pagers at 
substantially lower cost than current cellular telephones, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, KDM Messaging Co., a unit of Seattle-based McCaw Cellular 
Communications, won two licenses; Nationwide Wireless Network Corp., a unit of 
Mobile Telecommunications Technologies of Jackson, Miss., won two, and 
BellSouth Wireless, a unit of BellSouth Corp. of Atlanta, won one. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's auction covered licenses for nationwide services, but the FCC has 
another 3,534 licenses to auction later this year for regional paging systems. 
Hundt and industry officials said it is impossible to know how much money those 
will yield. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC also has 1,371 broad-band licenses for two-way wireless telephone 
services that will be auctioned later this year, an auction event that the 
Office of Management and Budget has estimated might raise $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 An FCC spokeswoman said both the interactive video and the pager auctions cost 
$2 million to conduct, which she characterized as "a real bargain." 
</P>
<P>
 Although none of the 10 pager licenses went to small or minority businesses, 
32% of the interactive video licenses went to minority-owned businesses, Hundt 
said, thereby increasing the ranks of minority broadcasters by 50%. Wireless

AN 'INGENIUS' IDEA WAITING TO BE DISCOVERED; CABLE: A FREE ON-LINE NEWS SERVICE 
HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE 1986, BUT FEW PEOPLE USE IT. THE ANTELOPE VALLEY CAN 
COUNT NINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Antelope Valley residents received a flyer in the mail recently for a 
national service that sends up-to-the-minute news, financial and sports data 
direct to their home or office computers via cable TV lines, two conclusions 
would have been natural. 
</P>
<P>
 First, that the service, known as Ingenius, must be the latest breakthrough on 
the information superhighway, as the cable industry tries to move beyond 
carrying just pictures. And second, that it is probably costly to use, like 
some other on-line computer information providers. 
</P>
<P>
 But they'd have been wrong on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingenius is not new. It has been carried nationally since 1986 and locally on 
Jones Intercable systems in the Antelope Valley and Oxnard-Port Hueneme areas 
since 1989, although it remains virtually unknown and unused by consumers. As 
for cost, the service is actually free on most cable systems that carry it, 
including Jones, after subscribers pay a $150 one-time equipment fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an incredibly rich thing. I use it every day and have for almost 10 
years," said analyst Larry Gerbrandt of the media research firm Paul Kagan 
Associates Inc. in Carmel. "As far as I'm concerned, it's probably the biggest 
bargain in the on-line business." 
</P>
<P>
 Ingenius, which functions as a personalized news service, offers general news, 
stock quotes, sports, entertainment and even state-by-state weather reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Gerbrandt is the exception. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Antelope Valley, only nine people out of 63,000 cable households 
subscribe to Ingenius. The number is similarly small in Oxnard and Port 
Hueneme. Nationally, the service -- founded by Tele-Communications Inc., the 
nation's largest cable operator -- has fewer than 100,000 adult users, despite 
being available to nearly 30 million households. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary use at home is by news junkies. God, they love us. But there 
aren't enough of those guys," said Jerry Bennington, chief executive of the 
Denver-based service.  
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Gerbrandt said Ingenius' tiny customer base is a testament to the 
cable industry's failure so far to effectively promote non-video services or to 
appeal to small, specialized audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 However, company officials and others in the cable industry say Ingenius has 
suffered in part because it arrived in the mid-1980s, before the explosive 
growth in the home computer market, and because of marketing kinks and consumer 
unfamiliarity with the cable-computer combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly known as X-Press Information Services Ltd., the company was founded 
in 1985 by a partnership of TCI, McGraw-Hill Inc. and a third firm. At first, 
it relied on TCI systems as its clients. Ingenius' current owner is Liberty 
Media Corp., a TCI offshoot based in nearby Englewood, Colo., that TCI has 
proposed to reacquire. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty Media, a publicly held cable systems concern, does not report separate 
results for Ingenius. But after long losing money, the information service 
today is self-supporting, Bennington said, without offering details.  
</P>
<P>
 For the $150 start-up price, users buy from the company a small converter box, 
computer software and connectors. The data feed arrives over the same cable 
lines that carry television signals. It goes through the converter box and a 
serial cable into PC-compatible or Macintosh computers. 
</P>
<P>
 There, only the categories of information selected by the user (down to levels 
such as Washington news and college football) appear on the computer, where 
they are available for viewing and printing. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are disadvantages that Bennington and others say have contributed to 
Ingenius' relative obscurity. Although the information feed is continuous, 
consumers can capture it only when their computers are left on, which some 
people are reluctant to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the service is not interactive, meaning users can tap into and save the 
data that arrives but cannot ask the system to provide specific information. 
And unlike the on-line services such as Prodigy and America Online, Ingenius 
has no electronic mail or discussion group capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Marketing has also been a problem. Bennington said cable systems have not 
pitched the service to their customers. Because it is often included in the 
basic cable package, companies get no extra revenue from it. Cable operators, 
on the other hand, say Ingenius has done little to help them market it. 
</P>
<P>
 While Ingenius says it has fewer than 100,000 non-school users, one industry 
estimate put the number at 60,000. The two biggest dial-up services, CompuServe 
and Prodigy, have about 2 million and 1.3 million subscribers, respectively, 
according to Information & Interactive Services Report.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: Q & A; DERIVATIVES AND MONEY FUNDS: WHAT 
DO THEY MEAN TO YOU? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the past few months, institutions and mutual fund managers have made one 
troubling announcement after another about losses on complicated financial 
products, generically known as derivatives. PaineWebber, BankAmerica and other 
fund managers have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to defray losses in 
pooled investments, including many that were considered low- or no-risk, such 
as money market mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the cash infusions, investors in publicly traded money funds have 
not lost principal. But that may change. Officials at the Investment Company 
Institute, a mutual fund trade group, revealed last week that at least one 
troubled money fund is searching for a buyer, presumably to cover 
derivative-related losses in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you at risk? Here's the rundown on derivatives and how you can assess the 
likelihood of losses in your money fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are derivatives? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Derivative is a generic term for a wide array of complicated financial 
instruments that are derived from combining -- or slicing apart -- better-known 
products. Collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMOs, for example, are a 
derivative of mortgage-backed securities. To make CMOs, investment bankers 
slice up mortgage securities, giving one group of investors the 
interest-bearing portion and other investors the principal repayment portion. 
</P>
<P>
 Other derivatives combine products, such as interest-bearing securities and 
futures contracts, or futures contracts tied to varying market indexes. "Range 
notes" pay interest only when rates are within a certain range. Other common 
derivatives are "inverse floaters" and "capped floaters." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why were they created? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Derivatives allow investors or institutions to limit or take a specific 
kind of risk. Traditional versions have allowed companies to nail down future 
costs, selling to others some of the risks of changes in the marketplace. Some 
have been around for decades, such as Treasury "strips," which split bonds into 
interest and principal portions.  
</P>
<P>
 Others hedge or allow bets on oil prices or currency changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The ones that are currently causing problems were spurred by falling interest 
rates on bonds, certificates of deposit and Treasury bills. That caused 
suffering for individuals who live on the income and money managers who collect 
fees for managing assets and were nervous about losing investors. 
</P>
<P>
 A few savvy investment bankers created derivatives that theoretically would 
pay income regardless of declining market rates. Indeed, some of their new 
products would pay more income when interest rates fell -- inverse floaters, 
for example.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why are they wreaking such havoc now? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Interest rates turned around, and many people who invested in these 
derivatives didn't fully understand the risks. Yields on some of these products 
plunged far more steeply than anticipated as demand for them shrank.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why would money funds invest in derivatives? I thought they were supposed 
to be invested only in short-term, risk-free government securities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Money funds do primarily invest in short-term Treasury bills and bank 
deposits. But the money fund business is competitive. And if a fund manager 
took just a small portion of the fund's assets -- maybe 5% -- and popped it 
into derivatives, the fund might be able to boast returns fractionally higher 
than the competition during the days of declining rates.  
</P>
<P>
 Yield-hungry investors would then flock to the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do I know if my money fund invested in derivatives and is likely to 
take a hit? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: You have two options: Call and ask, or make assumptions based on funds 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
 If your fund was topping the performance charts while market rates were 
dropping -- and if its prospectus says managers can invest in derivatives or 
"yield enhancing" securities -- you have reason to worry.  
</P>
<P>
 If, on the other hand, the prospectus says all assets will be invested in cash 
or cash equivalents and your money fund returns are always run-of-the-mill, 
your risk is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, your risk is probably greater if you have invested with a small fund 
company rather than a large one, says Teresa Redinger, editor of IBC/Donoghue's 
Money Fund Report, an Ashland, Mass.-based newsletter. That's simply because 
small funds are rarely rich enough to pump cash into their funds to prevent 
investor losses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why have investment advisers been reimbursing their funds for 
derivative-related losses? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Fear and competition, mainly. Some fear that if per-share values fall below 
$1 -- in other words, money fund investors lose principal -- it could so spook 
investors that they would flee. They might flee all money funds, not just the 
bad ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Large family funds have an additional concern: If investors leave a money 
fund, they may leave the entire family. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the worst-case scenario? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>

principal losses are modest -- a few pennies on the dollar.

 A money fund-like investment offered to Arco employees, for example, lost 5.3%

ECONOMY GROWS AS INFLATION STAYS ON SHELF; INVENTORIES: FACTORIES PUSH GROWTH 
TO 3.7% ANNUAL RATE, BUT TIMES POLL FINDS CONSUMERS ARE WARY, KEEPING DEMAND IN 
CHECK.

<P>
 Busy factories drove the nation's economy forward at a brisk 3.7% annual rate 
in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday, but growth in the 
second half of 1994 could slow dramatically because wary consumers are reining 
in their spending and goods are starting to pile up on store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the report was good news for inflation, because rising 
inventories should prevent manufacturers and retailers from raising prices. 
Wall Street traders gave their inflation fears a day off too, sending bond 
yields tumbling and stocks sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers, however, don't seem nearly as upbeat about the country's economic 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 A new, nationwide Times Poll found that only 14% of Americans think the 
economy will be better three months from now -- down from 26% in January -- 
while the percentage of people who think it will grow worse has jumped to 20% 
from 12% over the same period.  
</P>
<P>
 Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic growth, has 
been tapering off since the beginning of the year. The growing nervousness the 
poll found could portend an even sharper decline in spending and slower overall 
growth in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tend to spend less when they get nervous about the economy and their 
jobs," said Susan Pinkus, assistant director of the Times Poll. If spending 
drops further, she said, "it's reasonable to assume that the overall economy 
will also slow." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Friday's report of a 3.7% growth rate in the gross domestic 
product showed that the nation is enjoying the best of both worlds: solid 
economic growth with very little inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors took advantage of the upbeat news, sending the prices of stocks and 
bonds higher. The Dow industrial average of stocks jumped 33.67 points, its 
best one-day gain in more than a month, to close at 3,764.50. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which moves in the 
opposite direction of bond prices, tumbled to 7.39% from 7.55% Thursday -- a 
sign that traders think inflation will remain at bay for at least a while 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department report says business inventories in the second quarter 
rose at their fastest rate in nearly three years, as factories kept working 
overtime even as consumer spending dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, many economists said, manufacturers are likely to begin throttling back 
production to avoid glutting the market further. As a result, growth in the 
second half of the year should drop to about 3% -- a rate that is good enough 
to prevent companies from starting massive layoffs but low enough to keep 
inflation away. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's really no sense in keeping factories running at full speed when 
there's no one to buy your products," said Martin Regalia, chief economist of 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington. "We should see the economy slow 
down in the coming months, which should keep inflation in check." 
</P>
<P>
 Regalia and most other experts said Friday's report also takes some pressure 
off the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates again soon in its effort 
to keep inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has raised short-term rates four times since February to discourage 
businesses and consumers from borrowing and spending too much. Excess spending 
can overheat the economy and create inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new Times Poll indicates that consumers do not seem ready to go on a 
spending spree. 
</P>
<P>
 Although private and government economists say the national recession 
technically ended in late 1991, 53% of all Americans think the country is still 
in one, the poll shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two-thirds of the respondents said the overall economy is shaky, and 
one-third said their own finances are on unstable ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Another survey, also released Friday, found that consumers' confidence appears 
to be waning. 
</P>
<P>
 The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index dropped to 89 
this month from 91.2 in June, as rising interest rates drained off some of 
their optimism about the economy. THE TIMES POLL

 A recent Times poll indicates that more Americans appear worried about the

<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,515 adults nationwide, by telephone, July 23-26. 
Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that listed and non-listed numbers 
were called. Interviewing was conducted in English and Spanish. The sample was 
weighted slightly to conform with census figures for sex, race, age and 
education. The margin of sampling error for the total sample is plus or minus 3 
percentage points.

GROWTH REPORT PUTS SPRING IN STOCKS' AND BONDS' STEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Interest rates plummeted Friday and stocks rose strongly after a key 
government report suggested that a marked slowdown in the economy is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The news on second-quarter gross domestic product growth dissolved much of the 
worry about inflation that has dogged markets in recent months. It also 
suggested that the Federal Reserve Board may give up any thought of raising 
short-term interest rates soon. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, yields tumbled across the board as the market staged its 
biggest rally since May. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year Treasury bond yield slumped from 7.55% on Thursday to 7.39% at 
Friday's close, the lowest level since June 16. The yield had peaked at 7.73% 
on July 11. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 33.67 points to 
3,764.50, its highest level since June 17, though on fairly modest trading 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
 While analysts said some of the rally in stocks and bonds was owed to "short" 
covering -- panicked buying by bearish traders who had previously sold borrowed 
securities, expecting them to fall further -- there also was healthy genuine 
demand from investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Friday's buyers may be assuming that the economy's pace will slow 
enough to allow long-term interest rates to ease further and to at least halt 
any Fed hike in short-term rates that may have been imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the yield on three-month Treasury bills, a proxy for Fed actions, sank 
to 4.37% from 4.54% on Thursday. Traders said the market was signaling that it 
expects the Fed to leave short-term rates alone for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny how sentiment changes in a day," said Guy Truicko, equity 
portfolio manager at Unity Management. "All of a sudden everyone's calling off 
the dogs" on higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Wall Streeters, however, warned that the Fed may still decide to tighten 
credit for a fifth time when it meets Aug. 16, because of concern about 
inflation that may still be in the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the second-quarter GDP report showed that a key measure of inflation rose 
a moderate 2.9% in the quarter, the same as the first three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 If next week's batch of June and July economic statistics confirm a slower 
economy, some Wall Streeters believe sidelined money could pour back into 
stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the only surprise was that bond market's gains didn't spur a bigger 
stock rally. Winners topped losers by 16 to 6 on the Big Board, but volume was 
rather muted at 269 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Most major stock indexes rose less than 1%, though the Nasdaq composite index 
of mostly smaller stocks jumped 9.73 points, or 1.4%, to 722.16. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if strong second-quarter corporate earnings reports and falling 
interest rates persist next week, the combination could fuel a healthy summer 
rally in stocks, some experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite an implied slowdown in the economy, investors flocked back to 
industrial stocks. Analysts said buyers' assumption is that a slower, 
stretched-out economic expansion would guarantee longer profit growth for 
industrial firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcoa jumped 1 3/8 to 78 1/4, Caterpillar rose 1 1/8 to 108 3/8, Scott Paper 
gained 1 1/4 to 57 3/4, Air Products & Chemicals jumped 1 3/8 to 48, Timken 
leaped 2 1/8 to 34 7/8 and Dow Chemical was up 1 to 69 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto stocks also rose. Ford added 7/8 to 31 7/8, GM surged 1 1/8 to 51 3/8 and 
Chrysler advanced 3/4 to 48 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Steel stocks were helped by a bullish prognosis from brokerage J.P. Morgan. 
LTV rocketed 1 5/8 to 18 3/4, Bethlehem Steel advanced 1 to 22 1/4, Inland 
Steel added 1 to 38 and USX-U.S. Steel climbed 1 1/4 to 37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rebounding technology stocks drove the Nasdaq market higher. Apple Computer 
soared 1 13/16 to 33 11/16, Intel gained 1 3/8 to 59 1/4, Microsoft rose 2 to 
51 1/2, Sybase jumped 2 3/8 to 39 3/8 and AST Research was up 1 1/8 to 14 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 But America Online dove 5 to 55 5/8. Investor Paul Allen revealed that he has 
cut his stake in the firm to 9.7% from 18%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, New Image Industries soared 4 to 14 3/4. The 
dental-imaging systems maker said it will be acquired by Dentsply International 
for $16.38 a share in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas markets, Tokyo's Nikkei index rose 201.54 points to 20,449.39. In 
Frankfurt, the DAX average closed at 2,146.64, up 23.83 points. In London, the 
FTSE-100 index eased 13.3 points to 3,082.6. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City stocks' rally resumed, with the Bolsa index up 33.12 points to 
2,462.27, the highest since June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency trading, the dollar slipped back below 100 Japanese yen as new 
concerns about the weekend's U.S.-Japan trade talks erased an early boost. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 99.95 yen, down from 100.10 on Thursday, and 
at 1.583 German marks, down from 1.5910. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities markets, September crude oil futures jumped 53 cents to $20.30 
a barrel on fears that Nigeria's 4-week-old oil workers strike may worsen.

MACY, FEDERATED FILE REORGANIZATION PLAN; RETAILING: JOINT $4.1-BILLION 
PROPOSAL WOULD PAY BACK CREDITORS AND CLEAR THE WAY FOR A GIANT MERGED COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 R.H. Macy & Co. and Federated Department Stores filed a joint $4.1-billion 
reorganization plan Friday as the first step in a process to pay back Macy's 
creditors and by year's end bring Macy out of bankruptcy and merge the two 
companies into a retailing behemoth. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for the creditors to be paid through a combination of cash, 
debt and issuance of approximately $1.1 billion worth of new stock in the 
combined company. It would settle about $4.7 billion in claims. It must be 
approved by Macy's creditors, Federated shareholders and U.S. Bankruptcy Court 
Judge Burton Lifland. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the companies said that "the amount of creditor support across 
the board is very, very high . . . and we're very optimistic" about gaining 
official creditor approval of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the boards of the two companies must give formal approval to the 
merger. A Federated official said action on the merger agreement is expected 
within the next two weeks. The firms will also seek federal and antitrust 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies said they expect to file a detailed operational plan by the 
end of August that will offer financial projections and spell out how they 
expect to combine their 341 department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the two companies declined to offer clues about where cutbacks 
would be made or which stores might face closure. However, operations in the 
Northeast and in cities where the firms directly compete, such as New York and 
Atlanta, could take the brunt of the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization plan calls for different levels of payments to the 
different classes of creditors. Prudential Insurance Co., Fidelity Investments 
and Macy's other most senior, secured creditors, who are owed nearly $1.6 
billion, would be paid more than $2 billion in a combination of cash, new 
secured notes and new company stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondholders, believed to be the force that finally drove Macy into Federated's 
arms, will be paid at a lower rate. Owed nearly $1.3 billion, they will get 
cash and stock valued at $482 million. Other unsecured creditors will get paid

 Federated is a coalition of primarily regional chains, with 230 department 
stores in 26 states, under the names Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus, Jordan 
Marsh, Burdines, Bon Marche, Goldsmith's, Lazarus, Rich's and Stern's.  
</P>
<P>
 Macy, founded in 1858, operates 111 Macy and Bullock's department stores, a 
dozen I. Magnin outlets and more than 100 other specialty stores. The Macy name 
holds a special cachet for shoppers nationwide, its position as a sentimental 
favorite stemming largely from the classic 1947 film "Miracle on 34th Street," 
which romanticized Macy's traditional Thanksgiving Day Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Archrivals Macy and Federated got into trouble in the late 1980s, when each 
fell victim to the debt-financed mergers and takeovers craze that turned some 
of the country's biggest corporations into junk bond junkies.  
</P>
<P>
 Macy's tried unsuccessfully to buy Federated, a battle that weakened both 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Macy's entered Bankruptcy Court in 1992, Federated was emerging. 
It re-entered Macy's life in January when it took over a $449-million chunk of 
Macy's debt and said it wanted to talk merger. Macy's capitulated two weeks 
ago.

 Key Mortgage Rate Keeps Climbing: The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
said the 11th District cost of funds rate, the figure to which many 
adjustable-rate mortgages are tied, climbed to 3.804% in June from 3.726% in 
May. It was the third straight monthly increase in the rate after a steady 
decline during the previous 3 1/2 years.

 RTC Sells Five Guardian Branches: Home Savings of America said it bought the 
remaining branches of the failed Guardian Federal Savings Assn. of Huntington 
Beach from the Resolution Trust Corp. Home Savings paid a $1.8-million premium 
for the branches' combined $87.4 million in retail deposits and also purchased 
$9.8 million of Guardian's other assets. The five offices -- in Huntington 
Beach, Long Beach, Rancho Mirage, Hemet and San Jose -- will reopen Monday 
under the Home Savings banner.

REGULATORS CLOSE COMMERCEBANK AND GUARDIAN FEDERAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regulators closed two Orange County financial institutions with more than $200 
million in deposits late Friday but said it will be business as usual for their 
retail customers on Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 CommerceBank, a 15-year-old Newport Beach business bank, was seized and closed 
by state regulators, while federal thrift regulators shut down Guardian Federal 
Savings in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 CommerceBank, which has been on the state's list of troubled banks since 1990, 
was "operating in an unsafe manner, which necessitated the closure as 
protection to depositors and creditors," said James E. Gilleran, state banking 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's Newport Beach headquarters and its branch in Orange will open 
Monday as offices of Covina-based California State Bank, while branches in 
Costa Mesa and Long Beach will be closed and their retail accounts shifted to 
the Newport Beach office. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, the bank delayed a $14-million stock offering that would have 
brought in badly needed capital and could have helped stave off the closure. 
Bank officials said the offering was postponed because of publicity about 
CommerceBank's ties to First Pension Corp., an Irvine pension management firm 
that allegedly lost $121 million of investors' retirement funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a custodian for First Pension, Commerce held about $10 million in clients' 
retirement funds from 1990 to 1993. Bankers pulled the stock sale, fearing that 
people who used First Pension to direct their retirement funds would take legal 
action against the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 California State Bank acquired $40 million in CommerceBank deposits 
representing about 3,900 retail accounts. An additional $98 million in 700 
institutional accounts at the bank was left for regulators to refund. 
</P>
<P>
 Deposits of up to $100,000 at banks and thrifts are insured by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 All five offices and $87.4 million in deposits in 4,000 accounts at Guardian 
Federal Savings were transferred to giant Home Savings of America by the 
Resolution Trust Corp. The Guardian offices -- in Huntington Beach, Long Beach, 
Hemet, Rancho Mirage and San Jose -- will all open Monday as Home Savings 
branches.

WESTERN DIGITAL STOCK JUMPS 10% ON FAVORABLE REPORT BY VALUE LINE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Western Digital Corp.'s stock price jumped 10% Friday on heavy trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange, a $1.375-a-share boost the company attributed to a 
highly favorable report issued earlier in the day by Value Line, a respected 
publication for investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of the Irvine-based maker of disk drives closed at $15.25 as more than 
1.8 million shares changed hands, several times the stock's usual trading 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
 In its report, Value Line gave Western Digital high marks overall. 
</P>
<P>
 The publication gave Western Digital stock its top ranking for timeliness -- 
the equivalent of a strong "buy" recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 The report predicted that the company will have a strong gain in earnings per 
share for its fiscal 1995, in part due to demand for the company's new 
one-gigabyte and 730-megabyte drives. DON LEE

DEVELOPER'S NEW SUBURB MAY BE IN CHINA; ENTREPRENEUR: LARGO VISTA IS SHIPPING 
TWO MANUFACTURED HOMES TO FREE ENTERPRISE ZONE NEAR HONG KONG, WHERE DEMAND IS 
SAID TO BE HIGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Like many Orange County developers, John A. Jones has visions of wooded 
hillsides covered in ranch-style homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is that Jones' vision doesn't stop at Temecula or Rancho Santa 
Margarita or any of the Southland's new edge cities. The hillsides he sees are 
near the Chinese free enterprise zone of Shenzhen, China -- just north of the 
Hong Kong border. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jones isn't a builder, he's an exporter. 
</P>
<P>
 His company, Largo Vista Group Ltd., is sending two manufactured homes to 
China in the next few days. They are the first of four 800- to 
1,500-square-foot modular residences to be shipped as model homes for a 
proposed project that eventually could become a neighborhood beside Xili Lake, 
about 20 miles from the boom town of Shenzhen. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes according to plan, Largo Vista officials say they hope to build 
hundreds of prefabricated homes in the Chinese countryside and sell them at 
prices ranging from $35,000 to $200,000. They would create the rough equivalent 
of Orange County's suburban sprawl outside one of the world's most crowded and 
expensive metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a dire need for housing" in industrial South China, said Jones, 
Largo Vista's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese entrepreneurs and managers who have become the old nation's new 
wealthy are eager to buy Western-style homes, according to Jones. Largo Vista 
discovered the need almost by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The company hosted a delegation of Chinese provincial officials on a visit to 
Orange County several years ago, Largo Vista President Daniel J. Mendez 
recalled. He said there was a gap in the group's schedule that he had to fill, 
so he decided to give them a tour of a prefabricated home factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez said he took them the Golden West Homes plant in Perris. The Chinese 
officials viewed the finished models and asked how much they cost. Mendez said 
he thought the average price of $110,000 -- including an inexpensive lot -- 
would be way beyond the spending range of the Chinese and was surprised when 
delegates said such homes would be a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes being built in South China near Hong Kong typically are bare-bones 
condominiums that the Chinese buy for the equivalent of $100,000 or more, 
pooling all the money they can raise from friends and relatives, he said. They 
usually pay cash. 
</P>
<P>
 When Largo Vista showed off pictures of its model homes at recent trade show 
in China, Mendez said, one man asked the price and later came back with two 
shopping bags crammed with money and offered to buy one on the spot. 
Unfortunately, Mendez said, the homes weren't for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The model homes Largo is shipping are being built by Golden West Homes. The 
models should be available for inspection by early January. 
</P>
<P>
 If there are enough orders to warrant going ahead with the project, Mendez 
said, houses will be built at a plant in China, most likely through a licensing 
arrangement with Golden West or some other manufactured housing company in the 
United States, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 No modifications are being made for the China market in the Golden West 
models. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said visiting Chinese officials who have seen the houses say they like 
the open, airy design that contrasts with the smaller rooms and 
compartmentalized look of newer Chinese structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Largo Vista already has experience in Shenzhen, having broken ground on a 
$23-million joint venture there to build a new movie complex and museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said there are deals to be had everywhere in the free enterprise zone 
around Shenzhen. He has had a hard time, though, getting Americans to see the 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "In China, it's just mind boggling. There is so much going on," he said. Largo

US FACILITIES WINS VICTORY OVER AN UNFRIENDLY SUITOR; INSURANCE: COURT DECISION 
IS A SETBACK TO PLAN OF FIDELITY NATIONAL TO TAKE OVER THE O.C. FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 US Facilities Corp. won a legal battle Friday against unfriendly suitor 
Fidelity National Financial Inc. when a Delaware court overturned the election 
of two directors nominated by Fidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 US Facilities said the Chancery Court in Delaware, where the Costa Mesa-based 
stop-loss insurer is incorporated, decided to reinstate 80,386 shareholder 
votes -- enough to defeat the two nominees of Fidelity, the Irvine title 
insurance company that is offering $79 million in a hostile takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent tabulators had thrown out those votes at US Facilities' annual 
meeting in May because it appeared that the voting rights to those shares had 
been given to both US Facilities and Fidelity. The votes were cast by US 
Fidelity's employee 401(k) plan. But US Facilities filed a lawsuit challenging 
the tabulators' action. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's ruling allows US Facilities to install two of its own longtime 
directors and is a setback to Fidelity, which disclosed in April its intent to 
acquire US Facilities as part of a strategy to diversify its business. Fidelity 
owns 9.6% of US Facilities' common stock, but having two directors on US 
Facilities' board would have helped the takeover effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed," said Frank Willey, Fidelity's executive vice president and 
general counsel. Willey conceded that the ruling may slow down Fidelity's 
takeover bid, but he said it will not stop the sale of US Facilities to 
Fidelity or anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity won stockholder support at US Facilities' annual meeting for a 
resolution to put US Facilities on the market. But US Facilities decided to put 
that resolution on hold until its election challenge was settled. 
</P>
<P>
 George Kadonada, US Facilities' chairman and chief executive officer, said in 
a statement that the board would address the stockholder resolution to sell or 
merge the company. But he noted that it was a non-binding resolution, meaning 
the board does not have to do anything about the resolution, passed by less 
than a majority of the outstanding shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Delaware court's ruling Friday had little effect on the two companies' 
stock. Fidelity closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $12.625 a share, up 50 
cents. US Facilities' shares were unchanged at $12.875 in Nasdaq trading.

 Plaza Home Mortgage Corp., the Santa Ana mortgage banking company, reported a 
second-quarter loss of $9.8 million, or 85 cents a share, contrasted with a 
profit of $3.3 million, or 30 cents a share, for the same period a year

first half. For the first half, the company posted a loss of $9.8 million, or 
85 cents a share, contrasted with a profit of $6.2 million, or 56 cents a 
share, for the first half of 1993.

JUDGE NAMES FIRST PENSION CORP. RECEIVER; COURTS: LAWYER WILL TRY AND FIND ANY 
REMAINING ASSETS. AN ESTIMATED $121 MILLION IS MISSING.

 In an attempt to recover missing funds for investors, a federal judge this 
week appointed a receiver to ferret out any remaining assets in the allegedly 
phony mortgage pools operated by First Pension Corp., the failed pension 
management firm. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Harry L. Hupp on Thursday appointed Donald W. Henry, a 
Woodland Hills lawyer who specializes in real estate-related receiverships, as 
the receiver for the web of entities and partnerships affiliated with 
Irvine-based First Pension.The receivership was requested by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies that Henry will oversee are BMF Management Inc. and the BMF mortgage 
pools; Vestcorp Securities Inc.; Amerispec Inc., the home inspection company 
based in Orange; First Diversified Financial Services; Outpatient Surgery 
Center of California; Surgical Center Management;, Anaheim Surgery Center; 
Euclid-Ball ASC, Ltd., and Mitchell North Partners, Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC has alleged that the owners of First Pension operated a massive 
pyramid scheme for years, enticing investors into allegedly phony mortgage 
pools by promising returns of as much as 20%. An estimated $121 million of 
investors' funds are missing, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three operators of First Pension are scheduled to appear in federal court 
in Los Angeles at 10 a.m. Monday to plead guilty to two counts of mail fraud 
each. The charges carry a maximum prison term of 10 years, U.S. attorneys said.

 Keeping their promise to get tougher, the Kings delivered a roundhouse to 
their roster and their fans Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Luc Robitaille, one of the most popular players in club history, was traded to 
the Pittsburgh Penguins for right wing Rick Tocchet and a second-round draft 
choice next year. 
</P>
<P>
 While responsibility for the trade is being claimed by King General Manager 
Sam McMaster, insiders say the move contains the distinct fingerprints of Wayne 
Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky, who earlier this year engineered the return of Marty McSorley and the 
hiring of McMaster, openly coveted Tocchet when the two met at a recent 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said 'We might try to get you,' " said Tocchet, known as much for his hits 
as his goals. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday the Kings fulfilled that vow, even though Tocchet is recovering from 
back surgery. And even though it cost them a man who has been with their 
organization longer than any player on the current roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Robitaille, who was drafted in 1984 and spent the last eight years with the 
Kings, has never scored fewer than 44 goals in a season or heard less than 
exuberant cheers from the Forum fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The trademark chant of "Luuuuc" will now been replaced with, well. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, maybe they'll yell 'Rick,' " said Tocchet, 30, who is two years 
older and considerably more battered than Robitaille. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a family member, "there were tears" when Robitaille was informed 
of the deal. Robitaille refused to answer questions Friday but plans to hold a 
news conference today. He will read a statement that, in part, says: "I am 
sorry about leaving the Kings. . . . I really appreciate the wonderful support 
that I have received from the people of Los Angeles for all these years. I will 
always remember that no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Robitaille's agents, Pat Brisson, addressed a touchy subject that 
Robitaille will certainly discuss today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wayne Gretzky is one of the greatest players ever; Luc learned a lot from 
Wayne," Brisson said. "But Wayne is a player and should not be making the 
decisions. I don't know if he does or not." 
</P>
<P>
 While Robitaille has scored 40 or more goals for eight consecutive seasons, 
the longest streak by any active player including Gretzky, Tocchet has scored 
40 or more only three times in his 10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, while playing despite severe pain in his back and legs, Tocchet 
scored 14 goals with 26 assists in 51 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "He plays with grit, determination, he drives to the front of the net," said 
McMaster. But it is that style of play that landed him on an operating table 
June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 After banging around enough to accumulate more than 100 penalty minutes in 
each of his 10 seasons, Tocchet's lower back was injured to the point where 
doctors removed a piece of floating disc. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors assured Tocchet and the Kings that the operation was not career 
threatening, and he has recently been cleared to perform all necessary 
functions on the ice. Consulting on the case was Los Angeles-based Dr. Robert 
Watkins, a nationally renowned back expert. 
</P>
<P>
 Tocchet is expected to be able to fully participate in training camp beginning 
in September and be at full strength by the start of the season. The last time 
he was in top condition, two seasons ago, he scored 48 goals with 109 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand that he will be 100% for us, that is a condition of the deal," 
McMaster said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Tocchet is sound, league observers feel it could be a good trade, giving 
the Kings the offensive bruiser they so desperately need while removing a 
scorer who can be replaced by the likes of Gretzky, Jari Kurri and Mike 
Donnelly, according to McMaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Local fans will undoubtedly question how any team can deal a player who scored 
63 goals two seasons ago, a league record for a left wing. Robitaille led the 
team in virtually every offensive category that season before their run to the 
Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings could counter that it was easy to trade a player who disappeared 
once that 1992-93 regular season ended. Robitaille scored only nine goals and 
22 points in the Stanley Cup playoffs, with a team-worst minus 13 on the 
plus-minus scale. 
</P>
<P>
 McMaster, who helped sign Tocchet both for a junior hockey team and the 
Philadelphia Flyers, says he knew just the bruiser to take Robitaille's place. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we lacked up front is someone who played the game like Rick Tocchet," 
McMaster said. "Marty McSorley is that type of individual, but his strength is 
on defense. We were lacking that type of person up front." 
</P>
<P>
 Insinuations that Robitaille was not tough enough will anger his supporters, 
particularly since he played four months last season with a broken ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that is not tough, if that is not playing tough in front of the net, then 
I don't know what tough is," Brisson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tocchet also knows tough. A month after he was acquired by the Penguins in 
1992 from the Philadelphia Flyers, he suffered a broken jaw in the second 
period of a game in Chicago. He returned in the third period to score two goals 
in the Penguins' 4-3 comeback victory over the Black Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
 With this type of play, he later helped the Penguins win their second 
consecutive Stanley Cup championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the L.A. fans want to win, and if I come out and give 100%, they'll 
accept me," Tocchet said. "If you win, face it, the fans will back you." A Luc

NFL SPIRIT LIVES ON IN SPAIN; PRO FOOTBALL: RAIDER-BRONCO EXHIBITION, RETURN OF 
THE BARCELONA DRAGONS ARE AMONG SIGNS THAT INTEREST IS GROWING DESPITE 
POPULARITY OF SOCCER.

 The blow knocked Pau Coll down. He was dizzy. He was in pain. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Coll had played soccer all his life, understandable because he had grown up in 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 But then he got a chance to go to another part of the world, and his own world 
was never the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Coll went to the United States for one year of high school as an exchange 
student, winding up in Texas near Amarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Much as soccer is the closest thing to religion in Europe, such is the case 
with football in Texas. Only in Texas, it's not so easy to distinguish between 
the two. 
</P>
<P>
 When Coll asked if he could take a shot at playing this American futbol for 
his new school, his coach naturally made him a kicker. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem for Coll. But also, no satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to hit and get hit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, with sly smiles on their faces, the coaching staff put him on the 
defensive line to get a taste of it and, sure enough, on the first play, down 
Coll went. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt great!" says Coll, now 24,as he stood on the sideline Friday at a 
Raider practice. Coll, who is acting as an interpreter for the team this week 
while it prepares for Sunday's exhibition opener against the Denver Broncos in 
Barcelona's Montjuic Stadium, still has excitement in his voice as he spoke of 
his initiation into the world of football, even though the experience occurred 
more than six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing his year of high school, Coll came home, but he brought his 
new toy with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a funny-looking ball," said one of his old friends in Barcelona. "How do 
you kick it?" 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing funny about it to Coll. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's talk about real football," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 And soon, they were doing more than talking. Coll had his friends on the beach 
playing seven on seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't use any pads or anything," he says. "There were lots of bruises, 
plenty of teeth flying." 
</P>
<P>
 Once his friends caught some of Coll's enthusiasm, they inquired about 
purchasing football equipment from America. 
</P>
<P>
 They spent about $400 each on shoulder pads and about $250 on helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 Coll and his friends proved to be in the vanguard of a movement that was 
growing in Spain. With exposure to American football through television, 
interest in the sport was on the rise in 1988, just about the time Coll 
returned home. 
</P>
<P>
 Football had already made inroads in Italy, where a coach, Angelo Vettese, was 
working with young players. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, Vettese came to Spain and formed the Badalona Drags football 
squad. Today, football is bigger than ever in Spain. There are 53 amateur teams 
playing in two leagues nine months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Barcelona Dragons are about to return. After a one-year hiatus, the 
World League is back, bringing with it Barcelona's franchise, which operated in 
both 1991 and '92. 
</P>
<P>
 The football/soccer comparisons that are going on in the United States this 
summer as a result of the World Cup similarly are being made here in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody would dare hint that football will ever overtake soccer here, much as 
no one in America would predict that the World Cup would ever overshadow the 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 But much as there is a feeling that the two sports can coexist in America, 
such is the sentiment here as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a refusal by the older people to get interested in American 
football," says Cristina Cubero, a reporter for El Mundo Deportivo, a Spanish 
sports newspaper. "They are addicted to soccer. But many of the young people 
like American football because it is so different. They are getting tired of 
soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't football's violence turn off Spanish fans? 
</P>
<P>
 "They find it fascinating," Cubero says. "It's not like the players are trying 
to kill each other. It is a contact sport. We have no other contact sport. We 
have very little hockey in this country. (Football) is the most contact we can 
get." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Rafael Cervera, who will work in the front office for the 
reincarnated Dragons, only about 15% of the crowds who attended Dragon games in 
the past really understood football. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 35% liked the hard-hitting and the long bombs," he says. "And the other 
50% were just happy to feel like they were in America for three hours. And they 
liked to look at the cheerleaders." 
</P>
<P>
 The first year, the Dragons averaged about 28,000 a game. The second season, 
that figure grew to 32,000. This time around, they are hoping to average about 
35,000 in 54,000-seat Montjuic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Coll, who played for the Dragons the first time, is taking part in tryouts to 
regain his spot on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
 But working for the Raiders this week has exposed him to the huge gap between 
the talent level of the Dragons and that of the NFL, a league he still dreams 
of playing in. 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, Raider quarterback Vince Evans fires a long pass to Rocket 
Ismail. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's perfection," Coll says on the sidelines.BARCELONA DRAGONS (FOOTBALL

JORDAN GETS HIS FIRST GOOD CUTS OF THE SEASON; BASKETBALL: HE RIPS PIPPEN AND 
GRANT BUT SAYS HE WON'T COME BACK.

 Michael Jordan ripped former Chicago Bull teammates Scottie Pippen and Horace 
Grant and said he could average 32 points after only two weeks of preparation 
if he decided to come back to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview published Friday by the New York Post, Jordan said pride 
prevents him from even considering an NBA comeback, though, because "I'd never 
want the media to think they were right." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-time most valuable player, who retired from the Bulls before last 
season to pursue a professional baseball career, spoke after his Birmingham 
Barons lost, 3-2, in 10 innings to the Orlando Cubs on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, whose father, James, was murdered on July 23, 1993, said his father's 
death had no bearing on his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had totally lost interest," he said, adding he told teammates of his plans 
in the second half of his last season. "I knew I had to give it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, speaking about Pippen and Grant, Jordan said his father encouraged him 
"all that season" to retire because "he felt my teammates didn't appreciate 
what I was doing for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I covered their (butts) when they got tight at the end of games and I had to 
overcome fourth-quarter deficits all by myself. It bothered my father a lot, 
just as it bothered me, to hear them (complaining) about not getting enough 
credit, or not getting enough shots, or squawking about the supposed 
preferential treatment I was getting from (Coach) Phil (Jackson). 
</P>
<P>
 "They had no idea how much pressure and grief I had to put up with off the 
court while carrying them on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scottie found out the hard way what it's like to be under the microscope 24 
hours a day. For the first half of the season he did great carrying the team; 
the second half not so great." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, referring to Pippen's refusal to play the final seconds of a playoff 
game against the New York Knicks because he was to be a decoy on the play while 
Tony Kukoc took the final shot, Jordan said Pippen made a big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he'll ever live that down," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jordan has a .188 batting average and 10 errors in right field for 
Birmingham, he said he still "can't come up with a single reason to change my 
mind" about returning to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he came up with one. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that Reggie Miller said recently that Dream Team II is better than the 
first Dream Team of Jordan, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, Jordan said he would 
love to play a charity game matching the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys are on the right team, because they're definitely dreaming," he 
said. "Not only was Dream Team I better, but we could beat them right 
now."JORDAN, MICHAEL

 Many Southern Californians who enjoyed the experience of watching the Olympic 
torch being carried through their neighborhoods before the 1984 Games will have 
the chance to see the torch again. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a source in the Atlanta Organizing Committee, the Olympic torch 
relay before the 1996 Atlanta Games will start its cross-country trek in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will start the torch relay in early May," the source said Friday, "and we 
will start in Los Angeles as a tribute to the '84 Games." 
</P>
<P>
 The torch will then crisscross the country from Los Angeles and remain lit and 
moving until it lights the Olympic Stadium's torch during the opening ceremony 
on Friday, July 19, 1996. BILL DWYREOLYMPIC TORCH1996)

POSTCARD / ST. PETERSBURG; WHAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS IS GOOD FIVE-CENT TICKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY and 
</P>
</BYLINE>

 Before the Goodwill Games, organizers announced that the following would 
receive free admission to the events: Olympic athletes, schoolchildren, 
military veterans, retirees, physically impaired, workers who contributed to 
the construction and reconstruction of the venues, anyone whose last name ends 
in a v , y or a vowel. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, on the night that Carl Lewis ran in the 100 meters, Sergei Bubka pole 
vaulted and Jackie Joyner-Kersee began the heptathlon, so many of Petrovsky 
Stadium's 28,000 seats were empty that the gates were opened to allow anyone 
who happened to be passing by to enter without a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the night's program, even the optimists could not say with a 
straight face that the stadium was half full, and that so far has been the 
largest crowd for a sporting event during the Goodwill Games' first week. At 
some venues, there have been almost as many athletes as fans. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not that Russians do not like sports. They like them very much, although 
many sports fans here, like many sports fans in the United States, do not have 
much curiosity about team handball, judo, water polo or even, apparently, track 
and field and amateur boxing. They prefer soccer and ice hockey, neither of 
which is a Goodwill Games medal sport. 
</P>
<P>
 But even those who do enjoy the so-called minor sports, or have a curiosity 
about them, had difficulty before the Games finding tickets, which did not go 
on sale until two days before the opening ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, there's no Ticketron, no TicketMaster, no record-keeping, no credit 
cards over the phone," said Goodwill Games President Jack Kelly of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said he tried to persuade the organizers to establish a system for 
advance sales, but they wanted to do it their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, it's Russia," he said, resignedly. "It's their country, not mine." 
</P>
<P>
 He also got nowhere when he talked to them about limiting live telecasts in 
St. Petersburg. During the fortnight, 140 hours of events are being televised 
here on three channels. There is no word in Russian for blackout . 
</P>
<P>
 The largest obstacle to selling tickets, however, is their cost. Although 
reduced by two-thirds since they went on sale, the price of the best seats is 
still $13.50. Considering the average monthly salary of Russians living here is 
about $100, that is steep. There are cheaper seats, all the way down to $2.40. 
But even that, some residents complain, is more than they can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 In an excruciatingly painful transition period for the economy, many Russians 
are suffering. Seemingly oblivious to that, more than a few Americans here for 
the Goodwill Games are making sport of haggling with taxi drivers and street 
merchants over a dollar or two. 
</P>
<P>
 We have the money and we flaunt it. If they want some of it, they have to 
grovel. By the time the Goodwill Games end next weekend, I wouldn't blame them 
if they don't like us very much. RANDY HARVEYGOODWILL GAMES

FEDS DO THEIR DUTY IN BRAZIL; SOCCER: SEARCH BEGINS FOR TONS OF ITEMS BOUGHT IN

 The treasure hunt is on. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents are looking for the 17.4 tons of personal items bought by 
Brazil's soccer team during the World Cup, cargo that was waived through Rio's 
international airport last week to the chagrin of customs officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Lafredo Vieira Lopes, a federal judge, gave police the green light Thursday to 
search the homes of the 93 players, staff and guests of the team delegation 
that failed to pay $1 million in customs duties on excess luggage. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents started at the home of Ricardo Teixeira, president of the Confederation 
of Brazilian Football, who went over the $500 limit on personal items that can 
be brought in duty free by Brazilian nationals. Teixeira is the son-in-law of 
FIFA President Joao Havelange. 
</P>
<P>
 Teixeira refused to show airport customs officials in Rio his luggage and told 
players to boycott a scheduled ticker-tape parade there. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, airport officials said a call came from the presidential palace 
in Brasilia to let the baggage go uninspected. 
</P>
<P>
 When the feds came, however, Teixeira was apologetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never thought there would be a problem," he said, after giving the federal 
police and tax inspectors a list of his luggage. 
</P>
<P>
 "At no time did we ask that our baggage not be inspected." 
</P>
<P>
 Next came Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, who told police he brought in $3,700 
worth of items, including a color TV, personal computer and laser printer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't that we didn't want to pay duties, we just didn't want to leave our 
baggage impounded at the airport," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, the agents knocked on the doors of stars: Romario, Bebeto, 
Mazinho, Jorginho, Branco, Leonardo, and assistant coach Mario Zagalo. What did 
they find? 
</P>
<P>
 A doll house, and a baby stroller. 
</P>
<P>
 "My baggage looked big because I bought a doll house for my daughter. But I 
swear, I didn't go over the $500 limit," Mazinho said.

SOLIS RETURNS TO THE SCENE OF '93 SLUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago at Del Mar, Alex Solis won only 15 races, on 8% of his mounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis got a new agent -- Harry Hacek -- a confidant -- Fernando Toro -- and 
now he has a new life as a jockey. His numbers since last year's Del Mar 
meeting: 04,16,06,07,06 Track Wins Win % Pos. Oak Tree 24 13 4th Hollywood Park 
28 19 1st Santa Anita 68 16 4th Hollywood Park 78 19 1st Since 1981, Chris 
McCarron, Gary Stevens, Laffit Pincay, Kent Desormeaux, Pat Valenzuela and 
Eddie Delahoussaye had monopolized riding titles, winning all but four of the 
67 that have been available. The interlopers have been Aaron Gryder, who as an 
apprentice won Hollywood Park's short meeting in 1987, and Solis, who won a 
Santa Anita winter title in 1992 before his two recent championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis wasn't going to quit the game or return to Florida, as had been rumored 
after his dismal Del Mar showing last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a very sad meet," Solis, 30, said the other day. "It got to the 
point where week after week, nothing was going right. I was scared. I was 
riding so bad that I couldn't see what to do different. I forgot how much fun 
riding had been. I got very sour." 
</P>
<P>
 For solace, Solis sought out Toro, who won more than 3,500 races. Solis 
arrived in California from Florida in 1985, and the Panamanian newcomer and the 
Chilean veteran became close before Toro retired in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Toro remembers having dinner with Solis last fall, not long after the Del Mar 
season ended. "Alex was very depressed," Toro said. "But he was very honest 
with himself. He was willing to face the facts that he was doing some things 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Toro collected a batch of Solis' race tapes and began analyzing them. "He was 
trying too hard," Toro said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two began jogging together in the mornings, not far from Santa Anita. 
"Just keep working hard," Toro told Solis. "No matter what happens, you'll turn 
this thing around." 
</P>
<P>
 These therapy sessions might have been good for Solis, but they were wearing 
Toro down. "I was getting too sore," Toro said. "I finally told Alex that we 
better start walking while we talked, instead of running." 
</P>
<P>
 Trainers who had entrusted some of their best horses to Solis -- Mel Stute, 
Ron McAnally and Bruce Headley -- didn't quit on him. By the end of the year, 
Solis had sufficiently shaken off the Del Mar doldrums to total $6.2 million in 
purses, 14th nationally. He is at about $4.4 million this year, in ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hot jocks and cold jocks run in cycles," Stute said. "One of the reasons Alex 
might not have been doing much at Del Mar last year was that my barn wasn't 
winning much, either." 
</P>
<P>
 When Stute was training Snow Chief, four other jockeys weren't available to 
ride the inexperienced colt, so Solis got the job. In 1986, Solis rode Snow 
Chief to victory in the Preakness, the Florida Derby, the Santa Anita Derby and 
the Jersey Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alex is one of the strongest finishers there is on a horse," Stute said. 
"From the eighth pole home, I can't think of another jockey I'd rather have 
riding for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Toro says Solis does all right early in a race too. "He has a good sense of 
pace," Toro said. "He works a lot of horses in the mornings, that's why he's so 
good with pace." 
</P>
<P>
 From Toro, Solis was able to regain his confidence. From his standby trainers, 
he got hope. And Hacek got him the horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harry's a great agent, and Fernando laid it out so clearly for me," Solis 
said. "I always knew what I could do. I think I've got great communication with 
horses, but it was Fernando who got my head together. I still want to learn 
every day, I want to keep improving and I'm happy as long as I'm giving 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 Solis didn't win Wednesday, Del Mar's opening day, then in Thursday's third 
race, he suffered a hip injury in a two-horse spill. A second set of X-rays 
showed what was believed to be an old bone chip in his right hip, and Solis 
didn't ride Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But he will be back, maybe today. Del Mar doesn't scare him anymore. Horse 
Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron, who has sat out the last two days after suffering an ankle 
injury in a gate incident on opening day, is scheduled to ride two morning-line 
favorites in today's stakes. McCarron has the assignments on Kingdom Found, 
even money in the San Diego Handicap, and Work The Crowd, 5-2 in the San 
Clemente Handicap. McCarron will work some horses this morning before 
determining whether to resume riding. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Stevens is off to a hot start with nine winners in three days, but he is 
being slowed by the stewards, who have handed him a five-day suspension for his 
role in an incident that led to a two-horse spill Thursday. The ban begins 
Monday. . . . Memo is the highweight at 121 pounds for Sunday's $100,000 Bing 
Crosby Handicap. Also entered are Thirty Slews, Trouble Onthe Line, Gundaghia, 
Soviet Problem, Slerp, Bahatur, Codified, J.F. Williams, Phone Roberto and 
King's Blade. 
</P>
<P>
 Sea Hero, who won the 1993 Kentucky Derby and Travers, and Tabasco Cat, a top 
contender for 3-year-old of the year, are expected to be in action at Saratoga 
during the weekend. Sea Hero will make his third start on the grass this year 
when he meets 13 rivals in the 1 1/2-mile Sword Dancer Handicap today. Tabasco 
Cat, winner of the Preakness and Belmont, is set to contest the 1 1/8-mile Jim 
Dandy on Sunday. Entries for the race for 3-year-olds were scheduled today.

CLEANING UP THE MESS, CREATIVELY; ART: IN A WORK IN LAGUNA BEACH, A HUSBAND AND 
WIFE TEAM OFFERS IDEAS FOR SAVING A POLLUTED RIVER IN FORMER YUGOSLAVIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A basic concept of visual art is that most of it, no matter the medium, 
represents an idea, a feeling, a person, place or thing that isn't actually 
displayed inside a gallery but is represented there by the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists Newton and Helen Mayer Harrison, a husband and wife team from San 
Diego, deal with Planet Earth and the sooty, sludgy, smoggy, toxic, 
insensitive, meddling destruction of it by humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Can't bring all that into a gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 So they go out into the world, explore despoiled sites, formulate ways to 
restore ecological balance, implement such solutions if funding is found, and 
document their work with photographs, maps, drawings, poetic narratives and 
performance, for presentation in galleries around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fragile Ecologies: Artists' Interpretations and Solutions," opening Sunday at 
the Laguna Art Museum, is a traveling group show organized by the Queens Museum 
in New York that includes documentation of an ambitious project the Harrisons 
undertook in what used to be Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 The project focuses on the ecosystem of the Sava River, one of Europe's 
largest and last remaining flood plains, which the Harrisons say is threatened 
by industrial pollution and by man-made irrigation drainage and flood control 
systems. They call the work "Breathing Space for the Sava River (1988-90)." 
</P>
<P>
 "The river was under much pressure," Newton said recently, "and the work 
simply says, 'Let us give the river a breathing space.' " 
</P>
<P>
 All 12 artists involved in "Fragile Ecologies" are "not merely depicting the 
fragile beauty of nature but actively seeking to revitalize damaged habitats," 
as curator Barbara C. Matilsky notes in the exhibit catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The various projects -- some realized, others, such as "Breathing Space," 
still in proposal form -- often are created in conjunction with architects, 
scientists, engineers, local governments and community members. Among them: a 
hummingbird sanctuary planted with honeysuckle, an ocean fish habitat sculpted 
from recycled coal ash, and a batch of hand-carved limestone discs placed in 
rivers across the country to neutralize acid rain water. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harrisons (who in 1987 created "Disappearing Path," a landscaped walkway 
set within Inspiration Point, a coastal bluff in Corona del Mar) have filled a 
large gallery at the Laguna museum with their Sava River project. 
</P>
<P>
 Maps, drawings and panoramic color photos of the Sava and its indigenous 
wildlife are on view. In some photos, the river appears pristine; in others, it 
is murky brown or toxic white, polluted by various chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Between these images are panels bearing the Harrisons' trademark narration 
("waters come from the factory whitened by chalk, burdened by nitrates") which, 
Helen feels, makes the installation into something of "a long conversation, a 
rumination." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, when the Harrisons first visited the Sava wetland, a once-sparsely 
populated area between the Austro-Hungarian and Turkish empires, Newton recalls 
that it still sustained "ancient biota that had disappeared in the rest of 
Europe" such as oak forests, rare black storks, spoonbills and sea eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Some farmers were still employing traditional, "ecologically provident 
methods," Newton said, "using only natural fertilizers like manure, and 
allowing their animals to range free." But the river had been polluted with 
toxic waste from a nuclear power plant and factories along its route. Beyond 
that, it had been confined by earthen dams and canals for irrigation and flood 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 If left as nature made them, "rivers flood everywhere," said Helen. "It's how 
the earth is fertilized, how swamp life survives, where fish make nurseries." 
</P>
<P>
 To redress the destruction they found, the Harrisons proposed natural 
purification systems involving plants that could eliminate pollutants, organic 
farming, and the creation of a "nature corridor" that, Helen said, would give 
the river "the space to be itself, to twist and turn as it wants to, to do 
things rivers normally do." 
</P>
<P>
 Both felt optimistic about rehabilitating the Sava, which funnels into one of 
the world's best-known rivers, the Danube. "We saw it as eminently savable," 
Helen said, "and we began to tell stories. We proposed a new history for the 
Sava." 
</P>
<P>
 The Harrisons' work hasn't escaped criticism. Some feel that the 
documentation, with its diagrams, maps and written materials, can be overly 
didactic, can require a daunting amount of reading and can be less impressive 
visually than conceptually. Wouldn't the artists want to make their work as 
accessible as possible to best get their environmental message across? 
</P>
<P>
 Newton acknowledges that all the reading may cause viewers "to sweat it a 
little." But he said he sees several indications that the message is getting 
across: Many of the Harrisons' proposals -- such as one for a city promenade in 
Baltimore -- not only have been understood but brought to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
 After the artists exhibited their Sava River project in Germany and Slovenia, 
Newton said, the Croatian Department of the Environment approved their plans 
and the World Bank "said it would be willing to fund the purification of the 
river. . . . in part because of seeing our presentations and images." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the bank could follow through, ethnic violence erupted in the region 
and brought the project to an screeching halt. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, "we have no idea" what will happen to the Sava and its ecological 
restoration, Newton said. But "we have been invited back, when the fighting 
stops." 
</P>

'GUMP' STAR ACTS ON HIS VERSATILITY; MOVIES: MYKELTI WILLIAMSON ALSO WRITES AND 
DIRECTS, BUT HE'S IN NO HURRY TO TAKE COMPLETE CONTROL. 'THIS IS SUCH A 
COLLABORATIVE ART. . . . IT'S NOT ABOUT ME .' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a way, actor Mykelti Williamson owes his interest in his profession to the 
television show "Leave It to Beaver." 
</P>
<P>
 As a child growing up in Memphis, Tenn., he thought that because he could see 
Beaver and the Cleaver family on television, someone could see his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started walking like Beaver, talking like Beaver, dressing like Beaver, and 
my oldest brother, Jerry -- one day I called him Wally," Williamson, 35, says 
during a mid-afternoon interview in his publicist's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on, Wally," he squeaks in a surprisingly good Beaver imitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry sat me down and explained that that's the television set and this is 
reality," Williamson continues. "It was sort of like my calling, I just 
misinterpreted it. It was kind of wild how it worked out, because right after 
that, I started doing theater in church." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson started performing professionally at age 13 with the Lockers, a 
disco dance troupe, and won a guest role on "Starsky and Hutch" at 17 in his 
first professional audition. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Williamson has accumulated a list of film and television credits 
that might almost measure up to his 6-foot, 3 1/2-inch frame, including a 
recurring role on "Hill Street Blues" and a guest-star spot on two episodes of 
"China Beach." Recently, he has moved away from television for roles in "Free 
Willy" and the Los Angeles play "Distant Fires," but his powerful performance 
in director Robert Zemeckis' "Forrest Gump" seems sure to win him greater 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the film, Williamson plays Bubba, a country-boy-type from Louisiana who 
befriends Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump in the Army. The two are sent to fight in the 
Vietnam War, where Bubba continues to look out for Gump and teaches him about 
the shrimping business, which Gump pursues after leaving the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson's given name, Mykelti, means "spirit" or "silent friend" in the 
language of the Blackfoot Indians, of which his mother is a descendant, but 
he's hardly silent in person. Instead, he talks good-naturedly about the 
writing projects he's working on, how he's spending his time off and a summer 
trip to Oregon to reprise his role as a social worker in "Free Willy II." 
</P>
<P>
 "I restore cars, listen to jazz and play golf," says Williamson, who's single 
and lives near Marina del Rey, and is finishing work on a 1967 Mercedes 
convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to figure out which project we're going to do after (the sequel 
to) 'Free Willy,' " Williamson says. "I've (also) got some other projects that 
I'm writing right now for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides writing screenplays, Williamson is busy negotiating the sale of a 
television show he created called "The Legends of Big Mama," a "Twilight 
Zone"-style anthology of stories based on tales told to him by his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson also directs, and he's done videos for jazz guitarist Craig T. 
Cooper, one of his close friends, and rap artists Movement Ex. But although 
he's multitalented, don't expect to see him take complete control of a project 
by writing, acting and directing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is such a collaborative art that I think it's kind of silly to do it 
all," Williamson says. "It's not about me ." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson knows his part in "Gump" could be his breakthrough, but though he 
enjoyed working with Hanks and Zemeckis, the work he did for the film wasn't 
all pure fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very intense," says Williamson of the South Carolina filming of the 
Vietnam War sequences of the movie. "We lived in the jungle for a week. We had 
two weeks basic training. We were locked up in a room with this guy who's, 
like, happy to be a soldier, and we're civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day out there I suffered heat exhaustion; then I ended up getting 
poison ivy on my face; then I got chased by a snake, a 6-foot-long water 
moccasin. . . . The snake was gaining on me, it was right behind me, and then 
all of a sudden it just took a left turn and took off." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the harsh conditions and nature-related mishaps, Williamson found 
time for improvised humor. In a scene where his shrimp-obsessed character was 
required to name some of his favorite ways to cook shrimp, the director kept 
rolling. "He didn't cut, so I just kept on improvising more ways to fix 
shrimp," says Williamson, who came up with some fairly obscure dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 That natural humor is one of the reasons Williamson was chosen for the part, 
according to Zemeckis. "He brought the right tone to the character," Zemeckis 
said in a separate interview. "He can do comedy, he can do drama, he can convey 
emotion. He's got a real leading man quality."

SEX ON TV: THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING; COMMENTARY: MORE AND MORE ADULT FARE IS 
BEING SCHEDULED DURING PRIME TIME. ARE NETWORKS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING THE 
IMPACT THEY HAVE ON YOUNG VIEWERS -- AND THE CONSEQUENCES THEY MAY BE 
ENCOURAGING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The issue of family values on TV -- fueled by sexual attitudes in prime time 
-- looks like fair game again on the basis of some fall network pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time of growing concern over the number of children born to unmarried 
young mothers, many of them teen-agers, at least several new series present 
episodes involving first-date sex, with little or no mention of the possible 
serious consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 1992 when then-Vice President Dan Quayle raised the family values flag 
by criticizing "Murphy Brown" because its unmarried lead character had a baby 
out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the dispute that followed over Murphy Brown's impact as a television 
role model, some argued that you could at least say she was a mature woman of 
means; others said that point was irrelevant. In any case, the series airs at 9 
p.m., when network prime time presumably becomes a little more adult-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, a show like "NYPD Blue" is broadcast at 10 p.m., when its adult 
frankness is far more suitable than it would be at 8 or 8:30, times usually 
regarded by the TV industry as drawing a heavy tune-in of kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the face of TV has changed drastically, with tawdry revelations on 
tabloid shows polluting the airwaves at seemingly all hours, the networks, with 
their huge audiences and empty blabbing about appealing to families, are still 
a kind of desperate last resort for some viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet on Fox's new sitcom "Hardball," which airs at 8:30 p.m., we see a baseball 
pitcher in bed with his manager's daughter, whom he has picked up in the 
stands, hardly knows and has just taken out for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 On NBC's new sitcom "Friends," which also airs at 8:30 p.m. and otherwise has 
a nice freewheeling style, a young woman goes to bed on her first date with a 
fellow whose line is that he has not been able to perform sexually for several 
years. We don't see them in the sack, but it is discussed quite openly. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to be a prude to wonder about these things, and it's hardly a 
secret that the kids who watch TV at 8 p.m., 8:30 -- or whatever hour -- almost 
certainly know the facts of life. Still, you do have to ponder whether TV 
networks seriously consider anymore the impact they have on impressionable 
young viewers -- and the consequences they may be encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, well-known for appealing to the hormones of its core audience of young 
male viewers, has a new sitcom called "Wild Oats" that seems to have little on 
its mind besides sex. It is, at least, on at 9:30 p.m., but the 
single-mindedness of its obsession with sack time will not escape anyone of any 
age who can understand English -- or interpret leers. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime time has hardly been chaste for quite some time now. But what often 
seems to be the arbitrary insertion of titillating material is now so common 
and overwhelming that it is numbing. Perhaps that is why "Dr. Quinn, Medicine 
Woman" succeeded following the "Murphy Brown" flap; its wholesomeness seemed 
almost shocking in TV's current environment. 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, the pilot of ABC's new sitcom "All American Girl," another 8:30 
p.m. show, ends -- for no apparent reason -- with the family grandmother 
enjoying herself by watching a pornographic film on television. We don't see 
the film, but the mesmerized grandma is told: "You know that's pornography." 
</P>
<P>
 Other series in the 8-9 p.m. network hour, supposedly a bastion of family 
viewing, also figure to spread sexual innuendo and action far and wide. Fox has 
moved the racy "Melrose Place" to 8 p.m. Mondays, and also has "Beverly Hills, 
90210" at 8 p.m. Wednesdays and the openly suggestive situation comedy "Martin" 
at 8 p.m. Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
 If the pilot is representative, perhaps the best new show of the season will 
be ABC's "My So-Called Life," which will be televised at 8 p.m. Thursdays. It 
was produced by the creators of "thirtysomething" and deals with the growing up 
of a female high school student. Yet at a family dinner in the hourlong series, 
an oddly jarring sequence takes place: 
</P>
<P>
 The student's hip little sister bugs her mother for permission to watch a 
movie at home about a girl who gets obscene phone calls -- "It's like her job" 
. . . "and then somebody tries to kill her." The preoccupied mother finally 
says OK. 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness, you could, I suppose, make a case for the creative rationale 
behind this surprising little exchange -- the insights into the little girl and 
her mother and their states of mind amid the larger theme of growing up, and 
important clues to the family's interaction. And yet, with so much other 
strength in the compelling overall episode, I found myself wondering whether 
this exchange was really necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 A sign of TV's changing times came last year when NBC moved the sitcom "Mad 
About You," which had dealt openly with sex, to 8 p.m. The series had, in 
effect, thrown down the gauntlet early on when its two lead characters -- a 
husband and wife played by Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt -- had intercourse on a 
kitchen table. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not first-date sex that might result in children born to a young, 
unwed mother -- the couple was married and mature -- but by slotting the series 
at 8 p.m., NBC was making a statement about its attitude in the new age of TV. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, perhaps because of its older, more traditional audience, caught 
considerable flak when its relatively new sitcoms "Love & War" and "Hearts 
Afire" premiered in 1992 with lead characters who had clearly sexy 
relationships before much of a basis was established for these relationships. 
The lead couple in "Hearts Afire," played by John Ritter and Markie Post, 
eventually got married. 
</P>
<P>
 Other popular series, from "Seinfeld" to "Roseanne," have dealt openly with 
sexually oriented subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 But viewers may well be scrutinizing some of the fall's new, early hour sexual 
goings-on with a more critical eye amid concern over births among young, 
unmarried women. Just this month, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna 
Shalala, testifying before a congressional committee, also criticized Murphy 
Brown for having a baby out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
 More significant in the long term, it will be instructive to see whether the 
characters and role models who appear on TV series -- especially at hours when 
younger viewers make up much of the audience -- are altered creatively in the 
face of the fact that roughly 30% of today's children are born to unwed 
mothers, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an issue that goes well beyond Murphy Brown because numerous TV series, 
including some new ones, must come face-to-face with how to respond in a 
business that tramples over significant matters in the name of ratings.

A VISIT WITH FIRST COUPLE OF VIDEO ART; STEINA AND WOODY VASULKA HAVE DIVERSE 
TAKES ON POWER AT LACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If your idea of video art is pulling up a chair to watch moving pictures on a 
single monitor, you may not be ready for the work of Steina and Woody Vasulka. 
In their installations -- which opened Thursday night at Los Angeles 
Contemporary Exhibitions' new space in Hollywood -- Steina invites visitors to 
stroll around images of Icelandic seascapes projected on translucent screens, 
while Woody asks his audience to tap on a drum and speak into a microphone in 
an interactive work about violence and the military-industrial complex. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this will surprise the Vasulkas' fans, however. The emigre couple -- 
Steina is a native of Iceland and Woody was born in Czechoslovakia -- have been 
at the forefront of video art for 25 years. They met as students in Prague, 
emigrated in 1965 to the United States and in 1971 founded the Kitchen, an 
alternative exhibition and media arts center in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first became involved in video, we worked in collaboration because 
the medium was so complicated," Steina says. Now the Vasulkas serve each other 
as assistants and critics, but they have long since developed individual bodies 
of work. 
</P>
<P>
 In their show at LACE, the artists pursue entirely different themes in 
separate spaces. Steina's piece, "Borealis," is an environment of illuminated 
imagery that portrays nature as an all-powerful force. Pictures appear on both 
sides of 6-by-4 1/2-foot screens, so that viewers are surrounded by vast images 
of crashing waves, undulating seas and craggy cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope people flip out because it's so beautiful," Steina says. "I want 
people to see and feel what I experience when I make something like this. 
That's all an artist can ask." 
</P>
<P>
 What Steina experienced while creating "Borealis" was a return to her roots. 
"Nature is a heavy trip in Iceland," she says. "You have to be very careful or 
you die." As a child she accepted nature's overwhelming presence as normal. 
"But when I went to Europe I found a world that was incredibly benign, with 
blue skies everywhere," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving to New York turned her into an urban artist, further estranged from 
nature. But visits to her homeland sparked an intense awareness of her native 
environment and inspired her to use landscape as a theme. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Woody moved to Santa Fe, N.M., in 1980. "I was determined not to get 
seduced by nature," Steina says. "That lasted about a year. Nature got the best 
of me and I'm quite happy about it. I'm not urban anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 She taped the footage for "Borealis" in 1993. Trying to convey the magnitude 
and force of nature, she shot mountains and grand vistas, but decided to use 
close-ups to convey her feelings about human vulnerability and nature's power. 
"You can't compete with God," she says. "He has done it all, and he has done it 
much better." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, she professes that the point of art is "to really see God." It's 
a quaint, old-fashioned notion, completely out of sync with the art world's 
fixation on politics, Steina says, but no matter. "My interest in video is not 
the art world's interest in video," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 In striking contrast to Steina's concern with superhuman forces, Woody 
explores man-made power as he considers the specter of warfare and violent 
behavior. Where her work portrays organic forms, Woody's deals with hard-edged 
mechanical devices and images of cast-off military equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 His exhibition, "Brotherhood, Table III," is the third portion of an ongoing 
project, which will consist of six tables largely constructed of surplus 
materials from the atomic energy facility in Los Alamos, N.M. The metal table 
on view at LACE is made of a computer that was developed to set off bombs in 
Cambodia and Vietnam. A slide projector encased in the table projects images of 
Los Alamos detritus, such as circuit boards and hardware. These vaguely 
threatening pictures are relayed onto mirrors attached to the table and out 
into the room, on a group of free-standing and suspended screens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to evoke the dilemma of using a killing machine," Woody says. But 
getting the message depends upon viewers' recognition and interpretation of the 
work's components and ambience. More inclined to pose questions than deliver 
judgments, Woody speaks of his work in terms of dialogues and philosophical 
conundrums, while allowing for a degree of ambiguity. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme isn't the only complicated aspect of his work. In "Table III" he has 
constructed a multimedia apparatus that allows visitors to participate in 
directing how the images are conveyed. This is an outgrowth of his longstanding 
effort to subvert what he calls "the absolute idea of a single frame," which is 
fundamental to film and video. He bombards viewers with images, in both 
enclosed and expansive spaces, enticing them to move around the installation. 
Those who strike an electronic drum or speak into a microphone will find that 
their action affects the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Woody prefers revelations to prescribed experiences in his art, but this 
presents another dilemma, he says. Interactivity -- which is all the rage in 
the commercial world of electronic products -- allows outside players to 
replace artists as authors or at least to obscure the artists' identity. That 
may be a logical conclusion of modernism, which was bent on destroying 
authorship, he says, but it's a question he continues to ponder. 
</P>

ROOTING OUT A CULTURAL HYBRID; AS A DUO, A BRAZILIAN PIANIST AND A COLOMBIAN 
SAXOPHONIST-FLUTIST REVEAL THEIR HERITAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It no longer is fashionable to refer to the United States as a "melting pot," 
as dozens of ethnic and national groups struggle to maintain their identities. 
But the image still may be apt when one considers the stew of influences 
simmering inside the Southern California music scene. 
</P>
<P>
 On almost any given night, club hoppers can find Brazilians blending their 
rhythmic heritage with that of fellow South Americans from Argentina and 
Venezuela as well as with black be-boppers, all intent on the next hip thing. 
</P>
<P>
 A black Mexican bassist fronts a band with a saxophonist from Colombia and a 
keyboard player from Cleveland. Percussion instruments from all over South and 
Central America clutter a stage where musicians of Cuban, Peruvian and European 
ancestry, Americans all, combine funk, jazz and folkloric sounds in sessions 
that that know no boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a range of hybrids combining traditions and styles generated in 
myriad places and periods. Witness the effect that Brazilian dance rhythms, 
developed in the 1920s, had on American jazz in the '60s, or the influence that 
historic rhythmic forms from Mexico have had on today's urban pop. 
</P>
<P>
 Few collaborations reveal as much about this mixing of styles and traditions 
as that of Brazilian pianist Marcos Ariel and Colombian saxophonist-flutist 
Justo Almario. When they work as a duo, as they will tonight at the San Juan 
Capistrano Regional Library, they bare their personal and cultural heritages in 
a way that's not as easily visible in larger ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your roots never leave you," says Almario, who started playing percussion as 
a child in Colombia, then switched to saxophone at age 14 after hearing a 
Julian (Cannonball) Adderley recording. "I've been influenced by the great 
saxophonists from America, but I've still got my Caribbean-Andean roots." 
</P>
<P>
 Ariel, who moved to the United States in 1988 after encouragement from 
Brazilian guitarist Ricardo Silvera, puts it in a slightly different way: "Even 
after living in another country, you keep the things that you studied and 
learned in your native country -- even the way you walk and breathe -- but you 
assimilate to your new home in a natural way. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my case, I started to add more jazz to my playing after coming here. If I 
move to Africa one day, I'll take that with me, (as well as) my Brazilian 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Both men have roots that are widely planted. Ariel studied classical piano 
between the ages of 9 and 17 in his native Rio de Janeiro, but his first 
professional gigs involved playing flute in chorinho bands. After a short stint 
in the Brazilian army, he focused entirely on piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Almario, the son of a percussionist, moved to Boston to attend the Berklee 
School of Music in the late '60s, then went on to play with Afro-Cuban 
percussionist Mongo Santamaria (Almario later became director of Santamaria's 
group) as well as in the orchestras of Tito Puente, famed Cuban bandleader 
Machito and jazz saxophonist Frank Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 Almario and Ariel discovered each other one night in North Hollywood. Ariel 
"came to hear me play at the Baked Potato," Almario recalls, "and sat in with 
the group. He was playing a part all by himself, no drums, no bass, and I just 
jumped in and began playing with him. We began talking about playing duets, and 
it came to pass that we recorded that way." 
</P>
<P>
 That disc, "Rhapsody in Rio," featured the two matching skills in a widely 
varied program of jazz and Brazilian-influenced music. Almario also played on 
Ariel's last album, "Hand Dance," while Ariel appeared on Almario's most recent 
recording, "Heritage." 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Marcos' playing," Almario enthuses. "He captures the essence of 
Brazilian bossa novas and sambas, but he also goes deep into other Brazilian 
forms: the choro and the baiao. He works from deep inside the country and can 
capture the true folk sound. But he also has this wonderful classical feel. And 
he can play jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 Almario's Colombia also is represented in their repertoire. "We do a 
traditional Colombian form called pasillo on my song 'Alla Viva.' It is played 
in both 6/8 and 3/4 time and is very lively. Another of my tunes, 'Again,' also 
borrows from that form. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justo is one of the most complete saxophonists around," Ariel says of his 
partner. "No matter which instrument he plays, he gets his own sound. You 
always know that it's him. And he plays the flute exactly the way I'd want to 
play it if I were still playing it today." 
</P>
<P>
 Both say that combining their skills and backgrounds will only make their 
music better. "Bringing different kinds of music together extends its reach," 
Almario says. "Music has so much feeling, no matter what kind, and combining 
our roots only makes this feeling deeper." 
</P>
<P>
 Though they have done most of their work in and around Los Angeles, they think 
there are places where new hybrids are better appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 Almario says he "went to Lima earlier this year with (bassist) John Patitucci, 
(percussionist) Alex Acuna and (flutist) Dave Valentin and then to Puerto Rico 
with Acuna and Ricardo Silvera and (bassist) Abraham Laboriel. Then (Laboriel 
and I) went to Germany, Norway and Sweden. None of those people would let us 
off the stage. The thing we do with Latin music from South America and jazz is 
really popular there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is another story. There's so many things happening here that 
people are distracted. They treat concerts like a picnic here; they use it as 
background." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he adds, that's not the case at the San Juan Capistrano Regional Library, 
where he and Ariel have played before. "It's the best," Ariel agrees. "People 
are there for the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing duets is especially challenging, Ariel says. "I really have to be in 
shape to play that way. (In a duo) the piano takes the place of the bass and 
the rest of the rhythm section, but you also have to keep in mind the chords 
and the harmonies. With a band, it's less exercise." 
</P>
<P>
 "We put together all the things that have touched us," Almario says. "And then 
we make them our own. The sound we get, often it's very technical, but more 
than that. Our coming together makes for something very soulful and very 
expressive, something that speaks of our hearts." 
</P>
<P>
 * Justo Almario and Marcos Ariel play tonight at 7 and 9 at the San Juan 
Capistrano Regional Library, 31495 El Camino Real, San Juan Capistrano. $3.

AGE IS NO IMPEDIMENT TO SINGING HERSELF SILLY; KID STUFF: JOANIE BARTELS, WHO 
SINGS AT WILD RIVERS ON SUNDAY, APPEALS TO CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS WITH A 
MIX OF ROCK OLDIES AND ORIGINAL FUNNY TUNES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Joanie Bartels recorded her first children's album in a garage in 1985, 
she was not expecting children's music to become her full-time career. Nine 
years later, she is near the top of the field, with a gold record to her 
credit, 2.5 million of her numerous recordings sold, a home video series and 
plans for a TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of Bartels -- and of her label, Discovery Music, the Van 
Nuys-based independent that skillfully and shrewdly developed the singer -- 
attracted the attention last year of entertainment giant BMG, which is 
absorbing Discovery and its artists into its children's wing, BMG Kidz. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, between audio and video recordings, Bartels, assured and youthful 
at 41, regularly crisscrosses the country to perform. She'll be at Wild Rivers 
in Laguna Hills on Sunday at 2 p.m.; she says parents and children should come 
prepared to "really let their hair down and have fun with a lot of dancing, 
silliness and sing-along stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles resident whose background is in adult rock 'n' roll and jazz, 
she makes intergenerational participation easy. She mixes musical styles, 
though rock oldies and original humorous pop-style songs predominate, from such 
'50s and '60s classics as "La Bamba" and "Bare Footin' " to her own catchy 
ditties about "Silly Pie" and be-bopping Martians and dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's music can be cloying in repeated doses, but Bartels has staying 
power with polished, easy vocals notable for their mellow clarity. Her obvious 
career savvy is partnered by a disarming enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of it is that I'm still kind of a kid myself," she said recently. "I can 
get out there and still be goofy and silly and play." 
</P>
<P>
 She is especially enthusiastic about her new "Simply Magic" videos. The first 
two in the series, "The Rainy Day Adventure" and "The Extra-Special Substitute 
Teacher," have given her a chance to show off her acting skills in a story 
format. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're hoping to do next is a pilot for a children's TV show, 'Joanie's 
Juke Box Cafe,' " a sitcom with music based on aher new audio series. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartels began her career singing folk music in Massachusetts coffeehouses. 
That led to regular gigs with rock and jazz bands and studio work as a backup 
singer. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Ellen Wohlstadter, a young mother and head of production at RSO 
records, called Bartels with an idea for a lullaby album, the first in what 
would become Discovery Music's "Magic Series" of themed audio recordings 
(bedtime, bath time, travel time) for parents, infants and toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartels, one of many who auditioned, got the job thanks to her "incredible 
voice" and her sincere interest in the project, according to co-producer David 
Wohlstadter, Ellen's husband. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bartels, the rewards were unexpected. "What I had been doing was great, 
but none of it compares to what I'm doing now. It's a much healthier lifestyle, 
much more positive." 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't start out with star billing. Initially, the recordings weren't even 
marketed in her name because "no one knew who Joanie was," David recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen "pounded the pavement" and successfully placed "Lullaby Magic" on 
consignment in Westside and Valley specialty and juvenile stores as an impulse 
buy during the 1985 Christmas season. "That's the point we knew we had found a 
niche and started exploiting it," David said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later, as more and more people seeking recordings began asking for 
Bartels by name, "we started switching the direction of the marketing, toward 
developing Joanie as a children's artist." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, competition in the field was growing, and such major labels as A&M 
began signing artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Raffi who put children's music on the map," Bartels said, "so that it 
wasn't just a $2.99 album you picked up at Kmart. He really started working 
with children and child development through music; he opened the door for a lot 
of artists on the national level." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Discovery's years of focus, patience and grass-roots marketing on 
behalf of a concept and a single artist still are a phenomenon in the 
hit-driven recording industry, which has signed artists and then dropped them 
when immediate results weren't forthcoming. Discovery has maintained its 
formula, using it to develop two other artists, Dennis Hysom and Bethie. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the label and its artists are being absorbed by BMG, Wohlstadter says 
he and his wife will be "exploring new opportunities in the children's 
entertainment field. . . . We're out pitching TV shows for (Bartels, Hysom and 
Bethie) to cable, network, syndication and PBS." 
</P>
<P>
 Singing is Bartels' first love, though. "My mom told me that when I was about 
3," she said, "I saw Rosemary Clooney, probably on the Mitch Miller show or on 
'Ed Sullivan.' She said from that I was just transformed, and I said I wanted 
to sing like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure part of it was that she looked like an angel with her blond, blond 
hair that probably, on our black-and-white TV set, looked like it was glowing." 
</P>
<P>
 * Joanie Bartels sings Sunday at 2 p.m. at Wild Rivers, 8770 Irvine Center 
Drive, Laguna Hills, as part of the KCAL Fun Fest, a health and safety expo 
that will run from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and that also will feature children's 
singer Dan Crow. Free with regular park admission, $12.95 to $16.95. (213)

 Anchor Judy Woodruff is the host of Sunday's "Gender Wars" on CNN, which 
explores women's struggle to end unfair sexual discrimination, which has passed 
through the '90s prism and emerged as a source of new excess and abuse, at 9 
p.m. The program repeats at midnight.

 Sunday's "This Week With David Brinkley" on ABC pitches the baseball strike

 Jail expansion -- A story Friday erroneously reported what could be demolished 
as part of an expansion plan for Theo Lacy Branch Jail in Orange. The county's 
24-bed Intermediate Care Facility for troubled children could be demolished, 
officials said, but not the adjacent Orangewood Children's Home.

SOLIS RETURNS TO THE SCENE OF '93 SLUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A year ago at Del Mar, Alex Solis won only 15 races, on 8% of his mounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis got a new agent -- Harry Hacek -- a confidant -- Fernando Toro -- and 
now he has a new life as a jockey. His numbers since last year's Del Mar 
meeting: 04,16,06,07,06 Track Wins Win % Pos. Oak Tree 24 13 4th Hollywood Park 
28 19 1st Santa Anita 68 16 4th Hollywood Park 78 19 1st Since 1981, Chris 
McCarron, Gary Stevens, Laffit Pincay, Kent Desormeaux, Pat Valenzuela and 
Eddie Delahoussaye had monopolized riding titles, winning all but four of the 
67 that have been available. The interlopers have been Aaron Gryder, who as an 
apprentice won Hollywood Park's short meeting in 1987, and Solis, who won a 
Santa Anita winter title in 1992 before his two recent championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis wasn't going to quit the game or return to Florida, as had been rumored 
after his dismal Del Mar showing last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a very sad meet," Solis, 30, said the other day. "It got to the 
point where week after week, nothing was going right. I was scared. I was 
riding so bad that I couldn't see what to do different. I forgot how much fun 
riding had been. I got very sour." 
</P>
<P>
 For solace, Solis sought out Toro, who won more than 3,500 races. Solis 
arrived in California from Florida in 1985, and the Panamanian newcomer and the 
Chilean veteran became close before Toro retired in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Toro remembers having dinner with Solis last fall, not long after the Del Mar 
season ended. "Alex was very depressed," Toro said. "But he was very honest 
with himself. He was willing to face the facts that he was doing some things 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Toro collected a batch of Solis' race tapes and began analyzing them. "He was 
trying too hard," Toro said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two began jogging together in the mornings, not far from Santa Anita. 
"Just keep working hard," Toro told Solis. "No matter what happens, you'll turn 
this thing around." 
</P>
<P>
 These therapy sessions might have been good for Solis, but they were wearing 
Toro down. "I was getting too sore," Toro said. "I finally told Alex that we 
better start walking while we talked, instead of running." 
</P>
<P>
 Trainers who had entrusted some of their best horses to Solis -- Mel Stute, 
Ron McAnally and Bruce Headley -- didn't quit on him. By the end of the year, 
Solis had sufficiently shaken off the Del Mar doldrums to total $6.2 million in 
purses, 14th nationally. He is at about $4.4 million this year, in ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hot jocks and cold jocks run in cycles," Stute said. "One of the reasons Alex 
might not have been doing much at Del Mar last year was that my barn wasn't 
winning much, either." 
</P>
<P>
 When Stute was training Snow Chief, four other jockeys weren't available to 
ride the inexperienced colt, so Solis got the job. In 1986, Solis rode Snow 
Chief to victory in the Preakness, the Florida Derby, the Santa Anita Derby and 
the Jersey Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alex is one of the strongest finishers there is on a horse," Stute said. 
"From the eighth pole home, I can't think of another jockey I'd rather have 
riding for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Toro says Solis does all right early in a race too. "He has a good sense of 
pace," Toro said. "He works a lot of horses in the mornings, that's why he's so 
good with pace." 
</P>
<P>
 From Toro, Solis was able to regain his confidence. From his standby trainers, 
he got hope. And Hacek got him the horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harry's a great agent, and Fernando laid it out so clearly for me," Solis 
said. "I always knew what I could do. I think I've got great communication with 
horses, but it was Fernando who got my head together. I still want to learn 
every day, I want to keep improving and I'm happy as long as I'm giving 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 Solis didn't win Wednesday, Del Mar's opening day, then in Thursday's third 
race, he suffered a hip injury in a two-horse spill. A second set of X-rays 
showed what was believed to be an old bone chip in his right hip, and Solis 
didn't ride Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But he will be back, maybe today. Del Mar doesn't scare him anymore. Horse 
Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron, who has sat out the last two days after suffering an ankle 
injury in a gate incident on opening day, is scheduled to ride two morning-line 
favorites in today's stakes. McCarron has the assignments on Kingdom Found, 
even money in the San Diego Handicap, and Work The Crowd, 5-2 in the San 
Clemente Handicap. McCarron will work some horses this morning before 
determining whether to resume riding. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Stevens is off to a hot start with nine winners in three days, but he is 
being slowed by the stewards, who have handed him a five-day suspension for his 
role in an incident that led to a two-horse spill Thursday. The ban begins 
Monday. . . . Memo is the highweight at 121 pounds for Sunday's $100,000 Bing 
Crosby Handicap. Also entered are Thirty Slews, Trouble Onthe Line, Gundaghia, 
Soviet Problem, Slerp, Bahatur, Codified, J.F. Williams, Phone Roberto and 
King's Blade. 
</P>
<P>
 Sea Hero, who won the 1993 Kentucky Derby and Travers, and Tabasco Cat, a top 
contender for 3-year-old of the year, are expected to be in action at Saratoga 
during the weekend. Sea Hero will make his third start on the grass this year 
when he meets 13 rivals in the 1 1/2-mile Sword Dancer Handicap today. Tabasco 
Cat, winner of the Preakness and Belmont, is set to contest the 1 1/8-mile Jim 
Dandy on Sunday. Entries for the race for 3-year-olds were scheduled today.
