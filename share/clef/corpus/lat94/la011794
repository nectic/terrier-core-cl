COLUMN ONE; THE COLD WORLD OF SKATING; PRESSURES TO CASH IN CAN PUSH SOME YOUNG 
HOPEFULS OVER THE LINE. JEALOUSIES, BITTER RIVALRIES AND SABOTAGE SOMETIMES 
TARNISH THE SPORT'S ELEGANT IMAGE.

<P>
 The shocking attack on ice skater Nancy Kerrigan -- and the growing belief 
that it somehow involved the camp of rival Tonya Harding -- have tattered the 
carefully tailored image of women's figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
 But to those who spend time in the chilly corners of neighborhood rinks where 
girls and their parents begin to dream of Olympic gold, it is no revelation 
that the figure skating world is not all sugar and spice on ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Janice Thomas, whose daughter Debi won a bronze medal for the United 
States at the 1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not easy rising before dawn to drive miles up the freeway so Debi could 
train for hours before school. Then there were the staggering costs for 
lessons, equipment and travel. At $25,000 a year, it was a crushing load for a 
parent, especially a working, single mother with a mortgage to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 But what really bothered Thomas about the sport her daughter came to star in 
were the nasty, uncontrollable aspects: the jealousies, bitter rivalries and 
petty acts of sabotage by resentful competitors and their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deb's boots (skates) turned up missing from time to time, and once I tracked 
it down to another girl at our rink," recalled Janice Thomas. "She said she had 
picked them up by mistake, but how could that be? Deb's name and phone number 
were written right inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches, skaters and their parents say that behind the sequined outfits and 
radiant smiles, women's figure skating can be a cutthroat sport, one not nearly 
so innocent as television portrays. 
</P>
<P>
 Stealing and tampering with skates -- an item more personalized than a 
golfer's putter -- is just one way to sideline an opponent. Putting super glue 
on the guards skaters use to protect their blades is another dirty trick, one 
coach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some skaters, including Debi Thomas, have discovered their music tapes vital 
to competition stolen or snipped with scissors. On the ice, skaters may fail to 
yield the right of way during warm-up sessions or attempt to break a rival's 
concentration when she is attempting a difficult jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumor-spreading and gossip are more common, seen as ways to unsettle a nervous 
competitor. Some skaters also try to curry favor with judges in one of the 
world's most subjective sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents are sometimes the instigators. Like Hollywood stage mothers or Little 
League fathers, they often have unrealistic expectations and may push their 
children to attempt stunts they cannot perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Some go further. At Lake Arrowhead's renowned International Ice Castles 
Training Center, the proprietor recently warned a parent who had urged his 
child to trip another skater. Barbara Roles-Williams, a 1960 Olympic bronze 
medalist from Arcadia and now a coach, recalled one mother at a Newport Beach 
rink who stood at the rail and cast hexes on her daughter's competitors. 
Another Newport Beach mother got a tongue-lashing from Roles-Williams when she 
wished aloud that her child's rival would hurt her leg. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But such behavior, insist Roles-Williams and others, is more the exception 
than the norm. All sports have their bad apples, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly there are these minor types of incidents in figure skating, but 
it's a great sport, good for your body, good for your mind," Roles-Williams 
said. "And I hope no one concludes otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, said Claire Ferguson, president of the Colorado-based U.S. Figure 
Skating Assn., "we are not a group of perfect people. Skating is not some sort 
of fantasy world, and we are not a bunch of windup Barbie and Ken dolls." 
</P>
<P>
 This may come as a surprise to those who become mesmerized by the sport each 
time the Winter Olympics rolls around. The network television image of female 
skaters as elegant goddesses suggests a sorority of girls who have just stepped 
off the top of a wedding cake -- sexy, perhaps, but certainly unsoiled by sweat 
and the seamy side of life. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, the young skater's world is a grueling one. Long hours of practice 
deny the girls a typical social life and cut into every other part of growing 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport's intense physical demands -- especially the jumps, which get more 
daring each year -- require thin, perfectly fit bodies, which can mean 
constant, obsessive dieting. Lisa Carey of Woodland Hills, a U.S. junior pairs 
champion in the 1970s, recalls coaches who would force the heavier girls onto 
the scales in public to shame them into losing more pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Striving to match the ice princess look that skating judges -- and the public 
-- have shown they like, girls will go to whatever lengths their wallets and 
parents allow. Nose jobs are common, as is teeth polishing for a sparkling 
smile. At this year's national championships in Detroit, hip-thinning 
liposuction emerged as the skater's newest cosmetic weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Driving all of this, veterans of the sport say, are its high stakes and the 
slim chances of cashing in. Unlike many team sports, which provide numerous 
slots for the talented to fill, skating offers its true crown to only one, the 
Olympic gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many runners-up can earn a living as coaches or skaters in traveling 
ice shows, only the Olympic champion cashes in big-time, winning enduring fame, 
endorsements and other perks that can mean millions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Nancy Kerrigan wins the Olympic gold medal in Lillehammer, she will have 
gigantic, seven-figure earnings for four years until our next queen," said 
Michael Rosenberg, an agent who represents 36 prominent skaters. In the two 
years since she won the gold for the U.S. at Albertville, France, Kristi 
Yamaguchi has earned about $2.5 million, agents and other skating insiders say. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a dramatic change from decades past, said Carol Heiss Jenkins, a 1960 
Olympic champion now coaching in Ohio. "In my day, you competed to see who was 
the best of that time, to have someone designate you as the best. We didn't 
expect anything else to come out of it. I was on the news, Harry Reasoner 
interviewed me, that was about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although today's adolescent girls may not be propelled by the temptation of 
fame and a fat bank account, some of their parents are. Keeping a child in 
competitive figure skating can easily run $30,000 a year, experts said. 
Yamaguchi's father, Jim, once likened the experience to "sending Kristi to 
Stanford or Harvard for . . . 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Forced to work two jobs, mortgage their homes, spend hours at the rink and 
make other sacrifices to keep their daughters on ice, some parents hope for a 
pay-back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's big money, big contracts and big agents today, and some parents talk to 
their kids about this when they're young," said Roles-Williams, who now coaches 
in Torrance. "They think it motivates them, but in reality it's a (burden) over 
their heads. They feel they have to keep going, that they have to live up to 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many girls hold up fine and even flourish under the pressure. Captives of a 
rigorous training regimen, they develop discipline, self-confidence, courage 
and goal-setting skills that help them greatly in life. Moreover, some skaters 
say their sport forces them to cope with low scores, painful tumbles and other 
crushing disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough sport, and when you don't win, your self-esteem takes a dive 
because it's seven people telling you that you didn't measure up," said Yvonne 
Gomez, who skated for Spain in the 1988 Olympics but grew up and trained in the 
San Francisco Bay Area. "Despite that and the hard work, I loved skating, and 
it has really benefited me in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Zeckman, a former competitive skater from Chicago, agreed: "I had to learn 
how to lose and deal with it. That's what I do now in real life. I stumble, get 
up again, get over the disappointment and just go on." 
</P>
<P>
 For some skaters, things do not work out that way. The "pressure-cooker" of 
the skating world is simply too much, Zeckman says, and "somehow it all goes 
haywire." 
</P>
<P>
 The demands of weight reduction drive some to diet pills or eating disorders. 
Others cannot handle the stress of performing, or want to quit but are racked 
with guilt over their parents' considerable investment of time and money in the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Some turn to therapy for help. Even Kerrigan -- the picture of poise when she 
faced TV cameras after her attack last week -- began began seeing a sports 
psychologist when she was having troubles with falls several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as the San Fernando Valley's Tiffany Chin, drop out, cutting 
their emotional losses but perhaps not realizing their potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want my kid to be an ice skater. No way," Chin, a former U.S. 
champion, said shortly after she decided to skip the 1988 Olympics and turn pro 
at age 20. "I'd want my kid to grow, to go to college, to become a whole 
person. There's so many traps in skating. Once you're ensnared, you can never 
find your way out." Today, she teaches young figure skaters at the Iceoplex in 
North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some skaters attempt to have the best of both worlds, fighting to retain rich, 
well-rounded lives. Such renegades, however, risk criticism from coaches who 
fault them for lacking single-minded focus and true desire to succeed. Debi 
Thomas is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who grew up in San Jose, loved skating but loved many other things as 
well. She played the flute and trumpet, and enjoyed rock concerts and the 
opera. Determined to become a doctor from the age of 5, she realized that 
school was something that could not be missed. So, unlike many other skaters 
who take correspondence courses, she remained in school and graduated from 
Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
 "Debi was someone who needed and wanted balance in her life, and skated best 
when she had it," her mother said. But the skating world didn't like it. "They 
wanted total sacrifice," Janice Thomas said, "and the exclusion of everything 
else. It was very hard on Deb." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Debi Thomas managed to succeed. She now attends medical school at 
Northwestern University. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Glen Elliott, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at UC San 
Francisco, said the "isolative and solitary" nature of skating has its 
drawbacks. Unlike team sports, he said, "it's you working for hours a day 
perfecting your moves, and the only social involvement you get is when you're 
applauded or booed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Psychiatrically, one would assume that puts you in significant danger of 
assuming your worth is tied to your ability to get cheered on the ice and win 
the prize," Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another hazard of such intensive training, he said, is that "adolescence is 
the time when most children are trying to develop themselves as social beings. 
Instead, skaters are mostly developing themselves as superfine physical 
specimens." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the attack on Kerrigan, insiders say that nastiness and acts of 
sabotage are rare in the highest tiers of the skating world. There are 
exceptions, of course. Karin Doherty, a former German national champion who 
coaches in Las Vegas, recalled how one of her skaters, Richard Zander, had to 
withdraw from a major competition in Minnesota in 1989 after the blades of his 
skates were ruined with pliers. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the world championships in Paris one year, a famous American pairs team 
discovered just before competition time that their costumes had been cut into 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the hurtful stunts and ugly shenanigans seem to occur at lower 
levels of competition. Lisa Carey, the former pairs champion who is now public 
relations director for the Harlem Globetrotters, remembered the tensions she 
experienced in Burbank's Pickwick Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would get in your way on purpose so that you couldn't practice a 
jump," Carey recalled. "They would try to make it as difficult as possible for 
you to get quality time on the ice. You'd get mad, but it never came to blows. 
You'd make faces at each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The most troubling episodes, skaters say, are the instances of theft and 
tampering of skates. Coaches order their students to keep their equipment with 
them at all times; some even have beeper alarms on their bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychological torment is another tactic sometimes used to try to psyche out 
the opposition. Rudy Galindo, who was Yamaguchi's pairs partner when the two 
were national champions in 1989 and 1990, recalls how a rival's mother 
ridiculed him and his mother, who is overweight. It was painful, until one day 
when his mother solved the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The woman was laughing at us, telling us we were pathetic, and suddenly my 
mom just charged her and tackled her," Galindo said, recalling the 1987 
incident with a laugh. "My mom won that one and they left us alone after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany Chin and her family also lived through a strong dose of psychological 
abuse. When Chin was a youngster training in San Diego, parents of other 
skaters spread vicious rumors, suggesting, among other things, that her mother, 
Marjorie, beat her. The family also received hateful, unsigned letters and 
anonymous phone calls in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Though upset, Marjorie Chin seemed to accept the harassment as part of the 
skating game, a necessary evil: 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever's on top is going to be criticized," she once told The Times. "It 
wasn't unique. Many mothers in skating have to endure this." 
</P>

PEACE PLAN ELUSIVE AS COUNTY JAILS RACE WAR CONTINUES; VIOLENCE: MELEES BETWEEN 
BLACKS AND LATINOS ESCALATE. PITCHESS FACILITY IS AT THE FRONT LINE OF THE 
BATTLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The word passed quietly through the jailhouse, from visitors to inmates, then 
on to other inmates: The Mexican Mafia wanted its minions to "get the blacks" 
at 3:55 p.m. as they watched the Raiders playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the time came, Allen (Chivo) Gonzalez and his homeboys went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Far outnumbering the black inmates in their maximum-security dormitory at the 
Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho in Castaic, the Latinos swarmed toward them with 
homemade shank knives and broom handles, beating the blacks into a corner, 
where they fought for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack eight days ago, which involved about 1,000 inmates and injured 80, 
was unlike the hundreds of smaller spontaneous jail melees in the past. Those 
were largely sparked by fights over cigarettes or pay phones. This one was 
planned, authorities have confirmed, and the aggressors were organized. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard the word that we were supposed to jump them, so we let them have 
it," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a race war going down in the Los Angeles County jail system, and the 
Pitchess jail is the front line. It is a war that inmates, authorities and 
sociologists say is but one symptom of a black-versus-brown gang power struggle 
over drugs and turf that has reverberated through state prisons, the streets of 
Venice and other parts of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 And, inmates, deputies and sociologists say, it is a war that no one may be 
able to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The war has erupted in jail dormitories and court lockups, on buses and in 
jail workout rooms and cafeterias from Santa Monica to Pomona. But the largest 
conflict to date -- the largest in county jail history -- was the Jan. 9 melee 
at the Castaic jail's maximum-security North County Correctional Facility, 
where Gonzalez and other inmates began fighting as the Raiders clinched their 
victory over the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gonna happen again and again and again," said Gonzalez, who at 18 is 
headed to state prison for attempted murder and armed robbery. He turned to 
grin at his Latino cellmates as they flipped gang signs in Dormitory 611.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's just how it is," he said. "Now it's either them or you." 
</P>
<P>
 Once inclined to fight gangsters of their own race, blacks and Latinos are 
squaring off in the cramped confines of incarceration and lashing out at each 
other with unprecedented ferocity. Authorities are at their wit's end, trying 
to buy time with racial segregation, shows of force, discipline and lock-downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a tremendous problem here," said Cmdr. Robert J. Spierer, head of the 
Pitchess jail, located 39 miles north of Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Paul Myron, who oversees all jails for the Sheriff's Department, 
confirmed Friday that the department is investigating intelligence information 
that the riot was sparked by visitors affiliated with the Mexican Mafia, who 
passed on the directive to Latino inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack went off in two buildings at once -- instantly spreading from one 
50-man dorm to another. Overwhelmed deputies in riot gear tossed in "stingball" 
grenades, trying to regain order from outside the bars. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until eight hours later that the fighting at the mammoth jail 
facility ended. Twenty-four of the 80 injured inmates required hospital 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, fights have occurred daily at North County and the use of pay 
phones and other privileges has been halted "until they start acting like human 
beings again," Myron said. Visiting hours were canceled over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 A chilling foreshadowing of last week's violence came before Christmas, Myron 
said, when a member of the fearsome Black Guerrilla Family prison gang was 
viciously attacked by Mexican Mafia cohorts in the maximum-security Pelican Bay 
Prison in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "That, possibly, was the first signal that the attacks on blacks was 
beginning," Myron said. "They want to show that they can do what they want to 
do, and that one group is superior to another." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, deputies in riot gear prowled the sprawling Pitchess facility, 
randomly searching inmates and their bunk beds and common areas for homemade 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're quite ingenious," said Deputy Robert Harms, holding up deadly looking 
knives fashioned from plastic toothbrushes and metal shoe supports. "They find 
things we overlook." 
</P>
<P>
 Troublesome inmates are being sent elsewhere, mostly within the county jail 
system. Slowly, deputies are trying to re-integrate inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 But re-integration is exactly what many inmates do not want -- especially the 
African Americans, who are outnumbered nearly 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonzo Hicks, 42, was one of many black inmates who told Spierer that Latinos 
would cause more bloodshed if the races are not kept separate. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are arming themselves, and there is animosity," Hicks said. "I'm 
concerned about making it out of here alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez and other Latinos said they prefer to remain separated too, that they 
dislike blacks, and that they are just following orders to fight. They believe 
orders come from veterano gangsters, including the Mexican Mafia, to settle the 
latest killing or affront. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just what I heard," Gonzalez said. "We bomb on them, or we get bombed 
by our own if we don't take care of business. . . . You have to do it. You just 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 In an open letter last week, more than 50 black inmates said sheriff's 
deputies who patrol the jail are exacerbating the situation by forcing them to 
re-integrate, and baiting them with racial slurs. Written by inmate Clyde 
Hayes, the letter says: ". . . organized confusion, which is being fueled by 
the sheriffs . . . jeopardizes the lives of blacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes, like other inmates, said in an interview that the situation is 
superheated because sheriff's officials have long ignored the root causes of 
the racial tension, including overcrowding and dwindling programs to keep 
inmates busy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should be trying to establish lines of communication between the blacks, 
Latinos and the sheriff about why this is happening," said Hayes, 27. "But 
nobody is doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, somebody is gonna die," he said. "We're tired of playing these silly-ass 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 Greatly outnumbered, whites try to stay on the sidelines. "I'm terribly 
worried," said Igor Russo, 33, who in jail for failing to complete community 
service work. "I'm scared for my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Racially motivated fights and riots have been commonplace in the nation's 
largest county jail system for years; more than 400 inmates were injured in 57 
racially motivated melees last year, Spierer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, sheriff's officials attributed the violence to the power struggle 
that has evolved as jail demographics changed. Blacks used to control the 
jails, but by 1991 found themselves outnumbered by Latinos 40% to 37%. The 
disparity has grown ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the fighting escalating from sporadic scuffles to organized 
activity, the Sheriff's Department has enlisted the help of outsiders -- top 
black and Latino church leaders and, last week, the American Civil Liberties 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It asked the ACLU, which monitors jail conditions, to examine whether inmates 
could be segregated by race. ACLU leaders say they are seriously considering 
it, even though it would represent a major policy shift. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sat around . . . and nobody had an answer," Ramona Ripston, ACLU executive 
director for Southern California, said of last Tuesday's meeting with sheriff's 
officials. "Even if we were to agree that segregation was acceptable under 
these circumstances . . . what do they do when these inmates go on buses to 
court? What happens in the lockups in the courts and the holding cells? It is a 
terrible, terrible situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials have so far opposed segregation, which has been used only 
in a handful of U.S. jails or prisons. It is not prohibited by law, but 
authorities believe it may be not only unconstitutional, but impossible do.  
</P>
<P>
 "We live in an integrated society, and I think it sends the wrong message and 
says too much about our failure if we can't deal with this in an integrated 
setting," Spierer said. "We need to find a way to deal with it rather than 
throw our hands in the air and say we are giving up." 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates and other critics counter that the Sheriff's Department has long 
ignored festering problems that created such a tense atmosphere in which 
inmates are quick to rumble. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 sheriff's task force recommended a system of "progressive housing" that 
would reward inmates for good behavior with better living conditions. However, 
two years later, that system is just beginning to take shape, mainly because of 
tight budgets, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Some outside experts have called for inmate councils that can bring problems 
to jail officials. Myron says that idea was tried and discarded as ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts such as Ed Koren, of the National Prison Project in Washington, say 
the dorms such as those at Pitchess, which house as many as 130 inmates, are 
fertile ground for racial tensions and rioting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dorms, blacks and Latinos kill time side by side, and the smallest 
slight is seen by everyone. Locking down dorms only means cooping up the 
combatants together. That was clear Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Myron said most dorms at Pitchess were built before jail overcrowding set free 
all but the most violent criminals, who go to Pitchess to serve county jail 
sentences or to await trial or sentencing before heading off to state prison. 
Built to house 6,000 inmates, Pitchess holds 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the dorms and group barracks were not meant to house the accused 
murderers and other intractable offenders who reside there, Myron said, 
scrapping them for more manageable cells would be astronomically expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates have laughed at the suggestions of some programs, including racial 
sensitivity classes. Nevertheless, 1,700 more inmate beds in Lynwood are to 
come on line in the spring. Sheriff's officials say they are planning another 
safety measure: a moneyless jail credit system so inmates can buy foods and 
supplies, without fear of extortion from other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the county's jail inspection commission, which advises the Board of 
Supervisors, plans to meet Wednesday to discuss the scuffles and melees. 
</P>
<P>
 It has asked Sheriff Sherman Block to report on the situation and members also 
want to tour the facility "when it's safe," said Commissioner Jim Cragin. 
</P>
<P>
 And an internal investigation is under way into allegations that at least 
three deputies engaged in misconduct toward inmates during or after the Jan. 9 
riot that could have exacerbated the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 But some say that all the money in the world would not solve problems that 
sheriff's officials say come from the street and society. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Latinos want the power," the ACLU's Ripston said of the inmates. "And 
they are going to take it."

CHURCH THANKS AGENTS WHO THWARTED ATTACK

 Six months after federal agents thwarted a group of skinheads bent on 
assaulting Los Angeles' oldest black church, hundreds of congregants 
emotionally thanked those agents Sunday for, in the words of one church leader, 
"saving our women, our children, our aged, our men . . . for sleeping less that 
we might sleep in peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the First African Methodist Episcopal Church gave a standing 
ovation to the FBI agents, Los Angeles police officers and the federal 
prosecutor who oversaw the case against the skinheads. Congregants, some near 
tears, hugged the law enforcement officials who investigated the Fourth Reich 
Skinheads, a violent group of young racists who set out to bomb the church, 
strafe the congregation with gunfire and murder its pastor, the Rev. Cecil L. 
Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never, ever, ever will you find us ungrateful for those who give us life," 
Murray said from the pulpit Sunday as the five law enforcement officers 
gathered before the congregation. "Thank you to these agents, who delivered us 
from death, destruction and mayhem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The service came as First AME and churches across the nation marked the 65th 
anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birth -- the anniversary was 
Saturday although the holiday marking the occasion is today -- and federal 
agents and members of First AME Church noted the irony of simultaneously 
honoring King and the FBI. While King was alive, he and his aides were 
wiretapped and zealously investigated by the FBI under its then-director, J. 
Edgar Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least in Los Angeles, the skinhead case and the FBI's investigation of 
the police officers who beat Rodney G. King have thawed the relationship 
between the FBI and many in the African American community. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie J. Parsons, special agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles office, 
said he has been gratified by the warm reception. On Sunday, Murray praised 
Parsons and his agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you, Charlie Parsons, thank you, FBI," said Murray, who plans to speak 
to FBI agents here next month as part of Black History Month. "They told us 
about the plot, and God told them." 
</P>
<P>
 Julius Butler, chairman of First AME, said many church members share those 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gratitude is very deep," Butler said. "It has given us the beginnings of 
a new relationship with the current administration of the FBI." 
</P>
<P>
 Glenice Como, a member of the church, agreed. "We were in shock when we first 
heard about this. . . . We owe these agents everything. We owe them our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons was in the congregation Sunday, and he said he pondered the evolving 
relationship between the bureau and the African American community as he 
listened to the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, he conceded that there have been times when the FBI and civil 
rights leaders have been at odds, but he expressed hope that those days have 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a new FBI," Parsons said after the service. "I think the African 
American community appreciates that. . . . As Reverend Murray said, we are 
focused on the future, not on the past." 
</P>
<P>
 An FBI agent and an informant spent almost two years undercover investigating 
the activities of Southern California white supremacists. But it was only in 
April that their investigation brought them into contact with the Fourth Reich 
Skinheads. 
</P>
<P>
 After the informant left a message on a hot line espousing racist 
philosophies, he got a call back from a young man named Christopher David 
Fisher. Fisher told the informant that he led a group of skinheads, and the two 
agreed to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the coming months, Fisher and other members of his group would meet time 
and again with the informant and agent, who posed as representatives of a white 
supremacist organization known as the Church of the Creator. Unbeknown to the 
skinheads, many of the meetings were captured on video or audiotapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Transcripts of those tapes show that the skinheads discussed killing a number 
of prominent blacks, for a time debating the merits of assassinating Rodney G. 
King. They devoted their most concentrated efforts, however, to attacking the 
First AME Church. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 11, 1993, Fisher and Carl Daniel Boese, another member of the group, 
briefed the Fourth Reich Skinheads on their plans. They discussed dividing up 
responsibilities -- some of the attackers were to monitor police scanners or 
drive getaway cars, while others would lob pipe bombs and open fire on Murray 
and the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 As Boese described it, the skinheads would wait until Murray was "preaching 
about how the Bible says justice will be done, and just about when he's saying 
that, justice will be done by a couple of Aryan brothers who are . . . busting 
open the doors, popping off." 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents and Marc R. Greenberg, the assistant U.S. attorney who was 
coordinating prosecution of the case, were concerned enough about the 
skinheads' threats that Parsons briefed Murray about the case. Murray was asked 
to keep quiet, and Parsons pledged that if the agents believed that they were 
losing the ability to stop the skinheads from carrying out their threat, 
investigators would act. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 15, with the skinheads plotting to begin a campaign against Orange 
County rabbis and Jewish leaders, agents from the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms and officers from the Los Angeles Police Department moved 
in. They arrested Fisher, Boese and a third member of the skinhead group. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher and Boese pleaded guilty to conspiracy to bomb the church and other 
offenses. They were sentenced last week to prison terms -- Fisher to more than 
eight years and Boese to just under five. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Greenberg oversaw the criminal case for the government, he also 
spearheaded an effort to counsel Fisher, Boese and the other Fourth Reich 
Skinheads -- a program he dubbed "Operation Grow Hair." A number of local 
organizations participated, including First AME Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Operation Grow Hair allowed more than a dozen skinheads to visit 
the County Jail, meet with a federal judge, listen to two Holocaust survivors, 
share views with other young people and, for the first time, meet Murray and 
other leaders of First AME Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Some skinheads continued to boast of their racism at the end of those 
sessions, but Fisher wrote to U.S. District Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr. to 
say that the counseling had moved him profoundly. Another skinhead wrote to 
Greenberg, saying that he was now determined to stay out of trouble and to get 
a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Church leaders paid a special nod to that counseling effort Sunday. The church 
awarded plaques to each of the agents and officers, thanking them individually 
for protecting lives. "You have given us tomorrow," the plaques read. 
</P>
<P>
 In their award to Greenberg, the church leaders recognized his management of 
the criminal case. But they also paid tribute to his groundbreaking attempt to 
"change the negative into the positive." 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes you feel good about what you do," Greenberg said afterward. "It 
makes you feel like you did something worthwhile."

YELTSIN CZAR FOR ECONOMIC REFORM QUITS; RUSSIA: DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER GAIDAR 
CITES FRUSTRATION OVER NOT HAVING THE POWER TO CARRY OUT HIS REFORMS. SOME SEE 
HIS MOVE AS A MANEUVER TO BE GIVEN MORE MUSCLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Yegor T. Gaidar, the brain behind Russia's economic reforms, announced Sunday 
that he is quitting the government, citing the tremendous frustration of being 
blamed for decisions that he could not control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot serve in the government and at the same time be in opposition to 
it," Gaidar said in a letter to President Boris N. Yeltsin. "I cannot be 
responsible for reforms without having . . . the necessary levers to carry out 
the economic policy in which I believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaidar, the portly, 37-year-old economist who launched Russia's reforms in 
late 1991 and has done the most to push them forward, has become a symbol of 
Russia's move from a Communist economy toward a market-driven system. His 
resignation is likely to worry both financial circles and the Western powers 
backing the transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin is expected to discuss the resignation with Prime Minister Viktor S. 
Chernomyrdin today, and a spokesman said the Russian president might not accept 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some politicians called it an ultimatum meant to persuade Yeltsin to give 
Gaidar more power. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ella Pamfilova, the social protection minister who added her resignation 
to Gaidar's, said: "This is not an ultimatum. This is an act of despair, 
including by me." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaidar himself, in a television interview and his letter to Yeltsin, did not 
appear to be merely posturing -- he seemed to be worn down by a one-man fight 
against inflation and loose-fisted government spending.  
</P>
<P>
 He said he plans to concentrate on leading Russia's main reform party in 
Parliament, and he even went so far as to support Grigory Yavlinsky, a radical 
economist in a rival party, to replace him as first deputy prime minister in 
charge of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 His resignation also came as an unexpected postscript to the Russian-U.S. 
summit that ended Saturday, at which Yeltsin reportedly told President Clinton, 
"Gaidar stays." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Geneva, however, Clinton Administration officials said Yeltsin had warned 
them that Gaidar would resign and that the resignation would be accepted.  
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher noted in Geneva on Sunday that Gaidar 
had not been particularly effective in selling his economic program to the 
Russian public, and he suggested that it might be a step forward if he was 
replaced by someone more "sensitive" to the hardship felt by ordinary Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Gaidar, who is a very interesting, attractive person, was, after all, the 
head of a party that didn't do very well in the elections," Christopher said on 
NBC television's "Meet the Press." "So I wouldn't attribute undue significance 
to his leaving. There are other very strong reformers on President Yeltsin's 
team. And I think the important thing is President Yeltsin's commitment to 
reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaidar, who leads the Russia's Choice reformist bloc that trailed 
embarrassingly behind an ultranationalist party in Dec. 12 parliamentary 
elections, did not mention the voting as a reason for his resignation, but it 
seemed to have influenced him. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his allies were forced to take responsibility for the pain of the 
reforms, while Chernomyrdin stayed aloof from the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaidar's letter to Yeltsin named two recent incidents that contributed to the 
sense of powerlessness that led to his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he said, the government had agreed to let the ruble become the currency 
of the former Soviet republic of Belarus, a move that could hurt Russia's 
economy, without consulting him.  
</P>
<P>
 And second, also without his consent, Chernomyrdin allocated $500 million to 
build a new center for the Parliament now that the Russian White House -- the 
old Parliament building -- has been taken over by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sum far exceeds the resources allocated with great difficulty in 1993 
for defense conversion and is five times greater than the federal spending on 
art and culture," Gaidar wrote in exasperation. "This sum equals one-fifth of 
last year's social spending." 
</P>
<P>
 The two examples were clearly not reason enough to resign; rather, they 
reflected the basic difference that has split Gaidar and Chernomyrdin all 
along. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaidar advocates a tough monetary policy to fight inflation, while 
Chernomyrdin has been far more willing to print and spend money. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Chernomyrdin has been promising Russians that there will be no more 
"shock therapy," implying that social spending will be increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Their conflict reached a boiling point as Chernomyrdin went about reshuffling 
the Cabinet under a Yeltsin decree that calls for slashing the number of posts. 
The new lineup of ministers is scheduled to be announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin, who seems to have tried to remain above the Cabinet infighting, will 
be forced to referee between his prime minister and his economics chief today. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, he nominated Gaidar as his prime minister but ended up accepting 
Chernomyrdin after the Russian Congress rejected Gaidar. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he will once again choose Gaidar over Chernomyrdin is not certain. 
Yeltsin has assured the world that his tough reforms will continue despite the 
strong election showing by ultranationalists who profited from widespread 
discontent, but he has jettisoned Gaidar before out of political necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Gaidar and like-minded Deputy Prime Minister Boris G. Fyodorov -- who has 
yet to be invited into the new Cabinet -- end up on the outside, the point man 
for Gaidar's team of radical reformists will become Anatoly B. Chubais, the 
head of Russia's privatization program and the likeliest man to replace Gaidar 
as economics czar. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaidar said his allies had decided they would not quit the government as a 
group. Some areas of policy, such as foreign affairs, satisfy reformers, he 
said, and each will make an individual decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaidar noted that Chernomyrdin had asked him how he would feel about being 
replaced by rival economist Yavlinsky, and Gaidar said that he would "warmly 
welcome this." 
</P>
<P>
 But Yavlinsky, speaking on Russia's NTV network, indicated that he would not 
be eager to join a Cabinet that he said would be a "traditional Soviet 
government" with "no (policy) line." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Chernomyrdin maintained that the government will continue 
reforms with or without Gaidar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has been and will be reformist," spokesman Valentin Sergeyev 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Gaidar said he feared that his resignation could be followed by a return 
to socialist-style economics.

ASSAD-CLINTON TALKS RAISE HOPES FOR PEACE; MIDEAST: SYRIAN LEADER FOR FIRST 
TIME SAYS HE WANTS 'NORMAL, PEACEFUL RELATIONS' WITH ISRAEL. AT END OF GENEVA 
MEETING, PRESIDENT CALLS HIM INDISPENSABLE TO PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Syrian President Hafez Assad met with President Clinton on Sunday and raised 
hopes for a breakthrough in the Middle East peace talks by declaring for the 
first time that he hopes to achieve "normal, peaceful relations" with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a five-hour summit meeting at the end of Clinton's eight-day trip to 
Europe and the former Soviet Union, the Syrian leader declared that if pending 
negotiations succeed, "we are ready to sign peace now." 
</P>
<P>
 "If the leaders of Israel have sufficient courage to respond to this kind of 
peace, a new era of security and stability . . . (with) normal, peaceful 
relations among all shall dawn," he said in the final sentence of a formal 
statement delivered in an unprecedented news conference with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the 45 years of Israel's existence, Syria has rejected peace on any 
terms the Jewish state could conceivably accept. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, senior U.S. officials are now saying, Assad, perhaps the 
most careful and cunning leader in the Middle East, has specifically committed 
himself to negotiations aimed at establishing "normal" relations -- a code word 
suggesting that he is ready to accept Israel's insistence that any final accord 
provide not only security guarantees but trade and open borders. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, Clinton publicly praised Assad as the indispensable player on the 
Arab side of the peace process. "I believe Syria is the key to the achievement 
of an enduring and comprehensive peace that finally will put an end to the 
conflict between Israel and her Arab neighbors," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad has long sought recognition as the principal leader of the Arab side -- 
which accounts in part for his hostile reaction to last year's secret 
negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which 
took place without Assad's knowledge or participation. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, negotiating the details of a settlement between Israel and Syria -- 
which Clinton emphasized is primarily up to the parties directly involved -- 
will be a long, difficult process, with endless possibilities for failure. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Assad appeared to hold firm on his insistence that peace must 
involve simultaneous Israeli settlements with Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the 
Palestinians. The United States also favors a comprehensive settlement but 
opposes delaying individual settlements -- between Israel and the PLO, for 
example -- until all have been worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Assad cling to his position, he could delay or possibly even derail the 
four-way talks that are scheduled to resume in Washington soon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Sunday's summit, Clinton did not seek a detailed commitment from Assad, 
long considered one of Israel's most implacable foes and an obstacle to peace 
in the troubled region, on exactly how far he would go toward the kind of 
normalization Israel wants. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, U.S. negotiators sought movement on the broad issue of Syria's 
willingness to seek the kind of peace that Israel says it must have if it is to 
return control of the strategically sensitive Golan Heights to Assad. 
</P>
<P>
 And Administration officials insisted that the change in Assad's language at 
the joint news conference with Clinton should convince an uneasy Israeli public 
that the negotiations should be pursued vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad used "terminology that has not been used before," one Administration 
official said. "From that standpoint we have seen new ground broken." 
</P>
<P>
 At the press conference, Clinton himself said Assad has made a "clear, 
forthright and very important statement on normal, peaceful relations." 
</P>
<P>
 The talks, conducted amid extremely tight security, were also a landmark for 
Clinton, marking the first time he has taken on direct negotiations with the 
head of a state that has been such an implacable adversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Damascus, among other things, remains on the official U.S. list of nations 
that sponsor terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton brought up, but got no satisfaction on, U.S. objections to Syria's 
harboring of Palestinian terrorists, which has led to economic sanctions that 
Assad badly wants to eliminate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no substantive response from the Syrians," an Administration 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad was somewhat more flexible when Clinton raised continuing allegations 
that Syrians were involved in the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which 
exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Syrian leader said he would look into the latest allegations, a statement 
officials said they found "encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the joint press conference and the texts of the statements the two 
leaders read before taking questions had been under negotiation for two weeks. 
Final agreement was reached Saturday night by Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad has met with three U.S. Presidents but never before consented to hold a 
joint news conference. The two men looked grave when they appeared after their 
closed-door sessions, although U.S. aides said the talks had gone smoothly and 
even included "light moments." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the historic animosities of the Middle East, Syrian officials had 
tried to exclude all of the dozens of Israeli reporters who had flocked to 
Geneva for the talks, which had received a heavy buildup in the Mideast. Faced 
with Israeli protests, U.S. officials insisted that one Israeli reporter, from 
the newspaper Maariv, be allowed entrance as part of a small contingent of 
international journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials, who had been trying to downplay expectations for the summit, 
sought to do so again Sunday. "Everyone's trying not to overstate this," one 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the meeting, Christopher had asserted that "frankly, if there's an 
important result, we probably won't see it for several months." 
</P>
<P>
 The talks had centered on proposals that the Israelis would agree to recognize 
Syrian authority over the Golan Heights and begin a troop withdrawal, or at 
least a partial withdrawal. The Israelis took over the strategically important 
plateau during the 1967 Middle East War. 
</P>
<P>
 There are now about 13,000 Israelis in the heights, which dominate the Galilee 
Basin and lie only 40 miles from Damascus. Before Israel captured the Golan in 
1967, Syrian artillery on the heights regularly shelled communities throughout 
northern Israel. Many Israelis believe that their military control of the high 
ground has helped keep the peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad, in turn, has his own wish list. He wants to be dropped from the U.S. 
list of countries that sponsor terrorism because of the sanctions that listing 
entails. And he is under pressure to forge economic ties with Israel -- and the 
United States -- to strengthen a domestic economy that has been hurt by the 
contraction of Russian aid and military hardware. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the talks lead nowhere, they have brought Assad one concrete product: 
the prestige he will gain in the Mideast for appearing with the leader of the 
single remaining superpower. 
</P>

HARDING CAMP SAYS SHE DENIES INVOLVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR and RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of Tonya Harding's camp came forward Sunday to say the young ice 
skater "categorically denies" accusations that she was involved in an assault 
on one of her rivals and that she would not quit in her quest for the Olympic 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, U.S. Olympic Committee officials, who appeared Saturday to be 
moving toward a decision to remove Harding from the U.S. team for the Feb. 
12-27 Winter Games in Norway, decided during a meeting Sunday in Durham, N.C., 
to defer -- at least temporarily -- to the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul George, an executive committee member who represents figure skating, said 
it is premature to speculate about Harding's Olympic status until more is known 
about what role, if any, she played in the Jan. 6 attack on rival Nancy 
Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 But one USOC executive committee member who did not want to be identified 
said, "I think she'll be off the team within a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Making the first public statement on Harding's behalf, Diane Rawlinson, the 
skater's coach, said Harding is "shocked and angry" that men around her may 
have been involved in plotting and carrying out the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 News reports citing unnamed sources have alleged that Harding knew about the 
plot to hurt Kerrigan, and that the plot was planned by her ex-husband, Jeff 
Gillooly, who lives with Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly hasn't been charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's bodyguard, Shawn Eric Eckardt, and two other men have been charged 
with conspiracy to assault Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding was to resume training today, and her coach said she sent a 
sympathetic letter to Kerrigan, who returned to practice Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two victims in this horrible situation," Rawlinson said at a 
crowded press conference outside her house. "Nancy, of course. But Tonya is 
also a victim. Tonya will not be in line to make the kind of money from 
endorsements she would have been in line to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Rawlinson was joined by her husband, attorney Dennis Rawlinson, who has acted 
as one of Harding's attorneys in the matter. Dennis Rawlinson read a statement 
before his wife took questions: 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya Harding categorically denies all accusations and media speculation that 
she was involved in any way in the assault. Tonya is shocked and angry that 
anyone close to her might be involved. She is pleased to see that Nancy 
Kerrigan is recovering quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya is beginning the most important month of the most important year of her 
life. She wants to represent her country in the Olympics. She needs her fans' 
support and their prayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Rawlinson said Harding was to meet privately with prosecutors in the 
case Sunday and was "excited" at the opportunity to move the case along. But 
deputy Multnomah County prosector Norm Frink said repeated efforts to arrange 
such a meeting with Harding have been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to talk to them (Harding and Gillooly), but I'm unaware of any 
plans to do so," Frink said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Rawlinson said she did not know if Gillooly had a role in the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to believe that Jeff is innocent," she said. "I don't know Jeff as 
well as I know Tonya." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "Tonya absolutely believes Jeff is innocent. If she discovers 
anything different from that she will distance herself from him." 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Rawlinson repeatedly said Harding will not voluntarily withdraw from the 
Olympics competition in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya is innocent. She won nationals. She trained hard and she deserves to 
go," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. team will be the strongest with Nancy and Tonya on the team. Tonya 
skates best when she is upset." 
</P>
<P>
 The contents of Harding's letter to Kerrigan were not disclosed, but her coach 
said Harding wrote that she was "very sorry this whole thing happened."

<P>
 Kerrigan's coach, Evy Scotvold, said he was not aware of Kerrigan receiving a 
letter from Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan did not comment, but a statement said she returned to the rink for a 
training session for the first time since she was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid a media crush, she chose the unorthodox hour of 2 a.m. EST Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "My knee was a little stiff, and it took some time to get loosened up," she 
said in the statement. "But it felt good to be on the ice again." 
</P>
<P>
 As the first alternate, Michelle Kwan, 13, of Torrance, will compete in the 
Olympics if either Harding or Kerrigan drops out. Kwan finished second to 
Harding in the recent national championships in Detroit, where Kerrigan was 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion of a two-day executive committee meeting in Durham, the 
USOC's president, Dr. LeRoy Walker, said he expects the U.S. Figure Skating 
Assn. to decide within a few days whether to recommend Harding's dismissal from 
the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that the USOC is the final authority in determining which 
athletes will represent the United States in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he said legal counsel advised him to back away from his statement 
Saturday that action might be taken against Harding "without the consideration 
of whether or not her rights have been abridged," he repeated that her guilt or 
innocence in the plot to injure Kerrigan will not be the only factor in the 
USOC's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be based on the information we get from officials in law enforcement, 
it will be based on our rules and regulations, and it will be based on what we 
think will be the best possible environment for our athletes," he said. "The 
best situation for our athletes is the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 USOC officials are concerned that Harding's presence in Norway will create 
such a media feeding frenzy that the other athletes' security and concentration 
will be compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 If Harding is dropped from the team, USOC bylaws allow her to seek 
reinstatement through the American Arbitration Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The easy way would be for her to quit, but I don't think that will happen," 
Walker said.

NATURE TAKES A POST-FIRE WALK ON THE WILD SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The skies above charred hillsides are filled with hawks, many circling in 
places, such as the coastline, they normally avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ground, wood rats the size of small cats are invading houses that 
withstood last autumn's brush fires, nesting in garages, pantries and cars. 
</P>
<P>
 And in creeks within the fire-ravaged Santa Monica Mountains, tree frogs, 
normally a pale beige or gray, have turned as black as their burnt 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Southern California, wildlife experts and even casual observers cannot 
help noticing the ways the wildfires have changed the behavior of animals. 
Although many animals inevitably were killed, the survivors have quickly and 
relentlessly demonstrated how life reaffirms itself. 
</P>
<P>
 To people living in or near the fire zones, that fierce will to survive shows 
up in ways riveting and revolting -- from the sudden appearance of brilliantly 
hued mountain bluebirds that blanketed Laguna Canyon after the fires to the 
beady-eyed wood rats gnawing their way into hillside homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may seem eerie or weird to some people," said ecologist Sean Manion of the 
Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource Conservation District, "but in actuality it's a 
pretty normal event following fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fires are a naturally occurring phenomenon in the mountains here," he noted. 
"It's been going on for thousands of years." 
</P>
<P>
 A post-fire rat invasion is so typical that the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency's disaster recovery center in Malibu offers leaflets on the prevention 
and control of rodent infestations. Just like human fire victims, the rats 
become homeless when the large, twiggy nests they build above ground are 
consumed by flames. Survivors head for the nearest source of refuge and food -- 
often a house. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though a different species than the disease-spreading, garbage-grubbing Norway 
rat, so-called "pack rats" can nonetheless damage property and even rattle 
homeowners accustomed to wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Strote said her bunker-like, concrete house, set on 40 pristine 
acres in Calabasas, has become a rat magnet -- "the final nightmare" after the 
trauma of the Nov. 2 blaze that consumed 18,000 acres in the Santa Monica 
Mountains. The rats have colonized her garage and woodpile, eaten shrubs she 
has tried to plant, and chewed up the wires of her 1971 Mercedes-Benz. She had 
to have one dead rat steam-cleaned off the car's engine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mechanics told me Mercedes are good for anything -- even barbecue," 
Strote said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would see them when I would go to get wood out of the woodpile," Strote 
said of her unwelcome visitors. "I hear them. They're nocturnal so I'll go walk 
outside and I'll feel them right next to me. I'll hear them shuffling around. 
But I've started to avoid it. I don't go out more than I have to 'cause it 
gives me the creeps." 
</P>
<P>
 The rats, in turn, have drawn stray cats -- 20 of them -- to the Malibu home 
of Alan Jensen. After the brush fire that spread between western Topanga Canyon 
and Pepperdine University, Jensen said, "we counted as many as 37 rats the cats 
killed, and they were almost as big as the cats. . . . You could not walk 
around the property at night for fear you'd step on the rats." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen at least knew of this aftereffect of a major fire. After one in 1985, 
he saw the rodents leaping from palm tree to palm tree on and near his 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 As the rats and other small mammals are displaced by the fires, they are 
followed by hawks, ravens and other birds of prey -- producing unusually large 
numbers of them in the Santa Monicas these days, naturalists say. 
</P>
<P>
 What looks like wasteland becomes a great feeding ground for the hawks. With 
the chaparral burned off, they have a bird's-eye view -- literally -- of what's 
to eat on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The same phenomenon has been seen in the San Gabriel Mountains, where the 
October fires seared 5,700 acres around Pasadena, Altadena and Sierra Madre. An 
unusual variety of hawks -- Cooper's, sharp-shinned, red-tailed and 
red-shouldered -- have been circling the San Gabriels' burnt, south-facing 
slopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after the fires, a western meadowlark was spotted over the Eaton 
Canyon Nature Center, the first reported sighting of that species there in 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Director Mickey Long said he has not a clue where the meadowlark came 
from, or why, because the aptly named bird prefers meadows over the rugged 
chaparral. But he assumes that its unexpected presence was somehow related to 
the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent bird count throughout the region between the Santa Monicas and San 
Gabriels showed that birds were jammed much more tightly than usual into the 
pockets of vegetation spared by the fires. Despite the high concentrations, the 
number of species was lower, indicating that not all local birds survived, said 
John Fisher, who supervised the annual count for the Pasadena Audubon Society 
in the San Gabriels. 
</P>
<P>
 Two mountain lion sightings in San Gabriel Valley suburbs also have given rise 
to speculation that the brush fires drove the highly mobile but extremely shy 
cats from their usual habitats. Both back-yard sightings occurred Jan. 8, eight 
miles apart in Altadena and La Crescenta. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get occasional sightings but nothing like this," said Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Lt. Mike Wenrich of the Altadena substation. 
</P>
<P>
 Much more common -- and not unexpected -- have been the displaced coyote and 
deer discovered in the suburbs abutting the fire areas. 
</P>
<P>
 While some creatures migrate, others adapt. Lee Kats, a Pepperdine University 
biologist who studies amphibians in the Santa Monicas, uncovered one of the 
most striking examples inland from Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiking into Cold Creek Canyon soon after the fire, he spotted California tree 
frogs that were black rather than their customary pale beige or gray. As he 
watched them more closely he realized that the frogs were not covered with soot 
but had changed color, closely matching the charred ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen one that dark in four years," Kats said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kats, the color change is a reminder that fire is a naturally occurring 
phenomenon in the Santa Monicas. It shows that at least one native, the tree 
frog, has been equipped with "the genetic makeup to deal with post-fire 
conditions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means . . . this frog, this species, has evolved in a habitat that 
semi-regularly burns." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts are anticipating more such drama in the fire zones' ever-changing 
ecological theater. As different plants begin to revive, they will attract a 
succession of hungry insects, which, in turn, provide food for birds and other 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to see an absolute turnover in the diversity and abundance of 
different species," said biologist Dennis Murphy, director of the Center for 
Conservation at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after the October fires in Laguna Beach, Murphy said, the hills were 
covered in bright, almost phosphorescent mountain bluebirds, a thrilling sight 
against the stark, lunar landscape left by the flames. The bluebirds, unusual 
in that habitat, were drawn by the army of insects displaced as the Laguna fire 
consumed 16,680 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, Murphy predicts, visitors will see a disproportionate number of a 
small green butterfly called the bramble hairstreak. Its favorite food, a type 
of lotus, grows abundantly after fire in the ash-enriched soil, and thrives 
also because it has less competition from other plants. 
</P>
<P>
 It is just one example of how the regeneration works. 
</P>
<P>
 New plants tend to be particularly tender and nutritious after brush fires, 
providing the perfect forage for starved animals, said Suzanne Goode, an 
ecologist for the state parks system. Invigorated by the enriched vegetation, 
the native wood rats, in turn, will probably have larger litters and thus 
replenish their ranks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not to say that the fires did not kill many animals or that they will 
not hasten the demise of threatened creatures such as the California 
gnatcatcher and cactus wren, two songbirds whose habitat in Orange County's 
coastal sage scrub, a victim of continuing suburban development, shrank another 
10% during the Laguna fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every species able to flee and now trying to adapt, there were many other 
species totally lost in those areas, like brush rabbits, lizards and snakes," 
Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the quirky behavior that has alternately delighted and startled animal 
watchers in recent weeks could provide important leads in more methodical 
studies of how the post-fire environment recovers. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Park Service's Santa Monica Mountains headquarters is trying to 
coordinate a number of proposed studies, staff ecologist Ray Sauvajot said, 
including one led by an Occidental College biologist that will compare the 
recovery of reseeded hillsides with those left to nature's devices. The impact 
of animals on plant regeneration will be included, said Prof. Jon Keeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, of Stanford, fears that there is not enough funding available to mine 
the wealth of information presented by last fall's brush fires, a pity because 
fires of such magnitude occur only every 10 to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This opportunity," he said, "is just something we won't be able to take 
advantage of."

STOP THE PRESSES: PAPERS ENTER A BRAVE NEW WORLD; MEDIA: ELECTRONIC VISIONS 
SHARPEN. MERGERS, ADVANCES PUSH PUBLISHERS ONTO THE 'INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Roger Fidler first laid out his ideas for an electronic newspaper back in 
1981, he got "absolutely no response." Seven years later he tried again, 
outlining his high-tech vision to newspaper executives at the American Press 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 But the presentation "fell flat," he said. "They thought it was all Buck 
Rogers stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until last year that Fidler's company, the Knight-Ridder newspaper 
chain, agreed to finance his research on the newspaper of the future. The 
Knight-Ridder Information Design Laboratory in Boulder, Colo., is a modest 
operation -- just seven people -- but it's a start. 
</P>
<P>
 All across the newspaper industry, companies that long have resisted the 
information revolution are beginning to act. With phone companies, cable 
operators and computer firms spending billions of dollars in hopes of creating 
an "information superhighway," newspaper executives fear that unless they do 
something soon, they're going to be left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The $33-billion merger of Bell Atlantic Corp. and cable powerhouse 
Tele-Communications Inc., announced a little more than two months ago, was a 
jolt for those who suspected that the information highway was so much hype. 
Newspaper companies, which never have invested much in research and 
development, now have to figure out where they fit in a world of 500-channel TV 
systems and ubiquitous personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up to this point, I could defend the decision not to spend money on these new 
technologies," said David Easterly, president of Cox Newspapers Inc., which 
publishes the Atlanta Journal and Constitution and other papers. "But now is 
the time to establish some turf in (electronic services). Others will do it if 
you don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper publishers -- including Cox, Knight-Ridder, Times Mirror Co. (parent 
of the Los Angeles Times), the Washington Post Co. and the Tribune Co. -- are 
all pressing ahead with a variety of electronic information services, including 
versions of their newspapers for customers who own personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet much of the activity reflects the uncertain instincts of an industry that, 
in the words of veteran newspaper analyst John Morton, "has always reacted 
rather than innovated." Few companies have committed significant resources to 
electronic news services. And even some of the more ambitious efforts appear to 
be based on a highly traditional view of what readers and advertisers want. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of scrambling to look like you're doing something," says Gary 
Hoenig, editor of the industry publication News Inc. But he said he is not sure 
that newspapers have figured out yet how to deal with new technologies -- or 
are prepared to spend serious money on them. 
</P>
<P>
 In some respects, the caution is understandable. Skeptics note that the 
traditional newspaper is cheap, light, portable and disposable. Products that 
require a personal computer or other electronic hardware do not share those 
characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 The skeptics were proven right in the early 1980s, when Times Mirror, 
Knight-Ridder and their partners lost at least several million dollars on 
electronic information services known as Videotex. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology, based on a special terminal that plugged into television sets, 
was crude by today's standards. 
</P>
<P>
 And some say not all that much has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, you'd have to say there is no compelling demand for the 
information a newspaper provides to be transmitted in electronic form," said 
Hunter George, vice president of Toronto-based Thomson Newspapers, which owns 
112 small papers in the United States. "People prefer the printed word. They do 
not like to read off a TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet advances in computer and communications technology have made it possible 
to create electronic information and entertainment services that are far 
richer, cheaper and easier to use than Videotex. These advances have spurred an 
unprecedented wave of mergers, strategic alliances and business start-ups in 
every corner of the media business, as companies position themselves for the 
Age of Interactive Multimedia. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many newspaper companies also own cable television operations, and the cable 
businesses are in many cases the focus of their new technology investments. But 
the newspapers are also now getting attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Ridder, president of Knight-Ridder, says it is only necessary to look at 
the sales figures to see that newspaper companies need to think in new ways. 
The industry has been mired in a severe advertising slump for several years, 
and Ridder said he suspects that it is not just a cyclical decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "1990 was flat, but in 1991 revenues fell -- it was the worst year-to-year 
comparison ever," he said. (The Miami-based company enjoyed a slight rebound in 
1992.) "That really hit us square in the face. There was something going on out 
there, and we decided that instead of hunkering down, we would start working on 
new ways of delivering things." 
</P>
<P>
 To see the underlying economic logic of electronic delivery, one need only 
look at a modern newspaper printing plant, such as The Times' new facility in 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The $230-million Olympic Boulevard press building, which covers nearly 1 
million square feet, turns 430 tons of newsprint and 700 gallons of ink into 
600,000 newspapers every day -- newspapers that are then delivered across the 
Southland by hundreds of trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 It is enormous manufacturing and distribution operations like this -- rather 
than the salaries of reporters or editors or advertising salespeople -- that 
account for the majority of expenses at The Times and other major newspapers. 
The cost of duplicating such an infrastructure has kept many potential 
competitors out of the news business. 
</P>
<P>
 But this Industrial Age method of delivering information is expensive and 
inflexible. To print different papers for different parts of Southern 
California, for example, is very costly. To customize the paper for individuals 
is downright impossible, though so-called zoned editions are serving smaller 
and smaller geographic areas, and some papers are moving toward editions 
targeted to subscribers with specialized interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic distribution, by contrast, is highly flexible. It makes it possible 
to offer a much richer variety of information -- the full texts of political 
speeches, for example, or the complete roster of every high school football 
team -- with individual customers selecting only what they want. 
</P>
<P>
 To the degree that electronic delivery allows newspapers to reduce the amount 
of paper they deliver, they can chop their costs. For the most part, though, 
experts say electronic services won't be replacing newspapers so much as 
augmenting them. "The newspaper business is in transition from a single-product 
business to a multiple-product business," Fidler said. "Newspapers will publish 
things in many different ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Many papers already publish in more than one way. In Los Angeles and 
elsewhere, newspaper-sponsored telephone services provide weather reports, 
sports scores, stock quotes and much more. Cox's Atlanta Journal and 
Constitution has set up a joint venture with Bell South, the local telephone 
company, to deliver classified ads over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times, have 
started special fax editions that can deliver customized financial news or 
reach readers in far-off locations. Specialized electronic information services 
for businesses -- such as those offered by Mead Data's Lexis/Nexis or Dow Jones 
& Co., publisher of the Wall Street Journal -- have been growing rapidly in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the big challenge isn't these services but the launching of 
broad-based consumer services that use dial-up computer networks, wireless 
communications services and the upcoming interactive television networks. 
</P>
<P>
 At Knight-Ridder's San Jose Mercury News, one such system began operating a 
few months ago in conjunction with America Online, a national personal computer 
network. Customers can dial in from their personal computers and read the daily 
paper, view articles from past issues and get additional information -- 
including original documents -- about the day's news. 
</P>
<P>
 They can also send messages to reporters and editors, peruse the classified 
ads or look up where their favorite rock band is playing -- all with a few 
clicks of the keyboard. The newspaper itself prints codes at the end of stories 
and other instructions to help people navigate the online service. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Ingle, executive editor of the Mercury News, calls the project "an 
experiment that we hope will turn into a business." He said it will be two 
years before it is possible to evaluate the results, but it has already become 
clear that there is demand for in-depth information relating to news stories: 
That's been the most popular category on the service. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Tribune Co., which owns a 10% stake in America Online, recently launched a 
similar service with the Chicago Tribune. The Tribune Co. is pursuing what 
analysts call a "buckshot" approach to new technology -- trying many different 
ventures in the hope that a few of them will work. It paid $57 million for 
Compton's New Media, a publisher of multimedia computer disks, and acquired a 
company in the Washington, D.C., area that has developed an electronic system 
for real estate advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Post Co. last month launched a new subsidiary, dubbed Digital 
Ink, to develop electronic products, including a computer-linked version of the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 And Times Mirror announced in August that it will develop electronic versions 
of its newspapers -- beginning with the Los Angeles Times and Newsday -- in 
conjunction with Prodigy Services, an online service jointly owned by IBM and 
Sears Roebuck & Co. Cox also opted to go with Prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
 The deals raised some eyebrows, for Prodigy has lost prodigious sums of money 
since it was launched, and critics contend it uses cumbersome, outdated 
technology. America Online, a smaller and newer venture, had wooed Times Mirror 
heavily, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 But Prodigy, unlike America Online, will allow Times Mirror papers to retain 
complete control of the service. Rather than being one option among many on an 
online service, The Times and Newsday services will be completely separate. 
They'll use the Prodigy network, but customers will buy the service 
independently and dial up on a different phone line, with existing Prodigy 
customers likely receiving a modest discount. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The graphics capabilities of Prodigy will also make it possible to offer 
display advertising across the bottom of the computer screen. America Online is 
not designed for such advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the newspaper to have as close a connection as possible to the 
customer," said Chip Perry, director of new business development at Times 
Mirror. "We thought it was important to have a fully branded service and 
control as much of our own destiny as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet not everyone is convinced that it is a good idea for newspapers to seek 
the same level of control in -- and the same sources of revenue from -- 
electronic services as they've enjoyed with print. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's taking an old metaphor -- which sold advertising by adjacency to news 
-- and transferring it to a new medium. It won't work," said Ingle of the 
Mercury News, whose Mercury Center service now only runs text-only ads but 
eventually will offer interactive sales. "We're moving toward a time when there 
will be less reliance on advertising, and it will be more informational and 
more targeted." 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to predict how -- and how quickly -- electronic news services will 
evolve is, of course, extremely difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, while Times Mirror and the Mercury News believe that PC-based 
online services will be a good business, others say electronic information 
services won't have wide appeal until people can tap into them with a remote 
control and the television set. Prodigy, America Online and other services are 
all preparing to make themselves available over interactive television systems 
once the cable TV and telephone companies get such networks up and running, 
possibly later in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. bought Delphi Information Services earlier this 
year. However, the company's priority is not an electronic version of its New 
York Post but a customized, worldwide electronic newspaper for executives on 
the go. 
</P>
<P>
 Dow Jones is also targeting the mobile executive with a news service called 
the Personal Journal, which will be available next year via hand-held "personal 
communicators."  
</P>
<P>
 Even Fidler is a bit of a skeptic on personal computer-based services. He's 
counting on the emergence of lightweight, inexpensive, high-resolution computer 
screens -- he calls them "tablets" -- to create an entirely new vehicle for 
news distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This new kind of electronic tablet, Fidler said, will resemble paper more than 
a TV set. "We've been trying too hard to force document technology into video 
technology. Documents have evolved over a period of time, and they have certain 
standard characteristics. . . . You have to give people the ability to read 
them wherever you happen to be -- in bed, on a train, in a coffee shop." 
</P>
<P>
 With Fidler's tablet, you'll be able to tap a headline to get a story, a photo 
or even a video clip of the event in question. Touch the small advertising 
symbol and you'll get a screen full of promotional information -- and maybe be 
able to order the product on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 But one need not dispute Fidler's vision to question how important his notions 
about electronic news are for business today. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times Co., for one, remains convinced that the print newspaper 
will be its key business for many years to come. It recently made a big 
acquisition -- the venerable Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, there is no consumer market for electronic services. . . . The 
consumer perception is that we're still in the Videotex age," says Gordon 
Medenica, vice president for operations and planning at the Times Co.  
</P>
<P>
 Medenica said the New York Times is one of the few papers that earns 
significant profits in online services, via its relationship with Mead Data 
Central. Nexis pays royalties in exchange for the rights to back issues of the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But when the deal was signed 12 years ago, the Times gave Nexis the rights in 
perpetuity. Medenica concedes that he would feel better if the contract had an 
expiration date. Recently, though, the Times Co. signed an agreement with 
America Online to offer access to the same day's newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the real challenge for newspapers will be to design a whole new 
model for the electronic world. Self-contained news stories will be augmented 
-- or even replaced -- by layers of stories, with levels of detail. Pictures 
and graphics will move. Display advertising will give way to electronic buying 
and selling. 
</P>

 Analysts say newspapers, with their extensive news gathering organizations, 
editing skills and recognized brand images, have a big leg up in building this 
new generation of information services. 
</P>
<P>
 But their expensive printing and distribution operations won't be a defense in 
the electronic world. They'll have to defend themselves with creativity 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quality newspapers . . . are well-equipped to succeed in the shifting media 
world," Shelby Coffey III, editor of the Los Angeles Times, said at an 
investment conference in Scottsdale, Ariz., this fall. "They'll succeed because 
of their attention to basic reader psychology and because they understand the 
key transformation of turning information into readily graspable knowledge."

ASSAD NOW SEEMS TO SEE PEACE AS SYRIA'S BEST BET; SUMMIT: IF HIS WORDS ARE 
FOLLOWED BY CONCRETE ACTS, THE WHOLE MIDEAST PICTURE COULD CHANGE 
DRAMATICALLY.; NEWS ANALYSIS

 In a formal sense, President Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad did 
little more Sunday than trade some ancient diplomatic buzzwords -- "normal 
relations," a "comprehensive peace." 
</P>
<P>
 But after almost half a century of haggling over how Israel and its Arab 
neighbors might end their state of war, the words were freighted with 
life-and-death meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 If Assad's words are followed by concrete acts -- beginning with Syria's 
approach to detailed peace negotiations that resume in Washington soon -- the 
face of the Middle East could change completely. Syria has long been Israel's 
most bitter enemy, the foe whose fearsome tanks and ballistic missiles have 
forced the Jewish state to live under the constant threat of war. 
</P>
<P>
 So for the United States and Israel, the key phrase from Assad was "normal, 
peaceful relations," the term the Syrian president used to describe the 
ultimate goal of negotiations. In the Middle East, that means that Syria seeks 
not merely a truce with Israel but a real peace -- complete with open borders 
and free trade -- that would make renewed war less likely. 
</P>
<P>
 For Assad, the key phrase from Clinton was "an enduring and comprehensive 
peace" -- meaning that the United States will use its considerable influence 
over the wider Mideast peace process to be sure any settlement includes an 
honorable deal for Syria rather than pursue bilateral deals with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization and other parties that leave Damascus isolated and weak 
as Israel's last adversary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Syria is the key to achieving an enduring and comprehensive peace," President 
Clinton said. "There (will) be no comprehensive peace in the Middle East unless 
(Assad is) willing to take a leadership role." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the phrases the two presidents came to Geneva to speak. They were 
the objects of months of negotiations by U.S. and Syrian officials, and finally 
agreed to by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Syrian Foreign Minister 
Farouk Shareh in a quiet meeting the night before Clinton and Assad came 
together in the glare of a summit. 
</P>
<P>
 But the phrases that may mean the most over the long run were less noted. 
Syria seeks peace, Assad said, "as a strategic choice. . . . In honor we 
fought; in honor we negotiate, and in honor we shall make peace." 
</P>
<P>
 By that, a senior U.S. official said, Assad meant that he has decided freely 
that peace is now, at last, in Syria's national interest. And his proud 
stipulation that he would settle with Israel "in honor" was a promise to his 
people -- and the military caste on which his power rests -- that Syria will 
still insist that peace be made on its own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 A Syrian source agreed. "That is the most important thing -- that President 
Assad has made a fundamental decision to go ahead and make peace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, after 45 years of ferocious hostility to Israel, has Assad made that 
decision? U.S. officials provide several answers: because Assad recognizes that 
he desperately needs Western help to modernize his economy; because his 
longtime protector, the Soviet Union, is no more; because his few remaining 
sources of military hardware, such as North Korea, cannot hope to match the 
U.S. technology that is in Israel's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's news conference, the first ever held jointly by a U.S. and Syrian 
president, revealed another reason: Hafez Assad is getting old. A young air 
force officer when he seized power in 1970, he is now a gray and ailing 63. 
Bill Clinton was the fourth U.S. President he had met, but the first one 
younger than him. As they ascended the steps to the platform in a hotel 
ballroom for their news conference, Assad swayed a little. Clinton, a vigorous 
47, held out a hand to steady him. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Assad's decision for peace will prove lasting, U.S. officials 
acknowledged, will only become clear in the detailed negotiations that are 
scheduled to resume in Washington later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to hype this," said a State Department official who was 
involved in the negotiations. "This was a first step. Now we need to build on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Assad carefully hedged his embrace of normal relations with Israel and 
tied it to a settlement on the terms he wants -- essentially, full Israeli 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which were Syria's before the 1967 Middle 
East War. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the leaders of Israel have sufficient courage to respond to this kind of 
peace, a new era of security and stability . . . (with) normal, peaceful 
relations among all shall dawn," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Assad used the word "normal" only once, and he avoided spelling out what it 
means in concrete terms. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials said they have detected a growing interest in peace on 
Assad's part ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Syria's main military 
supplier and diplomatic booster. And Assad's interest has slowly grown as the 
other "tracks" of the Mideast peace negotiations have shown progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The peace agreement between Israel and the PLO last September was a major 
shock to Assad, U.S. officials and Arab analysts have said. The wily Syrian 
leader had sought to slow down the PLO's peacemaking; the pact not only showed 
that he had failed but opened the prospect of a peace settlement that would 
leave Assad out in the cold -- faced with a sputtering economy, uncertain 
military supplies and a more secure Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials noticed all that. So when Clinton presided over the signing of 
the Israeli-Palestinian agreement on the White House lawn, he deliberately 
inserted a quotation from Assad -- "a peace of the brave" -- into his speech. 
And he wrote a letter to Assad, one official said, noting that Syria could only 
benefit if it joined the move toward peace -- and could only lose if it missed 
the train. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the U.S. ambassador in Damascus, Christopher Ross, pitched 
Assad and Shareh hard in his flawless Arabic, warning them that Clinton 
intended to give his full support to the PLO pact; at the same time, he assured 
them that the United States would act as an honest broker, with due regard for 
Syria's interests, if they chose to make peace. 
</P>
<P>
 For Assad, though, one more ingredient was needed: a measure of personal 
confidence in Bill Clinton. Arab leaders are used to a world of one-on-one 
deals among warlords. And Syrian officials were worried about a Democratic 
President who had won office with widespread support from the U.S. Jewish 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 So one of Assad's goals in Geneva was to take Clinton's measure and decide 
whether he could rely on a young American who was still a student when Assad 
became president. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Clinton listened respectfully during more than five hours 
of meetings as Assad did "some lecturing" on the history of the Middle East and 
Syria's complaints against Israel. There was tension in the room too when 
Clinton pressed Assad to expel terrorist groups from Damascus and got a stony 
reply. There were a few light moments, as well; Assad "can be quite witty," one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 As to whether the Syrian gained any personal confidence in Clinton, a senior 
official said, "There's no way we can read Hafez Assad on something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The answer may become clear in coming months -- but only slowly. After nearly 
a quarter-century in power, Assad is a man who plays his cards one at a time, 
even when they are only phrases.

 LAKE TRAGEDY: To 10-year-old Ninoy Kiat of Panorama City, the ice-covered lake 
looked like a fun place to play. But he soon fell into the freezing water of 
Lake Jackson, near Wrightwood, prompting his mother to frantically run onto the 
thin ice after him.She, too, plunged into the water. . . . When it was all 
over, Ninoy was safe, but his mother, Analiza, was dead (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 OFF-ROAD DUSTUP: Motocross fans have their hearts set on an off-road vehicle 
park being built in rugged Baker and Hume canyons in Santa Clarita. But canyon 
homeowners are staunchly opposed, citing noise and traffic. . . . Opponents 
last week won a partial victory when county supervisors ruled Baker unsuitable 
for motocross. But Hume is still a possible site (B14). 
</P>
<P>
 PARTY SHOOTING: A 17-year-old alleged gang member was shot in the head by a 
state prison officer during a gun battle at a late-night Pacoima party. Four 
other party-goers were wounded when several shots were fired. . . . Police said 
the prison officer, who was not identified, apparently acted in self-defense 
when he shot the teen, reported in critical condition. (B3).

 TEEN TOWN: Bob Buckles wasn't surprised to learn that Fillmore has 
proportionately more teen-agers than any other Ventura County city. . . . "We 
do have a lot," said Buckles, whose job as recreation director is to keep them 
all busy. "It's a challenge. We do surveys to find out what they want." High on 
the wish list: a skating rink and bowling alley, neither of which is feasible 
in the small community. . . . One recent innovation is midnight basketball on 
weekends, an alternative to the street. Next month's schedule includes a youth 
car show. "The kids run the whole program. It's something for them to be in 
charge of." Where the Teens Are

 LONG WEEKEND: Thousands of government workers in Ventura County are enjoying a 
four-day weekend, thanks to that trend toward Fridays off in many agencies. . . 
. With Martin Luther King Jr. Day today, about 2,425 Ventura County employees 
have a total of four days off, as do 1,000 city employees in Oxnard, 400 in 
Thousand Oaks and 30 in Ojai. . . . Most county workers prefer four 10-hour 
days, union chief Barry Hammitt said. "The county would have a battle if they 
tried to take it away." 
</P>
<P>
 BOOSTING DOWNTOWN: Unlike several Ventura County communities -- Simi Valley 
and Thousand Oaks, for example -- Moorpark has a downtown. But the city has 
been frustrated in attempts to enliven the High Street area (B6). . . . Some 
hope to lure quaint shops to create the Ojai of east Ventura County. . . . 
Moorpark ranks second-to-last in taxable sales among local cities: $3,011 per 
resident, contrasted with Ojai's $9,454. 
</P>

 SLOW SIGNAL: "Press Button to Activate Green Signal," the sign says. So you 
do. But it doesn't -- at least not for a long time. Does pressing the button 
again and again make the light change any faster? Street Smart knows (B1). . . 
. A typical intersection needs eight Walk/Don't Walk signal boxes, which cost 
about $300 apiece, Ventura Traffic Engineer Mark Watkins said. And though you 
might doubt it sometimes, "the buttons all work," he said.

 As export commodities, they don't rank with cars, crops and chips. But there 
is a growing foreign market for American-style sound bites, photo ops, 
fieldwork and flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. expertise in electoral politics is unexcelled anywhere on Earth and 
sharing this know-how with emerging democracies is an expanding industry. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton blows his sax in a Prague jazz club and the world listens, 
but at any given moment countless other American politicos are quietly 
spreading democracy overseas unnoticed. Many are Californians who return with 
inspirational tales of courage and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are political pros earning a living. Others are political aides or 
academics on leave to foundations trying to educate the people of former 
authoritarian regimes in the intricate, subtle ways of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 All are lured by adventure. And they invariably return saying, "It sounds 
corny, but . . ." -- and then talk about being reminded of how fortunate they 
are to be American.

 Sean Garrett, 26, was born to a Lithuanian immigrant who had gotten pregnant 
shortly after arriving in San Francisco. She gave him up for adoption. He grew 
up comfortably in the Bay Area, became a political junkie and wound up working 
for Gov. Pete Wilson. But he always had been curious about his roots. So in 
1992, he wangled a job advising a pro-capitalist political party in Lithuania's 
second free election since breaking from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett was an instant celebrity. "Not only was I from America, I was from 
California," he says. "For them, California meant the ultimate dream -- 
Hollywood, beaches. . . . The easiest way to get a laugh was to tell them that 
California now had problems, and that Californians didn't like California so 
much anymore. They'd just start laughing. They couldn't grasp it. They were 
cold, hungry, out of work, out of gasoline." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett constantly urged his clients to keep their message simple. "They'd 
take out a full-page ad and fill it with small print. You could hardly read 
it," he says. "They'd tell me: 'We paid for a full page.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One day Garrett illustrated what he meant. While at a rock concert, he 
suddenly was asked to address the 5,000 young people there. "I walked out," he 
recalls, "and said: 'I've got one question for the future of Lithuania: Do you 
want Lenin or do you want Levi's?' I just thought it up standing there. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went nuts. 'Levi's. Levi's.' It was bizarre."

 "Not everybody has an opportunity to be in on the birth of a democracy," notes 
Rachael Richman, 41, a legislative staffer who recently returned from South 
Africa, where she advised local politicians on how to deal with an uncensored 
news media.

 South Africa will hold its first election open to all races on April 27.

 Pearl-Alice Marsh, 47, on leave as director of the African Studies Center at 
UC Berkeley, said last week in a telephone interview from Johannesburg that 
"people are getting shot at rallies" and "it's really unsafe to drive along 
rural highways because they're setting up vigilante traps and killing black 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsh, who is black, has been advising black political parties on the basics 
of old-fashioned American fieldwork aimed at turning out the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went into one neighborhood where a theater group was doing voter education 
and was astounded by some of the questions," she related. A housekeeper "said 
her madam had told her that good Christians don't vote. It was godless 
communism. Being a good Christian, she was completely confused. She was 
reminded that (white) Afrikaners have been voting for a long time."

 Ken LaCorte, 28, says he learned while working in a Colombian presidential 
campaign "to never travel with your candidate. Don't even walk through the 
airport with him. It's when they're on the road that they usually get 
assassinated." 
</P>
<P>
 Four candidates were killed by drug kingpins in that 1990 race, when LaCorte 
was an employee of consultant Roger Ailes and advised a losing candidate. "Our 
campaign office was literally a fortress with a gun turret in front," says 
LaCorte, who now runs his own consulting firm in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Marshall, 32, a San Jose native with the National Democratic Institution 
for International Affairs, recalls having to change the definition of volunteer 
while working in Romania's 1992 elections. "Under communism, people were forced 
at gunpoint to 'volunteer' in the fields at harvest," he says. "People were 
saying, 'We won't volunteer.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But on Election Day 5,700 did. This old man walked in and I thanked him. He 
said: 'No, thank you for letting me participate.' For me, that's what this is 
all about."

MEXICAN POLICE MAKE RECORD HEROIN SEIZURE; TRAFFICKING: AUTHORITIES BREAK UP AN 
UNUSUAL INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE INVOLVING SMUGGLING TEAMS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND 
MEXICO TRANSPORTING NARCOTICS INTO CALIFORNIA. NINE PEOPLE ARE ARRESTED. 
</P>

<P>
 Mexican federal police have made the largest heroin seizure in Mexican 
history, breaking up what authorities described Sunday as an unprecedented 
Asian-Mexican alliance that shipped Asian heroin into the United States through 
an unusual route: the border. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of raids over the past five days, police seized 52 kilos -- 114.4 
pounds -- of pure heroin and arrested nine suspects in this port city about 70 
miles south of San Diego, said Jose Arturo Ochoa Palacio, federal attorney 
general for the state of Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major blow to international drug trafficking," Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors filed drug trafficking charges Sunday against four Thai nationals 
and one Laotian, all of them U.S. residents allegedly involved in smuggling the 
heroin into California in vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The other suspects were Mexicans, including an employee of the Ensenada post 
office who helped sneak the heroin into Mexico from Thailand by mail, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bust apparently reveals a previously unknown and ingenious ring teaming 
Asian and Mexican smugglers at the border, said Jack Hook, a spokesman for the 
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sounds like it might be a new trafficking route to get Southeast Asian 
heroin into the United States," Hook said. "The methodology is new. . . . It's 
a very significant seizure." 
</P>
<P>
 Although smuggling of heroin across the porous U.S.-Mexico border is common, 
the vast majority is manufactured in Mexico, Hook said. Couriers generally 
smuggle heroin from Southeast Asia -- the world's largest producer of the drug 
-- into the United States at major coastal cities such as New York and San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ensenada traffickers allegedly mailed packages containing shampoo, soap 
and lotions to nonexistent addresses in Thailand, where accomplices in the Thai 
postal service concealed heroin in the bath products and sent back the packages 
as undeliverable, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the packages were supposedly unopened and also contained Mexican 
products, the shipments did not have to go through Mexican customs inspection 
on their return, Ochoa said. U.S.-bound smugglers picked up the packages at 
Ensenada post office boxes and drove across the border into California. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to indicating a potential new drug-smuggling route, the case is 
another example of the increasing internationalization of criminal 
organizations. Asian traffickers appear to have followed the lead of Colombian 
cocaine cartels that have gained access to the lucrative U.S. market by 
contracting with a longtime smuggling infrastructure in northern Mexico, Hook 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, a flurry of arrivals around Ensenada last year by ships carrying 
U.S.-bound illegal immigrants from China resulted from a joint operation by 
Chinese and Mexican smuggling networks, causing a surge of Chinese immigrants 
trying to cross the border. 
</P>
<P>
 The heroin-smuggling ring had been operating in Ensenada since at least 
September, according to Mexican federal police. Investigators got a break after 
a postal administrator discovered that two packages mailed back from Thailand 
contained not only soap but also 17 kilos of heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 Police discovered several more loads at other post offices and later arrested 
the five Southeast Asian suspects.  
</P>
<P>
 Their statements implicated Alfonso Romero Verdugo, supervisor of the central 
post office in Ensenada, and three women suspected of storing the heroin before 
it was sent north, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The heroin has a wholesale value of $20 million, but would be worth many 
millions more on the street, authorities said.

ARCHDIOCESE IS SHAKEN BY PRIEST'S TRIAL; COURTS: FATHER DAVID DEAN PIROLI IS

 Before a single witness has testified, the collection plate embezzlement trial 
of Father David Dean Piroli has shaken the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal Roger M. Mahony is among the potential witnesses. Some parishioners 
have been dismayed not just by the charges against Piroli but also by his 
lawyer's accusations that the real culprit is another priest who wanted to hide 
his own embezzlement of $60,000 and homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 Diocese officials angrily attacked all of the lawyer's accusations against 
Father James McKeon, declaring them "a gross injustice." Judge Allan Steele 
said he will allow testimony about the alleged embezzlement by McKeon but not 
the homosexuality issue. Nonetheless, the tone has been set for a trial in 
Ventura that threatens to lay open usually private parish matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors are expected to see ledgers showing the mysteriously shrinking coffers 
of St. Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley and Sacred Heart Church in Saticoy, 
the parishes from which Piroli is accused of taking $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 27, 1992, a Hollywood merchant's post-riot jitters led police to 
investigate his complaint about loiterers outside the Sears store. There, 
police said they found Piroli sitting in a Chevrolet Lumina belonging to St. 
Peter Claver Church with a man named Israel Palacios, $10,000 in small bills 
and small amounts of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles prosecutors dropped drug charges because the amounts were too 
small to warrant a case. Simi Valley police picked up the embezzlement 
investigation and filed the case with the Ventura County district attorney. The 
county's grand jury indicted Piroli on two counts of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Piroli trial unfolds, jurors may hear McKeon, former pastor of St. 
Peter Claver, describe how he bailed an agitated Piroli out of the Hollywood 
police lockup after the arrest, only to have him disappear a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be told that while Piroli was missing, church officials discovered 
another $50,000 in small bills and parishioners' donation checks in his room at 
the rectory -- although the judge said he will not allow jurors to hear 
evidence that gay pornography, fireworks and a switchblade knife also were 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 And they will hear testimony about the priest's arrest six weeks later at the 
California-Mexico border, where immigration officers told reporters they caught 
him driving in from Mexico with two illegal immigrants -- one of them Palacios. 
However, Steele said he will not allow testimony that the men were found in the 
car trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said he will let defense attorney Richard Beada give evidence and 
argue that McKeon framed Piroli because he feared that the younger priest would 
blow the whistle on him. But Steele refused to let Beada introduce evidence 
that the lawyer said would back his claim that McKeon was seen at a gay 
bathhouse in West Hollywood and that the money was taken to finance a secret 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Peace said in court she hopes to prove that 
Piroli was fleecing his flock at both churches -- he was assistant pastor at 
Sacred Heart from 1986 to 1990 and at St. Peter Claver until 1992 -- to finance 
a drug habit and his friendship with Palacios. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace secured the judge's permission to show jurors a photo Piroli had of 
Palacios clad only in swim trunks, although Steele said he will not let a 
police officer testify that Palacios is a male prostitute unless Peace presents 
evidence of a criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelations after Piroli's 1992 arrest and the counter-charges he made 
against his former superior have saddened his former parishioners, church 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli's former flock is ready to forgive and forget, said Father Dennis 
Mongrain, the new pastor at St. Peter Claver. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church is a community of human people, and we are all weak and wounded in 
our lives. We need God's help and his healing," Mongrain said. "When we look at 
Father Dave and Father Jim, we see a little of ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Parishioners seem to be praying for Piroli and McKeon, particularly in light 
of last week's allegations, said Richard Hamm, a parish deacon. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the priests are no longer with the parish -- Piroli was suspended 
after his arrest and McKeon was transferred in June to a post as senior priest 
at St. Jude the Apostle Catholic Church in Westlake Village -- the people are 
distancing themselves from the case, Hamm said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a long time in people's lives, and time heals," he said. "It's 
becoming the idea that this is happening someplace else and not to us as 
individuals. . . . It will be a real blessing when this is over and we can get 
on with our parish life." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the church seems to be prospering in the wake of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Parish enrollment is up from 1,500 families to 2,000, and the parish seems 
filled with new life, Hamm said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the church was in itself ready for change," said Jim Carper, 
president of the parish council. "What happened was shocking, but I think the 
groundwork has been laid for the growth. With Father Dennis arriving on the 
scene, it was like Shakespeare arriving at the Elizabethan theater. . . . I 
just think the time was ripe." 
</P>
<P>
 As for St. Jude's, Father McKeon's new parish, churchgoers were dismayed about 
the charges against Piroli and the countercharges he has leveled against their 
senior priest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't appreciate it," one parishioner said, declining to give his name. 
"It's not something I'd expect out of a priest." 
</P>
<P>
 "It just doesn't seem possible that one priest could set up another," said 
John Schmidt, a parishioner from Westlake Village. "You'd hope they'd be above 
that, as priests, especially for the children's sake. They don't know that some 
priests really do have feet of clay -- they're more human than we'd like them 
to be."

ITALY PARLIAMENT DISSOLVED; ELECTIONS SET FOR MARCH 27; EUROPE: THE PRIME 
MINISTER WILL REMAIN IN A CARETAKER ROLE. JEWISH LEADERS PROTEST THE VOTE 
COINCIDES WITH PASSOVER.

<P>
 After two years of tumult that eroded confidence in national leadership, Italy 
turned toward a new and uncertain political future Sunday as President Oscar 
Luigi Scalfaro dissolved a scandal-tarred Parliament and a lame-duck government 
summoned voters to landmark elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The March 27 vote will mark the end of a closely held political system that 
has ruled Italy in increasing prosperity and corruption since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Italians say the First Republic, born in the aftermath of war and fascism, is 
dead. In March, they will choose new faces under new rules to launch the Second 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Climaxing weeks of maneuvering, on a wet, blustery Sunday, Scalfaro asked 
apolitical Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and his technocrat government to 
remain in office until the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalfaro rejected a resignation that Ciampi proffered Thursday, meaning that 
the former Central Bank governor can remain in office without having to seek a 
new majority. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian president agreed with Ciampi, however, that it is time for 
elections, citing "unequivocal facts that require early dissolution of 
Parliament." 
</P>
<P>
 Among them, Scalfaro cited 80% support for electoral reform in a referendum 
last April and results in June and December municipal elections demonstrating 
that the Parliament no longer accurately represents political sentiment in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The four Establishment parties led by the Christian Democrats that hold the 
parliamentary majority, all of them tarnished by scandal, were overwhelmed in 
the mayoral votes by insurgents of the left and right. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalfaro also cited the demands of justice as one of his reasons for 
dissolving the Parliament: Nearly one-third of the 630 deputies and 315 elected 
senators face charges ranging from corruption to Mafia association but are 
protected by immunity while Parliament is in session. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 business leaders, politicians and public officials have been 
ensnared so far in a two-year investigation into massive kickbacks for public 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word now passes to the voters," Scalfaro said in a letter to 
parliamentary leaders decreeing the dissolution of the 21-month-old 
legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-hour Cabinet meeting chaired by Ciampi on Sunday set the March 27 date 
for the country's voters, triggering an immediate protest from members of 
Italy's small Jewish community and sympathetic opposition parties: Passover 
begins that day. The nation's 30,000 Jewish voters must choose between 
religious obligation and civic responsibility in deciding whether to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will have to follow their conscience," said Tullia Zevi, president of 
the Italian Jewish community. "Even in Italy it is clear that although all 
religions are equal, some religions are more equal than others." 
</P>
<P>
 Italian national television said that Ciampi went to the home of Italy's chief 
rabbi Sunday night to apologize and to explain that the March 27 date was in 
effect imposed on his government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suffered for not having been able to reconcile the needs of everyone," 
Ciampi told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The constitution requires an election within 70 days of the dissolution of 
Parliament, and Ciampi was warned by government election experts that to call 
it earlier might jeopardize Italians' ability to vote in some cities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Normally complex ballots will be even more convoluted in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid a surge of new parties, two-thirds of the deputies and senators will be 
elected directly, U.S.-style, for the first time, while the remainder will be 
chosen under the old system of proportional representation that has produced 52 
weak coalition governments since World War II, all of them dominated by the 
now-disgraced Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a new and very complicated (electoral) law," said Paolo Barile, the 
Cabinet minister responsible for relations with Parliament. He said that to 
have held the elections March 20, the alternative date, "would have been very 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Communists, neo-fascists, northern-based separatists and reformers 
clamoring for a piece of the political center all hope to prosper in March at 
the expense of the Christian Democrats and their allies.

THOUSANDS IN PARIS PROTEST PUBLIC SCHOOL PLAN; FRANCE: ATTEMPTS TO FUND REPAIRS 
AT PRIVATE SCHOOLS ANGER PARENTS, TEACHERS AND STUDENTS. THE MARCH IS ALSO A 
SHOW OF STRENGTH FOR LEFTISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hundreds of thousands of French parents, teachers and students marched down a 
cold, rainy boulevard in Paris on Sunday, staging the largest political 
demonstration in nearly a decade to protest attempts by the conservative 
government to increase state funding for private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The procession was the first significant show of strength for the leftist 
opposition in France since it was ousted by conservatives in decisive elections 
last April. And it was a warning to Edouard Balladur, the popular prime 
minister, that he must tread carefully when tampering with education -- long 
one of France's political minefields. 
</P>
<P>
 The march originally had been organized to protest a government law, announced 
late last month, that lifted a 140-year-old limit on local government spending 
for private-school repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Balladur later tried to soften the new law by promising a new financial boost 
for public schools. But the law was annulled last week by the Constitutional 
Council, France's supreme court, which said the law did not guarantee equal 
treatment to public and private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of charter buses and trains from the provinces fed the vibrant 
procession, which began at the Place de la Republique in central Paris and 
stretched four miles southeast along Boulevard Voltaire to the Place de la 
Nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers, including Socialists, Communists and teachers unions, estimated 
the crowd at 1 million. Police said the crowd numbered about 250,000, making it 
the largest demonstration in France since 1986.  
</P>
<P>
 Marchers, bundled up in heavy coats and rain slickers and lugging umbrellas, 
sang and carried colorful, hand-lettered signs reading "Private Schools -- The 
Priests Must Fork Out," "People Stand Up -- Your School Is in Danger" and 
"Public Money for Public Schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Others singled out Education Minister Francois Bayrou for scorn. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, Mr. Bayrou, the Money of Public Schools Is Not Yours," read one sign. 
"Saint Bayrou's Gospel: Have Pity for the Rich," read another. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government must first help state schools," said Jean-Pierre Broudic, a 
50-year-old salesman from Brittany, where more than 40% of pupils go to private 
schools. "We are defending the schools for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Rene Pichard, 35, also from Brittany, added: "We're here to show the 
government that we are ready to fight for the defense of state schools. They 
are the schools of the French Revolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, 17% of the country's pupils attend private schools, most of which 
are Catholic. Most of those schools already receive all their operating funds 
from the state, amounting to 13% of the national education budget, under an 
agreement in which they promise to use the government syllabus and admit 
children of any religion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the law only allowed local authorities to pay for up to 10% of 
private-school repairs and infrastructure.  
</P>
<P>
 Balladur's attempt to increase infrastructure spending for private schools 
reignited a long battle over education in France, which has a tradition of 
high-quality secular public schools that are free to all residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts said Balladur's government may have underestimated the 
nation's sensitivity to the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 School and college reforms have sparked violent clashes in 1968, 1984 and 
1986. And now, with unemployment already 12% and showing no signs of abating, 
many French fear that any reduction in state spending on public education will 
make it even more difficult for their children to get jobs after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has not indicated whether it intends to try again to increase 
private education spending with a new law that sidesteps the constitutional 
objections. But it is under pressure to meet an election pledge to equalize 
school financing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The issue provided an opportunity for the left-wing opposition, which has been 
largely silent in the face of Balladur's high ratings in the opinion polls, to 
rejoin the country's political fray. Socialist leader Michel Rocard and other 
opposition figures were at the front of the march Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to stay vigilant," said Marie-Annick Kipman, a 60-year-old Paris 
psychiatrist and mother of four. "We cannot let them destroy the school of 
equality. We must defend the right for school for everybody, and not a school 
based on money."

 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said he wants a general amnesty for all 
sides in a conflict in the southern state of Chiapas and ordered a special 
session of the Mexican Congress to consider the plan. He said the offer will 
give rebels who launched a New Year's Day uprising for indigenous rights no 
excuse not to lay down their arms. The newspaper La Jornada said the rebels, 
known as the Zapatista National Liberation Army, will respond to the 
government's call for dialogue soon and listed some of their goals.

 Secretary of State Warren Christopher said exiled Haitian President

workable." Interviewed on NBC's "Meet the Press" from Geneva, Christopher said, 
"I think the establishment of that kind of deadline probably is not workable at 
the present time, although we'll continue to help President Aristide." He 
added: "I think we're not going to commit to that kind of deadline."

 The Pan-Africanist Congress, a militant black party suspected by police of 
carrying out several high-profile terrorist attacks on whites in the last year, 
announced that it is suspending its armed struggle. The decision clears the way 
for the party to take part in South Africa's first universal suffrage election 
on April 27, and for its armed wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army, to 
join a 10,000-member, multi-party national peacekeeping force scheduled to 
begin training later this month. Party President Clarence Makwetu said his 
organization had made the move "because of our commitment to peace and free and 
fair elections."

WASHINGTON INSIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
 VETS UP IN ARMS: A political fireball as hot as the controversy over 
homosexuals in the military may be White House-bound. Veterans are furious over 
reports that the Clinton Administration is moving toward lifting the economic 
embargo on Vietnam. . . . The American Legion is mobilizing its troops and 
lining up other groups for a massive telephone and letter-writing protest to 
President Clinton and members of Congress. "This is an unprecedented 
grass-roots effort for us," said Phil Budahn, a spokesman for the American 
Legion, which has 3.1 million members in 16,000 posts. . . . Some officials say 
easing of the embargo is justified by recent Vietnamese efforts to determine 
the fate of missing Americans. Business groups are also pushing for access to 
Vietnamese markets. But many veterans want to keep pressing Vietnam to account 
for prisoners of war and those missing in action. . . . Warming to the debate 
ahead, American Legion National Cmdr. Bruce Thiesen wrote Clinton: "It's 
ghoulish that American business, in its thirst for making a buck, will be 
allowed to make the final decision on our POWs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 OUT OF THE LOOP: For better or worse, President Clinton likes to be 
Micro-manager Clinton. So the boss was not pleased when he found out in a 
newspaper that his Administration was going to require states to pay for 
abortions for poor women in cases of rape or incest. . . . Clinton previously 
had said publicly that states would have flexibility on this. But he wasn't 
consulted when a unit of the Department of Health and Human Services declared 
that Medicaid would pay for these abortions no matter what. The ruling 
conflicted with laws in up to 30 states. Clinton went ballistic when he found 
out, sources say, but decided not to reverse the policy. But he ordered his 
aides never to let this sort of thing happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 LESS THAN A HOME RUN: Czech-born Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the 
United Nations, was trying to persuade skeptical East Europeans to accept 
Clinton's offer of association with NATO instead of full membership in the 
security body. Insisting membership was still in their future, Albright told 
the officials that "the ball is on the field . . . and it's up to them now to 
pick it up and move to score." But, she said in a PBS interview, she is not 
sure the analogy worked "because they don't play football. . . . They're more 
into soccer." Touching the ball with your hands is a foul in soccer. If you 
pick up the ball, you don't score; you lose possession. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 WHOSE FAULT?So why was it that Justice Department officials were unconcerned 
that a New York State Police evidence-tampering scandal might hurt the 
nomination of the agency's superintendent, Thomas Constantine, as head of the 
Drug Enforcement Administration? Partly because it was the Justice Department's 
fault that Constantine didn't get wind of the scandal until a year after it 
began. It happened like this: A State Police investigator bragged during a CIA 
employment interview three years ago about faking fingerprints to help solve a 
crime. The CIA gave the information to the FBI, which relayed it to the Justice 
Department. But it ended up in the computer of a paralegal who left the 
department, and it wasn't uncovered until the employee's superiors got around 
to seeing what work had been left behind.

AMERICAN ALBUM: NEW TOLL 'GREENWAY' TO EASE D.C. COMMUTE; THE PROFITABLE,

 It used to require a special occasion for folks in Leesburg to travel to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 And only on weekends and summer sojourns did residents of the nation's capital 
come out to this picturesque old town in the foothills of the Blue Ridge. It 
was not intended to be a suburb. It was not created with the automobile in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, like communities from the mountains to the Chesapeake Bay, Leesburg 
has become a place where Washington's political people, business workers and 
federal civil servants retreat for a short night's sleep between workdays. 
</P>
<P>
 During the winter months, the morning rush into the center of the urban sprawl 
begins before dawn. Bridges crossing the Potomac River into Washington are more 
than an hour and as many as 23 traffic lights away. Congestion thickens with 
each passing month, and the lines of pull-up-and-stop traffic stretch for miles 
behind wrecks and bottlenecks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the harassed commuters of Leesburg and points west have the word of 
retired Army Corps of Engineers Maj. Gen. Charles E. Williams that come March, 
1996, the trip from here to Washington will be reduced to about 32 minutes. And 
that, he says, should be good news all across America. 
</P>
<P>
 Private investors have set out to build a 14-mile, $326-million road from 
Dulles International Airport to Leesburg, figuring eventually to turn handsome 
profits from motorists who will be charged $1.75 for the quick trip through the 
rolling Virginia countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is the ramrod for the undertaking, which he offers as a model for all 
states now seeing their highway budgets consumed by the upkeep of aging bridges 
and deteriorating roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the country is watching what is happening here," he said as an army of 
road-building machines marched across a Loudon County dairy farm last week. 
"With 45% of the dollar going to maintenance, the state of Virginia does not 
have enough money to build new infrastructure. This represents a new business, 
a new way of doing infrastructure projects." 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in Toll Road Investors Partnership II and their bankers pin their 
high expectations on Williams' ability to cut red tape and bring extraordinary 
efficiency to the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he has not disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Work, begun Sept. 29, is ahead of schedule. Right-of-way clearing has been 
completed. Sixteen bridges are under construction. Brown & Root Construction 
Co., working under a $145-million contract, has 114 pieces of heavy equipment 
deployed along the route. Work goes forward six days a week in two 10-hour 
shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Unexpected snags that might otherwise take weeks are resolved in hours, 
project participants say. How? By having designers, bankers, insurers and state 
officials on site with the contractors and the owners' management team, headed 
by Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 On the environmental front, project officials took the offensive early. They 
are attempting to mitigate their destruction of 64 acres of wetlands by 
reclaiming a nearby 125-acre wetland site that had been destroyed by farming 
operations years ago. Along a stretch where a sound barrier is needed, they 
plan to create tree-covered dirt berms rather than erect metal or masonry 
walls. They are not even calling their road a road. Officially, it is the 
Dulles Greenway. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams promises that the new link will not only shorten the trip from 
Leesburg into the Washington area, but will also make it pleasant. The roadway 
will be tree-lined, and its interchanges will be surrounded by flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging that growth will overtake the new road as it has all the others, 
designers provided a right of way broad enough for two additional lanes in the 
future, with enough space left to add a railway. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a limited partnership in Orange County has built privately owned toll 
lanes along 10 miles of the Riverside Freeway, Williams says the United States 
has seen nothing like the Virginia project in a century. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are talking about creating a right of way and building a new, 
privately owned road from scratch, this is the first time that has happened in 
your country and mine in more than 100 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal highway officials say they cannot confirm this, but they see clear 
signs of a comeback for privately owned toll roads. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pressures to find new means of financing roads have mounted steadily since the 
1980s. Several states have adopted legislation explicitly permitting private 
highway projects. The 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act 
allows the allocation of federal funds to such efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams says his office receives "oodles of calls" from potential investors 
and others interested in imitating the Dulles Greenway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody will win in these things," he said, "the state, the public, 
developers, investors. It's an idea that's not going to die. Its time has 
come."

THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS -- A PATH TO PEACE?; ISRAEL RESERVES JUDGMENT ON ASSAD'S 
OFFER; REACTION: PREMIER AND FOREIGN MINISTER SAY THEY WANT MORE DETAILS BEFORE 
RESPONDING. THEY QUESTION DEFINITION OF 'PEACE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel liked the tone of Syrian President Hafez Assad's comments about peace 
between their countries but is reserving judgment on whether this was the 
strategic breakthrough for which the whole Middle East has been waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general tone was positive, but it is still not clear what he means by 
peace," Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said of Assad's statement after his 
meeting with President Clinton in Geneva. "Does it mean full diplomatic 
relations, open borders and free trade? We will have to wait for full details." 
</P>
<P>
 Two senior U.S. envoys were to brief Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Peres 
overnight on the details of Clinton's talks with Assad. Further discussions 
were planned for today, and officials said Israel will then begin to formulate 
its response to Assad. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin, challenged by both Assad and Clinton to make the "peace of the 
brave" after 45 years of hostility, said, "I believe that I, as a prime 
minister, and the government of Israel have proven by now that we are ready to 
take brave steps. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only question is, what is the definition of a brave step and what brave 
steps are taken by our partners in the peace negotiations -- the Arab 
partners?" Rabin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, clearly cautious despite Clinton's assertion that Assad is committed to 
peace and normal relations between Israel and Syria, said: "I need to hear it 
from Assad too. Normalization has been mentioned by Syria in the past. The 
question is, how close it is to the concept of peace, what agenda is there for 
achieving peace and at what price from Israel?" 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and Syria have been negotiating terms of a peace treaty since October, 
1991, but the talks have stalled over the issue of the Golan Heights, captured 
by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria demands full withdrawal in return for peace. Israel has said it could 
make limited pullbacks but wants a commitment to total peace, with full 
diplomatic relations, open borders and free trade between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to the Clinton-Assad press conference, which was broadcast 
live from Geneva on Israeli radio and television, Peres said that even with his 
continued vagueness, Assad appeared to have done "the required minimum" to make 
the meeting with Clinton a success but "not the obligatory maximum" needed for 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Assad's speech contained no elements we have not heard before, but his 
answers (to press conference questions) did -- a little more," Peres said. "It 
is still too early to translate (this) into the language of negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 His hope, Peres continued, was that Assad said much more to Clinton in their 
talks and that the two U.S. envoys -- Dennis Ross, the State Department's peace 
talks coordinator, and Martin Indyk, the Mideast specialist at the National 
Security Council -- would bring those details. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Benjamin Netanyahu, chairman of the opposition Likud Party, charged that 
Rabin is already prepared "to give Assad all the Golan Heights . . . and that 
will not bring peace." 
</P>
<P>
 "If (the government is) interpreting peace as meaning some scrap paper that 
Hafez Assad has to give us, a peace treaty, and a couple of embassies and for a 
moment open borders -- well, tomorrow he can close the embassies and tear the 
paper to shreds, as has happened many times among the Arabs themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "There can only be peace if we stay on the Golan," Netanyahu said. "Peace 
without the Golan will not be peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Dovish ministers in the Rabin Cabinet were already moving ahead, however, to 
advocate a Rabin-Assad summit and, if the terms are right, full Israeli 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have said many times in the past that if President Assad will be ready to 
establish full peace with Israel with strict security arrangements on the Golan 
Heights, Israel should be ready to give up its sovereignty over the Golan 
Heights," Environment Minister Yossi Sarid of the leftist Meretz bloc said 
after the weekly Cabinet meeting here. 
</P>
<P>
 Other, more conservative ministers said the doves were going too far and 
undermining Israel's negotiating position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that wisdom obligates silence and restraint," said Economics Minister 
Shimon Shetreet, considered a hawk among Labor Party ministers. "These kind of 
expressions create on the other side expectations that we are ready to 
concede." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Israeli settlers in the Golan Heights clashed with police, burned 
tires and blocked the main road into the region Sunday to protest any 
withdrawal. The police and demonstrators exchanged blows when the police tried 
to push them to the side of a road near the town of Katzrin.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WITH VAUNTED STAMINA, ASSAD SITS OUT REST BREAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD T. COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to one-on-one diplomacy, Syrian President Hafez Assad is a man 
famous for his physical stamina, particularly his ability to sit at the 
negotiating table for so long without taking a break that he seems to defy the 
laws of human physiology. 
</P>
<P>
 In Geneva, the U.S. team was determined to match his prowess, but, alas, 
President Clinton failed the test. The first negotiating session ran from 10:08 
a.m. to 2:26 p.m.; Clinton had to excuse himself briefly at 1:45 p.m. -- after 
only 3 hours and 37 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, at a joint press appearance with Assad, Clinton praised the Syrian 
leader not only for his positive contribution to the Middle East peace process 
but for his endurance. "I had heard a lot about President Assad's legendary 
stamina in these meetings," Clinton said, drawing a burst of knowing laughter. 
"I can tell you that his reputation does not exceed the reality." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Weighty affairs of state are the reason summit meetings exist, of course, but 
every summit caravan has lesser purposes as well -- not the least among them 
shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 The appetite for bargains and mementos among the several hundred aides, 
technicians and others who accompany the President on such trips is voracious. 
So voracious that the pocket-size guidebooks issued by the government at every 
stop include not only guidance on local water supplies and medical emergencies 
but tips on where to shop and what to look for. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Clinton trip to Eastern Europe and Moscow, Russia's famed fur hats were 
high on the list of sought-after items. Eager buyers scouted them out in the 
Czech capital of Prague, in Moscow and even in the relatively barren bazaars of 
Minsk, in Belarus. 
</P>
<P>
 By Sunday evening, the most distinctive thing about the treasured hats was 
that some were developing an ominous smell. The problem, it seems, was that 
newly minted entrepreneurs had moved a tad too quickly to meet the surge in 
demand -- omitting the more time-consuming steps in the tanning process. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back in Moscow, post-summit analysts were pondering the latest 
additions to the rowdy dossier of Russian ultranationalist Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the arrangements for a network interview, Zhirinovsky and his 
supporters were provided with a hotel suite. They promptly ordered up $4,200 
worth of room service. 
</P>
<P>
 And they were reportedly seen leaving the hotel with some of the furniture.

 Water mains and power lines snapped and people stayed indoors across parts of 
the East on Sunday as temperatures fell to record lows as far south as the 
Carolinas. At least two deaths were attributed to the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Searchers on Sunday found the body of a hiker who was believed to have frozen 
to death in his sleeping bag on New Hampshire's Mt. Jefferson. The temperature 
was 30 below with wind gusts to 90 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 In Eagle Grove, Iowa, an elderly man with Alzheimer's disease wandered away 
from his home early Sunday and died from exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures hit record lows Sunday from the Great Lakes to the Carolinas, 
including 28 degrees below zero at Alpena, Mich.; 17 below at Syracuse, N.Y.; 
18 below at Elkins, W. Va.; 1 below at Asheville, N.C., and 6 above at 
Greenville-Spartanburg, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Watertown, N.Y., chilled to 43 below early Sunday, the coldest spot in the 
Lower 48 states, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
 About a fourth of the residents of Hallock in northwestern Minnesota trudged 
to neighbors' homes and the City Hall for water Sunday after a water tower pipe 
froze and water mains broke following days of subzero temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The town of about 1,300 people 20 miles south of the Canadian border has had 
temperatures below zero for days. 
</P>
<P>
 Subzero temperatures in much of West Virginia left 7,000 Appalachian Power Co. 
customers without service Sunday, spokesman Jack Shaver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Snapped power lines knocked out service to 6,200 customers in southeastern 
Michigan, Detroit Edison Co. said. 
</P>
<P>
 In eastern Kentucky, about 330 South Williamson residents lost gas heat early 
Sunday when a pipeline froze. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearby Belfry, Ky., a shelter for people without heat was set up at the 
courthouse.

A SIGN-ON, A MOUSE, VOILA -- IT'S YOUR NEWSPAPER!; INFORMATION: THE FUTURE IS 
NOW AT THE SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS WITH AN ARRAY OF FEATURES BY WAY OF A PERSONAL 
COMPUTER. 
</P>

<P>
 You want to take a look at the newspaper of the future? 
</P>
<P>
 You'll need an America Online disk, a personal computer and a modem. Sign on, 
and three clicks of your mouse get you to Mercury Center, the cyberspace home 
of the San Jose Mercury News. 
</P>
<P>
 On screen, you're facing a colorful array of icons representing different 
features: "Entertainment," "Sports," "Communication" and others. For the 
moment, though, ignore the pretty pictures and turn your attention to the 
"What's New Today" box -- a list of regularly updated breaking news stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another Storm Blowing In." Hmm. You scan the first three paragraphs. You get 
the idea. You're ready to move on. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But wait. The hourglass icon pops on the screen. This is the symbol that tells 
you -- albeit in a cute, graphic sort of way -- that the computer is moving 
more slowly than you are. It's not ready to take your next command. The delay 
lasts only a few seconds, but it's maddening. It underscores just how quickly 
your eye moves down the page of a newspaper, grazing for tidbits of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 And where are the cues to guide your eye? Cartoony symbols are the only 
pictures. The computer screen, with its seemingly endless series of windows -- 
it takes four additional choose-and-clicks to get to a feature on "Wayne's 
World" -- seems cramped. And all the headlines are the same size. How are you 
supposed to tell which stories are most important? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe that's not so bad. Here on the "information superhighway," you get 
to decide for yourself what's important. That nine-inch story on the Oxnard 
slayings in the Dec. 4 issue not enough for your sensationalist sensibilities? 
Type in a code listed at the bottom of the article and read more about how the 
suspect once ran for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 It's stuff like that -- the features you can't get in a regular newspaper -- 
that make this electronic paper so cool. 
</P>
<P>
 You can see stock quotes in almost real time. If you know what you're looking 
for, you can type in the subject and get all the relevant stories. (Except, for 
no apparent reason, your search for Michael Jackson stories comes up with a 
list including, "Bromeliads Easy to Grow.") You can pull up articles from back 
issues without spending hours in the library -- though it does cost an extra 80 
cents per minute. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in what amounts to genuine interactivity, you can talk to reporters and 
editors and other readers. Check out some of the hundreds of posted messages 
from other users on subjects ranging from the Middle East to the comics, and 
you begin to think maybe this could be better than a newspaper, or at least 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 But then you remember the time. 
</P>
<P>
 At $9.95 a month for America Online -- plus $3.50 an hour after the first five 
hours -- you're not going to wait around for the digital sand to sift through 
that hourglass. And as you read the dozens of suggestions to editors posted on 
the Mercury Center's "Feedback" bulletin board, you wonder why they don't just 
concentrate on improving the newsprint edition. 
</P>
<P>
 As one reader puts it: "I would like to request more news, more articles, more 
pictures, more of everything except advertising on Sundays."

 The closest possible thing to a Beatles reunion will happen next month when 
the three surviving members of the group go into the studio to record new 
music, the New Yorker magazine reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr plan to record new music, not 
remake Beatles songs, the magazine says in its Jan. 24 issue, citing two 
unidentified sources at the Beatles' record label, EMI.The fourth Beatle, John 
Lennon, was murdered in New York City in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 EMI officials speaking on the record would not confirm or deny the reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Beatles also have decided to issue four to six compact discs of 
previously unreleased Beatles songs from their vaults at Abbey Road Studios in 
London, the magazine said.

DIVERSION OF WHITEWATER FUNDS DISPUTED; INQUIRY: LAWYER FOR HEAD OF DEFUNCT S&L 
SAYS THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOURCE OF CASH WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ACCOUNT SUBJECT TO 
REVIEW BY BANK EXAMINERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The attorney for a key figure in the controversial Whitewater land deal on 
Sunday insisted that funds from a failed Arkansas savings and loan could not 
have been diverted into Bill Clinton's gubernatorial campaign coffers without 
being noticed by a host of federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Heuer, attorney for James B. McDougal, the president of the defunct 
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, said the only possible source of diverted 
funds would be Madison Guaranty's "cash account" -- a pot of money that Heuer 
said "is the first thing the (bank) examiners look at." 
</P>
<P>
 Bank examiners, FBI agents and Justice Department attorneys "pored over" the 
account's records and McDougal "would have been very quickly charged at that 
point in time with criminal activity had any money been diverted," Heuer said 
on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Heuer was commenting on one of the central questions surrounding the tangled 
land deal in which President Clinton, his wife and McDougal were investors: 
whether Clinton's 1984 gubernatorial campaign benefited financially from his 
relationship with McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the remarks left unanswered some of the Whitewater deal's other mysteries, 
including whether then-Gov. Clinton may have acted to shore up the failing 
thrift, which was seized by regulators in 1989, to help his business partner. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, the Administration stepped up efforts to put the 
Whitewater affair behind it following a decision last week to ask Atty. Gen. 
Janet Reno to name a special counsel to investigate the Clintons' role. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," presidential counselor David Gergen, 
reviewing the White House's handling of the Whitewater affair, acknowledged 
that "there are some things we would have done differently," but he said that 
"we've dealt with it, we're moving on." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "We really don't plan to be talking about it very much from the 
White House. We don't see the need for it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two key Republicans suggested that there will be limits to the GOP effort to 
probe the politically charged affair. Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), 
who has called for a congressional investigation into the matter, said that "we 
need to wait and see" who is appointed as special counsel. "That may change the 
attitude some." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Dole made clear that Republicans pressing for a 
congressional inquiry are seeking to turn the tables on congressional 
Democrats, who conducted a total of 18 investigations into alleged presidential 
wrongdoing during the Ronald Reagan and George Bush administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the bottom line here is the Democrats will investigate Republicans, 
as they did 18 times in 12 years . . . but Democrats in Congress aren't going 
to investigate Democratic administrations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), who has been one of the key GOP figures raising 
questions about the Whitewater affair, pledged to proceed on his own if the 
Democrats refuse to create a bipartisan panel to investigate Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he will not seek testimony from First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, 
who was Madison Guaranty's attorney at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing would be more inappropriate than a congressional effort to embarrass 
Mrs. Clinton," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at a prior elected official, a current elected official," he 
said, referring to the President. 
</P>
<P>
 In pressing his case for a congressional probe, Leach, the ranking Republican 
on the House Banking Committee, noted that while a special counsel would focus 
on potentially criminal activity, Congress would be the appropriate body in 
which to air issues of "public trust." 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't the largest issue. It's somewhere between much ado about nothing 
and something might be a little rotten in part of the Ozarks," he told CBS-TV's 
"Face the Nation." "There are possible breaches of law, but more importantly, 
there's a public ethic here that's at issue." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Heuer disputed the suggestion that investigators will find breaches 
of law in documents turned over to investigators by McDougal and others 
involved in the Whitewater deal.

 Madison Guaranty's books were examined by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 
twice, once in 1984 and again in 1986, Heuer said. The institution was also 
investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Federal Savings and 
Loan Insurance Corp. and two independent accounting firms, as well as by 
attorneys of the Justice Department and the FBI, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any real major secrets in any of the Whitewater materials, 
and I would suspect, were there some secrets, we would have known about them 
long before now," Heuer said. 
</P>
<P>
 He likened public concern over the Clintons' relationship with McDougal to 
anti-Communist hysteria, and he chided journalists, who he said are making 
mountains out of "molehill issues." 
</P>
<P>
 "The linchpin of this whole thing seems to be the fact that Jim McDougal was a 
savings and loan executive, which is akin to being a Communist in the McCarthy 
era or a witch in the Salem era, and that's ludicrous," he said.

SECURITY GUARD IS SLAIN BY SWAT TEAM AFTER 4-HOUR STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 44-year-old security guard, reportedly despondent after his wife and 
daughter left him, was shot and killed by a Los Angeles police SWAT team early 
Sunday after a four-hour standoff during which he fired multiple rounds from 
inside his rented duplex near Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, identified by the Los Angeles County coroner's office as Turk 
Ellington, was shot once when he left the back door of the dwelling and pointed 
a loaded semiautomatic pistol at members of the Special Weapons and Tactics 
Team shortly after 1 a.m., police said.He collapsed and was pronounced dead at 
the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Ron Karlson said in a statement that police negotiators had been in 
phone contact with Ellington, who was threatening to commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation by the LAPD's officer-involved shooting team will be 
conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and neighbors in the 5400 block of West 99th Place, just off Century 
Boulevard and east of the airport, said they heard gunshots coming from inside 
the wood-frame duplex where Ellington lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was shooting off randomly," said Heather Fujikawa, who lives in the 
adjoining unit in the one-story duplex. 
</P>
<P>
 Fujikawa said she heard the first shot fired Saturday evening, not long after 
police arrived and Ellington told them to leave him alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was distraught. His wife left him," she said. "I guess he wanted to commit 
suicide."

ZINO DAVIDOFF; 'KING OF CIGARS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Zino Davidoff, the flamboyant Jewish emigre who made Havana cigars world 
famous, has died at the age of 87. 
</P>
<P>
 He died Friday, according to the Swiss newspaper Journal de Geneve, which said 
Sunday that his family had given them an obituary to publish today. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidoff, a longtime cigar connoisseur, was widely known as "King of the 
Cigars." His philosophy was "smoke less but better." 
</P>
<P>
 He said in a newspaper interview in 1991 that for him a good cigar was a 
"moment of pure dreaming." 
</P>
<P>
 He regularly took on the medical profession, arguing that good cigars in 
moderation were not harmful. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a cigar merchant, Davidoff was born in 1906 in Kiev, which is now 
the Ukrainian capital. His family left the country in 1911 for Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a company biography, one of the first customers at the family's 
new shop in Geneva was Vladimir Lenin, who spent seven years in Switzerland 
before returning to Russia in 1917 to lead the Communist revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1924, Davidoff left Switzerland for South America. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Argentina I learned the tango," he said. "I then got to know people who 
told me the only true tobacco was to be found in Havana. I stayed for a few 
years in Havana, where I learned everything I know about cigars." 
</P>
<P>
 Davidoff kept his Cuban suppliers for more than 40 years. During this time he 
built up an international business empire, selling his expensive, hand-rolled 
products to wealthy industrialists and bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1989, he switched to supplies from the nearby Dominican Republic, 
complaining about product quality in Cuba.

GYORGY CZIFFRA; RENOWNED PERFORMER OF LISZT'S WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hungarian-born pianist Gyorgy Cziffra, best known for his brilliant 
performances of Franz Liszt's rhapsodies, has died, relatives said Sunday. He 
was 72. 
</P>
<P>
 Cziffra died Saturday of a heart attack at a Paris hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Living in exile since the 1956 Soviet-led invasion of Hungary, Cziffra had a 
home in Senlis, northeast of Paris, where he ran a foundation for young 
musicians and artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Born of Gypsy descent in 1921 in Budapest, Cziffra started performing at an 
early age and rapidly gained international fame with his renditions of the 
works of Liszt, the 19th-Century Hungarian pianist and composer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cziffra made two major visits to Los Angeles -- performing at the Hollywood 
Bowl in 1957 and Pasadena's Ambassador Auditorium in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The pianist, Times writer Daniel Cariaga noted after the 1984 performance, 
"commands a technique of superlative digital and sound resources; plays the 
piano in an old-fashioned, improvisatory, irresistible manner and makes music 
almost offhandedly." 
</P>
<P>
 A prisoner of the Red Army during World War II, Cziffra was sentenced to three 
years forced labor in the 1950s for trying to escape from Communist Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
 He took his family into exile in 1956 and became a French citizen in 1968, 
adopting the French first name Georges. 
</P>
<P>
 The pianist recounted his life in a book, "Guns and Flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Cziffra's foundation, the Saint-Frambourg Royal Chapel, said 
he set it up in 1973 "to spare young artists the misery he lived through." 
</P>
<P>
 Cziffra also founded an annual music festival at the medieval abbey of La 
Chaise Dieu, in central France.

STREET SMART: SEARCHING FOR SOLUTIONS TO 'EPIDEMIC' OF HORN HONKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 We have an epidemic of horn honking in our neighborhood. It goes on all hours 
of the day and night. 
</P>
<P>
 When people come to pick up a neighbor, they announce their arrival by 
honking. We have suggested that a more considerate and lawful approach would be 
to get out of the car and knock on the door. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor even honks to summon her housekeeper when she arrives home. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Vehicle Code says a driver should sound the horn "when 
reasonably necessary to insure safe operation." It also states: "The horn shall 
not otherwise be used, except as a theft alarm system." 
</P>
<P>
 The indiscriminate use of a horn is inconsiderate and a nuisance. It 
trivializes its intended purposes. Perhaps some of your readers have been 
confronted with horn honkers and have a solution -- other than Valium or ear 
plugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric J. Brownson, Valley Village 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Honking a car horn to vent your anger or to save yourself a walk to the front 
door is indeed illegal. Unfortunately, catching flagrant horn honkers is 
probably not the highest priority for local police officers. Solving murders 
and robberies comes first. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, in your neighborhood, the Los Angeles Police Department's new 
community-based enforcement program may be able to help. James O'Riley, a 
senior lead officer at the North Hollywood Division, urges residents in his 
area to write down the license number of any driver who repeatedly speeds, 
loiters or disturbs the peace by honking a horn. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley typically sends a letter to the car's registered owner, warning that the 
driver will be cited if the illegal behavior continues. That often halts the 
problem. But if it continues, an officer may be sent to the neighborhood at a 
time when the violations most often occur, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Village residents such as yourself can start this process by calling 
the community relations staff at the North Hollywood station, (818) 989-8838. 
</P>
<P>
 If you'd rather not involve the police, you might ask a Neighborhood Watch 
chapter or other community group to help you curb the noise by urging the 
offender to quiet down. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, as you suggested, our readers may know some other tactics -- aside 
from ear plugs and Valium -- that can be used to quiet the neighborhood horn 
honkers. How about it, readers? If you have a suggestion, contact Street Smart 
via the directions at the end of this column, and we'll print the best ideas. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 You have published the toll-free numbers we can call to report cars emitting 
excessive exhaust and to report drivers who do not have their small children 
secured in child seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is there no phone number to report vehicles that do not have current 
registration tags on their license plates? Or is there such a number? 
</P>
<P>
 Saul H. Davis, Studio City 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time, the California Department of Motor Vehicles did run a 
toll-free hot line that allowed you to anonymously report cars with expired 
plates. But the line was discontinued, says DMV spokesman Bill Madison, because 
"we did not get enough calls on it to justify the cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, judging by recent letters to Street Smart, drivers with expired 
plates are a source of great irritation to many motorists who pay their 
registration fees on time. 
</P>
<P>
 And people who don't pay pose a big problem for the state. "We have about a 
million delinquent vehicle registration renewal accounts every year, valued at 
$187 million," Madison says. 
</P>
<P>
 His agency is trying to recover more of this money. In September, a new state 
law turned over the DMV's overdue collections to the state Franchise Tax Board, 
which has broader legal powers, such as going after a driver's bank account, 
real estate or income tax refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tax Board has estimated that it can collect more than $51 million in 
overdue vehicle registration fees annually, Madison says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no hot line to report outdated plates, you can call 
attention to suspected violators by writing to DMV, Revenue Services-Policy and 
Procedures, MS H148, 2415 First Ave., Sacramento, CA 95818. Include the license 
number and make of the car, plus the driver's address, if you know it. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Freeway serves thousands of commuters in the Chatsworth area 
every day, including several large businesses such as The Times. But the 
Winnetka Avenue off-ramp is still closed. 
</P>
<P>
 This badly needed exit has already been built and would feed into a four-lane 
street that runs north and south through the Valley, except for a few short 
blocks in an expensive private neighborhood between the freeway and Devonshire 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you find out why this taxpayer-funded resource is not available to the 
public? 
</P>
<P>
 John Bruther, Woodland Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 This question pops up quite often, possibly because so many Valley motorists 
pass the "ramps to nowhere" every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a quick refresher: The $1-million ramps, built in 1982, were never 
opened because of a dispute about whether Winnetka Avenue should be extended 
south of the freeway through a gated community, Monteria Estates. The city did 
not own the right of way, and the homeowners did not want a stream of cars in 
their midst. 
</P>
<P>
 Greig Smith, chief deputy for Councilman Hal Bernson, says the city could 
force a land sale through eminent domain powers. But he says the cost of the 
property and the legal expenses would be far too high. Thus, there are no plans 
to extend Winnetka Avenue south of the freeway in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Porter Ranch Development Co., which is building a huge housing 
and commercial project north of the freeway, is obligated to pay for completion 
of the northbound freeway ramps at Winnetka. 
</P>
<P>
 The work is linked to the sale of nearby houses. Because of the sluggish real 
estate market, the ramps probably won't be open for another 12 to 18 months, 
estimates Larry Calemine, a spokesman for the developer. 
</P>
<P>
 When the ramps do open, you'll be able to drive north on Winnetka -- but you 
still won't be able to go south through Monteria Estates. For southbound 
drivers, the builder will extend Rinaldi Street from Corbin Avenue to Winnetka. 
You'll have to take Rinaldi east to Tampa Avenue and then head south. 
</P>
<P>
 In the more distant future, Rinaldi will be extended west to Mason Avenue, 
which also runs north and south. And when some new houses are built along 
Corbin Avenue, just south of the freeway, the developers will be required to 
finish that road, adding yet another north-south route.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: GETTING INVOLVED; 
'BORDER PEACE PATROL AFFIRMS NONVIOLENCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDITH T. COLE, Edith T. Cole is member of the Claremont Monthly Meeting of 
the Religious Society of Friends. Anyone interested in walking with the Border 
Peace Patrol can call (909) 626-0371. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When people inquire about our Border Peace Patrol, they usually do so with 
that indulgent smile reserved for the projects of enthusiasts and small 
children. But the patrol is alive and well and is celebrating its third 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1991, a small group of members of the Religious Society of Friends 
(Quakers) met in San Ysidro to walk along the U.S./Mexico border to learn more 
about the situation and possibly help to reduce the level of violence by our 
presence. We thought Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday an appropriate 
starting date. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that time, members of the Border Peace Patrol, wearing arm bands and 
walking in groups of two or three, have continued along various sections of the 
16-mile border at least once a month. 
</P>
<P>
 We talk to U.S. Border Patrol agents as well as to the people waiting to 
cross. Both sides tell us about some of their problems: The migrants share 
uncertainties about their future and their fears of being caught or mistreated 
by the migra . The agents tell us about the frustrations and perils of their 
job, from busted knees and back injuries suffered trying to apprehend border 
crossers in rough terrain to worries about migrants drowning in the Tijuana 
flood waters or women and small children endangered by wading through the 
sewage-polluted channel. 
</P>
<P>
 We do not pretend to offer any solutions to the complex issues of illegal 
immigration and law enforcement. We try simply to be present at the border in a 
manner that approaches all the participants in this drama with respect and 
compassion and affirms our belief that conflicts can be resolved without 
violence and abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 50 people have come to walk with us and gain some first-hand 
experience about border issues. For many, our commitment to a strictly 
nonpartisan attitude has been difficult to understand. They tend to see the 
border issues mostly in black and white -- as a conflict between absolute right 
or wrong, which has to be addressed by confrontation with the "evil" party. We 
try to point out what we see: that systemic violence is inherent in a situation 
that defines human beings as "illegal aliens" and charges others with the 
responsibility to hunt them down for no other crime than crossing a line. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, have you been successful?" we are asked. I guess the answer depends on 
how success is defined. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still only a handful of Border Peace Patrol members who are able to 
walk with some regularity. And the heavy fortification of the border with high 
steel fences has made contact with the people waiting to cross much more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 But we have found the defensiveness of the Border Patrol agents give way to 
generally friendly and occasionally serious conversations and encounters. The 
migrants tell us they appreciate our presence. For ourselves, the experience 
continues to be enriching and supports our faith in the importance of 
compassionate involvement and nonviolent personal action, no matter how small.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why in the world would anybody want to pierce their skin or permanently mark 
up their bodies with ink? 
</P>
<P>
 As more and more teens become fascinated by the latest fads -- body piercing 
and tattooing -- more and more parents are worrying, not only about the 
anti-social aspects, but also about the health effects. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Stephanie Suhm of Melrose Tattoo in Hollywood, "A lot of kids sit 
around in the kitchen or they sit around in the garage and stick each other 
with needles," a practice that risks not only infection but diseases including 
HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 When the kids get older and need to find a job, Suhm says, the parents are so 
upset about the way the homemade tattoos look that they take them to a real 
tattoo artist. "That's where a lot of my business comes in. I do a better 
tattoo over the one everybody hates," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a very big division between people who see tattooing primarily as an 
art form who are not necessarily interested in piercing. So it's not always 
true that you'll find pierced parts where you find tattooed parts. (But) rarely 
does a pierced person not have a tattoo," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Paul Levins, assistant professor of dermatology at UCLA and assistant 
director of the school's Laser Dermatology Center, and Dr. Karl N. Stein of 
Sherman Oaks both do a lot of tattoo removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Levins says there are basically two types: amateur and professional. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amateur tattoos are done with ballpoint pen ink or cigarette ash and water. 
They make a black ink and with a pen, they put their names or a cross or 
something like that on. Those are mostly teen-agers or younger people and 
occasionally gang people. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people who got tattoos as young people regret them later, both doctors 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some gave themselves amateur tattoos as teen-agers and now they are 
schoolteachers or lawyers," Levins says, adding that he's even removed tattoos 
from faces. "I've treated a 16-year-old kid with a swastika on his forehead and 
he can't get a job at McDonalds and it's like, 'I wonder why not.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Stein says tattoos are anti-social. "When these people go through their phases 
and they get a little older, they're still stuck with the tattoos -- especially 
graffiti or gang tattoos." 
</P>
<P>
 Levins says the media has a lot to do with the fascination. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the mass media, there are tattoos everywhere -- all over 
television, movies and music videos and advertising. There are young attractive 
people with tattoos." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the health effects? Levins says that because tattooing is not 
government-regulated, information about what the dyes contain is not readily 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the very brightly colored inks have metallic substances in them like 
cadmium, mercury, etc. As far as other health issues, you always have to be 
concerned about the transmission of viruses like hepatitis or HIV or anything 
that involves the exchange of blood or body fluids." 
</P>
<P>
 Stein has some words of advice for young people who believe this is the "in" 
thing: "Just think, just think about the future."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PLATFORM / 'ABUSED 
CHILD CAN GET HELP WITHOUT RESORTING TO VIOLENCE'

 Lyle and Erik Menendez say they killed their parents after being subjected to 
years of abuse. Voices asked some Southern California residents whether a child 
who has been continually abused by parents is ever justified, morally, if not 
legally, to respond with violence.  
</P>
<P>
 SUE NATALIZIO, Mother of five, 38, member of PTA, Greenville Fundamental 
School, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 I think legally, when children are being abused by a parent, then violence by 
the child against the parent or parents can be justified. However, the degree 
of violence, like murder, demands that there would have to be an awful lot of 
evidence that physical abuse was, in fact, taking place. If a child is guilty 
of a murder, and abuse was taking place, I also don't think that the child 
should be punished forever. From the moral standpoint, though, the question 
becomes a lot harder. I personally think that violence does not solve anything. 
Morally, I have a lot of difficulty justifying a child harming the parents if 
abuse is taking place. But then again, a parent does not have a right to hurt 
his or her child. It's a very difficult question. CHILTON ALPHONSE, Founder and 
executive director of Community Sports and Arts Foundation and Sports Center, 
43, South-Central Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Yes and no. Legally, I think everyone has the right to kill, or do whatever is 
necessary, to save their life if they are in danger. If a parent is violent 
toward his or her child, then children have a right to defend themselves. 
However, from the moral point of view, I think there are enough ways a child 
can notify those who can help them without having to resort to violence. There 
are child-care hot lines, the police, social service centers and other ways. 
But if my daughter was in a position that she felt her life was in danger and 
no one was responding to her cries for help, then I think she would be totally 
justified to do what she had to do to save her life. MARISA JUARDO, Mother of 
two, 37, South Gate 
</P>
<P>
 When I was a kid, I used to think my parents were the worst thing on earth. I 
used to hate them. My mom would sometimes really get mad and hit me when I did 
something wrong. But looking back on it now, and as a parent, I better 
understand why my mother hit me. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably today, some people might call that child abuse. But I think some 
parents resort to violence because that's how they were brought up. In the 
minds of some kids, they might think a spanking or being grounded is child 
abuse. Of course, a child should have a right to protect himself if someone is 
trying to kill them. But what exactly is child abuse? What I'm trying to say is 
that what is child abuse to some, might not be to another. 
</P>
<P>
 As for me, while I understand why my mother hit me, I don't think she had a 
right. I don't hit my kids because I personally think it doesn't solve 
anything. So, hopefully, when my kids grow up, they won't use violence as a way 
to discipline their kids. By not hitting my kids, I broke the cycle that told 
my mother and her mother that hitting was the way to rear children. Because, if 
a child is raised with violence, then violence will be that child's answer. 
TRUDY STAMPER, Mother of high-school and college-aged children, Pacific 
Palisades 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think children have a right to kill their parents or commit violence 
against them. But I also don't think a parent has a right to commit violence 
against their children no matter what they might have done. Children need to be 
taught at an early age, be it through school, church or other areas, that 
parental abuse should not be tolerated. Likewise, parents need to know that it 
is not all right to harm your children. In many cases, other adults are present 
when a child is abused. These adults should take it upon themselves to inform 
the parents that their behavior is intolerable and refer them to sources that 
can help them. We are failing as a society. Society needs to become more 
available to this sort of thing. To stop child abuse, we must not only treat 
the abused but the abuser. STEVE COLLINS, Family assessment counselor for the 
Coalition of Children, Adolescents and Parents, 56, Orange 
</P>
<P>
 Whether a child is justified in committing violence against an abusive parent 
depends on what type of abuse is going on and the time in the child's life it 
is happening. Obviously, if a child is incapable of taking action, then that is 
another question. In any event, it basically boils down to self-defense. The 
law is very clear on this: It is not all right to commit violence against a 
parent and vice versa. So if it goes to court, the jury would have to determine 
if self-defense was justified. Did the child do all he or she could have done 
to find other ways to deal with the abuse? There are agencies ready to help 
those who are being abused. 
</P>
<P>
 The moral dilemma is somewhat nebulous. For example, a person who is religious 
may consider killing a mortal sin, but not find any problems joining the 
military. When in the military, you are justified to take someone else's life. 
So does a child have a right to kill the parents if abuse is taking place? 
Let's just say it's a difficult question to answer.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MAKING A DIFFERENCE; 
ONE ORGANIZATION'S APPROACH: ADVOCATE FOR COURT DEPENDENT CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of abused, abandoned or neglected children under court jurisdiction 
in Los Angeles County has grown from 16,000 to 42,000 over the past 15 years. 
Each month, about 1,000 children who have committed no crime are added to the 
county's Dependency Court system where they rely on services from overburdened 
social workers, lawyers and other court professionals. Modeled after similar 
programs nationwide, the Los Angeles Child Advocates Office was established in 
1978 to recruit, screen, train and supervise community volunteers to assist the 
court on behalf of these children. Volunteers become Court Appointed Special 
Advocates charged with helping children while Dependency Court officials work 
to find them safe, stable and permanent homes -- a process that can take as 
long as two years and a half a dozen court appearances. Today, volunteers at 
more than 400 CASA programs in 47 states accompany children to court, prepare 
reports used to determine where they should live and give children the type of 
consistent one-on-one contact and support that court officials seldom can. THE 
NEED FOR VOLUNTEER ADVOCATES Los Angeles County Child advocate volunteers: 227

Bernadino, San Diego and Ventura counties ONE VOLUNTEER ADVOCATE'S EXPERIENCE 
</P>
<P>
 Carolina Oaxaca 
</P>
<P>
 Lives in Rancho Palos Verdes. A CASA volunteer since 1982, she was selected by 
the National CASA Assn. as 1992 Child Advocate of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 I learned about CASA through a friend of mine. She said, 'I'm working for this 
great organization, and we really need bilingual volunteers.' I thought, 'Why 
not?' She sent me an application form, I went into training and here I am 12 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
 We learn how to make independent investigations for the judge who eventually 
makes the final decision about what is to happen to these children. You have to 
sift through a lot of information about a child's life and make sense out of 
it. As a volunteer, I can make a recommendation to the court with back-up data 
to support my position -- dates, conversations, observations. Evaluations are 
done to find out where a child should be placed -- with the parents, with 
mother or dad or grandma or someone else. My job is to see the whole picture, 
to plan ahead for the child while listening to the child. We are an independent 
voice to the court on behalf of the child. We may not always agree with 
Department of Children's Services or with the therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a letter from the court allowing me to review school records, doctors' 
records, psychiatric records, medical and hospital records and police reports 
so that I can make an assessment about the child's treatment, incorporate it 
into my report and help in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a case now where the child has a speech impediment and is a slow 
learner. I insisted that the child receive testing for learning disability. I 
asked the people who evaluated him if his problems could be a combination of 
teeth missing and a hearing problem. We learned that he has a hearing problem 
and that he'll need surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the children come from lower-income families, many of them are 
minority children, many have learning disabilities. They are sometimes coke 
babies or HIV positive babies. Some have physical disabilities. These children 
have been abused, and they lose trust -- especially in adults. I never touch a 
child initially. I sit down and I let them come to me. Then if they want to sit 
close to me, fine. Eventually, when they see that you are not a threat, they 
will open up. Some open up right away; with some it takes years to reach them. 
</P>
<P>
 A CASA volunteer brings understanding and closeness to the child that the 
child may not receive at home or in foster care. The child may want to talk to 
a social worker or an attorney, but they may not be there or have time. Maybe 
the child is in a group home and there's no one who listens to him or her. 
Maybe a telephone call or visit from a CASA volunteer can make a difference. A 
CASA volunteer offers support to a child by going with the child to court. It 
can make quite a difference to a child to know that he or she is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the case I may devote about about four or five hours a week per 
case. I make telephone calls, make home, hospital and school visits. I may meet 
with the children, counselors, teachers, principals. Especially with 
teen-agers, I check that they are going to classes, that they are not into 
gangs and if they are, then we have resources to help with that. 
</P>
<P>
 As the years have gone by we are more and more recognized in court. People 
know who we are and what we can do. And they're supportive. In fact on court 
orders I see now CASA volunteers are requested -- some even by name. TO GET 
INVOLVED

advocates throughout Southern California. For volunteer, donation or other

VALLEY CHRONICLE: WAS 60TH ROSE PARADE MONTIE MONTANA'S LAST? HE'S NOT SURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There he was again, doing rope tricks and smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Montie Montana was riding in his 60th Rose Bowl Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 But his 1994 appearance riding and roping his way down Colorado Boulevard may 
have been the last one for this 83-year-old movie cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's getting hard, at my age, to keep on doing it," said the genial 
Montana, who learned to do rope tricks from his dad, Edgar Owen, as a boy in 
The Treasure State. 
</P>
<P>
 Father, son and his mother, Mary Edna Harlan, were billed as the Montana 
Cowboys as they performed on the rodeo circuit in the early 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1930s, Montana was on his own with his new last name, honoring his home 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to Los Angeles where he says a lot of real cowboys were heading hoping 
to get into the movies. "Times were tough and Hollywood was where the money 
was," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cowboys used to hang out by Gower Street and Sunset Boulevard waiting for one 
of the film people to come by and pick some of us up for day wages or to do 
tricks in one of the Tom Mix or Hoot Gibson movies. We'd get maybe $50 to $100 
for a good stunt." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana says he was grateful he'd learned to be good at roping. It kept him 
afloat during those hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 He says it was not easy, but it was a way cowboys could make a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember Roy Rogers saying he'd give anything to make a steady $75 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the cowboys in the films were real cowboys. Only Gene Autry and Roy 
were originally singers and had to be taught. But once they got the hang of 
things, they got to be real cowboys. Those were pretty good times for all of 
us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana says many of those cowboys are still getting together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to go to the Pickwick Bowl in Burbank or the Beverly Garland Hotel in 
North Hollywood and sit around and see who can tell the biggest lies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gene Autry and Roy and Dick Farnsworth and a bunch of us like to drink coffee 
and get windy," added Montana, who says Farnsworth hasn't gotten a big head 
since becoming a big movie star. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known Dick for a long time and he's a real cowboy, but he was so shy no 
one ever knew he could act. Then someone asked him to do a small speaking part 
in one of those big movies and he's been doing real well at acting ever since," 
Montana said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana has always made his way as a showman, not an actor or singer. "I 
learned early that you had to have a little showmanship to stand out from the 
rest. Once I got that in my head, I used to practice smiling in the mirror so I 
could smile to the audience, and I took to wearing fancy clothes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He did a lot of exhibitions, shows and personal appearances for the next 60 
years, give or take a couple. "I used to go to elementary school and perform," 
he said. He added that he knew he was getting up in years recently when he went 
to a senior citizens gathering and several people remembered those appearances 
from when they were kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Some may remember that Montana roped the newly elected President Eisenhower in 
1953 during his inaugural parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was lucky the Secret Service didn't ventilate me," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also roped so many people during the Rose Parade that their children 
and grandchildren now call out to him to rope them like he did their parent or 
grandparent when they were kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana has spent most of his adult life in the San Fernando Valley. He lived 
in North Hollywood and Van Nuys before moving to a magnificent horse ranch in 
Northridge in the early 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1970s, the people, encroaching buildings and taxes had gotten too much 
for him and he bought his current ranch across from Velasquez Rocks in Agua 
Dulce. 
</P>
<P>
 When he married his second wife, Marilee, in 1987 the hitching was a blowout 
at the Calabasas Inn in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I rode my horse in and Marilee and the bridal party came in a stagecoach," 
Montana said. 
</P>
<P>
 For once, what may be the most famous roper in the world couldn't hit his 
target. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it came time for me to lasso Marilee and lead her down the aisle, I was 
so nervous I didn't do it on the first try, and had to try again." 
</P>
<P>
 He said many of his cowboy friends were in attendance and that when Roy Rogers 
saw his goof, he just sat back and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 The preacher was from the First Baptist Church of Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "He married me the first time, and even though that didn't work out, he seems 
like a good person, so I thought I would give him a second chance," Montana 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana is also waffling as to whether he's going to stop riding in the 
Tournament of Roses Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Will he really be a no-show at the 1995 extravaganza? 
</P>
<P>
 "Aw, well I'm not positive. Well, maybe I could have my arm twisted," he said 
with a laugh. Free Parking? Hey, Let's Do Lunch at CityWalk 
</P>
<P>
 The folks who have brought you CityWalk in Universal City are now trying to 
get some of you to take a lunch there. 
</P>
<P>
 CityWalk has 10 eateries that are doing a booming evening business, but you 
could shoot a cannon through some restaurants and not hit anyone at lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 This is just a one-time observation of a group of people who had deserted 
their office buildings for a long lunch hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, said one of the group, it has something to do with the fact that each 
of us paid $6 to park our wheels in something that resembles our worst 
UCLA-parking-structure nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, 20,000 lucky folks are about to get a mailer that offers incentives to 
spoon at noon at CityWalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the promotion, they get free valet parking and a guarantee that the food 
hits the table within 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 20,000 people should be getting their notices in the mail any day," says 
Ron Herman, marketing director of MCA Development. "We hope it will encourage 
people in the surrounding areas to come over for lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Herman, the 20,000 who receive the mailers will be office workers 
in North Hollywood, Universal City, Burbank's Media Center and Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to encourage them to come over and give our restaurants a try," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that, yes, the mailer was going out to people at other studios, such 
as Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, he said, maybe Disney's Michael Eisner might get one. 
</P>
<P>
 It's such a relief to know that Eisner may be able to save the $6 for parking. 
After all, he didn't get a bonus this year. Self Censor Not Singing a Certain 
Song Anymore 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago Rena LeBlanc of Woodland Hills began Opera Encores, in which 
professionals sing operatic music in private homes, many in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 She also offers Yiddish music and show tunes in other in-home events. 
</P>
<P>
 But the program that may be nearest and dearest to her is one in which 
professional singers perform at local nursing and retirement homes for free. 
</P>
<P>
 LeBlanc likes to honor residents who have had recent birthdays by having one 
of the singers perform a song in which the punch line is, "I hope you live to 
be 100." 
</P>
<P>
 That song is not sung anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 LeBlanc said one woman recently complained she didn't like that song when it 
was performed at her senior center. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not? asked LeBlanc, somewhat startled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 103," the woman said. Overheard 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not politically correct, or physically or sexually attractive, but he 
wears a cologne that drives me crazy and his ex-wife has remarried so he 
doesn't have to pay alimony." 
</P>
<P>
 Woman, explaining her attraction to a new male friend, to another woman in 
Studio City home.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TESTIMONY / ONE 
PERSON'S VIEW OF LOCAL TV NEWS; 'THE BOTTOM LINE IS ALSO TIED TO CREDIBILITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By As Told to ROBERT SCHEER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sherrie Mazingo worked for nine years as a producer, news writer and deputy 
bureau chief for NBC in New York and Atlanta. She is chair of the Broadcast 
Journalism Sequence, School of Journalism, USC.  
</P>
<P>
 I paid particular attention to a leading local news channel on a recent Monday 
night. I wrote down every story they did. And I was appalled that the first 11 
stories before the commercial break were all dealing with crime and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not balanced news presentation. If I was a visitor here and I turned 
on that newscast, I would get the distinct impression that what goes on in the 
Los Angeles metro area is all crime and violence-related and that would 
certainly be a distorted perception. 
</P>
<P>
 Within this range of stories, (the newscast) even reached outside of the L.A. 
area to tell me about some inmate in Florida. One had to wonder what the heck 
does that have to do with me and why is that news and why is it the third story 
in their lineup? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there's something to be said for presenting related stories, but to do it 
with this many stories and to make it the whole top of the newscast before the 
break is outrageous, unbalanced and unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Something terrible has happened to this industry. In the L.A. television 
market in particular, we are seeing more and more stories on local television 
news that have an emphasis on crime and violence. And such presentations must 
be instilling unnecessary fears in the minds of some, if not many, residents. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been demonstrated over and over through research that if you have a 
cumulative presentation on any given topic to which viewers are consistently 
exposed, it leads people to believe that this must be the way things really 
are. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it the case that if you lead an ordinary life and go about your business on 
a daily basis, within a given period of time you will witness a crime, a 
violent incident, or you will be a victim of one? Is this is the only kind of 
activity that goes on here that is newsworthy? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think it means either of those, and yet by continuing to focus on and 
emphasize crime and violence as it occurs in Los Angeles, by devoting an 
excessive amount of attention to this, it is exactly the impression given to 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 I work at USC in South-Central L.A. and I live at the other end of 
South-Central and I drive through South-Central six to seven days a week. I was 
at USC when the civil disturbance broke out. And even driving home that day I 
was not as afraid as I am today when there is no immediate threat. What is 
operative here is my perception that there is a threat -- not from my 
experience, but from what television is telling me about the environment out 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 I think this also feeds into racial and ethnic and cultural stereotypes and 
misconceptions. It's not just black males. It's Hispanic individuals, it's 
people coming from different cultures. There are other news stories about these 
same classes of individuals that are not being presented on our local 
television news. To think that the only thing that makes these people 
interesting and informative is if they are engaged in some kind of criminal 
activity or if they're victims is terribly erroneous thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 The broadcast majors here at the School of Journalism produce a half-hour 
weekly television news magazine program that airs over 19 cable outlets 
throughout Southern California. In our programs we do stories on people of 
varying racial, ethnic and cultural backgrounds within the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in connection with the City Council's consideration of whether 
street vendors should be licensed, we told a lot about the background of these 
people -- where they're from, why they're street vendors, why the street vendor 
culture seems to be limited to only a few particular groups of people. It's 
informative; it's telling another story. 
</P>
<P>
 Another example: When I came to L.A. 10 years ago, Watts was predominantly 
black and had been for a long time. Watts today is predominantly Hispanic. I 
bet nine out of 10 people don't know that. I have not seen that story. 
</P>
<P>
 It has nothing to do with some gang running around Watts, it has nothing to do 
with some drive-by shooting in Watts. But local TV news will go out and do 
hit-and-miss reporting on drive-by shootings, on gang incidents, murders and 
this-and-that and the other. But they won't give me a background story that has 
meaning and interest to me as a resident of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 What this industry needs to do is to turn this around. If they want to focus 
and emphasize the bottom line, there has got to be some rapid realization that 
the bottom line is also tied to credibility, to viewers' perceptions of the 
integrity of a news organization and the responsible presentation of news and 
information. If the industry keeps going in this direction, we will 
increasingly see viewers turning off those presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 TV news seems to have strayed greatly from a focus of responsible news 
presentation. There are many reasons for that. First, we're seeing more of the 
money guys coming into editorial positions, as opposed to people who previously 
came from news backgrounds exclusively. And we are seeing an explosion in the 
technology affecting presentation and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology shifts the focus and emphasis from solid news gathering and 
presentation. News programs are going "live" almost at the drop of a hat on the 
most meaningless stories. What is the rationale for going live over, say, some 
guy who might have been the victim of a carjacking at a gas station in the 
Valley. You have a reporter at the scene, doing a stand-up, saying, "Frank and 
Jane, right here just a few hours ago, Bill Porter, 57, of Van Nuys was a 
victim of" -- what is the point of that?  
</P>
<P>
 We do it because the technology is there and we have not learned how to make 
the technology coexist reasonably with the central focus of news presentation. 
We don't know how to make the technology supplement or complement the news 
rather than drive it. 
</P>
<P>
 We've gotten technology crazy. It's skycam. It's satellite technology. It's 
doing it faster than anyone else. That's letting technology drive the wheels of 
news. It's leading us to have an emphasis on negative stories. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to suggest that people who want to do something about this do what I 
do. When I see something that bothers me, I pick up the phone and call the 
newsroom. I usually ask to speak to the news director and/or the executive 
producer. Readers and viewers should also write to the general manager, to the 
news director, to the editor of publications like The Times and the Daily News 
about what they are seeing on local television news that may concern them.

 "Congratulations, we are delighted to inform you that you have successfully 
completed the first two stages and have now made it to the final stage of the 
"ZZZ Sweepstakes." You are guaranteed to win one of the following awards." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh no, not another one. My curiosity, however, is piqued since I never sent 
anything in to the first two stages. I know there is a gimmick to all of these 
"awards," and every once in a while I am curious to find out what it is they 
want from me. 
</P>
<P>
 I call a toll-free number on my congratulatory note. My friendly salesperson 
proceeds to divulge to me the magnificent details of the wonderful gifts I have 
just won in addition to my award: jewelry I probably won't wear; trips to 
places that aren't on the top of my list but are OK; a discount coupon book; a 
Home Safe alarm that I am too young to need but might not be a bad idea for 
parents, and a special new camera, which at least has possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 And all of these free items for only $698.50 to cover insurance, taxes, 
shipping, and handling. Which taxes? What insurance? I don't know about you, 
but a gift should be a gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Last, but not least, you need to decide right now. No chance to change your 
mind. No time to consult the spouse. It is now or never and they usually want 
your credit card number to boot, something you should never give out over the 
phone to someone who calls you, according to fraud experts. 
</P>
<P>
 I am tired of these offers that clog up our mail system and cost us plenty. 
The objective of a company is to make money. 
</P>
<P>
 The only good thing about these promotional offers as far as I am concerned is 
that they employ people like the friendly receptionists who answer the phones.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SECOND OPINION / 
OTHER MEDIA; THE MUSLIM EMPHASIS IS SELF-ESTEEM, DISCIPLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL-TALIB, Al-Talib is a news magazine that reflects the Muslim perspective. 
It is published biquarterly by students at UCLA. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What is it to be a Muslim? If you believe the media, we are fanatics, 
extremists, terrorists, or a backward group of people bent upon halting time. A 
major reason for this is that Muslims have allowed themselves to be defined by 
people who are hostile toward Islam and Muslims.Contrary to these stereotypes, 
we Muslims represent a wide spectrum of people who work toward a united global 
community comprised of people of differing cultures and ethnicities. 
</P>
<P>
 We are proud of our religion and what it means for society -- all societies. 
(The Muslim) emphasis upon self-esteem and discipline is the vehicle by which 
they implement social change. Whereas the prevailing attitude among most 
Americans is that of "I got mine, you get your own," our community is more 
concerned with the well-being of society and wanting for others what they want 
for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 While American society has given up on those who are incarcerated, Muslims are 
interested in restoring their humanity and allowing them to be productive 
people in an ever changing society.

INTRUDER KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "Intruder Killed After Struggle at House," Dec. 31: It's about 
time that The Times prints an article that shows the true necessity of private 
citizens owning firearms. The article also highlights some of the criminal 
record of the slain intruder.This was a career bad guy. How many chances should 
a convicted criminal get to go on repeating his crimes? The police are barely 
more than an after-the-fact investigative service. They don't arrive most times 
until after the crime has been committed. As long as our society treats 
criminals like the good guy, they have nothing to fear in committing their 
crimes. The justice system merely slaps them on the hand and lets them go. 
</P>
<P>
 The only deterrent for a criminal is the possibility that their victim is as 
well armed as they are and they may finally have to pay for their crimes. Mike 
Weiser did not purchase his weapon with intention of being Rambo. He is, 
however, a hero, and if he had not been armed there would have been two dead 
people. A man and his wife are alive today because of a truly concerned, 
law-abiding, armed citizen.

COUNTY PENSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Politicians and bureaucrats never seem to get it. Your Jan. 8 story about 
public works Director Thomas A. Tidemanson retiring with a pension that is 
$35,000 more than his annual salary makes this taxpayer want to vomit.At age 
61, he can enjoy the good life for a long time. I'm older than he, am 
self-employed and have no pension plan. 
</P>
<P>
 What private company can afford a pension plan that will pay a retired 
employee almost $200,000 a year? We have allowed our leaders to pile perk upon 
perk until the retirement pensions we pay the average government employee are 
totally out of line.

ELLIE NESLER'S SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Daniel Driver was convicted of child molestation in 1983 and served three 
months in jail for this heinous crime. Ellie Nesler was convicted of voluntary 
manslaughter of a convicted child molester and was sentenced to 10 years in 
prison (Jan. 8).Ten years for executing the molester of her young son, and 
incidentally, protecting other children from this most vile of criminals who 
undoubtedly would again have been released by our "justice system." 
</P>
<P>
 If our justice system did its job, mothers protecting children would not have 
to do executions. Gov. Pete Wilson should immediately step forth and commute 
her sentence to probation. 
</P>
<P>
 When will our government begin protecting its law-abiding citizens instead of 
coddling criminals? 
</P>
<P>
 JOSEPH W. KINKOPF, Glendora 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of giving her time, Nesler should be given a medal. We need more Ellie 
Neslers to send a message to child molesters who commit the most atrocious 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 GRAYCE W. WEBSTER, Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The judge who sentenced Ellie Nesler to 10 years in prison doesn't see the big 
picture. I'm sure he's pleased with himself for sticking resolutely to the 
rules, but if it was put to a vote, Ellie Nesler would walk. Tuolumne County 
Superior Court Judge William G. Polley is going against the grain. 
</P>
<P>
 God and everybody else know Nesler doesn't deserve to be punished. She's not a 
criminal. It was a mother's love that killed Danny Driver . . . love 
transformed into rage so pure, incandescent and focused that five bullets found 
their target. 
</P>
<P>
 Give her probation . . . the Constitution will survive it. What good does it 
do to lock her up? Let her go. Let it be a clean win for the good guys.

WHEN THE FEELING ISN'T EXACTLY MUTUAL; MUTUAL FUNDS CAN BE A GREAT INVESTMENT, 
BUT CONSUMERS DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND THE RISKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It used to be that accumulating a nest egg was as simple as opening a bank 
account or buying a few stocks. Not so today. A vast array of financial 
products such as mutual funds and annuities is now widely available from banks, 
brokerages and other financial services companies. These products are 
attractive as higher-yielding alternatives to low-interest bank accounts and 
time deposits. But they can also be confusing and risky. 
</P>
<P>
 With the huge amount of money -- $69 billion last year -- going into mutual 
funds sold by banks and S&Ls, consumers need to be more fully informed of the 
risks. Greater consumer safeguards are in order. That is a must-do task for 
federal bank regulators and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Take this test: Is that mutual fund or stock you purchased from a bank insured 
like a savings or checking account? If you answered yes, you're wrong. But 
you're not alone in your lack of information. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of 1,000 bank customers by a securities administrators group showed 
that only 18% were aware that mutual funds are not covered by federal deposit 
insurance; only 25% knew that stocks sold by banks are not covered by insurance 
and 14% were aware of the same lack with annuities, which are investment 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Confusion abounds despite extensive publicity and voluntary efforts by federal 
regulators and savings institutions to educate the public about the potential 
hazards of uninsured investments. 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition that includes the North American Securities Administrators Assn., 
the Consumer Federation of America and the American Assn. of Retired Persons is 
seeking simple-English disclosures of risks and guidelines for how banks sell 
and label mutual funds and stocks. The goal is to differentiate them from 
regular bank accounts so that investors better understand that not all products 
sold by banks are insured by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The distinction is especially needed considering that banks and savings and 
loans sold about 15% of all mutual funds purchased last year. Investors, 
especially senior citizens seeking security, need to understand that the risks 
of such investments are no less when they are purchased at a bank. The Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. insures (up to $100,000) only savings accounts, 
checking accounts and certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank customers survey showed that nearly 90% of those who bought mutual 
fund shares through banks were warned that the risk was theirs if the funds 
fell in value. Yet almost half still believed the government would cover any 
losses. Such misunderstanding must be countered aggressively to protect the 
interests of consumers, banks, mutual funds and the stock market.

BEST WAY TO HONOR THE MEMORY OF DR. KING; MRS. KING'S ANTI-VIOLENCE PLEA SHOULD 
RESONATE IN THE CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. preached nonviolence in the face of terrible 
violence. Confronted with bullets, fire hoses and police dogs, he and his 
followers practiced peaceful resistance. As today's national holiday marks the 
slain civil rights leader's birthday, his widow is calling for a modern day of 
nonviolence worldwide, in the face of wars and other dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Coretta Scott King pleads with "adversaries who are engaged in personal as 
well as political conflicts" to honor the legacy of her late husband "by 
reaching out to each other to make some effort to start a constructive 
dialogue, to use this day to plant the seeds for a peaceful resolution of the 
conflict that divides them." Her message should resonate everywhere, both 
abroad and in the United States, especially in the black communities for which 
Dr. King fought so hard. 
</P>
<P>
 As President Clinton asked in November in a speech in Memphis, where Dr. King 
was killed in 1968, if the rights leader "were to reappear by my side today and 
give us a report card on the last 25 years, what would he say?" Clinton 
acknowledged black political gains, economic gains for the black middle class 
and other strides against racism. But he didn't hold back in pointing to the 
problems found in many poor black communities, where violent crime takes its 
heaviest toll. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. King, Clinton declared, would say: "I did not live and die to see the 
American family destroyed . . . to see 13-year-old boys get automatic weapons 
and gun down 9-year-olds just for the kick of it . . . to see young people 
destroy their own lives with drugs and then build fortunes destroying the lives 
of others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fought for freedom . . . but not for the freedom of people to kill each 
other with reckless abandon; not for the freedom of children to have children 
and the fathers of the children to . . . abandon them as if they don't amount 
to anything. I fought for people to have the right to work, but not to have 
whole communities and people abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was on the mark in that speech. He is also on the mark with the 
comprehensive crime bill he is pushing in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate passed its version in November. Legislators found $22 billion, 
despite the huge federal deficit, to pay for major new initiatives including 
100,000 new police officers, more prisons, jail-like boot camps, tougher 
sentences and an expanded death penalty. We don't like the death penalty idea 
-- expanded or not -- but the rest of it is worth rallying around. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the bill is in trouble in the House, largely because many members of 
the Congressional Black Caucus note that the legislation pays too much 
attention to the consequences of crime and not enough to the causes. Tougher 
penalties and more prisons aren't all that's needed. The caucus rightly insists 
that Washington also fight crime by attacking the unemployment and poverty that 
punish so many communities. Still, the lawmakers shouldn't sacrifice the entire 
crime bill. They should cut a reasonable deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Any reduction of violence in cities, suburbs or rural areas would provide an 
appropriate tribute to Dr. King today, and every day.

YES, NUNS COVERED BUT LAWYERS EXEMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since it was approved by voters in 1990, the Los Angeles Ethics Commission has 
been instrumental in improving a grossly under-regulated and, as such, widely 
suspect city government. Indeed, the commission, under the leadership of 
Chairman Benjamin Bycel, deserves much credit for fundamental changes in the 
rules governing relationships between those in City Hall and those who conduct 
business there. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hard-won reforms are tough rules for campaign contributors and on 
gifts to public officials and a one-year prohibition on lobbying after an 
individual has left city office. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crusade is by no means complete. The commission still must grapple 
with the difficult issue of how to bring fairness and equity to the city's 
problematic lobbying ordinances. As it now stands, lawyers doubling as 
lobbyists can get away without registering and reporting their earnings for 
lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as Times columnist Bill Boyarsky recently reported, people like 
Sister Diane Donoghue, a nun who sometimes appears at City Hall on behalf of 
the homeless, are required to register as lobbyists and pay a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Two reform proposals intended to bring balance to this system are now before 
the City Council's Rules and Election Committee. One, originating within the 
council, is favored by professional lobbyists and some council members, perhaps 
not surprisingly. It would create confusing standards under which lawyers often 
would continue to be exempt from reporting the money they earn or spend in 
lobbying. The proposal also would exempt from earning disclosure those 
lobbyists taking in less than $2,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The other proposal, put forth by the Ethics Commission, makes much more sense. 
It would eliminate special exemptions, target the big spenders by lowering the 
reporting requirement to $1,000 a month, provide a more comprehensive picture 
of lobbying activity and keep the bureaucracy off the backs of people who do 
business with the city infrequently. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Alatorre, chairman of the council committee, should speed 
consideration of both reform plans. But the council should approve the more 
sensible Ethics Commission version.

PROTECTING IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "Group Forms to Fight 'Immigrant Bashing,' " Jan. 7: 
</P>
<P>
 With Los Angeles County and the entire state on the verge of bankruptcy, it is 
comforting to know that some "local Latino elected officials" have come 
together to form PRIDE, an illegal alien rights group. God forbid that they 
should lose their free health care and welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Latino taxpayer, I am sick and tired of politicians, such as Xavier 
Becerra, Gloria Molina, Hilda Solis and Art Torres playing the "race" card to 
keep our borders open to whoever wants to enter and then provide "services" to 
them at my expense. They are not my responsibility! 
</P>
<P>
 There is obviously enough work in this country to provide jobs for all of 
these people; what's the problem with a quick and easy way to document these 
immigrants at the border so they are held responsible for their actions, just 
as we are when we go to Mexico? 
</P>
<P>
 If these self-appointed saviors of Latino rights are really for "responsible" 
immigration, then they should start worrying about the rights of their 
constituents rather than the rights of illegal aliens, or don't we count any 
more? 
</P>
<P>
 This is not an issue of race. It is an issue of economic and national 
sovereignty. My tax dollars only go so far! 
</P>
<P>
 VICTOR RIVERA, Alhambra 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So the apologists for illegal immigration who have formed a high-powered 
lobbying group and hired PR agents claim that "all immigrants, including the 
undocumented, have rights . . . including access to public schools." In other 
countries that take a far more sensible approach to the immigration crisis than 
America, non-citizens and foreigners are allowed to attend local educational 
facilities, but must pay for that privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 While Gov. Pete Wilson is on the right track when he complains about the 
tremendous costs of educating non-citizens, he and other public officials 
should not ignore the obvious: Illegal aliens should have to pay for the 
educational services that they are provided, which are normally free, rather 
than banning them outright. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing will really turn the tide in the other direction unless Mexico reduces 
its birthrate drastically and/or a Berlin Wall goes up at San Ysidro and along 
the Rio Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 M. S. SNIDER, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My ancestors were here in California before the white Europeans came, 
dispossessing the Indians and the Mexicans with their treachery and deceit. So 
as far as I'm concerned, you're all immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't blame today's immigrants for our woes; we are the ones who give them 
jobs, we are the ones who make it easy to get welfare, so who's at fault?

CRIME AND PUNISHMENT -- AND POLITICS; TOUGH SENTENCING TAKES MORE THAN 'THREE 
STRIKES'; INCARCERATION: SOME PROPOSALS, LIKE LIFE FOR FIRST-TIME RAPISTS, 
WON'T WORK.

<P>
 After the arrest of a suspect in the kidnaping and murder of Polly Klaas, Gov. 
Pete Wilson described him, in a statewide broadcast, as "a career criminal with 
a long, long record of habitual sordid crimes and violence. This animal should 
never have been at large on the streets of California." Wilson then asked for 
"tougher laws . . . to make our cities, our suburbs and our small towns safe 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 These new laws would require prisoners with violent crime convictions to serve 
more than 50% of their sentences (the current norm), give life sentences to 
three-time felons and send forcible rapists, child molesters and some arsonists 
to life in prison even for a first offense. About this last group Wilson said, 
"What we need for them is a simple law: One strike, you're in -- for life. In 
good conscience, how can we risk releasing them to claim another victim, to 
traumatize another life?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's political opponent, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, lost no time in 
expressing his disdain for the public pressure for tougher punishment: "The 
overwhelming majority of the public are in a mind to put people away forever 
for jaywalking, period." Cognizant, however, of his inability to resist the 
popular tide for tougher punishments, Brown has indicated his approval of 
putting a "three strikes and you're out" measure on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, it might be wondered, would Brown want to allow the public to do 
something that he opposes -- to satisfy, as he sees it, its passion for 
punishment? The answer seems clear enough. Brown's stratagem enables him to 
wash his hands of the matter and thus to free him and his liberal colleagues in 
the Assembly from the responsibility of actually debating the soundness of 
California's punishment policies. 
</P>
<P>
 If, as Brown apparently believes, current policy is sufficiently severe (or 
perhaps too severe), then he has a profound responsibility to make that case in 
the Legislature and in the public arena. Indeed, in a democracy, elected 
officials have no higher duty than to promote the public interest, even against 
strong tides of public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect, however, that Brown well knows that current punishment practices in 
California are not defensible, that no persuasive case can be made for the 
following facts (all from official state publications): 
</P>
<P>
 * Of all those arrested on felony charges (crimes such as homicide, rape, 
robbery and burglary that can result in incarceration for at least year), only 
22% of those convicted are sentenced to state prison for a year or more; most 
serve less than a year in a local jail, and some get no incarceration at all. 
Of those convicted of violent crimes, only 25% end up going to state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 * California has more than 2 1/2 times as many offenders (390,621) serving out 
their sentences in the community, on probation or parole, than are incarcerated 
in all its state prisons and local jails (145,225). 
</P>
<P>
 * Of the 50,000 felons released from state prisons in California each year, 
half have served less than one year and four months behind bars (which includes 
time in custody pending or during trial). Median time served for specific 
crimes: homicide, three years, four months; robbery, one year, 11 months; 
assault with a deadly weapon, one year, 11 months; rape, three years, five 
months; lewd act with a child, three years, two months; arson, one year, nine 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Given this reality, is it any wonder why the Speaker and his ideological 
allies have opted not to lead a serious public debate on crime and punishment? 
</P>
<P>
 Less surprising, of course, is the governor's focus on tougher punishment. 
Here is a case where a politician's electoral interests largely conform to the 
public interest he is charged with serving. We will have more justice in the 
criminal-justice system, greater citizen confidence and enhanced public safety 
if more convicted felons go to prison than is now the case, and if those who do 
go serve longer than they now do. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, one aspect of Wilson's rhetoric that ill serves the case 
for a reasonable toughening of the criminal-justice system. This is his call 
for life in prison for first-time rapists, child molesters and some arsonists. 
Here Wilson demonstrates an all too common tendency of conservative politicians 
to propose punishments so severe that many reasonable people -- including 
jurors, judges, and even some prosecutors and police -- will resist their 
automatic application in every case. Can we really be confident that those 
responsible for prosecuting and convicting wrongdoers would unerringly carry 
out their duties if they believed that in many cases life in prison would be an 
excessively harsh punishment for the first offender? 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than calling for punishments that many reasonable people will consider 
Draconian, the governor should have called attention to the abysmally short 
sentences that violent offenders currently serve and proposed a substantial, 
but reasonable, increase. For example, a 10-year minimum (actual time in 
prison) for first-time rapists would be nearly three times longer than the 
median time now served by all rapists, many of them repeat offenders. Make no 
mistake, this would be a huge increase in punishment for rapists, but one, I 
believe, that is more consistent with reasonable public opinion than life 
sentences for every first offender. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect that the governor would rather not focus public attention on a 
degree of leniency in punishment for which the voters might blame both parties 
and both branches, legislative and executive. Still, in the coming months, our 
elected officials have a responsibility to lead the kind of serious and 
informed public debate about crime and punishment that this issue truly merits.

CRIME AND PUNISHMENT -- AND POLITICS; HOW MANY PRISONS MUST WE BUILD TO FEEL 
SECURE?; LEADERSHIP: 'THREE STRIKES' ISN'T AS TOUGH AS CHANGING THE CLIMATE FOR 
CRIME. 
</P>

By JONATHAN SIMON, Jonathan Simon is an associate professor of law at the

the Underclass, 1890-1990 has just been published by the University of Chicago

 "Three strikes and you're out," the proposal to imprison three-time felons for 
life, is drawing considerable attention from politicians. Governors as 
different as Mario Cuomo and Pete Wilson, who share little more than bad 
polling numbers and impending elections, have rushed to embrace the proposal. 
This is not surprising. The idea, like the slogan, is simple, satisfying to 
express and capable of channeling the overwhelming tide of popular anger about 
violent crime rising in America. Any politician who does not ride on this wave 
has good reason to fear being dragged under it. 
</P>
<P>
 The arguments against the proposal are solid, persuasive and boring. Any 
effort to really enforce such a law will require a massive increase in prison 
spending when states like California and New York have been slashing budgets 
for years. Wilson promises to build six more prisons on top of the five he has 
already built on top of those built by his predecessor. Cuomo, too, promises to 
wring New York's budget dry to pay for more cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Life sentences involve a lot more whimper than bang. The twentysomethings with 
a seemingly insatiable appetite for violence become forty-, fifty- or 
sixtysomethings. Their propensity for violence goes down but the cost of 
maintaining them (in human as well as fiscal terms) goes up. In the meantime, 
correctional officers will have to deal with a burgeoning population of inmates 
with little left to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 So many violent offenders are now being released without serving their full 
terms because mandatory sentencing laws for drug offenders have already filled 
our prisons, forcing early release of felons without mandatory minimums. "Three 
strikes" would add yet another monolithic mandatory sentencing policy that robs 
our courts of the ability to make common-sense distinctions of degree between 
crimes and criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 But, look, don't bother the public with the fiscal details, or the fact that 
plenty of horrible crimes, like the rampage on the Long Island commuter train, 
get committed by people with no record of felonies. Like the ball game from 
which the slogan derives, the "three strikes" proposal has an almost mythic 
quality that sustains its capacity to endure in our hearts over many seasons of 
disappointment. This is the stuff that dreams (and governors) are made of. 
Indeed, variations on this theme, life terms for "habitual" offenders, have 
been around since the 19th Century and in some form or another sit in the laws 
of virtually every state in the union, the relics of earlier crime panics and 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this wave crests, leaving behind yet more evidence for the proposition 
that Lincoln should have been more worried about fooling most of the people 
most of the time, two aspects are worth considering. 
</P>
<P>
 While "three strikes" may seem to fit in with the "get tough" policies toward 
crime legislated over the last decade or two, it really reflects an admission 
of bankruptcy on the part of that philosophy. They used to tell us that tough 
sentences would cut through the confusing messages of the "rehabilitative" 
penal philosophy, and that the promise of stiff punishment would deter crime. 
Now, billions and billions of dollars later, "three strikes" implicitly 
acknowledges a fact too painfully obvious to conceal any more: Deterrence did 
not work to prevent crime. And, guess what? The new solution to the old 
solution looks like the same solution: more prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians, like people all over America who are toasting the "three 
strikes" proposition, are expressing genuine frustration over the loss of 
personal security in this country. Contrary to the received wisdom that 
Americans want their government to go away and leave them alone, millions of 
Americans are saying that they expect government to take an active role in 
improving the conditions that make life so fearful, and they are willing to be 
taxed if they believe it will go to a serious effort. 
</P>
<P>
 What form should that effort take? Criminal-justice experts, liberal and 
conservative, share a surprising degree of consensus on programs that will have 
both short- and long-term impacts on public safety, such as: targeting early 
intervention at juvenile offenders; improving drug treatment and education 
programs in prison so that first-time felons do not graduate to careers in 
crime; and boosting police presence in the schools, parks and shopping 
districts where law-abiding citizens must be made to feel secure if our cities 
are to remain economically viable. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these proposals has anything like the magic ring of "three strikes and 
you're out." Creating a thoughtful strategy to reduce crime and increase public 
confidence in the safety of their communities will be as boring as a pitchers' 
duel. The question is whether the political leadership and the taxpayers will 
give the serious, low-key approach a try before or after the next 
multibillion-dollar monument to political mendacity is constructed.

PERSPECTIVE ON HEALTH CARE; RAISE QUALITY BY LOWERING COSTS; INCENTIVE FOR 
PROVIDERS NOW IS TO USE THE MOST COSTLY TREATMENT. THERE'S NO REWARD JUST 
KEEPING PEOPLE HEALTHY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ALAIN C. ENTHOVEN and SARA J. SINGER, Alain C. Enthoven is a professor of 
management at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and a member of

analysts. Sara J. Singer is his special assistant.

<TEXT>
<P>
 To improve quality in health care, cut costs. Sounds counterintuitive, but in 
health care, as in most businesses, quality and economy go hand in hand. One of 
the biggest misconceptions in the health-reform debate is that if you cut the 
cost, quality will suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, providers -- hospitals, doctors and other practitioners -- work in 
a system in which everyone is rewarded for providing more, not necessarily 
better, care. This traditional fee-for-service, remote third-party-payer model 
pays per procedure, regardless of the outcome. In a world such as this, 
providers, no matter how ethical, have an unavoidable incentive to provide the 
most costly treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide variations in practice patterns among physicians suggest that more 
procedures are not necessarily related to better outcomes. A medical director 
of an East Coast health-maintenance organization studied practice patterns and 
observed a fivefold to tenfold difference in the costliness of practice 
patterns of different doctors, usually with no evidence of difference in 
outcomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the traditional system does not allocate resources rationally. Instead, 
hospitals purchase expensive equipment even if they cannot fully utilize it, 
and beds go unfilled while hospitals continue to build capacity. There is no 
incentive to keep individuals healthy because there is no reimbursement for it. 
Providers are paid less for pursuing a less invasive, but equally effective, 
non-surgical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the current system, there is no match between resources and needs. This 
country has trained too many specialists and too few primary-care physicians. A 
surfeit of specialists is bad for your health and bad for your pocketbook. If 
there were fewer, we could pay them well and give them full schedules. They 
could care for the same population at less cost. Because they would be 
proficient, their work would be of high quality. Because they would be busy, 
there would be less unnecessary surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, there is no accountability for cost or quality because 
providers are not paid on the basis of either. Problems in health-care 
delivery, such as lack of immunizations and other preventive measures, are 
viewed as isolated issues. They are not. They reflect a systemic problem: No 
one is accountable for getting the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 Even physicians have come to dislike the traditional fee-for-service model 
because it sets them up in an adversarial relationship with payers. Physicians 
routinely must respond to calls from lesser-qualified insurance company 
representatives who question their choice of treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Better care at less cost is possible through integrated financing (that is, 
insurance) and delivery systems (hospitals and physicians). Under the new rules 
of the game, all would benefit by keeping individuals under their care healthy, 
or, once sick, by making them well in the most efficient way possible. Such a 
system would give providers responsibility for individuals' comprehensive care 
for a fixed periodic payment set in advance, put providers at financial risk 
for the cost of care and, therefore, for the "cost of poor quality," and hold 
providers accountable for quality outcomes. 
</P>
<P>
 With this new set of incentives, accountable health plans would seek to 
attract committed and responsible physicians. Finding, training and retaining 
the most qualified group possible in the right quantities and specialty mix for 
the population served would be key to financial success. Accountable health 
plans would give doctors incentives to provide high-quality, low-cost care and 
the tools they need to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Information systems could be used to identify and adopt cost-effective care. 
Quality management and improvement techniques would be employed routinely. 
Providers would study variations in practice patterns to determine and adopt 
what makes sense. They would be held accountable for quality outcomes because 
the remuneration of the entire group would be at stake. Technological 
redundancy would be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Costly specialized procedures would be concentrated in efficient regional 
centers where physicians are busy enough to maintain proficiency and achieve 
administrative economies of scale. There is a well-documented correlation among 
high volumes, low mortality and low cost. The Pennsylvania open-heart surgery 
study, for example, studied 35 hospitals doing coronary artery bypass graft 
operations. The procedure at the hospital with the best risk-adjusted mortality 
rate cost $21,000; at the worst it was $84,000, and on average was $44,000. If 
every hospital performed at the level of the most proficient hospital, 
Pennsylvania alone could save $350 million in one year for this one procedure. 
A similar result could be true for other states. 
</P>
<P>
 We do not mean to suggest that any means of cutting costs is acceptable. 
Arbitrary cuts put quality at risk. The Clinton Administration's proposal for 
health-care reform sets unrealistic limits on health-plan premium increases, 
given the incentive scheme and time frame for other reforms they propose. 
</P>
<P>
 Price controls would limit premium increases to the consumer price index plus 
1.5% in 1996, phased down to the index plus zero in 1999. Such targets and 
better could be met a few years later by a thoroughly reformed competitive 
system with the strongest possible market incentives, without price controls. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a great deal of waste in the health-care system and big opportunities 
for cutting cost without cutting the quality of care. To realize potential 
savings, the industry needs time to reorganize, restructure, retrain and 
install programs of continuous quality and productivity improvement. This 
cannot happen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Clinton plan succeeded in meeting its cost-containment goals, likely 
consequences would be arbitrary cutbacks in service and care, then queues and 
rationing in the form of spending reductions not thought through for lack of 
time and incentives, especially in the short run. Quality of care would suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, expenditure limitations should not be confused with cost 
reduction. While a country can limit the cost of treatment, as Britain and 
Canada have done, by shifting the cost of illness back onto patients in the 
form of treatments delayed or denied, the only way to reduce the total social 
cost of illness and its treatment is to improve the efficiency and 
effectiveness of care delivery. What is best for society is to minimize the 
cost of illness and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the rationale that high-quality health care must be expensive is 
flawed. In fact, often the opposite is true. Mistakes cost lives and dollars. 
Providers must be given tools and held accountable for doing it right the first 
time. We believe that this can only be achieved through market forces and 
accountable health plans.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; HEAT OVER FIREFIGHTERS' OVERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westminster officials were right to ask the Orange County district attorney's 
office to investigate overtime payments to the city's firefighters to determine 
whether the money was spent for time actually worked. The probe will show if 
the city attorney is correct in claiming that firefighters did not earn the 
pay, an assertion disputed by firefighters' representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 What is not in dispute is that firefighters and paramedics have racked up 
large amounts of overtime in recent years. The numbers are laid out in an audit 
conducted for the city by the KMPG Peat Marwick accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986-87, the total overtime paid topped $340,000, according to city 
figures. In 1992-93, the amount was more than $860,000. Some firefighters 
regularly collected $20,000 to $40,000 a year in overtime, the audit disclosed. 
Figures such as these understandably are of concern to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation comes after years of tension between the city and the 
firefighters union, which represents all 63 members of the department except 
the chief. The council passed a plan to reform the department last year. The 
union challenged the plan in court and now supports a recall of the four 
council members who approved the reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster Mayor Charles V. Smith, who disclosed last week that the 
investigation was under way, correctly said most of the firefighters are 
undoubtedly honest, hard-working public servants who do a tough job and do it 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the city has been the victim of tough times in recent years. The 
state took property taxes that Westminster had counted on receiving, and a poor 
economy kept shoppers at home, substantially reducing sales taxes. The cut in 
revenues has made it more important than ever that the city save money and that 
all its departments cooperate in the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's belt-tightening attempts included the Fire Department, which the 
city tried to streamline, asking it to all but eliminate overtime. But in less 
than three months after that, firefighters pulled in $283,000 in overtime, 
nearly four times the amount designated in the city's 1993-94 budget. The 
question is whether that amounted to an overtime "rampage" or was legitimately 
required. 
</P>
<P>
 A director of the firefighters' association said the group welcomes the 
district attorney's investigation. That's the right attitude. When the inquiry 
is over, both sides still will have to work together, because the city's money 
woes are not going to just fade away.

CANUCKS TAKE DUCKS BY SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Mighty Ducks told goalie Ron Tugnutt he could carry his new cellular 
phone out and put it on top of the net with his water bottle, he would probably 
be tempted. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Lisa, are expecting their first child any day, and Tugnutt is 
beside himself with excitement and worry. The phone is new, has one purpose, 
and has never rung. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this phone rings, my equipment comes off," Tugnutt said. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't ring Sunday, when Tugnutt lasted only one period in the Ducks' 4-3 
loss to Vancouver in front of a sellout crowd of 17,174 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt gave up a goal only nine seconds into the game on Trevor Linden's shot 
from the blue line and fell behind, 4-0, after the Canucks added three 
power-play goals in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Hebert replaced him to start the second and the Ducks scored three goals 
to cut the lead to one, but never tied the score, despite Garry Valk's 
second-period breakaway chance and Peter Douris' spin-around shot from the slot 
that missed wide by inches in the final seconds of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks erased a 3-0 deficit to beat Hartford, 6-3, on Friday, but they 
couldn't come all the way back this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave up a lousy goal at the beginning and kind of got back on our heels," 
Coach Ron Wilson said. "A couple of mistakes on their power play in the first 
period did us in." 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt, who entrusted the phone to support staff during the game, stood 
clutching it while waiting to leave after the game was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "This being our first, it's very distracting," he said. "I find myself 
thinking about it quite a bit, carrying a phone around wherever I go. This is 
definitely a big, big moment in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 It's so big that the Ducks -- no Houston Oilers -- have told Tugnutt he does 
not have to make a two-game trip to Toronto and Detroit this week before the 
All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to have gone and played, but I think that's very nice of them to 
think about Ron Tugnutt and his family life first," he said. "She was told 
three or four days ago it could happen any day. Since then I can't get my mind 
off it, and I think everybody can understand it. It's a big, big time in my 
life. We're pretty excited." 
</P>
<P>
 He was not excited about the first goal, and was upset that the arena lights 
were not fully on yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's no excuse for it, I should have had it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Wilson: "We had to stop the first one. That can't go in. It ends up 
being the difference in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second game in a row the Ducks have allowed a goal in the first 30 
seconds. The score was 2-0 after Geoff Courtnall put back a rebound from the 
slot at 10:27 when the Ducks failed to clear the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 It got uglier, with the Canucks scoring on a giveaway at 15:17, when the 
Ducks' Bob Corkum lost the puck in his end and Bobby Dollas couldn't recover 
it, leaving Vancouver with a 2-on-1 at short range. Courtnall put the puck in 
the net for his second power-play goal of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with 15 seconds left in the period, Vancouver's Dave Babych dumped the 
puck in off the boards, and no Ducks chased it. Pavel Bure picked it up in the 
right circle and fired. Tugnutt made the initial stop but the puck caromed in 
off Duck defenseman Alexei Kasatonov's skate and the Ducks went in trailing, 
4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Switching ends after the intermission somehow changed the Ducks' fortunes. 
Tugnutt replaced Hebert in a shaky outing against San Jose two games ago, and 
this time the roles were reversed. Hebert made 15 saves in shutting out the 
Canucks over the final two periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Corkum started the rally with his 15th goal, and Troy Loney and Joe Sacco also 
added second-period goals. They got no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been a shaky few outings recently for the goalies, who have been 
the cornerstone of the team's success.

 "I think together, Guy and I have both let in some weak goals," Tugnutt said. 
</P>
<P>
 With defensemen Sean Hill and Randy Ladouceur out with minor injuries the last 
few games, the defense hasn't been as strong either -- particularly the 
penalty-killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wilson says he isn't worried about Hebert and Tugnutt, and Tugnutt's 
not worrying either -- at least not about the goaltending.

MORNING BRIEFING: TIME TO USE THE GAG RULE ON RYAN, DITKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For an assistant coach, Buddy Ryan sure gets a lot of air time on television. 
Even Buddy's buddy, Mike Ditka, is getting tired of it. Said Ditka on NBC 
Saturday: "I want to hear from (Oiler Coach) Jack Pardee." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Ryan: Joanie Ryan, wife of the bombastic Ryan, says he's a different guy 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "People feel sorry for me," she said. "They ask me how I can live with it. But 
he's never like that at home. He's a pussycat." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Ditka: After NBC's Joe Gibbs gave a rather expansive, straightforward 
analysis of Buffalo's victory over the Raiders, it was Ditka's turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boring," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditka also said of the Raiders: "They brought in a tough quarterback. Now they 
need to bring in some tough players on defense." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: USC has won six and lost 11 in the NCAA basketball tournament. 
What is the furthest the Trojans have advanced? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute: Said Dave Dorr of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, in writing about 
Wisconsin freshman Rashard Griffith, a 7-foot center: "He's a classic example 
of how one player can change the fortunes of a school's basketball program 
overnight. Patrick Ewing did it for Georgetown. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did it for 
UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA had won the NCAA championship two of the three years before Abdul-Jabbar 
-- then Lew Alcindor -- played for the varsity in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Exercise Bowl: If you're going to the Super Bowl, you'd better be prepared to 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown Atlanta will be almost impossible to reach by car on game day. Thirty 
blocks around the Georgia Dome will be closed to motorists without special 
passes. An eight-block corridor to major downtown hotels will be closed to 
traffic four hours before the game and hotel guests will be urged to walk to 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It worked: Remember the poignant sign on a motor home at the Rose Bowl from a 
woman looking for a ticket so she could attend the game with her father, a 
Wisconsin graduate and World War II fighter pilot? 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Conant Gomez of Newport Beach writes to say that she was the woman who 
wrote the note and that the sign helped her purchase a ticket "for a reasonable 
price" to join her father. 
</P>
<P>
 Nice way to start the new year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Too good: Norway's Sonja Henie won Olympic figure skating gold medals in 1928, 
1932 and 1936, but her compatriots frowned on her turning professional to make 
a fortune in films. 
</P>
<P>
 Envious Norwegians called her "Little Miss Money Bags." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: USC lost in the semifinals twice, in 1940 to Kansas, 43-42; and 
in 1954 to Bradley, 74-72. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Namesake: In a few years, if someone wants to bet you that Michael Jordan 
played baseball in the major leagues, be careful. 
</P>
<P>
 A Michael Jordan played 37 games for Pittsburgh in 1890. Batted .096.

TENNIS ROUNDUP; GRAF WASTES LITTLE TIME IN AUSTRALIAN OPEN WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Steffi Graf, the favorite in the absence of three-time champion Monica Seles, 
needed only 23 minutes today to win her first-round match in the Australian 
Open at Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf defeated Kimberly Po of Rolling Hills, 6-1, 2-0, when Po retired in the 
second set because of a strained stomach muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 Goran Ivanisevic, seeded fifth among the men, had 15 aces in a 6-4, 6-0, 6-2 
defeat of Alex O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, the only woman in the tournament who has previously won the event, 
dropped only four points on her serve in the first set. The German, ranked No. 
1 in the world, won the tournament in 1988-89-90. 
</P>
<P>
 Seles had hoped to make her comeback in the tournament, but she still has not 
recovered from being stabbed in the back by a spectator during a match in 
Hamburg, Germany, last April. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, it's different with Monica not being here," Graf said. "But I'm not 
thinking about it now that I'm playing the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Seles' absence was the most glaring as the first Grand Slam event of the year 
opened without several top players. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Agassi is recovering from surgery on his right wrist. Boris Becker is in 
Europe awaiting the birth of his first child. Michael Chang couldn't fit the 
$5.7-million tournament into his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Martina Navratilova and Jennifer Capriati are skipping the event. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden warmed up for the Australian Open by 
defeating Patrick McEnroe, 6-4, 6-0, to win the New Zealand Open at Auckland. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Japan's Kimiko Date won the women's title of the New South Wales Open, 
defeating Mary Joe Fernandez, 6-4, 6-2, at Sydney, Australia.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buffalo's longest and perhaps most important play from scrimmage Saturday was 
not a completed pass or a run. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It was a questionable 37-yard pass-interference penalty late in the first half 
that set up the touchdown that brought the Bills, who had been badly outplayed, 
to within 17-13 of the Raiders. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The penalty didn't fit the supposed crime. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Replays showed that if Raider cornerback Torin Dorn did make contact with Bill 
wide receiver Bill Brooks, it was incidental. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Other teams, such as Denver against the Raiders during the final 
regular-season game at the Coliseum, also have been assessed huge amounts of 
yardage on ticky-tack interference calls. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, it is time for a rules change. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA pass-interference rule advances the ball only 15 yards. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The NFL should make it 15 yards in most cases and spot-of-the-foul only for 
flagrant violations such as that committed by the Houston Oilers' Cris Dishman 
against the Kansas City Chiefs' Willie Davis in the fourth quarter Sunday. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 The less influence officials have on the outcome of a game, the better. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Granted, there was nothing controversial about the majority of the Raider 
penalties, including Howie Long's four offsides. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Mistakes, curious strategy and the resilient Bills contributed to the Raiders' 
return to their pre-Denver second-half form. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Why did the Raiders continue to run the ball when Buffalo switched to an 
eight-man line? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Why did the Raiders wait until it was too late to blitz Jim Kelly, who was 
able to take up residence in the pocket and complete 27 passes for 287 yards 
and two touchdowns? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Oh yes, some credit must be given to Western New York's Team for reaching the 
AFC championship game a fourth consecutive time. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Remember, the home-ice advantage in the playoffs wasn't given to the Bills. 
They earned it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are reasonably close to making it to the Super Bowl for the first 
time since the 1983 season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 They need to think better on game days, whether or not that means any changes 
in the coaching staff. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Their player personnel priority should be to keep Tim Brown, who has developed 
into one of the NFL's best offensive performers. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 All Al Davis has to do is either match transitional free agent Brown's highest 
offer from another team or make him the Raiders' franchise player and pay him 
at least the average salary of the top five wide receivers in the league. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders usually draft the player they believe is the best available 
regardless of position, but they might be better served this time by selecting 
the best running back available. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That could be Mario Bates of Arizona State or Byron (Bam) Morris of Texas 
Tech. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 For a change, there will be no hue and cry to do something at quarterback. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 I only wish Jeff Hostetler had been given more opportunities to pass on a day 
when the wind wasn't a factor. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He demonstrated his competitive fire late in the game when he ran onto the 
field during a timeout and implored the Raider defense to stiffen so he could 
get one more shot at the Bills. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What more can be said about the spirit of Joe Montana, who rallied the Chiefs 
to victory after throwing an interception in the fourth quarter that would have 
deflated most other quarterbacks? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Imagine, there was a fight on the Astrodome sidelines and it wasn't between 
Buddy Ryan and Kevin Gilbride. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dallas eventually pulled away, but Coach Jimmy Johnson would have been 
compared with Leon Lett if the Cowboys had lost to Green Bay after that 
mind-boggling fake punt on their 28-yard line in the first quarter failed. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Hope you have Ricky Watters on your postseason fantasy football team. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dan Reeves prepared the New York Giants for the San Francisco 49ers as though 
it was a Super Bowl game. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA became the only unbeaten top-10 team on a day when the Oregon-Oregon 
State game was televised in Los Angeles, but the Bruin-Washington game wasn't. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 With so many undergraduates having made themselves available for the NFL 
draft, Chet Forte says the Senior Bowl ought to be changed to the Junior Bowl. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Unless she is implicated in the Nancy Kerrigan attack, Tonya Harding should be 
allowed to represent the United States at the Winter Olympics. I mean, isn't 
that the way it's supposed to work in this country?

 Todd Leary made a timely return for the Indiana Hoosiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Leary, who missed the 11th-ranked Hoosiers' first two Big Ten Conference games 
because of a sprained knee, rescued a sluggish offense with 16 second-half 
points Sunday, rallying Indiana from a 15-point deficit to an 82-72 victory 
over No. 10 Michigan in Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana's Alan Henderson had 19 points and 16 rebounds, while Damon Bailey 
scored 18 points. Indiana (10-2, 3-0) outscored Michigan, 36-10, from the foul 
line. Michigan fell to 11-3, 3-1 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana extended the nation's longest current home winning streak to 37 games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No. 22 Alabama Birmingham 85, Memphis St. 57 -- Robert Shannon, held scoreless 
in the first half, made seven three-pointers in scoring 26 points in the second 
half as Alabama-Birmingham (13-1, 2-0) gained its 11th consecutive victory with 
the Great Midwest Conference rout over Memphis State (5-8, 0-4) at Birmingham, 
Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the seventh straight loss for the Tigers, their longest losing streak 
since dropping nine in a row in 1969-70. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No. 23 West Virginia 70, George Washington 70 -- Pervires Greene scored 22 
points and West Virginia (10-2, 4-1) held off a late charge to beat George 
Washington (8-5, 2-3) in an Atlantic 10 Conference game at Morgantown, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia never trailed. The Colonials cut the lead to 66-60 with 26 
seconds left after trailing by as many as 17 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina State 78, Florida St. 70 -- Charlie Ward resumed his winter job 
as Florida State's point guard, but North Carolina State (5-8, 1-2) made it a 
dismal debut, taking an Atlantic Coast Conference victory behind 20 points from 
reserve Ricky Daniels in Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida State (7-5, 0-4) has a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward delivered a national football championship to the Seminoles on New Year's 
Day, and it seemed he had hardly missed a step when he made an NBA-range 
three-pointer and handed out two assists early. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward finished with five points, six assists and four fouls.

NBA ROUNDUP; TRAIL BLAZERS KEEP SAVING MURRAY'S BEST FOR LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tracy Murray is making a habit of shooting down the Charlotte Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday night, Murray scored 11 points in the fourth quarter, leading the 
Portland Trail Blazers to a 106-101 victory over the Hornets at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two weeks ago, Murray had 22 points and made four of five three-point 
shots in 20 minutes of play in the Trail Blazers' 116-110 victory at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to make sure I keep myself mentally ready, especially when you 
come in the third and fourth quarters," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland Coach Rick Adelman kept Murray on the sidelines until the start of 
the fourth quarter on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray made a three-point basket during an 9-0 run that helped the Trail 
Blazers come back from an 11-point third-quarter deficit. He also made a 
three-point play with 4:34 left that broke a 92-92 tie and gave the Trail 
Blazers the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Physically, all I have to do is run up and down the floor a couple of times 
and I'm ready," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford Robinson scored 20 points for the Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersey Hawkins led the Hornets with 24 points. Alonzo Mourning added 20. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 99, Utah 94 -- The Nets held the Jazz without a basket over the 
final 6:41 at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Anderson and Kevin Edwards combined for 20 of the 26 fourth-quarter 
points scored by the Nets, who played without starting forwards Derrick 
Coleman, who had back spasms, and Chris Morris, who had flu. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nets are 3-0 in games Coleman has sat out. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson had 24 points, 14 assists, five rebounds and two steals. Edwards 
scored 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson and Edwards each had 10 points during a fourth quarter that featured 
eight ties and two lead changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Malone had 23 points for the Jazz, but only three in the final quarter. 
John Stockton had 17 points for the Jazz, who have lost five of six. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 105, Denver 100 -- Rookie forward Dino Radja scored 29 points and 
Robert Parish had a season-best 26 at Boston as the Celtics ended their 
franchise-record seven-game home losing streak, and a five-game overall losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Brown added 16 points and 11 assists and Xavier McDaniel had 12 points for 
the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf led the Nuggets with 20 points. Tom Hammonds had 17, 
including 13 in the fourth quarter. The Nuggets are 5-15 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammonds had a chance to tie the score with 50 seconds left, but he missed a 
free throw. 
</P>
<P>
 A basket by Parish and a put-back by Radja with 10 seconds left helped seal 
the victory.

SANTA ANITA; ZIGNEW LIVES UP TO BREEDING, WINS THE SAN FERNANDO STAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A grandson of Northern Dancer and a son of Danzig, Zignew is a 4-year-old colt 
whose races have never been as good as his breeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Dancer won the Kentucky Derby in 1964; 29 years later, Sea Hero, a 
grandson of Danzig, did the same. But Zignew spent his 3-year-old season unable 
to bridge the competitive gap between allowance company and stakes races. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Speedy Smithwick moved the colt from dirt to grass and back to dirt 
while trying to find the answer. Smithwick's patience might pay off. Waiting 
until his 12th start before scoring his first stakes victory, Zignew scored a 
21-1 upset on dirt Sunday at Santa Anita in the $225,400 San Fernando Stakes. 
That means that the Strub series will go another year before a horse has a 
chance to sweep the three races. Of the five horses to sweep, Precisionist was 
the most recent, in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Diazo, winner of the Malibu, the first race in the series, was a contender for 
the first mile of the San Fernando, but he finished a well-beaten ninth in a 
field of 12 4-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonproductiveasset, making his first start on dirt since trainer Wally Dollase 
claimed him out of a $40,000 maiden race last May, came from far back to finish 
second, 1 3/4 lengths behind Zignew and a half-length in front of Pleasant 
Tango, who might have done better had he not been trapped behind horses in the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Zignew, bred and owned by Jack Kent Cooke and ridden by Chris McCarron, earned 
$135,400, which was $22,875 more than his purses for 11 previous starts. He had 
won four times, but was not better than fourth in three stakes starts. Sunday 
marked Zignew's first stakes race since an eighth-place finish in the Ascot 
Handicap at Bay Meadows on Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Diazo and his stablemate, Stuka, went off favored at 19-10. Zignew, who paid 
$44.80 after running 1 1/8 miles in 1:47 4/5, came into the San Fernando off an 
allowance victory at Hollywood Park a month ago. He carried 116 pounds Sunday, 
four less than the top-weighted Diazo. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's getting better with age," said Smithwick, who comes from a family of 
Hall of Fame steeplechase horsemen. "I think he's matured, he's learned how to 
rate and he didn't stall when he made the lead this time. He's out of a Prince 
John mare (Newfoundland) who's had nothing but nice horses, and they've all put 
it together late in life, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Zignew broke from the outside post, and with Bat Eclat, Diazo and Del Mar 
Dennis doing the fastest early running, McCarron was able to drop his mount 
into fourth place after a half-mile. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the stretch, Bat Eclat and Diazo dropped out of contention. Del 
Mar Dennis had the lead with an eighth of mile to go, and although McCarron 
could have gone to the front then, he was reluctant to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to open up three lengths or so leaving the eighth pole," 
McCarron said. "Because then he might stick his toes into the ground and lose 
momentum." 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron said that after he heard the Santa Anita announcer, Trevor Denman, 
say that Pleasant Tango was moving, he asked Zignew to dig in. McCarron, who 
rode Bertrando to victory last year, became only the third back-to-back winner 
of the stake, which was first run in 1952. Bill Shoemaker rode the winners in 
1957-58 and Eddie Belmonte had a three-race streak that started in 1969.

 McCarron rode Zignew early in his career and has been aboard for the horse's 
last three races. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris has figured him out a lot," Smithwick said. "He waited as long as he 
could to move with him today. One of the problems with this horse is that he's 
never learned how to shift into overdrive. He was a May foal, and that's one of 
the reasons he never made it to the races as a 2-year-old. I hope the best with 
him is yet to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Chris Speckert could say the same thing about Pleasant Tango, who made 
his first start since a fifth-place finish in the Breeders' Cup Classic nine 
weeks back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have needed a bulldozer to get through in the stretch," Speckert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleasant Tango hadn't bled in the Breeders' Cup, but was a first-time Lasix 
user because of bleeding during a morning workout. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the last turn, there were a lot of traffic problems," jockey Eddie 
Delahoussaye said. "We had to weave in and out. After he got through, he made a 
run, but those other two were already gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Dollase and his crew were ecstatic about Nonproductiveasset's race, which was 
also marred by crowded quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I tried to go somewhere, I was looking for a place to go," jockey 
Corey Nakatani said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diazo came from the back of the pack to win in the Malibu. His worst finishes 
last year came when he raced close to the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't send him," jockey Laffit Pincay said Sunday. "I figured he'd be 
about six, seven lengths off the pace, but then all of a sudden he started 
running. He started fighting me, so I had to go with him. That's not his style, 
but I'll know next time." 
</P>
<P>
 There will probably be another large field for the series finale, the $500,000 
Strub Stakes at 1 1/4 miles on Feb. 6. Zignew, who has never run farther than 
Sunday's distance, will get his chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point in his career, I wasn't even sure he was a miler," Smithwick 
said. "But he's sure bred to run all day."

 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron rode three winners Sunday, and was astride the other stakes 
winner on the card when Musical Girl outfinished Flying In The Lane for a 1 
1/4-length victory in the $111,550 filly division of the California Breeders' 
Champion Stakes for 3-year-olds. Musical Girl, bred and owned by Sidney Factor, 
ran seven furlongs in 1:21 4/5, tying the stakes record. In her only other 
start, Musical Girl won a maiden race at Hollywood Park and Sunday she paid 
$21. Of the 12 stakes at the meet, only one has been won by a favorite. 
Overall, 21% of the races have been won by favorites, about 10% less than the 
national average. 
</P>
<P>
 Arches of Gold, who finished sixth in the race a year ago, is the 3-1 favorite 
in today's Santa Monica Handicap. . . . Legacy World, winner of the Japan Cup, 
is headed for trainer Richard Mandella's barn, to run in the San Juan 
Capistrano Handicap on April 24. Mandella's Kotashaan, a horse-of-the-year 
candidate in North America, ran second in the Japan Cup.

OGLE WINS HAWAIIAN OPEN AS DAVIS LOVE III FALTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Australia's Brett Ogle overtook a faltering Davis Love III and shot a 
four-under-par 68 Sunday to win the Hawaiian Open, his second victory in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogle took the lead to stay with a two-stroke swing, his birdie against Love's 
bogey, on the 17th hole at the Waialae Country Club and went on to a one-shot 
triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogle, who won the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am almost a year ago, scored his 
fourth worldwide triumph with a 19-under 269 total. It was worth $216,000 from 
the $1.2-million purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Love, who assumed the lead with a 60 in Friday's second round, could do no 
better than a 71 on each of his last two trips over the windblown course and 
finished at 270. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about like all the others I've thrown away -- not a lot of fun," Love 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the man who tied for fourth last week in the Mercedes Championship noted 
"only four guys have beat me in two weeks and I haven't played my best yet." 
</P>
<P>
 John Huston was third at 272, three back but never really in contention. He 
had a closing 67 and was followed by Corey Pavin, a two-time winner of this 
title, at 65-273. 
</P>
<P>
 Love and Ogle were paired in the final group and battled all the way. Love led 
outright on two occasions, Ogle led twice and they were tied three times. Love 
held a two-shot advantage when they started and once was three ahead before 
Ogle started back.

 USAir wants more business sending people to their final destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral directors who are booking flights for bodies and mourners can call a 
special reservations line intended to make the process easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Undertakers frequently find themselves in the role of travel agent, handling 
arrangements to fly remains and survivors to sometimes-distant burial places. 
</P>
<P>
 The USAir effort reflects airlines' increased efforts to get more revenue from 
cargo as passenger tickets have become less profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 And for every 30 corpses shipped on USAir, the funeral director gets a free 
round-trip ticket for domestic travel. 
</P>
<P>
 But they can leave their black suits behind. The ticket is good only for coach 
class, where the attire leans more toward blue jeans and sweat shirts.

FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES: HOLLYWOOD SIGALERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California has long been concerned about the loss of jobs and money due to 
"runaway production," the term used to describe movie and television producers' 
decisions to shoot scenes out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes word that filmmakers are even going elsewhere to shoot scenes set on 
Southern California's world-famous freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming Twentieth Century Fox film "The Chase" starring Charlie Sheen is 
a story about high-speed car chases on our freeways. But the freeways seen in 
the movie are actually in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a publicity statement on the film, the movie was filmed last 
summer in Houston "because the Texas metropolis offered more access to its 
freeways than traffic-choked Southern California." In addition, the film makers 
were given access to an unopened expressway. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Los Angeles film czar Cody Cluff nor California Film Commission 
Director Patti Archuletta finds that funny. 
</P>
<P>
 They argue that local and state officials close freeways all the time and 
could have easily accommodated the production. 
</P>
<P>
 "We close freeways better than anyone else in the world," Cluff says. And a 
Side Trip to Bosnia? 
</P>
<P>
 Peace may be starting to percolate in Northern Ireland after more than two 
decades of violence, but is the area ready to become a tourist mecca? 
</P>
<P>
 A 24-page supplement in the latest issue of Travel Weekly touts Northern 
Ireland as just that, noting that the British-ruled province welcomed a record 
1.25 million visitors in 1992 and probably set another record in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Canadian and American travelers visit Northern Ireland for its rich history, 
heritage, scenic beauty and the hospitality of the people, undoubtedly the 
country's strongest asset," the supplement says. 
</P>
<P>
 It also notes that "among savvy golfers, the prospect of traveling to Northern 
Ireland is cause for great excitement." Hype! 
</P>
<P>
 The self-help business seems to be making its point -- exclamation point -- if 
the new Prentice Hall catalogue of spring and summer publications is any 
indication. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the titles: "Eureka!" "Power Within!" "Turn Your Business Around!" 
"Behavior Smart!" "Really Writing!" "Tune In!" "Earth Smart!" "Hooked on 
Fitness!" "Science Starters!" "Sound Out!" and "Winning Tennis!" Briefly . . . 
</P>
<P>
 They'd do anything for promotion: An announcement by music video channel VH-1 
on a Meat Loaf special describes the singer as a "Rock God." . . . Start 
spreading the news: Golfers participating in singer Frank Sinatra's charity 
celebrity golf tournament in Palm Desert early next month will be presented 
with a Sinatra-autographed putter. . . . More Sinatra: For $10,000 per couple, 
they can also can see Sinatra's Rancho Mirage home from the inside at a 
nightcap party. . . . Marketing News says Elvis Presley Enterprises signed an 
agreement allowing a Silicon Valley telecommunications group to market calling 
cards featuring the King's picture.

JACK SMITH: COUNTING THE DAYS OF '94 WITH A FEW CHOICE QUOTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The year being well-launched, it is perhaps time for me to take notice of "An 
Expectation of Days: 1994," an irreverent calendar prepared by the 
irrepressible Bob Specht. 
</P>
<P>
 Specht used to edit the more dignified RAND Corp. calendar, whose latest 
edition I have already exploited. I wouldn't say Specht's "Expectation" is any 
less philosophical than RAND, but it is more fun. 
</P>
<P>
 To underline his lack of respect for convention, Specht's calendar has seven 
pages, rather than the usual 12. He does this by combining months that begin on 
the same day, for example, January and October, which both begin on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 I see no point in this except that it saves paper. 
</P>
<P>
 To suggest his distrust of serious philosophers, Specht quotes Ambrose Bierce: 
"All are lunatics, but he who can analyze his delusion is called a 
philosopher." 
</P>
<P>
 Specht expresses his own doubts about the human race in this observation: "In 
its flyby past the Earth, the spacecraft Galileo detected no clear signs of 
intelligent life." 
</P>
<P>
 Specht quotes Carl Sagan on human madness: "We are at risk. We do not need 
alien invaders. We have all by ourselves generated sufficient dangers." 
</P>
<P>
 Also noting humankind's self-destructive pastimes, he quotes Erasmus (by way 
of Leo Rosten): "Beasts do not fight collectively. Who has seen 10 lions fight 
10 bulls? Yet how often do 20,000 armed Christians fight 20,000 armed 
Christians?" 
</P>
<P>
 Specht quotes Sam Levenson on the value of the rebel spirit: "If the founding 
fathers of this country had all been well-adjusted, we would still be a British 
colony." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Specht's quotations show his respect for women: "God made man, and 
then said, 'I can do better than this,' and made woman." (Adela Rogers St. 
John.) 
</P>
<P>
 He quotes a prophetic letter from that unrelenting feminist Abigail Adams to 
her husband, John Adams, our second President, when he was a member of the 
First Continental Congress: "Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of 
the husbands. Remember all men would be tyrants if they could. If particular 
care and attention is not paid to the ladies we are determined to foment a 
rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no 
voice or representation." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a dubious recommendation that seven of the quotations in "Expectation" 
are from me. I had forgotten most of them and must assume they are included 
only in support of Specht's conviction that philosophers are not to be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
 I am pleased to note that Specht has chosen to quote a few of my thoughts in 
celebration of women. For example, "I don't think I have ever deliberately 
written anything anti-feminist except to express my conviction that no woman 
will ever play third base in major league baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Another of my thoughts Specht has seen fit to rescue from oblivion is one on 
domestic harmony: "I do believe in the fair division of chores between husbands 
and wives. Historically, my wife has prepared dinner while I take care of other 
chores, such as turning on lights, checking the TV log, and turning on 
television." 
</P>
<P>
 He quotes me also on the nature of political notoriety: "The century has so 
far given us no women who have that combination of power, hubris and iniquity 
found in most men who dominate history." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the iniquity, the former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
may be said to qualify for that distinction. Specht quotes her as follows: "In 
politics, if you want anything said, ask a man. If you want anything done, ask 
a woman." 
</P>
<P>
 I think I should point out that Specht also quotes me on a subject I know more 
about than I know about women: "Cats are very much like me. We share the same 
virtues, being independent, insolent, indolent, intractable, inquisitive, 
infuriating, morally intemperate and intellectually inaccessible." 
</P>
<P>
 It is curious that Specht has included two examples of a common form of insult 
meant to disparage one's intelligence from Paul Dickson's "Slang: The Topic by 
Topic Dictionary of Contemporary Lingoes."  
</P>
<P>
 "He's two cans short of a six-pack."  
</P>
<P>
 "His elevator doesn't go up to the top floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Specht also quotes me as saying, "In my immobility I have turned to television 
for company. . . . I asked my wife if she thought I had suffered any brain 
damage. She said yes." 
</P>
<P>
 What she meant, I think Specht is trying to tell me, is that my elevator 
doesn't go to the top floor.

 They worshiped him. Jumped to their feet to applaud him. Paid $500 each to 
dine with him. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the opera buffs who joined tenor Placido Domingo for dinner on 
Saturday night after his performance in the Spanish opera "El Gato Montes" at 
Segerstrom Hall questioned the appropriateness of a soon-to-be-53-year-old 
playing the role of a young matador. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a wonderful matador -- a very handsome matador, " observed one female 
guest during the champagne reception at the Four Seasons in Newport Beach. 
"Even if a little older matador. I mean, wasn't he playing someone in his 20s?" 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed Domingo had heard it all before. No sooner had he swept into the 
hotel ballroom than a guest asked him about the "challenge" of playing opera. 
</P>
<P>
 His graceful reply: "All of the roles I play are for young people, you know? 
It is important for me to use my imagination, because I am over the age of any 
role I play. I try to keep the sound very lyrical, the voice really calm." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he flashed a smile that would melt a lorgnette. "Mostly, I am very proud 
and happy that an opera so close to me is loved by the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. The audience applauded wildly at the conclusion of "El Gato Montes" 
(The Wildcat), a Los Angeles Music Center Opera production presented by Opera 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Said his co-star, the Chile-born soprano, Veronica Villarroel: "On stage, we 
could feel the warmth of the public from the beginning. We could see their 
smiling faces. It is very energetic music -- people like the feel of it." 
</P>
<P>
 During the final act, Villarroel lies in repose, flickering tapers at her 
feet, while a lover (Justino Diaz in the role of Juanillo) and a band of 
Gypsies bemoan her fate. "It is difficult to lie there so quietly," said this 
vibrant young soprano who has performed at the Met and La Scala. "You have to 
be very relaxed. I sing with the people in my mind to maintain it." 
</P>
<P>
 As for performing with Domingo, "it is always an unforgettable experience," 
she said. "We have done many concerts together. We also did this opera together 
in Madrid last summer." 
</P>
<P>
 During the festivities -- which included a sit-down supper and a stand-up 
demitasse with Domingo -- an ebullient David DiChiera, general director of 
Opera Pacific, told the crowd: "The exciting thing about tonight is that, 
besides being its West Coast premiere, this opera gives us a wonderful 
opportunity to create a bridge to the Hispanic community here in Orange 
County." 
</P>
<P>
 Among guests were gala co-chairwomen Mary Roosevelt and Michelle Rohe 
("Placido Domingo has always been my husband Frederick's favorite tenor," she 
said. "And though Frederick cannot be here with me tonight, he is in my 
heart"); Floss and Ed Schumacher; Dr. Walter Henry and Spain-born Maria Del 
Carmen Calvo ("I loved the bullfight scene," she said. "I used to go to the 
bullfights with my father in Madrid"); Renee ("I saw bullfights in Spain when 
Franco was in power") and Henry Segerstrom; Laila and Bill Conlin; Dick and 
Jolene Engel; Zee Allred; Ed McGrath; Tom and Marilyn Nielsen; Elaine Redfield; 
and Dotti and Glenn Stillwell.

 Still buzzing over London: South Coast Repertory supporters climbed aboard a 
British Airways jet and spent New Year's Eve in London, catching "Sunset 
Blvd.," "Carousel," "King Lear" and "The Madness of George III" during a jaunt 
that also offered tea at the Savoy, a medieval feast at a hunting lodge in the 
country and a tour of the National Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour-goers paid $1,699 each and SCR ended up with about $20,000 in its 
coffers. "The first time we did this was 10 years ago -- on our 20th 
anniversary," said Susan Reeder, the theater's associate director of 
development. "It was fabulous." The highlight? "New Year's Eve, when we watched 
the cast of 'Sunset Blvd.' come out for a curtain call. They shot streamers and 
confetti into the audience and we all sang 'Auld Lang Syne.' "

 A Tribute to Athalie Clarke: In what may be the year's most emotional social 
gathering, a reception launching the Athalie Richardson Irvine Clarke Memorial 
Exhibition will be held on May 5 at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in 
Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was Clarke Orange County's grand dame when she died last May, she was 
a friend to Presidents Nixon, Carter and Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit consists of about 50 paintings that were displayed in Clarke's 
Newport Beach home. Paintings that she contributed to the Irvine Museum will 
also be in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying the exhibit will be the publication of a 125-page book, "Memories 
of My Mother," written by Clarke's daughter, heiress Joan Irvine Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke's unpublished memoirs are being incorporated into the book, which will 
also contain photos of her art collection and archival photographs from her 
life -- from her first baby picture to the final picture of her taken on 
Valentine's Day last year.

INTO THE NIGHT / BILL HIGGINS: $6.4 MILLION HAUL NOTHING TO LAUGH AT

 The Scene: Saturday's Comic Relief VI at the Shrine Auditorium. There was a 
party for 1,400 in the Exposition Hall concurrent with the comedy telethon 
benefiting the homeless. In addition, 2,000 of the 6,000 guests in the audience 
were invited to the hall afterward. After leaving a five-hour show, they 
arrived at the buffets with fervor. A number of guests mentioned they'd never 
in their entire lives been so happy to get a slice of free pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: Since 1986, more than $20 million has been raised. HBO 
underwrites both the show's expenses and the organization's operating costs so 
all of the $6.4 million proceeds of this year's event will go to health care 
programs for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Amidst much flux, the party crowd included co-hosts Whoopi 
Goldberg, Billy Crystal and Robin Williams, plus Dustin Hoffman, Larry King, 
Barry Levinson, Rosie Perez, Paula Poundstone, Carl Reiner, David Crosby, L.A. 
Mayor Richard Riordan, Paul Rodriguez, Kevin Pollack, Bobcat Goldthwait, Marisa 
Tomei and Comic Relief president/founder Bob Zmuda. 
</P>
<P>
 The Locale: The cavernous Exposition Hall looks like "that room where LBJ 
greets the astronauts in 'The Right Stuff,"' said Dennis Miller. The walls were 
draped in black cloth, the floor covered in matching Astroturf. Two 
theater-size screens telecast the show. Eating and conversing seemed to take 
precedence over watching the fund-raiser. "It's a bunch of comedians schmoozing 
for jobs," observed comic Doug Bady. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Overused Material: There were paramedics standing by to treat victims of 
the newly discovered Bobbitt Joke Overload Syndrome. One guest said he lost 
count at somewhere past 100 references. Garry Shandling defended the comic's 
use of the material by saying, "The Bobbitt trial is what we've been waiting 
for all our lives. I think that puts it in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Moment: When Dustin Hoffman and Larry King got to deciding who, 
living or dead, should play themselves in a film bio, King went for George Raft 
while Hoffman opted for John Garfield.

COMEDY REVIEW; IT'S NO JOKE: $6.4 MILLION; COMIC RELIEF SETS RECORD BUT 
OVERDOSES ON BOBBITT HUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID KRONKE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 After Comic Relief VI, the whole country is probably suffering from an 
overdose of Bobbittuates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comic Relief benefits -- Saturday's raised a record $6.4 million by the 
time it signed off its nationwide telecast from the Shrine Auditorium -- have 
always sought to straddle the line between supplying laughs, and lots of them, 
and sensitively underscoring the plight of the nation's homeless. It's no easy 
task, as comedy and homelessness are obviously not easily meshed, and in the 
past the result has been a few moments of misguidedly maudlin preachiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's show, hosted as usual by Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg and Robin 
Williams, orchestrated the shifts in mood deftly, and even though brevity is 
generally considered the soul of wit, the epic, 5-hour production moved along 
at a brisk clip for at least the first 3 1/2 hours. Some of the best -- and 
best-known -- comics raced through their prime material in brief sets. 
</P>
<P>
 But the barrage of jokes about John Wayne Bobbitt's ill-fated anatomy was 
enough to give you the willies. Not since Dan Quayle and family values inspired 
an outpouring of invective at the 1992 Emmy Awards have there been so many 
performers gratuitously piling on one topic. Time for a moratorium, OK, guys? 
</P>
<P>
 After Bobbitt, the Menendez brothers trial garnered a lot of punch lines. The 
Angst -on-ice saga of Nancy Kerrigan, Tonya Harding and the goon who came 
between them cropped up occasionally, along with a few, generally timid, 
meditations on Michael Jackson. Dennis Miller tried to capture the overall tone 
with a line that served as the Cliff's Notes of the evening's comedy: "My 
brother and I snuck into our Hispanic father's bedroom and cut off his (penis) 
with an ice skate -- just wanted to cover all the bases." 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Butler, star of the hit sitcom "Grace Under Fire," was rushed at one 
point during her performance by a thug with an iron bar. "Not me, you idiot!" 
she scolded the interloper. "Rita Rudner! Rita Rudner!" Butler also took the 
evening's one shot at conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh -- "I was at 
'Schindler's List' and he started the wave." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg's own recent tabloid travails were aired at length, as well, mainly 
by Goldberg herself, though her righteous anger wasn't tempered with enough 
genuine wit, resulting in a routine that didn't evolve much from your standard 
"expletive-you." 
</P>
<P>
 The entire first half of Williams' extended set was dedicated to -- well, 
guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Later into the program, a few comics pointedly backed off the joke du jour. 
Kevin Pollak reached back to Ross Perot for a laugh, offering one of the 
billionaire's quixotic homilies: "The economy is like peanut butter: If you 
feed it to a horse and he chews it, it'll look like he's talking." During an 
edgy, energetic set, Carlos Mencia looked to last autumn's fires and the riots 
of 1992 (the cause for looting: a TV newscaster announcing during the riots, 
"I'm here at a K mart . . . and there are no police anywhere "). 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Chappelle and Paul Rodriguez offered funny, sage sets focusing on the 
country's racial divisiveness. Rodriguez noted: "It's 1994, and the only 
Latinos consistently on TV are the Menendez brothers. We have to kill our 
mothers to get on TV?" Bill Maher offered the sort of droll, clear-eyed 
sardonic wit that serves him well on his cable series "Politically Incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
 The evening emphasized younger comics. Alan King, the elder statesman of the 
performers, came through with a passionate and sometimes harrowingly funny 
reflection on growing older. The cast of the classic TV series "Your Show of 
Shows" -- Cid Caesar, Imogene Coca, Carl Reiner and Howard Morris -- appeared, 
but only to pitch Comic Relief T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Iris Stevenson's Crenshaw High School Elite Choir gave the benefit a rousing 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 From glorious gospel music to Bobcat Goldthwait's endearingly dopey turn as a 
magician who transformed the miracles of Christ into rank parlor tricks to 
Marisa Tomei's spokesmodel-for-the-homeless waif act, Comic Relief VI had 
something to uplift and offend everyone.

DOMINGO AND CO. TAME PENELLA'S WILDCAT; OPERA REVIEW: WHILE TECHNICALLY NOT 
OPERA, IN ITS BEST MOMENTS "EL GATO MONTES" IS GOOD OPERA; IN ITS WORST, STILL 
INTERESTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "El Gato Montes," a.k.a. "The Wildcat," isn't your ordinary everyday 
garden-variety opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, it isn't an opera at all. Its creators called the splashy opus a 
zarzuela. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes it an intrinsically Spanish, essentially popular entertainment 
fusing music, drama, folklore and dance. 
</P>
<P>
 But if it looks like an opera, sounds like an opera, smells like an opera, 
stars Placido Domingo, and is presented by the Music Center Opera of Los 
Angeles at the Orange County Performing Arts Center under the auspices of Opera 
Pacific, it must be an opera. Right? 
</P>
<P>
 Right. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is: Is it a great opera? 
</P>
<P>
 Not really. 
</P>
<P>
 Does that matter? 
</P>
<P>
 Not really. 
</P>
<P>
 In its best moments, "El Gato Montes" is a good opera. And in its worst 
moments, it still is interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 One's response to Manuel Penella Moreno's easy, blood-and-gutsy saga of tragic 
love, lusty lust, misplaced honor, noble revenge and pretty death among the 
dashing matadors, brooding peasants, romantic outcasts and comic relievers of 
old Andalusia depends on one's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to Puccini -- and the comparison is inevitable -- Penella would seem 
to be a very competent imitator. There are worse fates. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to Andrew Lloyd Webber -- and the comparison is painfully pertinent 
-- Penella would seem to be a deathless genius. He doesn't repeat himself. He 
doesn't overwrite. He doesn't cheat, and he doesn't ooze slushpump sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Music Center Opera, which will follow the gala Orange County tryout with 
six performances at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion starting Wednesday, isn't 
calling the project an American premiere. Historians tell us that an Anglicized 
version of "El Gato Montes" played Broadway for 10 weeks in 1921 -- five years 
after the first triumphant performance at the Teatro Principal in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 There can be no question, however, that the current version is far more 
elaborate, far more serious, and probably more authentic than its distant New 
York predecessor. This production, after all, comes from the Teatro Lirico 
Nacional in Madrid, where it was first seen in 1992. It enlists a stellar cast 
that understands and savors the idiom. It is staged by Emilio Sagi with equal 
parts sensitivity and flamboyance, and it uses a new musical text lovingly and 
lavishly edited by the conductor Miguel Roa. 
</P>
<P>
 The capacity audience in Costa Mesa seemed to adore every quiver and every 
hemidemisemiquaver at the opening on Saturday. The high-tension arias, the 
fervent duets and the neatly delineated ensembles earned instant ovations. So 
did Goyo Montero's gypsy-pipsy dance divertissements. So did Julio Galan's 
picturesque sets -- three-quarters naturalistic, one-quarter abstract. 
</P>
<P>
 The climactic bullfight, accompanied by Penella's beloved pasodoble in the pit 
and embellished with some distressing newsreel footage on the scrim, inspired 
the wonted awe as well as many an ah. The music was nice -- simplistic, 
perhaps, but always nice -- and the stagecraft was terrific. 
</P>
<P>
 Penella's score abounds in folk impulses that add a compelling Spanish accent 
to the predictable verismo formulas. This is music that wants desperately to 
please, and cliches pose no obstacle. There is plenty of hummable melody here, 
much snappy rhythm, a lot of gushing emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 The desperate climaxes produce high notes in all the right places, and the 
orchestra always reinforces the proper response. When the titular heavy makes 
his entrance, the assembled brass actually blare ominous chords worthy of a 
misplaced Scarpia. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem with "El Gato Montes" involves its structure. Penella uses 
the first act for careful exposition of character and plot. In the second act 
he concentrates on the action-climax. Then things tend to fall apart, with too 
little coming too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenor-hero has met his cruel fate with hardly an "adios." The grieving 
soprano dies her "Leidestod" during an intermission. The baritone-antihero 
turns into a tragic figure with hardly a pause for demonstrative introspection. 
Expansion is needed here, but development does not seem to be the composer's 
forte. 
</P>
<P>
 The performers do their considerable best to accentuate the positive. Domingo, 
the operative force behind the entire venture, brings Otello power as well as 
push-button temperament to the dashing agonies, not to mention the diverting 
ecstasies, of the matador Rafael Ruiz. The ever-forceful Justino Diaz manages 
to be both sinister and sympathetic as his "wildcat" nemesis, the 
baritonal-bandit Juanillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Villarroel exerts the perfect aura of wounded ardor as the 
long-suffering heroine who loves both men -- in different ways. Her big, 
bright, occasionally rough-edged soprano sounds far more vibrant as Solea than 
it did as Puccini's Mimi in San Francisco or Verdi's Violetta in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The large supporting cast adds appreciative nuances of not-so-local color. 
Carlos Chausson offers a sweetly befuddled Padre Anton. Suzanna Guzman delivers 
an apt Carmen audition as "una gitana." Michael Gallup blusters amiably as the 
picador Hormigon, a pardonable memory lapse notwithstanding. Mabel Perelstein 
introduces a classically maternal contralto as Frasquita, and John Atkins is 
deft as always as the valet Caireles. In the fleeting utterances of the street 
vendor, Greg Fedderly suggests that his elegant lyric tenor has been misused in 
crusty comprimario assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone articulated the Spanish text -- and, one assumes, the Andalusian 
dialect -- with apparent ease. The super-titles proved useful in conveying the 
niceties of an unfamiliar plot, although, once again, they drew attention to 
the screen atop the proscenium at the expense of the actors on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Roa conducted with seasoned flair, if without maximum fire. He received 
staunch support from the so-called Music Center Opera Orchestra, which didn't 
sound like the pick-up band it must be.

JAZZ REVIEW; KARUKAS AND TRIO PERFORM MUSICAL HIGH-WIRE ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sense of drama is central to the music of keyboardist Gregg Karukas. Nearly 
every tune he and his backing trio played Saturday at Randell's contained 
passages in which soloists climbed from reserved, sometimes considered 
beginnings into strong, often stratospheric heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when this pattern of spiraling excitement became predictable, Karukas 
changed the pace, playing a solo number on acoustic piano, then leading the 
combo in a touching ballad with the relaxed feel of afterglow. This needed 
change of pace provided a break until Karukas picked up the tempo and embraced 
the dramatic once again. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing a long opening set of originals pulled primarily from his 
"Summerhouse" and "Sound of Emotion" albums, Karukas demonstrated an almost 
literate sense of plot development, letting things open slowly and accessibly 
while setting the groundwork for the agitation and entanglements to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the high tension was provided by saxophonist Boney James, who moved 
his improvisations easily past cozy, melodic statements into tough, sometimes 
frantic fits of expression. 
</P>
<P>
 The only tune in the set not composed by Karukas -- Joe Zawinul's "Mercy, 
Mercy, Mercy" -- lent itself perfectly to this kind of foreplay and climax, and 
the band took full advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 James, playing tenor, used "Mercy" to show some chops, working up fleet if 
sometimes repetitive lines detailed with soulful sounds. Karukas explored firm, 
rhythmic chording splashed with uneasy, atonal touches. 
</P>
<P>
 The number also gave bassist Bruce Atkinson a chance to step upfront. True to 
the band's chosen method of operation, he moved from deeply voiced, melodic 
passages into bright, finger-popped lines at his solo's close. 
</P>
<P>
 Other numbers handled with the same developmental strategy included "Severna 
Park," a mid-tempo funk exercise that saw Karukas coming out of his seat behind 
a pair of synthesizers as the dynamic ante increased, and "Thanks for the 
Reason," a gospel-tinged blues statement that featured James' tenor squeals at 
the height of his solo. 
</P>
<P>
 Though all of the tunes featured easily accessed rhythms and melodic hooks, 
the most ambitious of the lot was the title tune from "Summerhouse," with the 
minor-key feel of its bass introduction and the unexpected chord changes in 
Karukas' lead.  
</P>
<P>
 James added an easy, grooving tenor line before the keyboardist took over with 
his strongest improvisation, a gliding, beat-induced effort pitted with blue 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The change of pace came when Karukas moved to the acoustic grand to play a 
solo version of "Sound of Emotion." Though the keyboardist worked through the 
simple piece with authentic emotion, the slow-paced number came off dull and 
flat compared to the rest of the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the band moved into another ballad, "Love on the Beach," 
constructed on an almost droning bass line and featuring James' touching, if 
not thoughtful, alto work. 
</P>
<P>
 That this is a working band -- James, Atkinson and drummer Joel Taylor all 
make appearance on the "Summerhouse" album -- was apparent from the tightness 
and polish of their presentation. Taylor was especially instrumental in this, 
bringing on-the-money timekeeping to the predictable rhythms while adding 
plenty of off-beat interest with cymbal embellishments and snare-drum accents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Karukas, who has shown his versatility working behind Brazilian composer, 
guitarist and vocalist Dori Caymmi as well as singer Shelby Flint, needs to 
bring more variety to both his inevitable sense of dynamics and his rhythmic 
slant, something he did on "Moon Lit Breeze," a Brazilian-influenced number 
dedicated to Caymmi. 
</P>
<P>
 That he's a smart composer with a good ear for drama was apparent; that his 
approach can be predictably tedious over a period of time was also there to be 
heard.

PITCHESS ON FRONT LINE OF JAIL RACE WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The word passed quietly through the jailhouse, from visitors to inmates, then 
on to other inmates: The Mexican Mafia wanted its minions to "get the blacks" 
at exactly 3:55 p.m. as they watched the Raiders playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the time came, Allen (Chivo) Gonzalez and his homeboys went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Far outnumbering the black inmates in their maximum-security dormitory at the 
Peter J. Pitchess jail, the Latinos swarmed toward them with homemade "shank" 
knives and broom handles, beating the blacks into a corner, where they fought 
for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack eight days ago was unlike the hundreds of smaller, apparently 
spontaneous jail riots in the past, sparked by fights over cigarettes, pay 
phones and the like. This one was planned, authorities have confirmed, and the 
aggressors were organized. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard the word that we were supposed to jump them, so we let them have 
it," said Gonzalez, who at 18 is already headed to state prison for attempted 
murder and armed robbery.

 There is a race war going down in the Los Angeles County Jail system, and the 
Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho, as it is officially named, is the front line. 
It is a war that inmates, authorities and sociologists say is but one symptom 
of a black-vs.-brown gang power struggle over drugs and turf that has 
reverberated through state prisons, the streets of Venice and other parts of 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 And, inmates, deputies and sociologists say, it is a war that may be 
unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
 It has erupted in jail dormitories and court lockups, on buses and in jail 
workout rooms and cafeterias from Santa Monica to Pomona. But the largest 
conflict to date -- the largest in County Jail history -- was the Jan. 9 melee 
at the Castaic jail's maximum-security North County Correctional Facility, 
where Gonzalez was among as many as 1,000 inmates who began to battle as the 
Raiders coasted to victory over the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gonna happen again and again and again," Gonzalez said last week, 
turning to grin at his Latino cellmates as they flipped gang signs in Dormitory 
611. "That's just how it is." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now," he said, "it's either them, or you." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Once inclined to fight gangsters of their own race, blacks and Latinos are now 
squaring off in the cramped confines of incarceration and lashing out at each 
other with unprecedented ferocity. Authorities are at their wit's end, trying 
to buy time with racial segregation, shows of force, discipline and lock-downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a tremendous problem here," acknowledged Pitchess Cmdr. Robert J. 
Spierer last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Myron, chief of the Sheriff's Department's Custody Division, which 
oversees all jails, confirmed Friday that the agency is actively investigating 
tips and intelligence information that the riot was sparked by visitors 
affiliated with the Mexican Mafia, who passed on the directive to Latino 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack went off in two buildings at once -- instantly spreading from one 
50-man dorm to another. Overwhelmed deputies in riot gear tossed in "stingball" 
grenades, trying to regain order from their safe haven outside the bars. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until eight hours later that the fighting at the mammoth facility 39 
miles north of Los Angeles finally ended. Eighty inmates were injured, 24 of 
them requiring hospital treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, fights have been a daily occurrence at North County and the use of 
pay phones and other privileges have been halted "until they start acting like 
human beings again," Myron said. Visiting hours were canceled over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 A chilling foreshadowing of last week's violence came before Christmas, Myron 
said, when a member of the fearsome Black Guerrilla Family prison gang was 
viciously attacked by Mexican Mafia cohorts in the maximum-security Pelican Bay 
prison near the Oregon border. 
</P>
<P>
 "That, possibly, was the first signal that the attacks on blacks was 
beginning," Myron said. "They want to show that they can do what they want to 
do, and that one group is superior to another." 
</P>
<P>
 Fearful of another assault, deputies in riot gear prowled the sprawling 
Pitchess facility all last week, randomly searching inmates, their bunk beds 
and common areas for homemade weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're quite ingenious," said Deputy Robert Harms, holding up deadly looking 
knives fashioned from plastic toothbrushes and metal shoe supports. "They find 
things we overlook." 
</P>
<P>
 Troublesome inmates are being sent elsewhere, mostly within the County Jail 
system. And, slowly, deputies are trying to re-integrate inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 But re-integration is exactly what many inmates don't want -- especially the 
African Americans, who are outnumbered nearly 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonzo Hicks, 42, was one of many black inmates who told Spierer that Latinos 
would cause more bloodshed if the races aren't kept separate. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are arming themselves, and there is animosity," Hills said in an 
interview. "I'm concerned about making it out of here alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez and other Latinos said they would prefer remaining separated too, 
that they dislike blacks and are just following orders to fight. They believe 
orders come from veterano gangsters, including the Mexican Mafia, to settle the 
latest killing or affront. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just what I heard," Gonzalez said. "We bomb on them, or we get bombed 
-- by our own, if we don't take care of business. . . . You have to do it. You 
just do." 
</P>
<P>
 In an open letter to prison authorities last week, more than 50 black inmates 
said sheriff's deputies who patrol the jail are exacerbating the situation by 
forcing them to re-integrate and baiting them with racial slurs. Written by 
inmate Clyde Hayes, the letter said: " . . . organized confusion, which is 
being fueled by the sheriffs . . . jeopardizes the lives of blacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes, like other inmates, said in an interview that the situation is 
superheated now because sheriff's officials have long ignored the root causes 
of the racial tension, including overcrowding and dwindling programs to keep 
inmates busy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should be trying to establish lines of communication between the blacks, 
Latinos and sheriff about why this is happening," said Hayes, 27. "But nobody 
is doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now," he said, "somebody is gonna die. We're tired of playing these silly-ass 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whites, greatly outnumbered, try to stay on the sidelines. "I'm terribly 
worried," said Igor Russo, 33, who is in jail for failing to complete community 
service work. "I'm scared for my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Racially motivated fights and riots have been commonplace in the nation's 
largest county jail system for years. More than 400 inmates were injured in 57 
racially motivated riots last year alone, Spierer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, sheriff's officials attributed the violence to the power struggle 
that evolved as jail demographics changed. Blacks used to control the jails, 
but by 1991 found themselves outnumbered by Latinos 40% to 37%. The disparity 
has continued to grow ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the fighting escalating from sporadic scuffles to organized 
violence, the Sheriff's Department has quietly enlisted the help of outsiders 
-- top black and Latino church leaders and, last week, the American Civil 
Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
 It even asked the ACLU, which monitors jail conditions, to help examine 
whether inmates could be segregated by race. ACLU leaders say they are 
seriously considering supporting the idea, even though it would represent a 
major policy shift. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sat around . . . and nobody had an answer," said Ramona Ripston, executive 
director of the ACLU's Southern California office, of last Tuesday's meeting 
with sheriff's officials. "Even if we were to agree that segregation was 
acceptable under these circumstances . . . what do they do when these inmates 
go on buses to court? What happens in the lockups in the courts and the holding 
cells? It is a terrible, terrible situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Like ACLU leaders, Father Gregory Boyle -- whose East Los Angeles gang 
ministry has won the trust of Latino gang members -- said he thinks segregation 
may be necessary, at least temporarily. The Sheriff's Department has sought his 
counsel as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, I think it's gotten bad," he said, after talking by phone with one of 
the dozen or so inmates he keeps in touch with each day. "Any way we can get 
this at the roots and resolve it inside (jail) so it doesn't bleed out onto the 
streets is what we need to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials in the past have opposed jail segregation, which is not 
prohibited by a specific law but could be challenged under other integration 
statutes, they believe. They also say it would be impossible to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in an integrated society, and I think it sends the wrong message and 
says too much about our failure if we can't deal with this in an integrated 
setting," Spierer said. "We need to find a way to deal with it rather than 
throw our hands in the air and say we are giving up." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials are considering reconvening a 1991 task force that 
recommended fundamental changes in the way the Pitchess jail is organized and 
administered, Myron said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as in the past, few department officials hold out hope for an imminent 
solution. "As earnest as they were in their suggestions," Myron said of the 
panel, "nothing we tried worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates and other critics counter that the Sheriff's Department hasn't tried 
hard enough, that it has long ignored festering problems that created a tense 
atmosphere in which inmates are quick to rumble. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the Sheriff's Inmate Disturbance Task Force recommended a system of 
"progressive housing" that would reward inmates for good behavior with better 
living conditions. But two years later, that system is just beginning to take 
shape, mainly due to tight budgets, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Some outside experts called for inmate councils that can bring problems to 
jail officials. Myron says that idea was tried and discarded as ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 And such experts as Ed Koren of the National Prison Project in Washington, D. 
C., say dorms like those at Pitchess, which each house as many as 130 inmates, 
are fertile ground for racial tensions and rioting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the dorms, blacks and Latinos kill time side by side, and the most minor 
slight is visible to everyone. Locking down dorms only means cooping the 
combatants all up together. That was clear on Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a pleasant sight, when you think you're running a jail, and three 
hours after the incident started you realize you don't have control," Myron 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said most of the dorms at Pitchess were built before overcrowding kicked 
loose all but the most violent criminals, who land at Pitchess to serve County 
Jail sentences or await trial or sentencing before heading off to state prison. 
Built to house 6,000 inmates, Pitchess now holds 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the dorms and group barracks were not meant to house the accused 
murderers and other intractable offenders who now reside there, Myron said, 
scrapping them for more manageable cells would be astronomically expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other improvements have been slowed or dropped by the lack of money. 
"We'll just have to struggle through with what we've got and do the best we 
can," Myron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates have laughed at the mere suggestion of some other programs, including 
racial sensitivity classes. Nevertheless, 1,700 more inmate beds are set to 
come on line in Lynwood this spring. Sheriff's officials say they are planning 
another safety measure: a money-less credit system so inmates can buy food and 
supplies without the fear of extortion from other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies randomly interview inmates each week trying to uncover conflicts 
before they explode and have posted anonymous complaint boxes throughout the 
jails. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's jail inspection commission, which advises the Board of 
Supervisors, plans to meet Wednesday to discuss the recent riots at Pitchess. 
It has asked Sheriff Sherman Block to report on the situation, and members want 
to tour the facility "when it's safe," said Commissioner Jim Cragin. 
</P>
<P>
 Myron also confirmed that an internal investigation is under way into 
allegations that at least three deputies engaged in misconduct toward inmates 
during or after the Jan. 9 riot that could have exacerbated the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 But some say all the money in the world wouldn't solve problems that sheriff's 
officials say come from the street and society. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Latinos want the power" in the jails, said the ACLU'S Ripston. "And they 
are going to take it." 
</P>
<P>
 But blacks say they will relinquish nothing without a fight. "This ain't about 
gangs. It's about blacks versus Mexicans," said Clyde Hayes, the author of the 
letter from black inmates. "There's gonna be another riot. There's gonna be a 
riot from now on."

O.C. WATER CHIEF QUITS AFTER TRIPS DISCLOSED; TRAVEL: SANTA MARGARITA CHAIRMAN 
CITES 'CONTINUED ADVERSE NEWS,' INCLUDING REPORTS OF HIS FREE MEXICO VISITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chairman of the Santa Margarita Water District resigned Sunday, the same 
day it was disclosed that he had taken free trips to Cabo San Lucas, courtesy 
of an Orange County engineering firm that has received millions of dollars in 
district contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Don B. Schone, 52, who has served on the board for 17 years, submitted his 
resignation effective today and, in a written statement, said it was "due to 
continued adverse news which distracts from the effectiveness of (the 
district's) important objectives." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Sunday that Schone was treated to stays in Cabo San Lucas 
for four days in April, 1990, and again for five days in May, 1991, with 
travel, lodging, food and drinks paid by Robert Bein, William Frost & 
Associates, an Irvine engineering firm. Schone didn't report the trips, as 
required by state conflict-of-interest regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Schone initially said he had been on only one trip, in 1990, to inspect a 
Bein, Frost sewage reclamation treatment plant installed for Koll Co. 
developments. On Sunday, he acknowledged embarking on a "follow-up" trip in 
1991 for the same purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 His travels, he said in an earlier statement, were beneficial to understanding 
how the Santa Margarita Water District might reclaim water during a drought. 
</P>
<P>
 In his written statement Sunday, Schone said he did not list the cost of the 
trips on his statements of economic interest -- required by state law -- 
because he had not fully understood the requirement at the time of his travels. 
He called his failure to report the trips a "misunderstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is worth mentioning that business expense reporting guidelines were not 
consistently disseminated or understood uniformly within" the district, Schone 
wrote. "Specifically, the practice of receiving and extending courtesy 
reciprocation for business meeting and function expenses was not well defined" 
in district regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, an official who accepts gifts valued at more than $250 in any 
12-month period must abstain from voting on any official decisions that could 
affect the donor in the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Schone should have abstained from voting on matters affecting 
Bein, Frost in 1991 and 1992 because the trips were estimated to be worth 
between $600 and $700. 
</P>
<P>
 Schone continued, along with other directors, however, to approve Bein, Frost 
contracts. During 1991 and 1992, the board approved nearly $9 million in Bein, 
Frost engineering work. 
</P>
<P>
 Schone was chairman during a scandal that has consumed the district for much 
of last year and led to the resignations of the district's general manager, 
Walter W. (Bill) Knitz, and assistant general manager, Michael P. Lord. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Knitz and Lord are under a joint state-federal criminal investigation for 
conflicts of interest stemming from their acceptance of gifts, first disclosed 
last year in The Times. The two managers also spent tens of thousands of 
dollars on personal perks, which outraged many district ratepayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the scandal, Schone was reluctant to criticize Knitz and Lord. The 
two managers accompanied the chairman on both trips to the Baja California 
resort area, but reported the travel on their state disclosure forms. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Schone declined to explain why he did not file amended statements 
of economic interest reflecting the Mexico trips when the issue of gift-giving 
had been aired so thoroughly in the press in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the district spent $5,000 on a legal seminar last summer to teach all 
board members and top district employees how to comply with state 
gift-reporting requirements administered by the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 New district guidelines adopted in May prohibit board members and employees 
from accepting all but the smallest gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 The only gift an employee can receive is a meal or beverage related to a 
business meeting and, even then, it cannot exceed $25 per meeting. No more than 
$50 can come from any one source over a calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
 Every district employee is required to submit a quarterly listing of all 
gifts, which can include as little as a cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Those doing business with the district must submit an annual inventory of 
gifts provided to district employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, both Knitz and Lord made some disclosure on trips provided by 
Bein, Frost in 1990 and 1991. Lord listed the 1990 Mexico trip as being worth 
$2,000 but did not list the 1991 trip. Knitz listed trips worth $3,000 by Bein, 
Frost in 1990 and the 1991 trip as worth $1,400. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of Bein, Frost said last week that the company would have no 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 With Schone's resignation, all five members of the board that were in office 
when the scandal erupted last March are gone. One board member retired last 
May. Three others were voted out of office in November. The four new board 
members will select Schone's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 In what he said would be his last communication with the news media, Schone's 
written statement criticized the press for stories over the past 10 months that 
he said "warrant correction, clarification and balance" although he was not 
specific and concluded, "it is time to move on and end the distractions." 
</P>
<P>
 New board member Bob Lay praised Schone's help to his colleagues in the months 
after the election and said he came to like the chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We frankly needed help and he was of real good assistance to give us some 
perspective," Lay said Sunday. "I got to know the guy over the last couple of 
months, and I think a lot of him. I don't know the circumstances of what 
happened (with the trips), but he was dedicated and a real straight-up person." 
State Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), who authored a bill that became law 
earlier this month that allows district board members to be selected by popular 
vote, said Schone's resignation was proper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that maybe after 17 or 18 years with no oversight to speak 
of, you kind of lose touch with reality," Conroy said. "I don't mind that he 
made those trips, but when you come back, if you have to report it, then report 
it. Be proud of why you went and what you did." 
</P>
<P>
 Schone's resignation was in the best interest of the district, Conroy said, 
"after all the problems they went through last year. He was responsible. He was 
chairman of the board. Now that he's out, they are basically cleaned up down 
there, and I hope they can now go about their business." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had contemplated resigning for some time, Schone said he stayed on 
"to provide historical continuity during the recent restructuring period" and 
to interview candidates for the general manager's job. The new manager, John J. 
Schatz, 39, begins work at the Santa Margarita Water District today. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Schone stated that a news account of the trips made his prompt 
resignation more "timely." 
</P>
<P>
 Schone, an engineer with Southern California Edison, called his tenure with 
the board "a labor of love" and said he used vacation time to attend board 
meetings.

RACIAL STRIFE AMONG YOUTHS TESTS LAGUNA; DIVERSITY: FIGHTS AT HIGH SCHOOL 
BETWEEN WHITE, LATINO STUDENTS THREATEN CITY'S TOLERANT IMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOREEN CARVAJAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In this isolated shore town, fabled for its tolerance of a wide array of 
lifestyles, a string of racially charged confrontations involving young people 
is testing the liberal values that have attracted so many to the "Riviera of 
the West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
 Since autumn, the rambling compound of Laguna Beach High School has been 
struck by a series of tense incidents pitting white teen-age boys against 
students of Mexican descent. The Latino students are part of a small, slowly 
growing minority at Laguna High, where the population historically has been 
overwhelmingly white. The school continues to have the highest percentage of 
white students in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest fracas, a 16-year-old white student was banished from the school 
last week in connection with a snack-line fight in mid-December that escalated 
from insults about Mexicans to a blow with a clenched fist wrapped in a chain. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials also tried to expel a white athlete who snatched a lead pipe 
from a wood shop to threaten Latino students in October, according to school 
Supt. Paul Possemato. But after appeals from the student's parents and lawyer, 
Possemato said the student ultimately was allowed to remain in continuation 
high school under special supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 While those events were unfolding, the veteran chairman of Laguna High's 
foreign language department fired off letters to Possemato and school principal 
Barbara Callard, complaining about another student who trailed him along the 
city's winding streets, taunting him with ethnic slurs about his Mexican 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher, Rod Ortiz, was troubled by some homework assignments he had been 
grading. "They come over to the U.S. and abuse the country," read one essay on 
student impressions of Latinos. "They should all go back to their country and 
work out all their problems there," read another. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The demographic changes at Laguna High prompted one school official to muse: 
"This is such a small town. They attempted to isolate themselves, but the 
isolation isn't working. Some of these kids always thought they would own the 
town. They thought everyone would be blue-eyed and blond and the beach was 
theirs. It's not." 
</P>
<P>
 Possemato vowed to deal with future offenders in a severe manner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot tolerate any pupil feeling unsafe," he said. "Public institutions 
have a certain responsibility and we should teach, in a number of ways. I don't 
treat this lightly when a student doesn't fulfill these responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, a select group of invited students gathered at the high school 
for a kickoff meeting to debate values and strategies designed to promote 
racial harmony. Students were invited by school administrators and foreign 
language teachers who hoped to attract a range of viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same night, members of a volunteer community group called the Laguna 
Beach Cross Cultural Task Force convened a meeting to hear an update about the 
student body's mood.  
</P>
<P>
 But underlying all the debate was a simple question: How could this happen 
here? 
</P>
<P>
 Since the turn of the century, the hillside views and balmy winds of Laguna 
Beach have attracted an eclectic collection of artists and sea worshipers, 
hippies and movie legends, and one LSD guru. 
</P>
<P>
 Its bracing air of tolerance has drawn many gay residents, and the city has 
emerged as a bastion of support for gay and lesbian rights. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a city that cares so much about the frail that it supported an animal 
shelter with a no-kill policy, and passed an ordinance allowing local police to 
retrieve animals left in sealed cars.  
</P>
<P>
 But it is also a city that has struggled with issues that focus on its small, 
but growing, Latino population, which numbers about 1,600 and is made up 
largely of people of Mexican background. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, the city enacted a tough ordinance aimed at clearing Latino 
day laborers from a corner in north Laguna Beach and moving them to a 
designated location across from a lumber yard with restroom facilities and 
benches. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was prompted by complaints from north Laguna residents, who said 
they disliked the groups of workers who loitered in their neighborhoods. They 
complained that the day laborers accosted them, harassed women and urinated on 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Some teachers and school officials wonder if some students are simply 
reflecting the fears and doubts of the adults in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to change hearts and minds of not just students, but the faculty," 
said Myra Sosin, a former Laguna High teacher whose daughter now attends the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Others suspect that the fires that devoured Laguna Beach homes may have left 
many of the students feeling vulnerable and defensive.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is more stress than I have ever seen," said Margie Zimmerman, who 
teaches English to Spanish-speaking students at Laguna High. "The school is 
undergoing construction. We've been through a major fire. And tensions are 
high, and behavior is not normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students believe that the problems are isolated to a few of their peers. 
"This is something they talk about among their friends," said Tim Torro, a 
14-year-old freshman. "They make fun of the races only among people who think 
the same way." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kara O'Keefe, a 16-year-old junior: "I don't look at it like these are 
the people that represent our school." 
</P>
<P>
 But one student said teens feel threatened when they hear a language they 
don't understand. "They think they might be talking about them," said Kanoeani 
Connor, a 17-year-old senior. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sosin's 16-year-old daughter, Sara, believes Laguna High students have for 
too long been shielded from real world concerns. She devoted her college 
application essay to that theme. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live in a bubble," she wrote. "In Laguna Beach, we are surrounded by a 
thin, protected shell. Laguna has a reputation as an artist's colony full of 
gays, but the 24,300 residents are primarily affluent white Christians and 
conservative." 
</P>
<P>
 The awkwardness she feels is magnified for the Latino students, Sara Sosin 
said. They are easily identifiable by the color of their skin and the words of 
their language, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year was the first time that Ortiz, the school's foreign language 
chairman, detected the serious misgivings of his students about the school's 
growing Latino student population. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, when he was a student teacher, there were only three Mexican 
students, he said, and little comment about their presence. But last year, as 
the population edged toward 50 -- or more than 6% of the school -- Ortiz began 
to see negative stereotypes in homework assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opinion is that all the legal and illegal Mexicans should go back to their 
own countries," wrote one student on the theme of his impressions about 
Latinos. "They're taking all our jobs and taking our money back to their 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some Mexicans are cool," declared another student in one of the essays. "But 
the majority are idiots. The ones that are idiots are the ones who get in a big 
group and pick on one of my friends and then chicken out when it comes to a 
real fight." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hate the way they insult in Spanish, knowing that we can't 
understand," complained a third essay writer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months that followed, Ortiz said he would hear variations of those 
complaints from students who also seemed to exaggerate the size of the Latino 
population. Their numbers seemed to expand as the other students noticed them 
congregating at the snack shop line, or waiting between classes by a stairwell. 
</P>
<P>
 The most blunt complaint came last year from a student who stood up in Ortiz's 
Spanish class, looked directly at the teacher, and declared she disliked 
Mexicans. She preferred, she said, to study ceramics. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ortiz didn't consider the nagging complaints and criticism serious enough 
to require immediate attention until a spate of incidents late last year that 
gradually escalated in violence. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there was a shoving and pushing match involving four white and four 
Latino students that resulted in two-day suspensions for all. Then, a 
well-known high school athlete used a lead pipe to threaten a Latino student. A 
few weeks later, a Latino student was hit by a student who wrapped his hand in 
a chain from his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Castenada, who was punched in the mouth, said he was standing in the 
snack line, speaking Spanish to another classmate, when the fight occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said to me, 'Are you talking about me? Are you saying bad words?' " 
Castenada said in Spanish. "I said, 'No. What are you talking about?' Then he 
started cursing Mexicans." 
</P>
<P>
 Castenada, who said it wasn't the first time he has been hit, blames tensions 
at the school on a few "racist" students. "I think they are angry with me 
because the boy who hit me was sent home and I think they are angry about 
that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the incidents, school officials and Ortiz have scheduled a 
special orientation program for the Latino students with a Spanish-speaking 
psychologist who can offer lessons and advice about fitting in with the other 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, about 30 students participated in a special school-sponsored 
forum on the racial tensions, which resulted in requests for more information 
about the problems. The students also asked school officials to issue strong 
public condemnations, expressing "zero tolerance" for hate attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that night, Laguna Beach Unified School District President Carl Schwarz 
vowed to make communication a priority to prevent any further misunderstandings 
between ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came on the board in 1981," Schwarz told members of the Cross 
Cultural Task Force, "I think the Latino population (in the school district) 
was less than 1%. Now that number is growing, and I will tell you that we have 
a reality and in this district we have to face the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 The school already has a few test cases showing the impact of education. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Donna Simchowitz was student body president when she rose in Ortiz's 
class to declare her distaste for Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the impression that Mexicans were dirty and poor and every time I 
walked down the street they would whistle at me," she said. "The guys in Laguna 
Beach seemed angrier about it. It's like, they drive through the canyon and see 
40 or 50 Mexicans standing there waiting for work and they may say, 'My 
father's in construction and he's out of work.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Ortiz persuaded Simchowitz to stay, guiding her through a study of Aztec 
warriors and Mexican role models, culture and history. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you know the history of people, you're able to accept them more," she 
said. "I was totally inspired. I find the Mexican culture fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
 This school year Simchowitz enrolled as a freshman at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Her ambition: Spanish teacher. Ethnic Enrollment Growing 
</P>
<P>
 The ethnic composition of the predominantly white Laguna Beach Unified School 
District remained more or less the same between 1989 and 1992. But at Laguna 
Beach High School, the minority percentage of the population has doubled since 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 School District, 1989: 
</P>
<P>
 White: 89% 
</P>

total of 2,437 students this fall; 761 attend Laguna Beach High.

GRIFFIN OFFERS CONSERVANCY 104-ACRE GIFT; PARKS: THE ENTERTAINER PROPOSES 
GIVING THE LAND TO THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS GROUP. HE JOINS OTHER CELEBRITIES 
WHOM A NEW TAX LAW MIGHT HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Merv Griffin is the latest celebrity to offer a gift of parkland to the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy, joining a string of wealthy entertainers whose 
charitable instincts may soon be rewarded by a recent change in tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy's board is scheduled to vote tonight on taking the 104 acres 
in Benedict Canyon south of Mulholland Drive, next to Griffin's planned 
development of six estate homes. 
</P>
<P>
 If the gift is accepted, Griffin will join the ranks of celebrity donors Jack 
Nicholson -- who two weeks ago gave 60 acres of parkland in Coldwater Canyon 
above Sherman Oaks -- and Barbra Streisand, who last month deeded her lavish 
Malibu estate to the conservancy to use as an environmental research and 
conference center. 
</P>
<P>
 Although these luminaries have not publicly discussed the tax considerations, 
their gifts have followed close behind a key tax law change that was meant to 
encourage the philanthropic impulse. In August, Congress changed the tax code, 
effective with the '93 tax year, to boost deductions for charitable gifts, such 
as artworks and real estate, that have gone up in market value over time. 
</P>
<P>
 The change "has opened up an area that was virtually closed to us," said 
Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the conservancy, a state agency that 
preserves open space and wildlife habitat in the Santa Monicas and in the hills 
and ranges encircling the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of inquiries about this . . . from a lot of potential 
donors," Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The flurry of activity "makes all kinds of sense to me," remarked Robert 
Giannangeli, public affairs officer for the IRS. The change occurred because 
Congress was "getting a lot of complaints from charities and such, saying 
people weren't donating and the best way to get them donating" was to change 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the change, donors generally could deduct the full market value of the 
land from their taxable income. Much of the deduction, however, was recaptured 
through the "Alternative Minimum Tax" -- a computation meant to keep wealthy 
individuals from using legal deductions to escape taxation altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 The rich donor had to count the appreciated value of the land as income in 
calculating his Alternative Minimum Tax. Thus, if land purchased 15 years ago 
for $200,000 was now worth $2 million, the donor had to count the $1.8 million 
in appreciation as income in figuring his Alternative Minimum Tax. 
</P>
<P>
 With the change, however, the appreciated value is not counted as income under 
the Alternative Minimum Tax. The result is a potential for hundreds of 
thousands or even millions of dollars in extra tax savings for the wealthy who 
donate their land. 
</P>
<P>
 The incentive to donate was made more attractive still by an increase in the 
tax rate for those in the highest income bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Griffin's proposed gift of 104 acres, 59.4 acres must be preserved as a 
condition of his development approval from the city of Los Angeles. The other 
44.3 acres are, in essence, a pure gift and probably will "at least be eligible 
for appropriate deduction on his taxes," Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
 But an executive who works for Griffin said tax considerations were 
inconsequential in the decision to offer the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Eyre, vice president with the Griffin Group, Griffin's investment 
management company, said donating the entire 104 acres had long been under 
consideration. "The thought . . . was that that was a good use for those 
acres," which "would be difficult to develop" anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 As has been the case with the Streisand gift in Ramirez Canyon in Malibu, the 
Griffin donation has stirred deep concern among neighbors that public use will 
overwhelm narrow mountain roads and generally disturb the serenity of their 
canyon retreat. The property had not been a top priority for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not going to tell you this is the most pristine or critical area," said 
Edmiston. But "most of our constituency probably believes that open space of 
any stripe . . . ought to be preserved." The land is "free, we're not buying 
it" and in taking it "we're not doing any special favors for Merv Griffin." 
</P>
<P>
 John Diaz, chief of land acquisition for the conservancy, voiced more 
enthusiasm, calling the Griffin parcel "the showcase piece of all the 
properties we're acquiring" in the Benedict Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
 Those acquisitions are part of an effort to preserve a continuous swath of 
wildlife habitat between Griffith Park on the east to Topanga State Park on the 
west.

BURNING FAT, DO-SI-DO

<P>
 Square dancing is not just fun. It is not just a chance to socialize or show 
off that colorful new outfit. 
</P>
<P>
 No, this is Southern California, so members of the Sierra Hillbillies square 
dance club of Santa Clarita say their hobby is also a good way to get aerobic 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the American Health Foundation, one hour of vigorous square 
dancing burns 560 calories -- more than tennis or bicycling -- as members of 
the group noted at a recent get-together. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like there may soon be a "Do-Si-Do Workout" video. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Sierra Hillbillies show up regularly in a high school cafeteria 
to burn off calories and have a good time too. 
</P>
<P>
 The 240-member club also offers classes for beginners. 
</P>
<P>
 Information on their activities and those of other square dance clubs in the 
area are listed in the Chatsworth-based publication Open Squares, which can be 
reached at (818) 993-4648.

POLICE CITE SELF-DEFENSE IN SHOOTING OF YOUTH AT PARTY; VIOLENCE: THE ALLEGED 
GANG MEMBER IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION AFTER A GUN BATTLE IN PACOIMA WITH A STATE 
CORRECTIONS OFFICIAL. FOUR OTHERS WERE WOUNDED. 
</P>

<P>
 A state prison officer apparently acted in self-defense when he shot a 
17-year-old alleged gang member in the head at a Pacoima party Saturday night 
during a gun battle that left four others injured, Los Angeles police said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old, who was not identified because he is a juvenile, remained in 
critical condition Sunday at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. The four other 
wounded party-goers, two young men and two young women, all hit in the arms or 
legs, were taken to the same hospital. Hospital officials declined to release 
their conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred shortly before midnight Saturday after two young men, 
described by witnesses as local gang members, exchanged heated words outside a 
party in the 13600 block of Gager Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the argument escalated, one of the two men took out a pistol and fired 
several shots into the crowd that had gathered. The corrections officer, a 
relative of the party hosts whose name was not released, then stepped in, also 
drawing a gun, said Detective Frank Bishop of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Foothill Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The young man then pointed the gun at the corrections officer, several shots 
were exchanged, and the corrections officer shot him in the head, police said. 
Bishop said the four other injured people also were identified by witnesses as 
gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives Sunday were questioning witnesses and examining the scene of the 
shooting to determine exactly what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The corrections officer was released after questioning early Sunday morning, 
and so far has not been charged with anything, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was apparently acting in self-defense," said police spokesman Arthur 
Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
 The young man with whom the injured teen was arguing was not apprehended, and 
police have not identified him, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family hosting the party refused to comment on the shooting, but a 
neighbor said the corrections officer lives in the neighborhood.

WHEELER-DEALER FOR CONSERVANCY CAUSE; SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS: EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTOR JOSEPH T. EDMISTON HAS AGGRESSIVELY EXPANDED PUBLIC LANDS. HE'S 
DEVELOPED ADMIRERS AND CRITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 First there were the sparse domestic budgets of the Reagan-Bush years. Then 
came the deficit-reduction fever of the Clinton Administration. It hasn't been 
a picnic for those who would acquire public parkland, not even for a 
wheeler-dealer such as Joseph T. Edmiston. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the only executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, 
the state agency created in 1980 to acquire parkland in the mountains, Edmiston 
has thrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, he has gained a reputation as an aggressive and innovative parks 
advocate. Even his detractors acknowledge his remarkable success at expanding 
parklands during more than a decade of tightfisted government spending and 
spiraling land prices. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 14 years at the helm, the agency has managed -- often in jigsaw-puzzle 
fashion -- to buy, swap for or procure by donation 20,000 acres of private land 
in the spectacular mountain corridor that stretches from Griffith Park to Point 
Mugu in Ventura County. That's a land area more than half the size of San 
Francisco. The conservancy has also acquired other lands in the mountains 
ringing the San Fernando Valley, even establishing a part in the Santa Clarita 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 When the task has demanded it, he has enlisted the support of powerful 
political allies, outsmarted fellow bureaucrats, struck deals with movie stars 
and real estate developers, and charmed community and environmental leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe's record of accomplishment speaks for itself," said Rep. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City), a longtime ally who as a state legislator led the effort to 
establish the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, hold a different view. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston is "more interested in personal power than in conservation," declared 
Mary Weisbrock, whose group, Save Open Space, finds him too quick to compromise 
with developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others say he can be ruthless and vindictive with those who dare cross 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe has a difficult time separating professional considerations from his own 
personal feelings," said Peter Ireland, who was forced out of his job at the 
agency last year after butting heads with Edmiston. 
</P>
<P>
 Bearded, baritone-voiced and armed with a lightning wit, Edmiston's powerful 
persona and zeal for deal-making has made him, to friend and foe alike, 
virtually indistinguishable from the agency he heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe Edmiston is the conservancy," said Jerry Daniel, the agency's board 
chairman. "Without Joe I sincerely believe that the organization would crumble 
to pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Edmiston is the conservancy's key player as the agency 
prepares to take on two potential make-or-break challenges this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, voters will decide the fate of a $2-billion statewide bond initiative 
that would generate $132 million for the conservancy and its affiliates. It is 
no coincidence that the measure, sponsored by the California Planning and 
Conservation League, treats the conservancy generously. Edmiston helped draft 
it, as he did a similar measure sponsored by the same group and approved by 
voters in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's measure, known by the acronym CALPAW, would also make the agency 
permanently eligible to receive money from the state's General Fund and 
undertake land acquisition projects as far afield as the Whittier Hills and San 
Gabriel Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 While the June vote represents a potential boon for the conservancy, a second 
test threatens to be the agency's bane: Opponents in the state Legislature are 
pushing proposals to rein in the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Several lawmakers, led by state Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), object to 
the agency's tactics, particularly its controversial attempt to use eminent 
domain to wrest 245 acres in the heart of the mountains from Soka University. 
</P>
<P>
 They are considering legislation to force the conservancy to reimburse state 
bond funds with the money it gets for transferring parkland to the federal 
government, no small change considering the agency has reaped $35 million from 
the transfer of about 5,000 acres to the National Park Service in little more 
than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy supporters were stunned last month when state Sen. Dan 
McCorquodale (D-Modesto), long counted among the agency's friends, joined 
Wright in criticizing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are constantly looking at reinventing government, and at some point you 
may get reinvented," McCorquodale warned during a Senate oversight committee 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the storm is Edmiston, 44, who shrugs off such attacks by 
saying they come with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the Sgt. York in the Jeep," he said. "I provide a nice wide target to 
shoot at." 
</P>
<P>
 A self-proclaimed workaholic who wears a wrist calculator to figure per-acre 
land prices, Edmiston has wheeled and dealed all over the Santa Monica 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1989, he managed to torpedo an effort by the Los Angeles County 
Sanitation Districts to put a garbage dump in scenic Towsley Canyon near Santa 
Clarita, even though the landfill agency had already acquired an option on the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston bought two small parcels, including one near the mouth of the canyon 
that provided the only feasible truck route between the landfill site and the 
Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston's critics, however, say his deal-making often comes at the 
environment's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many of his deals the mountains are clearly the loser," said Siegfried 
Othmer, a Sherman Oaks activist who accuses Edmiston of doing the bidding of 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Othmer cites two recent transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 In Calabasas, the conservancy last year endorsed a luxury housing development 
on 938 acres after the developer, Micor Venture, agreed to cluster the 250 
houses it hopes to build on the property and set aside nearly 700 acres of the 
tract as public parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say it was a Faustian bargain, noting that the houses were to be 
built in a pristine canyon that is an important wildlife habitat. They have 
filed suit to block the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Also controversial was the conservancy's purchase last year, with the National 
Park Service, of the 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch in Ventura County from entertainer 
Bob Hope. Part of a complicated land swap, it ranks as the conservancy's single 
largest land acquisition ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the agency stands to acquire another 7,000 acres in the mountains 
owned by Hope and the Ahmanson Land Co. But the rest of the deal hinges on 
whether Ahmanson and its partners proceed with plans to develop a $1-billion 
mini-city for 8,600 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In promoting the Hope land swap and the Calabasas development, Edmiston 
switched hats and acted as a lobbyist for the builders before regulatory 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes no apologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talk to developers because they're the ones who own the land," he said. "If 
you aren't willing to be pragmatic, you're nowhere in (the parks procurement) 
business, which some people have a difficult time understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston is proud of the Bob Hope deal, commemorated by the deed to Jordan 
Ranch framed on his Malibu office wall. As befits a man who sees parkland 
preservation in strategic terms, his office bookshelves are crammed with 
volumes dealing with the tactics and strategy of warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview, he seemed to be conducting a military briefing, using a 
large aerial photo of the mountains to pinpoint hits and misses in his quest to 
add to the public domain. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was Sampo Farms," he said, pointing to the heavily residential and 
commercial area near the intersection of Las Virgenes Road and the Ventura 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "That parcel would have provided a dramatic gateway into the mountains from 
the north, but it got away from us," he said. "No money." 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview, Ruth Kilday, the head of the Mountains Conservancy 
Foundation, which works closely with the conservancy, stopped by to deliver a 
framed photo as a gift. 
</P>
<P>
 The photograph depicts Edmiston's latest triumph, Barbra Streisand's 24-acre 
Malibu estate, which the entertainer recently donated to the conservancy for 
use as a conservation research center. 
</P>
<P>
 But even such a gift carries a price. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand's Ramirez Canyon neighbors have already begun to fret about the 
traffic the center may generate. Edmiston has suggested a road could be built 
to bypass that enclave, a notion that hasn't played well with some 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also complain that Edmiston oversteps his authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month he was accused of lobbying against the appointment of 
Ireland, his former subordinate, as Los Angeles' representative to the 
conservancy board. Despite an early overture to Ireland, Mayor Richard Riordan 
appointed actor Ed Begley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston declined to comment on the Ireland matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston lives in Santa Monica with his wife, Pepper, and their seven 
children. His wife, the founder of a camp program for children, is the daughter 
of Beverly Hills Mayor Max Salter. 
</P>
<P>
 He grew up in East Los Angeles, an only child whose parents exhibited a keen 
interest in local politics and environmental causes. His father, an engineer 
who invented a machine used in canning fruit, and his mother, whom he described 
as an "activist housewife," shared a passion for the outdoors.

<P>
 Edmiston was a student at West Los Angeles School of Law in the early 1970s 
when he realized he wanted to be a conservationist. He had earlier graduated 
from USC, which he attended on a debate scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 He abandoned law school, at age 24, when he was offered a $500-a-month job as 
a Sierra Club lobbyist in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job was to preach to the heathen(s)," he said of his four years spent 
promoting environmental legislation, including the bill that established the 
California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1977 he had caught the attention of then-Gov. Jerry Brown, who appointed 
him to the Santa Monica Mountains Comprehensive Planning Commission, the 
conservancy's forerunner. The post made him the logical choice for his current 
job. He earns $65,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His agency works closely with the National Park Service and the state park 
system to acquire parkland. It receives little directly from the state -- less 
than $150,000 this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither has it been able to count on much help from the federal government. 
For several years in the early 1980s the Reagan Administration eliminated 
acquisition funds for local parks. This year, the agency's administrative 
budget, including salaries for its 11-member staff, is $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the conservancy finances the purchase of a given piece of parkland, 
sells it to state parks or to the federal government for inclusion in the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and uses the proceeds to obtain more 
land. It does so through a variety of innovative means, which observers credit 
largely to Edmiston. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency often intervenes to snatch up land as it comes on the market, 
without waiting for the federal government to complete the often cumbersome 
process of appropriating money. Park enthusiasts say the practice has preserved 
thousands of acres that may have fallen to development. 
</P>
<P>
 But with deficit-cutting the watchword these days in Washington, there are few 
federal dollars to go around. For the current fiscal year, the Clinton 
Administration allocated $4.5 million for land acquisition in the Santa 
Monicas, compared to $11.5 million during the last year of the Bush presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the lion's share of the conservancy's money -- nearly $100 
million in all -- has come from a series of voter-approved state and local bond 
measures. Proposition 117, commonly known as the Mountain Lion Initiative, 
netted the agency $50 million in 1990, while Proposition A, approved by Los 
Angeles County voters in 1992, brought in another $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 To subsidize the meager sum provided directly by the state for staff and 
office expenses, the conservancy must rely on interest it earns from unspent 
bond money. As a result, it seems almost always strapped for cash. 
</P>
<P>
 That could change in a hurry with passage of the June ballot measure. The 
measure would provide $132 million, more than doubling the bond funds the 
agency and its affiliates have received to date. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy's legislative problems may not be solved as easily. Supporters 
insist that the agency's troubles with lawmakers stem from the dispute over 
Tokyo-based Soka University's property. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks enthusiasts, including National Park Service officials, have long 
coveted the 245-acre campus -- on the site of the former King Gillette Ranch -- 
as the ideal spot for a visitor center and park headquarters for the national 
recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy, through one of its affiliated agencies, took the 
unprecedented step of instituting condemnation proceedings last year after the 
university rejected a bid to buy the property for more than $19 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka, which operates a language school for about 100 international students at 
the site, wants to build a 3,400-student liberal arts college there. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks enthusiasts view the site, located in a valley at the foot of dramatic 
peaks in the Santa Monicas, as vital to the decades-long effort to piece 
together an expansive mountain park. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Soka site is lost, we lose any chance of having a genuine big-sky type 
of park," Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The university, meanwhile, has hired powerful lobbyists to protect its 
interests in Washington and Sacramento, with impressive results. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka's influence could be seen in this year's federal appropriation for Santa 
Monica Mountains land acquisition. The measure's language precluded any of the 
funds being used to procure the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that Soka might throw its considerable weight behind a campaign to 
defeat the measure, sponsors of the June ballot initiative also inserted a 
provision to restrict the conservancy from using any of the proceeds to buy 
Soka property. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan denies that the university is out to get the 
conservancy, although he does not disguise his ire at the agency and its 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe Edmiston fancies himself as the William Mulholland of the 1990s," Ourvan 
said. "But where Mulholland brought water as an essential resource to Southern 
California, Edmiston's mission is a park headquarters, which is hardly vital to 
people of the region."

BAKER CANYON RULED OUT FOR OFF-ROAD PARK; DEVELOPMENT: SUPERVISORS' DECISION IS 
A VICTORY FOR SANTA CLARITA RESIDENTS WHO OPPOSE MOTOCROSS SITE. BUT A SMALLER 
FACILITY IN HUME CANYON IS STILL BEING CONSIDERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Opponents of a proposed off-road vehicle park in Baker and Hume canyons have 
scored a partial victory to keep the facility out of their back yard, but there 
are several more laps to go before the issue is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors last week agreed with a Parks 
Department report that called Baker Canyon unsuitable for the motocross track, 
and decided to form an advisory committee to determine what type of facility 
off-roaders want and where it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Hume Canyon still is a possible choice for the park, though it would be a much 
smaller version. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally proposed for the 537-acre property spanning the two canyons were 
two or more motocross tracks, a flat track, caretaker's facilities, a bicycle 
motocross facility, storage space, wash racks for vehicles, a pro shop, 
training areas and trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say the smaller park -- covering 40 to 50 acres -- still presents 
problems of noise, traffic and pollution, upsetting their quiet, equestrian 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "You (should) fit a facility to what its climate is," said John Kachelek, who 
lives in Baker Canyon and is opposed to having the park built anywhere in the 
canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County is reviewing 57 locations for the park. Supporters say 
owners of the nearly 70,000 registered off-road vehicles in the county need 
places to ride that are closer to urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the two canyons northeast of Santa Clarita say they are not 
against off-road racing, but note that the Rowher Flats facility in Canyon 
Country -- covering about 10,000 acres and with about 40 miles of riding trails 
-- can be used by riders and is less than two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Parks Department also recommended expanding the 19,000-acre Hungry 
Valley State Vehicle Recreation Area in Gorman as an alternative to Hume and 
Baker canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hume-Baker proposal faces considerable hurdles, including local 
opposition, considerable acquisition costs and potential legal challenges," 
said Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hungry Valley is relatively free of these types of obstacles, and is 
therefore the best alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than endorse expanding the Gorman site, the board now will look to 
the recommendations of its newly appointed committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory group is to represent several different interests, including 
off-roaders, residents and environmentalists. It is scheduled to report back to 
the board by March 1.

NFL PLAYOFFS; COWBOYS CAN'T HELP LOOKING AHEAD, 27-17; NFC: DALLAS WAS 
CONCENTRATING ON SAN FRANCISCO EVEN BEFORE GETTING PAST GREEN BAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The San Francisco 49ers' 44-3 dismantling of the New York Giants Saturday 
wasn't exactly Emmitt Smith's definition of quality entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got bored," the Dallas running back said, "because San Francisco was 
killing them. Just basically killing them. Everything they did worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and the Cowboys gained a 27-17 victory over the Green Bay Packers Sunday 
at Texas Stadium in an NFC divisional playoff game, but the game seemed almost 
an afterthought, forgotten by the Cowboys within minutes of the final gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Their minds were on the future, on playing the 49ers next Sunday in the NFC 
championship game. And on 49ers 44, Giants 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the way (the 49ers) attacked the Giants," Dallas cornerback Kevin Smith 
said. "If the Giants had played their best game, I still think the 49ers would 
have scored 44 points. We can't get into a scoring battle with the 49ers." 
</P>
<P>
 Next Sunday's game will be a rematch of last year's NFC title game, won, 
30-20, by the Cowboys in San Francisco. The major plot twist this year is that 
the NFC road to the Super Bowl goes through Texas Stadium instead of 
Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The home-field advantage might not mean a lot, however, if the Cowboys don't 
play any better than they did against the wild-card Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yes, the Packers . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson had so little respect for Green Bay that he called 
a fake punt on fourth and two at his own 28-yard line only 9:20 into the game 
(the play failed) and decided to rest Emmitt Smith, the NFL's most valuable 
player, for the game's final 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Swinging the momentum toward the Cowboys were two huge Packer turnovers -- a 
fumble by Corey Harris in the waning seconds of the first half and an 
interception thrown by Brett Favre early in the fourth quarter. Those plays did 
more than anything else to let the defending Super Bowl champions win without 
being in championship form. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this was a regular-season game, everybody would be upset because we didn't 
play our best game," Dallas' Bill Bates said. "But we won't get too mad, 
because we won a playoff game. We're one step away from the big show." 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time this season, Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman threw for more 
than 300 yards against the Packers. He completed 28 of 37 passes for 302 yards 
and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Packer safety LeRoy Butler: "He could have had 700 yards passing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Aikman had some down moments, too, including two interceptions. Factor in 
a quiet day from the recuperating Smith (13 carries, 60 yards), and it was not 
a game worth remembering for the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the Dallas offense's performance, Aikman said: "I thought it was 
average. We turned the ball over, killed drives, didn't run the ball like we're 
accustomed to." 
</P>
<P>
 Favre threw for 331 yards, but the Dallas defense had its moments, keeping 
Sterling Sharpe, the Packers' record-setting wide receiver, in check and out of 
the end zone until the game's final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was largely a day of football follies, from both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while out there, it looked like we were playing playground football," 
Packer fullback Edgar Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers' Harris certainly put his stamp on it after the Cowboys had taken 
a 10-3 lead on Eddie Murray's 41-yard field goal with 23 seconds showing before 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris cleanly fielded Murray's kickoff, but lost the ball as he tried to 
carve out extra yardage. Dallas' Kenny Gant stripped the ball from Harris' 
grasp, and Joe Fishback recovered for the Cowboys at the Green Bay 14-yard line 
with 14 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't get (the ball) that much, and I thought I could make a big play," 
Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Aikman threw a six-yard scoring pass to tight end Jay 
Novacek, allowing the Cowboys to take a two-touchdown lead into the dressing 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just before the end of the first half, the fumble they converted into a 
touchdown, I thought that was big," Packer Coach Mike Holmgren said. "Not only 
the points, but we sagged just a little bit. It took us a while to regroup 
after that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys built their lead to 24-3, but then the Packers found the end zone 
for the first time on a diving, 13-yard touchdown catch by Robert Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 A 43-yard punt return by Brooks set the Packers up again at the Dallas 29 1:41 
into the fourth quarter. Suddenly, the Packers seemed poised to make a game of 
it. But they self-destructed on the first play of the series, Leon Lett tipping 
Favre's pass straight into Charles Haley's chest. 
</P>
<P>
 The interception gave the Cowboys the ball at the Green Bay 30, and, with 
Smith on the sideline, they moved 47 yards in nine plays to Murray's 38-yard 
field goal with 7:38 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he could have used Smith on the drive, but felt comfortable 
enough with backups Lincoln Coleman and Derrick Lassic to let Smith rest his 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game was kind of out of reach," Smith said. "No reason taking a risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Translated: Brett Favre is not Steve Young, and the Packers are not the 49ers. 
There will be other days to risk the league's most valuable shoulder, perhaps 
starting next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you know, the 49ers have got a great team," Dallas defensive tackle 
Tony Casillas said. "We've got to play well to beat them. It will be like last 
year. The same kind of game. Maybe the same kind of outcome."

NFL PLAYOFFS; MONTANA'S MAGIC MAKES OILERS DISAPPEAR; AFC: QUARTERBACK LEADS 
CHIEFS WITH THREE SECOND-HALF TOUCHDOWN PASSES, 28-20. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a day Joe Montana was to be broken at the hands of the unfeeling 
Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the fighting stopped, the hands raised triumphantly were his. 
</P>
<P>
 The legend was supposed to end, but the legend only grew. Montana rallied the 
Kansas City Chiefs to 28 second-half points Sunday in defeating the Houston 
Oilers, 28-20, in the AFC semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 11-game winning streak having disappeared, the Oilers sought comfort in 
the supernatural. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amazing, just amazing," safety Bubba McDowell said. "It's almost like Joe 
Montana's got magic. Seriously. How does he do it? I mean, how does he do it?" 
</P>
<P>
 How, indeed? That question was left for Montana to savor after he threw three 
touchdown passes in the final 26 minutes to bring the Chiefs to within one game 
of their first Super Bowl in 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This feels as good as it ever has," Montana said. "To have a lot of people 
count you out . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good to be in one piece, still playing, still winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Buddy Ryan's defense with subtle orders to knock him out of the game, 
what did not seriously injure Montana only made him stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime, the Chiefs trailed, 10-0. Montana had nine completions in 20 
attempts, although Willie Davis dropped a sure touchdown pass, one of several 
drops by the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana had ribs so sore they required two pregame painkiller shots. He had a 
swollen left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Montana: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Threw his first touchdown pass less than five minutes into the second half 
-- a seven-yard pass to Keith Cash -- while being chased by William Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Threw his second touchdown pass -- an 11-yard toss to J.J. Birden -- with 
six men in his face. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Threw the go-ahead touchdown pass with 7:44 remaining in the game by 
purposely throwing the ball behind Davis, who was blanketed by Cris Dishman. 
Davis leaned backward and caught the ball behind Dishman for an 18-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Watched Marcus Allen run 21 yards for the clinching touchdown with 1:55 
remaining after completing a 41-yard pass play on a wobbly fly ball to Cash. 
Wobbly, because Montana threw it while being knocked on his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dishman: "I haven't seen any quarterback throw a pass like him." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fuller: "He may be the greatest." 
</P>
<P>
 How does he do it? That question must now be pondered by the Buffalo Bills, 
who will play host to the Chiefs on Sunday in the AFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana threw for two touchdowns earlier this season when the Chiefs defeated 
the Bills in Kansas City, 23-7. The maligned Chief defense played well in that 
game, but nothing like it played Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of injuries to Oiler offensive linemen David Williams and 
Mike Munchak, the defense held 1,002-yard rusher Gary Brown to 17 yards in 11 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys like Joe who have shown the ability to do it under pressure, they do 
lift players around them to a different level," Kansas City Coach Marty 
Schottenheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
 That level was reached on Sunday, according to several Chiefs, during a play 
late in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers were driving for a touchdown that would have given them a 17-0 lead 
when Brown grabbed the facemask of low-key cornerback Albert Lewis as Lewis was 
driving him out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 To the surprise of nearly everyone on the Kansas City sideline, Lewis shoved 
Brown, who then took a swing at him. Lewis swung back, and then several Chiefs 
and Oilers jumped on the two players, causing a disturbance that resulted, 
surprisingly, in only offsetting penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 One play later, Lewis sacked Moon and caused a fumble that was recovered by 
the Chiefs' Jaime Fields, and the half ended with score 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
 For the rest of the game, it was the Oilers who were intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs sacked Moon nine times -- tying the playoff record -- and Montana 
was sacked twice. 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring the first touchdown, Cash spiked the ball into a banner that 
featured a drawing of Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the game ended, the Chiefs were screaming back at the crowd of 
64,011, the largest to see a football game in the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fight by Albert, that gave us the passion we needed," kicker Nick Lowery 
said. "From then on, it wasn't like, 'How can we stop them?' It was like, 'How 
bad can we kick their butts?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers are the only NFL team that has made the playoffs in each of the 
last seven years, but they have yet to advance as far as a conference 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't imagine that we won't be going onto the practice field this 
Wednesday to prepare for Buffalo," receiver Haywood Jeffires said. "It hurts 
again this year. It hurts a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana was hurting a lot when he started the second half, clutching a left 
hand that had been smashed during a blitz and wincing with every sudden turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually thought he was out of the game at one point," McDowell said. "But 
he kept coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Oiler linebacker Lamar Lathon also thought Montana was on the verge of leaving 
the game early in the fourth quarter, with the Oilers still leading, 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
 As Montana walked off the field during a timeout, Lathon confronted him. "He 
told me, 'We're coming after you,' " Montana recalled, smiling. "I told him, 
'Yeah, I know.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Montana was sacked by Lathon on the next play, then threw an interception, and 
the Oilers took a 13-7 lead minutes later on a 43-yard field goal by Al Del 
Greco. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Montana led the Chiefs to two touchdowns in a period of 54 seconds, 
with two drives sandwiched around a lost fumble by Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan might still be cursing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe Montana," he said, summing up the game. "He just kept getting up."

NFL PLAYOFFS; ANALYSIS; HOW RAIDERS CAN IMPROVE NEXT SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On their first trip of the preseason, the Raiders went to Austin, Tex., where 
the temperature was 100 degrees. On their last trip of the postseason, they 
went to Buffalo, where the temperature with the windchill factor was 32 degrees 
below zero. 
</P>
<P>
 How fitting. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a season of extreme highs and lows for the Raiders, a season equal 
parts euphoria and depression, a season when inconsistency was the only 
constant. 
</P>
<P>
 One week, the Raiders seemed headed for the Super Bowl, the next week, they 
seemed headed nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 And it didn't even have to be week to week. Sometimes, it was half to half. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is understandable. Coming off a 7-9 season in 1992, the Raiders 
had a new quarterback, a new running game, new receivers, an altered offensive 
line, a new middle linebacker and a new strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a machine whose new parts kept getting out of sync. Some wondered if 
these were even the right parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the performances on the field, there was a question whether anybody 
could fill the leadership gap left by the departure of strong safety Ronnie 
Lott and running Marcus Allen, who left after his feud with owner Al Davis 
turned ugly and public. The Allen situation caused a morale crisis that cut 
right through the club in '92. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, quarterback Jeff Hostetler, signed as a free agent, was the 
answer to several questions. 
</P>
<P>
 He reinforced his image as an accurate passer with a club-record 15 
consecutive completions in the season opener, showed he could go deep with a 
club-record 424 yards passing on another day and showed he could scramble by 
setting a season club record for quarterbacks with five rushing touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler was a leader as well, inspiring the team with his emotional 
exhortations in the huddle, his cheerleading on the sidelines and his ability 
to keep returning to the field no matter how many times he limped off because 
of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler's favorite target was Tim Brown. This was the season Brown went from 
being a good receiver to being a great one, catching 80 passes, a team record 
for a wide receiver, and becoming one of the league's best big-play performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiver James Jett became one of the league's new big-play performers. A 
former Olympic gold medal-winning sprinter, Jett, a rookie free agent, showed 
he has good hands to go with his speed, breaking open for one explosive gain 
after another. 
</P>
<P>
 The signing of free-agent offensive tackle Gerald Perry and the emergence of 
defensive lineman Chester McGlockton, a disappointment in his injury-plagued 
rookie season of 1992, made their respective lines stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle linebacker Joe Kelly, previously a journeyman, and outside backer 
Winston Moss made that unit effective once again and second-year man Derrick 
Hoskins stepped up to replace Lott, at least physically if not emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
 With Rocket Ismail leading the league in kickoff returns and kicker Jeff 
Jaeger tying the league record with 35 field goals, the special teams also made 
a big contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest question mark entering the season was the running game, and it's 
still there. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Bell, projected as the starting tailback, was a disappointment. First he 
was hurt and then he was ineffective. Greg Robinson, an eighth-round draft 
choice, wound up the leading rusher with 591 yards despite sitting out the last 
4 1/2 games because of knee surgery. Napoleon McCallum came off special teams 
and returned from an appendectomy to become the Raiders' most reliable back in 
Robinson's absence. Ty Montgomery, after spending more time on the sidelines 
than in the backfield for 15 games, was used extensively at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 All the parts finally meshed as the Raiders won five of their last six games 
to reach the second round of the playoffs before being eliminated, 29-23, 
Saturday by the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, the highs outweighed the lows. The Raiders got back some 
respect, got back above .500 and got back in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But now what? 
</P>
<P>
 How do the Raiders take that next big step and become true Super Bowl 
contenders? 
</P>
<P>
 Two key moves are necessary: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Find a way to keep Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Find a running back. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, unhappy with all the turmoil last season, wanted to leave, but was 
bound for one more year by his contract. He's a transition player, meaning the 
Raiders can match any offer he gets. Match it, pay him, do whatever it takes to 
make him happy. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the rushing attack, Robinson may be the answer if he comes back 
healthy, McCallum has shown he can pick up yardage and Montgomery deserves 
another look. But the Raiders still need to find a proven running back in the 
free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
 Where would they have been this season with Allen? Probably still playing, as 
Allen is with the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a lot of talk by players about getting no respect, about media and 
fans jumping on the Raider bandwagon at the last moment. No kidding. A 7-9 team 
that struggled early didn't draw well. What a shock. When the Raiders won in 
the stretch, the Coliseum was filled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing to be ashamed of," said Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody said they did.

MIKE DOWNEY: BARRING CRIME CONNECTION, HARDING BELONGS ON TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now, wait just a Tonya-picking minute here. I thought vigilantism went out 
with cattle rustling, Klan crackpots and Charles Bronson movies. For the people 
who pick America's team to even contemplate removing figure skating's Tonya 
Harding from her rightful place in the Olympics, before this woman has been 
convicted, charged or even stands accused of anything worse than guilt by 
association, violates everything for which America stands. 
</P>
<P>
 All she did was skate. That's all we know. We don't know that Harding had 
anything to do with the Nancy Kerrigan ambush. We only know that it might have 
been done by people she knows. Tonya didn't touch her. Tonya didn't drive the 
getaway car. Tonya didn't hire the hit man. So far as we know. Understand? All 
she did was skate. 
</P>
<P>
 When the cops take her off in cuffs, we can talk. When a judge sends her up a 
river, we can talk. Until then, no, no, a thousand times no. Discharging a 
figure skater for something she has not necessarily done would be tantamount to 
blackballing someone 40 years ago as a Communist sympathizer because he 
happened to be acquainted with one, or like suggesting that Michael Jordan 
couldn't have played basketball in Barcelona until we looked into that alleged 
gambling "problem" of his. 
</P>
<P>
 You think these examples extreme? I'll give you extreme. Extreme is the 
eminent LeRoy Walker, president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, saying of the 
Harding affair: "We have to make a decision without the consideration of 
whether or not her rights have been abridged." 
</P>
<P>
 The hell we do. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Harding skated. I don't care what her husband did, what her bodyguard 
did, what her bodyguard's handpicked baton swinger did, what the assailant's 
74-year-old grandmother did or what the counterman from Nancy Kerrigan's 
favorite Dunkin' Donuts did, nor should anybody else, regarding the question of 
whether Harding herself should be permitted to wear the united skates of 
America. Not until she is convicted of foul play or confesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Pay close attention to the words of Claire Ferguson, head of the U.S. Figure 
Skating Assn., who says: "It's a terrible thing to say she should be removed 
without us knowing what happened." Amen, sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the presumptuous Walker already is carrying on about Harding being a 
potentially disruptive presence next month in Norway, about his organization 
having an obligation "to protect the competitive environment," which is a 
mouthful of gobbledygook, if ever one has been uttered. How about protecting 
Tonya Harding? How about her rights? 
</P>
<P>
 What exactly is it that Tonya Harding would disrupt? The opening ceremony? OK, 
don't walk in them, Tonya. Jordan didn't. Keep to your room, the way he did. 
The opening week of practices? OK, don't come to them, Tonya. You came to your 
last Olympics a week late; do likewise this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried about all those nasty photographers and reporters disrupting everyone 
else's practice? Say, here's an idea. It's called security. Lock them out. 
Olympic officials are very good at this, shielding famous athletes from the 
public, from the press and even, if necessary, from their teammates. Harding 
doesn't have to dwell in the Athletes' Village. All she has to do is skate.  
</P>
<P>
 Oh, no, though, said one Olympic official. Harding's hopes of remaining an 
Olympian "look grim." And oh, no, said another Olympic official. Harding's 
rights must be weighed against "the welfare of the entire team." 
</P>
<P>
 And oh, no, wrote Chicago sports columnist Jay Mariotti, Harding must not go. 
"Even if she isn't linked to the conspiracy, she must not go to Lillehammer. . 
. . Whether or not she helped plan the vicious attack, Harding has become a 
dark figure in this sick bit of theater. Stigmatized beyond her control, she 
will create a circus atmosphere that will make it impossible for her, Kerrigan 
and other competitors to produce an Olympian performance." 
</P>
<P>
 She will? She'll disturb the bobsled, the downhill skiing and the luge? She'll 
create more of a circus atmosphere at the Olympics than 12 of professional 
basketball's most internationally adored players did? Apparently so, according 
to the Chicago writer, because Harding's presence "will mar Kerrigan's 
concentration, her inner peace. She deserves to have it, and assuming Harding 
is innocent in the plot, she still should respect Kerrigan's pain and stay away 
from Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming Harding is innocent, she should stay away. Hmmm. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's me. Tell me it's me. I don't understand this at all. I don't 
understand why anyone would punish someone for being a suspect. I don't 
understand where our Olympic officials get off saying this stuff, or anyone 
else. And then again, it's a free country. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll repeat that for those who missed it. 
</P>
<P>
 A free country. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Harding pleading guilty, being found guilty, this I would understand. 
When this day comes, one of you grab her ankles, another of you undo her laces 
and I will personally yank off her skates and hurl them into the nearest 
garbage can. But until this happens, Tonya Harding can compete for my country 
anytime.

FEISTY KINGS PAY PRICE IN LOSS TO FLYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the Kings lashed out at an official in the heat of the moment in the 
third period of their 5-2 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers on Sunday night, and 
the biggest surprise was his identity. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it wasn't Luc Robitaille or Tony Granato or Wayne Gretzky. And -- at least 
that time -- it wasn't Coach Barry Melrose. 
</P>
<P>
 It was mild-mannered left wing Mike Donnelly. Donnelly, upset over an offside 
with the Kings trailing by two goals, yelled something unprintable at linesman 
Gord Broseker and received an unsportsmanlike penalty at 12:03. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia defenseman Yves Racine scored on the ensuing power play to put 
the game out of reach before a sellout crowd of 17,380 at the Spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ended the Kings' six-game unbeaten streak on the road and it was only 
their second defeat in the last 10 games overall. The Kings (18-22-4) did not 
go down without some fighting words: Melrose got an unsportsmanlike conduct 
penalty after Racine's goal at 12:55. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was clapping," Melrose said, smiling. "I'd never criticize our refs. I've 
given $5,000 to their pension fund." 
</P>
<P>
 Melrose was fined $5,000 earlier this season for his public criticism of the 
replacement officials during the officials' strike. He disagreed with the 
timing of Broseker's call and wondered why it was a penalty because referee 
Bill McCreary did not make the call initially. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can put what he (Donnelly) said in the paper," Melrose 
said. "It's a tough call at that time. I thought it is made if you embarrass 
the referee or linesmen. Nobody in the building heard what he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got a thin skin, you shouldn't be in coaching or refereeing." 
</P>
<P>
 King goaltender Kelly Hrudey, who faced 41 shots, was not directing criticism 
at Donnelly, but he said the Kings need to work on maintaining their composure 
in critical situations. And Sunday, the Kings gave the Flyers' power play 
opportunity after opportunity. In all, the Flyers were two for nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Donnelly was still irritated at Broseker after the game. Broseker also worked 
the Kings-New Jersey game on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him he screwed up the last two games," Donnelly said. "I just thought 
he made some questionable calls. There's a fine line. Maybe I overreacted. It 
(the call) was not necessary. I've heard a lot worse. When you are down, 4-2, 
with seven minutes to go, it is not a good penalty to take. We were down two 
goals, but it was still a bad call. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I learned a lesson -- not to say anything to a linesman." 
</P>
<P>
 Robitaille walked by Donnelly and added his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's 300 linesmen in this league and we get the same ones every night," he 
said. "Why does the league do that? 
</P>
<P>
 "They're only human and if you say something one night, they remember it the 
next night." 
</P>
<P>
 Two nights of Broseker were more than enough for the weary Kings.  
</P>
<P>
 The Kings started slowly, falling behind, 4-0, before getting two goals in the 
final 3:42 of the second period. About a minute before Donnelly's penalty, 
defenseman Alexei Zhitnik nearly pulled the Kings within a goal but was stopped 
on a breakaway by goaltender Dominic Roussel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings' Jari Kurri scored on the power play for his 19th of the season. 
Gretzky, who assisted on Kurri's goal, scored his 22nd of the season with 43 
seconds left in the period. He is 14 goals from tying and 15 from breaking 
Gordie Howe's all-time record of 801 goals.

EARLY BARRAGE TOO MUCH FOR DUCKS; HOCKEY: THE CANUCKS TAKE A 4-0 LEAD IN THE 
FIRST PERIOD AND HOLD ON, 4-3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 If the Mighty Ducks told goalie Ron Tugnutt he could carry his new cellular 
phone out and put it on top of the net with his water bottle, he probably would 
be tempted. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Lisa, are expecting their first child any day, and Tugnutt is 
beside himself with excitement and worry. The phone is brand new, has one 
purpose, and has never rung. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this phone rings, my equipment comes off," Tugnutt said. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't ring Sunday, when Tugnutt lasted only one period in the Ducks' 4-3 
loss to Vancouver before a sellout crowd of 17,174 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt gave up a goal only nine seconds into the game on Trevor Linden's shot 
from the blue line and fell behind, 4-0, after the Canucks added three 
power-play goals in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Hebert replaced Tugnutt to start the second period and the Ducks scored 
three goals to cut the lead to one, but never could catch up despite Garry 
Valk's second-period breakaway chance and Peter Douris' spin-around shot from 
the slot that missed wide by inches in the final seconds of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks erased a 3-0 deficit to beat Hartford by 6-3 on Friday, but they 
couldn't come all the way back this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt, who entrusted the phone to support staff during the game, stood 
clutching it while waiting to leave after the game was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "This being our first, it's very distracting," he said. "I find myself 
thinking about it quite a bit, carrying a phone around wherever I go. This is 
definitely a big, big moment in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 It's so big that the Ducks have told Tugnutt he does not have to make a 
two-game trip to Toronto and Detroit this week before the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to have gone and played, but I think that's very nice of them to 
think about Ron Tugnutt and his family life first," he said. "She was told 
three or four days ago it could happen any day. Since then I can't get my mind 
off it, and I think everybody can understand it. It's a big, big time in my 
life. We're pretty excited." 
</P>
<P>
 He was not excited about the first goal and was upset that the arena lights 
were not fully on yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's no excuse for it, I should have had it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Right from the start, the first period was a disaster for the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second game in a row they have given up a goal in the first 30 
seconds. And the score was 2-0 after Geoff Courtnall put back a rebound from 
the slot at 10:27 when the Ducks failed to clear the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 It got uglier, with the Canucks scoring on a giveaway at 15:17 when Bob Corkum 
lost the puck in his own end and Bobby Dollas couldn't recover it, leaving 
Vancouver with a two-on-one at short range. Courtnall put the puck in the net 
for his second power-play goal of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ducks didn't escape the first period trailing by only three goals. 
With 15 seconds left, Vancouver's Dave Babych dumped the puck in off the 
boards, and no Ducks chased it. Pavel Bure picked it up in the right circle and 
fired. Tugnutt made the initial stop, but the puck bounced in off of Duck 
defenseman Alexei Kasatonov's skate and the Ducks went in trailing, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Switching ends after the intermission somehow changed the Ducks' fortunes. 
Tugnutt replaced Hebert in a shaky outing against San Jose two games ago, and 
this time the roles were reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 Corkum, Troy Loney and Joe Sacco scored in the second period, cutting the lead 
to 4-3, but the Ducks got no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think together Guy and I have both let in some weak goals," Tugnutt said. 
"But we haven't seemed to be killing penalties as well lately." 
</P>
<P>

 Duck Notes

 Left wing Stu Grimson was scratched after suffering a cut hand during the 
morning skate. . . . Forward Steven King played after sitting out six games 
because of a sprained left shoulder.

COMMENTARY / BOB OATES: QUARTERBACKS CARRIED THE BILLS AND CHIEFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a four-game playoff weekend with, clearly, only one superstar, Joe Montana, 
there were these differences between representatives of the NFL's two 
conferences: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The league's best pair of teams, the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 
49ers, won a pair of NFC blowouts, advancing easily to next Sunday's Super Bowl 
semifinal at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In two close games, four evenly matched AFC teams fought their way into the 
last minutes before quarterback Montana could advance the Kansas City Chiefs 
into the other semifinal at Buffalo against the Bill quarterback who ousted the 
Raiders, Jim Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 At San Francisco Saturday, the 49ers, losers of three of their last four 
regular-season games, felt they had something to prove and took it out on the 
New York Giants, 44-3. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dallas Sunday, the Cowboys couldn't get interested in the worst of the 
year's playoff teams, the Green Bay Packers, and made only enough plays to win, 
27-17. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys' best offensive player, halfback Emmitt Smith, and best defensive 
player, end Charles Haley, are both struggling with painful injuries -- meaning 
it's unlikely now that they can win a game against the 49ers that would be 
theirs, perhaps, if they were at full strength. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Montana, he is a football player who can win at Buffalo, or anywhere -- 
at least anywhere on this planet. 
</P>
<P>
 The matchup at the Astrodome Sunday was Montana vs. Buddy Ryan -- football's 
most successful quarterback vs. the season's most successful defensive 
coordinator -- and it was Montana who took Ryan out. 
</P>
<P>
 Some spectators thought Montana beat Ryan with three touchdown passes, 28-20, 
but that isn't correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana beat him with courage. 
</P>
<P>
 At 37, with a long history of crippling injuries, Montana, though blitzed and 
buffeted around throughout the first half, kept standing in anyway, kept 
missing long passes, kept taking hits. 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, it was Ryan who gave up. Three long Montana incompletes in the 
second quarter -- each landing close to the target -- scared him out of the 
blitz. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Ryan quit attacking Montana with blitzing linebackers and blitzing 
cornerbacks, it was all over for Ryan's team. 
</P>
<P>
 Of what use is a lion without teeth? What good is a Ryan team without the 
blitz? 
</P>
<P>
 It is entirely possible that Montana's performance wasn't the bravest ever in 
pro football, but it was the most courageous some of us have seen. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of the first half, which ended with Houston leading, 10-0, was 
whether Montana would be seriously injured. The Astrodome floor is cement-hard, 
and he kept landing on it. 
</P>
<P>
 He did seem finished once or twice, but recovered to throw the decisive 
fourth-quarter pass to wide receiver Willie Davis on a play that some might 
have thought was a sandlot play of some kind, a hope pass, possibly, lobbed 
into an end-zone corner. 
</P>
<P>
 No chance. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a designed play, a perfectly thrown new-style fade pass. It came out of 
the book of Kansas City offensive coordinator Paul Hackett, whose game plan was 
extraordinary, plainly, if Montana could live long enough to execute it. He 
could. 
</P>
<P>
 This much can be said for the quarterback Montana outscored, Warren Moon. He 
was not only playing hurt, along with Montana, he was playing with a hurt 
offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one physically ready Houston lineman -- All-Pro center Bruce 
Matthews -- and Kansas City sneaked by the others to overwhelm Moon repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of that, Moon still had Houston ahead in the fourth quarter, 13-7, 
and then made it close again with another long Oiler drive, 21-20. 
</P>
<P>
 As often happens in late-season football, the quarterback with the healthiest 
blockers won. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't quite the case Saturday at Buffalo, where the Bills outlasted the 
Raiders, 29-23, when the NFL's only quarterback play-caller, Kelly, proved more 
efficient than a coaches' committee of Raider play-callers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders had the weekend's best quarterback not in a Kansas City uniform -- 
Jeff Hostetler -- who might have been the All-Pro quarterback this season if he 
could have called his own signals. 
</P>
<P>
 Denied that, Hostetler was required to keep handing off for running plays in 
the decisive third quarter at Buffalo when the Bills shifted into an 8-3 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Against a seven-man front in the first half, the Raiders, with their best 
first-half game plan of the season, had run the ball effectively. It all turned 
in the third quarter, when, after fullback Napoleon McCallum managed to spin 
for nine yards on a first-down play, the Raiders twice tried to run it for 
another yard, failing both times against Buffalo's revised eight-man front. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did the Raiders blitz Kelly often enough. Even a defense with players as 
talented as those who play for the Raiders can't get by without ever blitzing. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been a Raider day even so but for three weird plays: an 
interference call that wasn't interference, a long Buffalo kickoff run by a 
blocker, and a Kelly fumble that gained 15 yards.

UCLA TIED WITH KANSAS AT THE TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA (11-0) and Kansas (16-1) are tied for the top spot in the USA Today/CNN 
coaches' poll that was released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas received 13 first-place votes, UCLA 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the Associated Press poll will be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Bruins were ranked No. 1 was during the 1982-83 season, 
under Coach Larry Farmer, when they won 13 of their first 14 games and spent 
two weeks at the top of the AP poll.

SOCCER / JULIE CART; BROSE'S, REYNA'S MEMORIES OF '92 BENEFIT U.S. IN UPSET OF 
NORWAY 
</P>

<P>
 They hadn't been on the same field since the 1992 Olympic Games. Neither had 
ever played with the U.S. senior national soccer team. So, late in Saturday's 
2-1 victory over Norway, Dario Brose and Claudio Reyna relied on distant 
memories to form a play that set up the winning goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one here knows I can throw the ball as long as I can," Borse said of his 
ability to kick long passes. "But Claudio knows, from the Olympic team. I told 
him, 'If I get the ball, take off.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna saw his chance, when Brose launched a long pass. "I looked at him and 
started running," Reyna said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna took the pass just outside Norway's box and sent a hard shot at the 
goalkeeper. The rebound kicked out to Cobi Jones, who scored. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a fitting debut for Reyna, a junior at Virginia, who has won every 
award college soccer has to offer. The national team has awaited the end of the 
collegiate season so Reyna could join camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just happy to be here and I hope I can contribute," the soft-spoken Reyna 
said. "I'm only 20. I'm not concerned that it will be my last World Cup chance. 
I'm going to do my best and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna is a highly skilled playmaker in the midfield. So is Brose, who has been 
playing in France for second division St. Brieuc. Brose is on break from his 
club team and is expected to play against Switzerland Saturday at noon at Cal 
State Fullerton. 
</P>

 The night before the Norway match, a committee of four U.S. players called a 
meeting. The topic: attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all sat down for 45 minutes or an hour," Marcelo Balboa said. "Last year, 
we didn't have a winning attitude. We said, 'Let's give ourselves a chance to 
win the game.' You need to air things out, to get past the bickering and 
problems. We wanted to start the new year with a new attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Such players-only meetings are often seen as a healthy means of catharsis by 
coaches. In soccer, where coaches are restricted to a distant sideline and are 
unable to call timeouts to confer with players, a team is left to its own 
devices and leadership. Chemistry and communication are crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 When losing, it is natural for players to blame others, and when a team is 
consistently making the same mistakes, frustration escalates the 
finger-pointing. 
</P>
<P>
 For the U.S. soccer team, the last three years have been a numbing grind of 
correcting faults. With a sparse schedule and few opponents, their frustrations 
have been internalized. In football, coaches take it as a sign of readiness 
when fights break out in practice. Infighting is not so constructive in soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps with the World Cup now only five months away, the team is beginning to 
rechannel its energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a marked change in the guys at the draw," U.S. team general manager 
Bill Nuttall said. "It all hit them in the face. This is it. They went home and 
reflected on that." 
</P>
<P>
 After three years of training and playing matches whose meaning pales in 
comparison to the World Cup, the U.S. players may be invigorated by the 
prospect that, after all the tedious preparation, the real games are about to 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-three World Cup teams notified FIFA Saturday of their choices of 
training sites for the June 17-July 17 tournament. The U.S. team has already 
made known its intention to remain at its existing training center in Mission 
Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Four teams will use training facilities in Southern California, two from Group 
A -- Colombia and Romania -- and two from Group B -- Cameroon and Sweden. These 
four teams will each play at least one game at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The four training sites are at UC Irvine, Cal State Fullerton, Loyola 
Marymount and at Oxnard. The sites were selected through a bidding process 
managed by venue executive director David Simmons and his staff. Each of the 
sites has, in addition to all facilities required by FIFA, Bermuda tiff grass, 
which is similar to the field at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 After the final draw in Las Vegas last month, the qualified teams dispatched 
representatives to their venue cities and toured training sites and hotels. 
Different teams have different priorities -- the Italians made it known they 
wanted total isolation and have secured an entire resort hotel on the Hudson 
River north of New York City. Brazil, too, declared an interest in being 
shielded from its prying media and fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The selections are expected to be announced before the end of the month.

 Soccer Notes 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. soccer officials had a fright last week, when news reached them that Roy 
Wegerle, a forward with Coventry City in England, had injured his knee. Tests 
revealed a strain in the medial collateral ligament to Wegerle's left knee. 
National team trainer Rudy Rudawsky said Wegerle was expected to resume light 
training in 10 days. Wegerle remains in England. . . . Also in England: Kasey 
Keller continues to impress as Millwall's starting goalkeeper. Millwall is in 
fourth place in the first division and has a chance for promotion to the 
Premier League next season. Timo Liekoski, a U.S. assistant coach, scouted 
Keller in the recent match against Arsenal in the third round of the FA Cup. 
Keller, on his way to his fifth consecutive home shutout, gave up a goal in the 
final minute of a 1-0 loss. There is still no clear indication from U.S. Coach 
Bora Milutinovic about the goalkeeping situation. The two goalies in camp are 
performing well: Tony Meola was 7-7-3 last season and Brad Friedel was 3-6-7. 
However, Meola gave up 24 goals while Friedel gave up only 18. Meola made a 
brilliant save late in the game against Norway last Saturday, while Friedel 
played well against Germany last month, a performance that brought interest 
from at least one German club. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic has all but ruled out the possibility that Steve Snow would get a 
tryout with the team. Snow, a proven scorer who some believe is not fully 
recovered from knee surgery, had been playing in Belgium, but has returned to 
the United States to play indoors. Milutinovic is often reluctant to publicly 
assess players, but said last week he saw no point to bringing Snow to camp. . 
. . Coach Egil Olsen of Norway, asked if he agreed that his team's World Cup 
group -- Italy, Mexico and Ireland -- was properly called the Group of Death: 
"I agree on that. When we saw that group being formed I said, 'I hope we don't 
get into that group.' But it will be the same situation as we had in 
qualifying, being drawn with England, Holland and Poland. We must hope to 
finish second."

 'Philadelphia' Story: The AIDS drama "Philadelphia" made a dramatic showing at 
the movie box office as it was widely released, taking in $12.1 million to lead 
the weekend box-office race, according to early industry estimates. The TriStar 
movie starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington opened in 1,245 theaters across 
the country after playing in only four theaters since Dec. 22. "Mrs. 
Doubtfire," the daddy-turned-nanny comedy from 20th Century Fox, dropped to No. 
2 with $9.2 million. New Line's "House Party 3" opened in third with $6.6 
million, followed by Warner Bros.' "Grumpy Old Men" with $6 million. Warner 
Bros.' "The Pelican Brief" was fifth with $5 million. These box-office totals 
do not include estimates for today's holiday. POP/ROCK

 Manilow Mix-Up: Barry Manilow canceled his headlining performance Saturday at 
an inaugural gala for New Jersey Republican Gov.-elect Christie Whitman in 
Atlantic City, saying he didn't know his show was related to the inauguration. 
The event was billed as an Ethnic Pride and Heritage Festival at the Atlantic 
City Convention Center. Manilow said in a statement that he was told in writing 
the concert would be a nonpartisan event. "I would not have agreed to endorse 
Ms. Whitman in this way having never met her . . . or been aware of her 
political platform," Manilow said. But Whitman's staff said ads for the show 
had been submitted to Manilow's staff in advance. Since Manilow pulled out 
hours before the concert was to begin, concert officials persuaded Donald Trump 
to move a Paul Anka concert from the Trump Plaza to the convention center.

 Standing By Wynette: Fans loved country music star Tammy Wynette at her first

 HBO Coming Attractions: HBO announced that new shows for its Friday late-night 
time slot are on the way. One will be a six-part series starring comedian 
Dennis Miller live, which will air beginning in April. Miller will provide a 
satiric recap of the week. Also slated: a four-episode series with hot new 
Latino comics hosted by Carlos Mencia; two shows featuring comic John 
Leguizamo; a special called "Bad Girls of Def" showcasing female comedians; the 
"Peep Show," from Madonna's Maverick Television Co., which peeks at provocative 
performers around the globe. In addition, HBO's successful "Russell Simmon's 
Def Comedy Jam" and "Hardcore TV" will be back with new episodes.

 Menendez Movie and More: Fox Broadcasting will present a made-for-TV movie on 
the 1989 killings of Jose and Kitty Menendez, network executive Gary Hoffman 
announced. It will be the second TV project on the case -- CBS plans to air a 
four-hour miniseries this spring. Other Fox projects announced include movies 
based on "The Munsters" (to be executive produced by John Landis) and "Alien 
Nation," a biography of baseball and football star Bo Jackson, and a miniseries

 Mini-'Cheers' Reunion: Attention "Cheers" fans: Frasier Crane is reunited with 
ex-wife Lilith in the Feb. 3 episode of the spinoff "Frasier" -- but only 
briefly. A spokeswoman for the NBC comedy series stressed that Bebe Neuwirth 
was signed only for the one installment, in which Lilith visits Frasier in his 
new Seattle digs. The episode was taped last week, after which Neuwirth went to 
New York to star in "Damn Yankees" on Broadway.

THEATER; SOUTH COAST 'HEDDA GABLER' TAKES ON MYTHIC QUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Henrik Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler" has the reputation of an acquired taste. Devoted 
playgoers should find South Coast Repertory's new revival a reacquired taste, 
depending on their tolerance for its moody embrace of the appalling, 
self-destructive Hedda. 
</P>
<P>
 A brief but atmospheric prelude to the drama, glimpsed in the pale half-light 
of dawn, sets the histrionic tone of what is to come. It also wastes no time 
deploying the key visual technique for suggesting the production's mythic 
dimension: huge slide projections of surreal motifs tied to Hedda's inner 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Director David Chambers has Hedda emerge from the shadows like an insomniac 
ghost, while the faint ticking of an unseen clock fades into silence. She 
circles the stage and strikes a match to light a cigarette. The match glows, 
then goes out. Suddenly the walls behind her are emblazoned with two towering 
images of flame, portending her demonic nature and her fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without such emblematic eruptions, there is never any mistake that Lynnda 
Ferguson's Hedda is a nasty piece of work. In the Mainstage production that 
opened Friday, she is willful, selfish, calculating, temperamental and, above 
all, miserably bored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a talent for only one thing in the world -- to bore myself to death," 
Hedda admits to Judge Brack (Miguel Perez), an insinuating admirer. 
Unfortunately, she also has a mammoth talent for lying to herself and others 
and for manipulating everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Her self-made match with George Tesman (Nicholas Hormann), the prosaic scholar 
to whom she's been married for five months, has turned out to be a bad one. 
Hedda not only finds the tedium of their life together unbearable but her 
incipient pregnancy repellent. Both feed her simmering frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, she is made jealous by the unexpected appearance on the scene of a 
former lover, Eilert Lovborg (Bruce Abbott), and his devoted soul mate, Thea 
Elvsted (Bari Hochwald). 
</P>
<P>
 Looking as predatory and imposing as a black widow, especially in the sweeping 
gown designed for her grand entrance, the elegant Hedda condescends to all 
within reach of her silken web.  
</P>
<P>
 It soon becomes apparent that she's capable of killing brutally, with or 
without her famous pistols. She wields the sort of malignant power one 
associates with Lady Macbeth. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its doom, however, this striking "Hedda Gabler" is not a gloomy 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson carries off the title role with a commanding swagger and a lightness 
of touch, even while communicating the repressed hysteria just below the 
surface of Hedda's brooding personality. 
</P>
<P>
 She conveys Hedda's sardonic humor with an engaging sense of mockery, lending 
an entertaining resonance to her icy put-downs. When Hedda belittles her 
husband, who worships the ground she walks on, she seems hateful yet somehow 
amusing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hormann, for his part, makes George far more plausible than usual. Though he 
is still a provincial milquetoast hard to credit with a catch such as Hedda -- 
she is, after all, the desirable daughter of an aristocratic general -- George 
doesn't appear to be so dimwitted as to make their marriage seem inconceivable. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more remarkable, Hormann manages to capture the spirit of perpetual 
dullness with more inflections for "Eh?" -- George's frequently repeated phrase 
-- than Ibsen probably ever dreamed of. A new English translation, worked up 
for this production by the director, also helps brings a broad hint of 
infantilism to the character: George keeps referring to his Aunt Julia as 
"Auntie Jujie." 
</P>
<P>
 On opening night Perez stood out for his portrayal of the oily Judge Brack. 
Hochwald gave a mildly affecting performance as Thea, the mouse with the 
courage to roar. And Abbott was intermittently persuasive as Lovborg, the 
tempestuous genius who falls off the wagon. Oceana Marr was a bit too wooden, 
however, even for Aunt Julia. 
</P>
<P>
 What sets this "Hedda Gabler" apart is the production's spectacular look and 
the unifying aim of the physical design. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive walls of the Tesman villa are skewed to invoke the idea of an 
ancient fortress. The black-and-white projections of equestrian statues and 
female torsos, among the other emblems of Hedda's psychic makeup, reinforce the 
notion of classical antiquity. And Shigeru Yaji's stunning costumes embroider 
on the mythical element whenever they can. 
</P>
<P>
 The odd thing is that the play's final offstage gunshot has so little dramatic 
impact. The way it has been staged, without any effective buildup, it seems no 
more than an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that shot, too, needs a visual analogue to make its catastrophic 
point. 
</P>

MOVIES; ANOTHER ONE FOR BRONSON'S 'WISH' LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The character "arc" of every "Death Wish" film is the same: Charles Bronson, 
as Paul Kersey, starts each installment as a peace-loving architect with a 
good, doomed woman by his side, and ends up having added so many baddies to his 
cumulative body count you'd think he was competing against Ho Chi Minh's 
all-time league record for kills-batted-in. The theme of all these movies is 
pretty much beating plowshares back into swords, as it were. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not street thugs incurring Bronson's wrath this time in "Death Wish V: 
The Face of Death" (citywide) but Mafioso. Seems deadly crime lord Tommy O'Shea 
-- played by Michael Parks, who, coincidentally, starred in TV's "Then Came 
Bronson" 25 years ago -- is also the ex-husband of the vigilante's new squeeze, 
Lesley-Anne Down. She hasn't heard that dating Kersey portends chances of 
survival roughly akin to a Spinal Tap drummer's, and gets it into her pretty 
(for now) head to testify against her mobster ex; predictably, bad things 
happen to good Bronson mates. 
</P>
<P>
 Even fans of "Wish" fulfillment -- now celebrating the 20th anniversary of the 
original -- will find the cheap, Canadian-made "V" a snoozer. Parks, at least, 
attacks the role of an Irishman heading New York's Italian Mafia with all the 
relish such an idiotic part demands. But no one can say "I love you" to an 
ill-fated fiancee or feign a slow burn with quite the absurd stoicism of 
Charles "Vengeance is Mine, Sayeth the Bored" Bronson -- who, it is good to 
know, even in his early 70s can leap off tall buildings in a single bound and 
emerge unscathed.

COUNTERPUNCH: BEAUTY OF HUMANKIND DWELLS IN 'THE AIR UP THERE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH GLASER, Elizabeth Glaser is the chairperson of the Pediatric AIDS 
Foundation in Santa Monica. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am the wife of Paul Glaser, the director of "The Air Up There." I am also a 
mother of a child in private school in Santa Monica. Our school had a small 
fund-raiser recently. We paid $10 a ticket to go see "The Air Up There" -- all 
the money raised went to the school. Based on the review (" 'The Air Up There' 
Is Pretty Thin," Calendar, Jan. 7), if I hadn't been Paul's wife, I probably 
would never have paid to go see the film -- but it was for our school, so I 
knew people would come. 
</P>
<P>
 After it was over, I watched people leave the theater and I was filled with 
two strong emotions: 
</P>
<P>
 The first was anger because I heard so many parents say, "The reviewer never 
mentioned that I would love this movie." The second, and more important, was 
pride.  
</P>
<P>
 I was proud because as a trained teacher I knew that with all the silly jokes 
(that we all laughed at) both parents and kids had the chance to learn about 
another culture without even realizing it. I was proud because "The Air Up 
There" is really a joyful film. 
</P>
<P>
 So I am writing out of frustration to tell people who are not film critics 
about this movie. Yes, I am the director's wife -- but nearly everyone I 
listened to leaving the movie house, both kids and adults, felt the same. 
</P>
<P>
 It is beautiful. The colors of the Sambrene, the real tribe used in the 
filming, made me feel alive and invigorated. It is joyful -- it made me see the 
beauty in all of us. It was fun and funny. It was exciting. It made me laugh 
and it made me cry . . . and every other parent, man or woman, black or white, 
who wasn't embarrassed to say so, said they had a tear also. 
</P>
<P>
 But here's the most important part: I left appreciating the simple beauty of 
all humankind when we take the time to look. The eyes that sparkle, the smiles 
that are contagious, the pride that can show through. We all can find these in 
ourselves and others if we can touch the more simple and loving parts of who we 
are.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The implication in the word simple is often seen as something bad. I feel in 
today's world we analyze too much, we dissect too much, we see the dark and the 
negative, we hide who we really are and what we really feel. I guess it is 
because we're scared or embarrassed. But, if we could stop protecting ourselves 
so much, I think we would find that we are all simple in a most human way, and 
that this is not bad. In fact, I think it is good. 
</P>
<P>
 Being simple doesn't mean we're not smart. It doesn't mean that we don't know 
life is complicated. It doesn't mean that we don't know life in Africa, or 
America, can often be hard or violent. I know firsthand how tough life can be. 
But, it can be loving too -- if we choose to open a little crack in our armor 
and let that part in as well, we all benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 I love "The Air Up There." I've seen it at least 10 times. I hope you go see 
the movie as well, not because it's Paul's, but because it shows a part of life 
that we all often ignore or forget -- the beauty, the fun, the foolishness, the 
love.

COUNTERPUNCH: PIONEER OF CLASSICAL MUSIC FOR KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FRANK, Sam Frank has written a book about actor Ronald Colman for 
publication by Greenwood Press. He will pay tribute to Alan Livingston on 
KPCC's Ian Whitcomb Show on Tuesday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a classical music lover since I was a boy, I am delighted to learn that a 
series of videotape and CD lines are being produced to make the classics as 
much a part of the daily lives of children as rock music ("Making Classical 
Music Kid's Stuff," Calendar, Nov. 2). However, I must point out that the 
current producers of classical music for kids, deserving of praise as they may 
be, are far from the first with this idea. Nor was Leonard Bernstein the first 
on the block to make the classics user-friendly with his well-remembered "Young 
People's Concerts" in the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 The very first record album to make classical music fun for kids was "Rusty in 
Orchestraville," produced by former bandleader Alan W. Livingston for Capitol 
Records in the fall of 1946. Although I now have "Rusty" on tape, I well 
remember playing my copy of the original 78 r.p.m. album many times in the late 
1950s. It was so wildly successful -- over a million copies sold -- that 
Livingston followed it with "Sparky's Magic Piano" in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite of the two remains "Rusty," which established a standard that is 
still worth emulating today. What was there about "Rusty in Orchestraville" 
that captured the imaginations of us baby boomers? Like "Peter and the Wolf," 
it told a story designed to introduce kids to musical instruments, but in a way 
that personalized them. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusty (Henry Blair) is a boy "about your age" who hates his piano lessons 
because he has to play scales endlessly instead of cutting loose with a real 
piece of music. Falling asleep after his hated lesson one day, he dreams he is 
in Orchestraville, where all the instruments live. The basso-voiced conductor 
of Orchestraville (Billy Bletcher) takes him on a guided tour of the place, 
introducing him to Vera the Violin, Tommy the Trumpet, Bobo the Oboe, Sammy the 
Saxophone and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Each plays an excerpt from such works as "The Swan" (Saint-Saens), "The 
Carnival of Venice," and "Nocturne in E Flat" (Chopin). The entire orchestra 
plays the "Surprise" segment from Hayden's "Surprise" Symphony after the 
conductor tells Rusty the short story behind it. When Rusty finally apologizes 
to Peter the Piano for making a disparaging remark about him, Peter obliges 
with all of Chopin's "Minute Waltz." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What makes all of this such a delight is that the instruments talk to Rusty 
via Sonovox, a unique mechanical device. It is held to the larynx so that 
wordless speaking becomes a pleasantly weird synthesized voice. (The voice of 
Casey Jr. in Disney's "Dumbo" is someone using Sonovox.) The punch line is that 
after getting to know several of the instruments personally, Rusty is now 
motivated to work at his piano lessons so he can have the fun in real life that 
he had in Orchestraville. The couched-in-entertainment lesson: You can't get 
there without a lot of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his classical music duo, Livingston also created Bozo the 
Clown, producing numerous Bozo albums starring Pinto Colvig -- the original 
Bozo and the voice of Goofy -- from 1946 to the mid-1950s. Remember "Bozo at 
the Circus," "Bozo and His Rocket Ship" and so on? 
</P>
<P>
 And Livingston created record lines for kids starring Woody Woodpecker and the 
Warner Bros.' characters. Many of these albums were known as record readers 
because their comic strip-type pages helped children learn to read while 
enjoying the stories. Sound familiar?  
</P>
<P>
 They also made happily creative use of outrageously comical musical sounds and 
noises and featured an array of talented voice people such as Mel Blanc, June 
Foray and Billy Bletcher. Billy May wrote the original music, including the 
Bozo theme song, for which Livingston wrote the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 My reason for writing this is to cure a bit of cultural amnesia. A new 
generation of people who want to share their love of the classics with children 
are making it fun again. But a gifted young music man named Alan Livingston -- 
who today heads an animation company called Pacific Rim Entertainment -- first 
paved the way nearly 50 years ago.

DANCE REVIEW; MALASHOCK PREMIERES HOLD SURPRISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just before launching a program of new works, Friday in Schoenberg Hall at 
UCLA, choreographer John Malashock spoke to the audience about the 
unpredictability of live performance, supplying examples from his former career 
as a dancer with Twyla Tharp. As it happened, the final work in the three-part 
event added an ironic new anecdote to his collection.  
</P>
<P>
 With a concept credited to Malashock and Southland composer Michael Roth, 
"Their Thought and Back Again" featured two singers (Roxane Carrasco and 
Christine Phelps) who prowled the stage, interacting with the dancers and 
appearing to comment on their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, you could understand only about one-tenth of the words they 
sang and thus felt increasingly deprived of crucial data and confused by major 
shifts in mood within what seemed to be an evolving narrative. No matter that 
the group dancing revealed a spectacular sense of surge along with meticulous 
character detail -- or that Roth's score vividly evoked music-theater styles 
from opera to musical comedy. Strain and frustration simply short-circuited the 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 This reviewer asked for a copy of the text afterward and only then understood 
the playful, non-literal link between words and motion underpinning "Their 
Thought and Back Again." Ironically, an audience able to hear Roth's lyrics 
(mostly fragments of familiar phrases drawn from such sources as classified 
ads) would never have been as obsessed with them as some of us were on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the evening, Malashock's six-member, San Diego-based company 
displayed its prowess in pieces signaling a new, disarmingly lush phase of his 
creative development. Commissioned by the San Diego Symphony, "Souvenir de 
Florence" found him claiming for leotards a Tchaikovsky score that might seem 
more suited to tutus and tiaras. 
</P>
<P>
 Emphasizing the slow, powerful opening-out of the limbs into stretched, 
sculptural poses, this quintet kept its 20th-Century irreverence in focus 
through constant shifts in level, direction and dynamics as well as whimsical, 
anti-lyric gymnastic ploys set against some of the swooniest music. However, 
the unorthodox patterns of support in a duet for Gwen Hunter Ritchie and 
Francis Floro showed Malashock's mastery of classical adagio traditions and his 
ability to extend them boldly. 
</P>
<P>
 Bathed in golden light, "The Near Reaches" strove for an archaic look that 
matched the lost world evoked in a suite of haunting 15th-Century Sephardic 
songs recorded by Hesperion XX. Indeed, you could argue that long before the 
dreamlike meetings, partings and group-caresses of the finale, the piece had 
grown nostalgically self-infatuated. Yet its best moments offered intriguing 
explorations of gender roles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opening duet, for instance, Malashock reversed conventional partnering 
relationships by making Debi Toth the energizing, dominant cavalier figure and 
Floro the yielding, supple body-on-display. Both remained bare above the waist, 
with the contrast between her hard-muscled physicality and his softer look 
reinforcing the contemporary sexual politics defined in the movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Later on, Malashock pictorially developed the concept of female dominance but 
lost the strong back-to-the-future relevance that Toth and Floro had embodied 
so tellingly.

MUSIC REVIEWS; ZWILICH 'FANTASY' PREMIERES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inconclusiveness in a novel or film may be just what the author intended; in a 
new symphonic work, listeners tend to grow nervous when a piece sounds 
incomplete or unfinished. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the problem -- the only problem -- with Ellen Taaffe Zwilich's 
"Fantasy for Orchestra," which received its world premiere performance by the 
Long Beach Symphony, conducted by JoAnn Falletta, Saturday night in Terrace 
Theater at the Long Beach Convention Center.  
</P>
<P>
 On first hearing, this fantasy seems to be a strong edifice without a core: It 
contains an introduction, a scherzo, a slow movement and a finale, none of 
which appears to define its structure. If this is only a suite, and not a 
symphony, then the lack may not be serious. However, because Zwilich, at 54, is 
considered by some to be one of our more important American symphonists, this 
canvas may seem unfinished. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, it is a handsome-sounding, thoroughly engrossing piece, moving as 
it does from a mysterious beginning, through various, almost consistently 
atonal, mood changes, into a highly brilliant closing movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach orchestra's many virtuoso facets and collective musicality were 
on strong display in the Zwilich opus. In the subsequent performances of 
Sibelius' Violin Concerto and a long set of excerpts from Prokofiev's "Romeo 
and Juliet" ballet, more aimless playing became the norm. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Wilkie, who usually serves as concertmaster of this orchestra, appeared 
as soloist in the Sibelius work; he met all challenges without strain, leaped 
all hurdles without mishap. He also produced a beauteous, full and projected 
tone at all times. But he did not lead much. Unfortunately, conductor Falletta 
didn't either. So the total tended to sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
 A frustrating sense of wandering also characterized the Prokofiev excerpts, 
which seemed to lack any dramatic focus or apprehensible continuity. And the 
playing -- under-rehearsed? -- emerged often ragged. TIMOTHY MANGAN

MUSIC REVIEWS; BORODIN QUARTET IN POLISHED PLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For no apparent reason the Borodin Quartet limited its program Saturday night 
at the Irvine Barclay Theatre to a single year in chamber music history, 1876, 
the year that saw the premieres of the two Third Quartets of Brahms and 
Tchaikovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 These are not holy works in the string quartet repertory.Critics have noted 
their relative weaknesses and both turn up fairly rarely on chamber-music 
programs. While the Borodin didn't entirely make their flaws disappear, it did 
make them seem beside the point, in performances of graceful polish and deep 
musicality. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1945 and still including two of its original members -- violist 
Dmitri Shebalin and cellist Valentin Berlinsky, who were joined by violinists 
Mikhail Kopelman and Andrei Abramenkov in 1974 -- the Borodin is rightly 
counted among the world's elite quartets, and it proved again why. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely there are string quartets that play better technically (though not 
many). What impressed most about the Borodin on Saturday was its carefully 
calibrated, elegantly and purposefully executed interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
 The conception for Brahms was a Classical one, which allowed all of this 
work's charm and naivete to shine through clearly and Kopelman to lead the way 
in wonderfully slippery but focused song. 
</P>
<P>
 Tchaikovsky's Third emerged on a vaster canvas, with the players as equals and 
a broader expressive, dynamic and tempo scheme. The groups' characteristic 
vibrato -- wide and fast -- came flavorfully into evidence. With this arsenal, 
the players made the Andante funebre e doloroso, one of Tchaikovsky's most 
striking movements, into a stark, dramatic landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 The delectable encore was the second of Stravinsky's Three Pieces for String 
Quartet. TIMOTHY MANGAN

JAZZ AND POP REVIEWS; DICK HYMAN SUPERB, ECLECTIC IN BAKERY SOLO RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To claim that uniquely eclectic pianist Dick Hyman touched all bases in his 
show Saturday at the Jazz Bakery would be an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 90-minute solo recital, Hyman was consistently on the move, from idiom to 
idiom, from swinging jazz to ragtime to stride to classics, from 4/4 to 3/4 
(both "Russian Lullaby" and "Sophisticated Lady" were presented as waltzes), 
and to a generous supply of Ellingtonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Ellington pieces covered an unusually broad span of the Duke's music. 
"Clothed Woman," atypical and partly atonal, was inspired by one of the more 
obscure Ellington piano solos. "Jubilee Stomp" was a highly authentic reworking 
of a 1928 band number, and the delightfully conceived, tricky composition 
"Tonk," written for (and performed by) Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn as a 
piano duet, somehow worked for Hyman, who played as if he had four hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling a recent appearance for an opera-oriented audience, Hyman offered 
his personalized yet faithful treatments of the "Habanera" and "The Pilgrims' 
Chorus." 
</P>
<P>
 Hyman's technical mastery is a given, but one still finds it hard to believe 
the peripatetic adventures of his left hand, which seemed at times to have a 
life of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The packed house rewarded him for his tour de force with the longest and 
strongest ovation this reviewer has ever observed in this room. It's high time 
Hyman traded in his one-night stands here for a full week run. LEONARD FEATHER

JAZZ AND POP REVIEWS; MORPHINE PROVES ODD BUT COMPELLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Morphine's seedy and thick baritone rhythms oozed off the Troubadour's stage 
Friday like a seasoned drunk pours out of a lounge -- anesthetized yet coolly 
composed. 
</P>
<P>
 The guitarless Boston trio's great show proved the band to be a uniquely 
compelling force in the realm of oddball pop.Morphine, which uses sax, 
two-string bass and drums, doesn't exactly fit into any one genre, but has 
become increasingly popular in underground rock since its second album, "Cure 
for Pain," was released last year. It's the unexpected appeal of Morphine -- 
its low-key blend of bar-fly blues, post-punk discordance and quirky edge -- 
that grabs you. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer and bassist Mark Sandman growled and moaned down-and-out lyrics in deep 
tones and harmonized with creeping sax interludes. Sax player Dana Colley who, 
like other band members, looked like he just rolled out of bed, played 
consistently cool but edgy melodies that would erupt into Angsty climaxes. At 
one point, he played two horns at once, while drummer Billy Conway banged out 
fast then slinky beats somewhere between '60s pop and kitschy, lounge jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Morphine can pull an incredibly rich and seductive sound out of a weird and 
minimal combination of instruments and hit grooves that will stick in your head 
for days. But more impressively, the trio does it with a gutter-style charisma 
that anyone who's ever felt on the skids, or simply had a hangover, can relate 
to. LORRAINE ALI

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: FILMS BY CHEN KAIGE PART OF 'NEW CHINESE' PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chen Kaige's superb "Farewell My Concubine" may well be the strongest 
contender for the best foreign film Oscar, but earlier he made, among others, 
two films that surprisingly are considerably more complex. They are his debut 
feature, "Yellow Earth" (1984), which screens Tuesday at UCLA's Melnitz 
Theater, and "King of the Children" (1987), screening Sunday at Melnitz.  
</P>
<P>
 Both films, part of the "New Chinese Cinema" program, show the 
nothing-less-than-cosmic impact a newcomer has upon a remote mountain 
community. In the first, set in 1939 in northern China, a soldier (Wang Xueqi) 
has been sent to a village to collect folk songs; the idea is that if he 
explains that they will be sung by the Eighth Army, it will be easier to 
recruit village youths to join up in the battle against the Japanese invaders. 
What he does not reckon with is how his reports of the improving status of 
women in the big cities will affect a 13-year-old girl (Xue Bai) eager to free 
herself from an impending marriage arranged in her infancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Both "Yellow Earth" and "King of the Children" take place largely in single 
primitive locales, set against dramatic backdrops of immense mountain ranges 
and vast skies, yet the films possess an epic scope much like "Farewell My 
Concubine," which spans half a century and covers a sizable portion of China 
itself. That's because they are subtle, understated journeys into the heart, 
soul and mind of their people. (Note: Zhang Yimou, now a director every bit as 
important as Chen, served as "Yellow Earth" cameraman.) 
</P>
<P>
 "King of the Children" is enormously complex in its implications. Set during 
the Cultural Revolution, it tells of a young intellectual (Xie Yuan) who's been 
undergoing "re-education" as a member of a unit that's been ordered to work as 
peasants. Out of the blue he receives an order to become a teacher to a large 
class of children who look to be from 10 to 12 years old.  
</P>
<P>
 He is appalled to discover that there's only one textbook for the entire class 
and that all that is expected of him is for him to write it out on a blackboard 
for the children to copy. He takes it upon himself, in a conscientious, patient 
fashion, to attempt to teach them to read and to write -- and in doing so, not 
only how to think but also to think for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the teacher is embarking on a dangerous course, but "King of 
Children," although a warm, earthy film, is not in the least predictable or 
conventional. It instead evolves into a speculation on the possibilities and 
limitations of teaching and learning and the roles in which nature and fantasy 
play in those processes.  
</P>
<P>
 Although this film has been dissected at length as a philosophical treatise, 
it is nevertheless brisk, engaging, often as funny as it is sad, and finally 
affirmative in that no matter what happens to the teacher himself, he has 
transformed the lives of his students. 
</P>
<P>
 The 94-minute "Yellow Earth" will be preceded by Wu Wenguang's 165-minute "My 
Time in the Red Guards" (1993), which screens at 7:30 p.m. and which was 
unavailable for preview. It is a collection of interviews with intellectuals 
who, in their youth, had participated in Mao Tse-tung's political movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "King of the Children" is preceded by Huang Jianxin's "Black Cannon Incident" 
(1985), which screens at 7 p.m. (it was shown once at UCLA in January, 1987). 
This prize-winning dynamic and controversial film, which ran into complicated 
censorship problems, takes its title from a missing chess piece referred to by 
a Chinese translator in a cable to an East German engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Structured like a top-flight Hollywood political thriller, it is one of the 
most accessible and compelling contemporary Chinese pictures.

TV REVIEWS; 1 EXTRA CONFESSION IN '2 FACES OF EVIL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As true-life TV movies go, "Confessions: Two Faces of Evil" (at 9 tonight on 
NBC, Channels 4, 36 and 39) hits unusually close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 On Christmas Eve, 1980, on a bleak street in San Fernando, police officer 
Dennis Webb was cut down by six bullets when he emerged from his black and 
white to question a robbery suspect, who fled in the cop's car. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Fernando, they still remember Webb and the killing's maddening 
aftermath, when two young men fitting the suspect's description confessed to 
the slaying, which only one of them could have committed. The production rides 
this conundrum if not with style at least with fidelity to the larger facts, as 
faded L.A. headlines come back to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors Jason Bateman and James Wilder etch some quirky flavor as the two 
suspects -- the smirky, New Mexico college honors student and Sylmar High grad 
William Mothershed and boisterous drifter Robert Berndt. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who remember the highly publicized outcome of the case won't have as 
much fun negotiating the psychological puzzle. Why are both young men, who 
don't know one another, confessing to the same murder? Who is lying? Which one 
did it? 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing strong support are James Earl Jones as a flamboyantly bemused 
defense lawyer steeped in courtroom gamesmanship, Melinda Dillon as one 
suspect's open-faced, dimheaded mom and Ari Meyers, refreshingly offbeat as a 
suspect's girlfriend with a private agenda. TV veteran Gil Cates directed in 
workmanlike fashion from a script by Gy Waldron. RAY LOYND

TV REVIEWS; JAMES EARL JONES BRINGS FIERY PASTOR TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The producers of "The Vernon Johns Story" (which airs tonight at 5 p.m. on WGN 
and at 8 on KTLA-TV Channel 5) couldn't have found a more perfect actor than 
James Earl Jones to portray the renegade minister and civil rights leader at 
the hub of this inspirational, real-life drama. 
</P>
<P>
 With his imposing physique and booming baritone, Jones is thoroughly 
believable as a fiery African American pastor who attempts to politicize his 
staid Baptist congregation in Montgomery, Ala., in the early 1950s. (Jones is 
competing with himself tonight. He's also in NBC's "Confessions: Two Faces of 
Evil"; see review below.) 
</P>
<P>
 In this charismatic actor's hands, Vernon Johns is a powerful orator who uses 
Scripture to help convey the need to rise up against the South's racist 
policies and attitudes. During one typically impassioned sermon, Johns 
thunders, "Others say don't rock the boat. . . . Ladies and gentlemen, I want 
to tell you I am a boat rocker!" 
</P>
<P>
 True enough. At one point the forthright Johns walks straight into a 
whites-only diner and orders a ham sandwich and a lemonade. It's a tense scene 
that Jones plays with just the right mix of gutsy pride and trepidation.  
</P>
<P>
 Johns was a true iconoclast whose dogmatic, uncompromising ways are honestly 
shown to be both an inspiration and an irritant to those close to him. His 
adolescent daughter Dee (Nicole Leach), in particular, struggles to come to 
terms with the negative attention his vociferous activism casts upon the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the headstrong minister finds himself at odds with a number of 
exasperated church deacons who want to replace him with a more conventional 
pastor. He eventually is succeeded at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church by a 
young minister named Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Vernon Johns Story" is striking for its unflinching depiction of Southern 
racism as it was 40 years ago. Most disturbing is the film's portrayal of 
Alabama cops, who routinely harass and brutalize local blacks with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
 The filmmakers should have shed at least a little light on the accomplishments 
of Johns' wife, Altona. A gifted musician and an author of children's books, 
she is depicted in the movie (by Mary Alice) solely as a supportive wife and 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this omission, "The Vernon Johns Story" is a memorable tribute to an 
unsung hero of the civil rights movement. It was written by Kevin Arkadie and 
directed by Kenneth Fink. JON MATSUMOTO

MIKE PENNER: DUCKS NOT WILLING TO TRADE UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 According to reliable reports, the Mighty Ducks will make a move today that is 
expected to bolster their chances in their race with Winnipeg and the Kings for 
the eighth and final playoff spot in the NHL's Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 This morning the Ducks fly from LAX to Toronto, where they will begin their 
last road trip before the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks haven't made a better trade this season -- ridding themselves of 
Anaheim Arena for a week in exchange for a pair of games at Toronto's Maple 
Leaf Gardens and Detroit's Joe Louis Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of fact, the Ducks haven't made any trades this season. In 
October, that didn't seem like much of an issue, with the nondescript Ducks 
expected to hunker down in their inaugural season, take their licks and quietly 
lay the groundwork for 1996 from the anonymous sanctuary of last place. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the stakes have been raised, oh, a mile or three. The Ducks 
entered Sunday night's game against Vancouver with 38 points, leaving them two 
points shy of the eighth-place Kings and one behind ninth-place Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Sunday, the Kings lost to Philadelphia, remaining at 40 points, and 
Winnipeg was edged in overtime by Tampa Bay to stay at 39. 
</P>
<P>
 What a sight: Scoreboard watching in Anaheim Arena in mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for the Ducks, they neglected to take care of their own 
scoreboard, particularly in the first period, when the Canucks pummeled Ron 
Tugnutt for four goals, all they would require in a 4-3 victory that kept the 
Ducks spinning their wheels on the home ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Another one-goal defeat, their 14th of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Another home defeat, their 15th, dropping them to 5-15-2 in Anaheim, a mere 
shell of their very respectable 12-12-0 record on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 So close . . . and yet, the temptation grows with every one of these 
three-period teases: If only the Ducks had another scorer.  
</P>
<P>
 In Florida, where the other first-year team finds itself in a similar 
predicament, contending before its time, the Panthers have burned the phone 
lines, trading from the hip. Florida has made 11 trades so far, the most recent 
bringing the Panthers 27-goal scorer Bob Kudelski from Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks, meanwhile, have sat on their hands, signing a Don McSween here and 
a Dean Ewen there, working the overstock bins at Pic N' Save. General Manager 
Jack Ferreira's concept of home improvement has been to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait for Steven King, Tim Sweeney and Bill Houlder to play up to their minor 
league credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait for Anatoli Semenov's dislocated elbow to heal. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait for Paul Kariya to fulfill his Olympic commitment with Team Canada and 
coming riding in on a white horse in early March, providing Disney can shake 
free enough badly pinched pennies to get his name on a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about Kudelski," Ferreira says. "Early in the season, we didn't 
want him. Later, we were more interested but (Ottawa) was looking for a big guy 
(i.e., Todd Ewen or Stu Grimson), and we didn't want to give one up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the answers we're looking for are within the organization. Guys like 
Kariya and (Valeri) Karpov, who are unsigned. Those guys are offensive players. 
They can really help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya, the Ducks' No. 1 draft pick last June, had 29 points in his first 17 
games with Team Canada. His skating and puck-handling skills would be one cure 
for the Anaheim blues, but as the Ducks are about to discover, drafting Kariya 
is going to be a lot easier than signing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see," Ferreira said, softly chuckling to himself. "I watched Kariya 
last night (against Team USA). He played OK. We'll see what develops during the 
Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks need something, especially if the results of the Toronto Sun's sixth 
annual NHL talent poll are to be believed. Each year the end of December, the 
Sun assembles a staff of so-called "experts" -- television commentators Don 
Cherry and John Davidson were two of the five names -- to rate the individual 
talent in the league by position, then assemble the totals for each team. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the poll, the least talented team in the NHL is, yes, the Mighty 
Ducks. By a decent margin, behind San Jose and Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' top-ranked left wing? Garry Valk, tied for 78th. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' top-ranked defenseman? Sean Hill, tied for 75th, followed by Bill 
Houlder (tied for 104th), Alexei Kasatonov (tied for 137th), Randy Ladouceur 
(142nd) and Bobby Dollas (154th). 
</P>
<P>
 Semenov was the highest rated Duck, tied for 30th among right wings, which 
Ferreira found interesting, considering Semenov plays center. 
</P>
<P>
 "And look at this," Ferreira scoffed at he studied the numbers. "Terry Yake 
(tied for 42nd among centers) is a right wing. They have (Patrik) Carnback (the 
94th center) ahead of Bob Corkum (No. 96) and Corkum leads us in goals. That's 
all wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira's final assessment: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe the polls. It doesn't surprise me, but I don't agree we have 
the worst talent. The talent we have suits what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, Ron Wilson finished in a four-way tie for 16th on the top 
coaches list. If the Ducks have the worst talent in the league, and are two 
points out of a playoff spot, Wilson must be doing something right, right? 
</P>
<P>
 There you have it: Outside of Anaheim, the Ducks get no respect. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a slow sale, to say nothing about the trades.

A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON THE GAME; SOCCER: MANY OF SANTA ANA VALLEY COACH 
ADNAN BAYATI'S PLAYERS PUT SCHOOL AND JOBS BEFORE SPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Half the team often misses practice. Those who do attend usually leave an hour 
early. Games are not exactly well attended either. Coach Adnan Bayati is often 
forced to bring up three or four players from the junior varsity to field a 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, three of Bayati's most dependable players have been ruled ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a last-place team, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. The latest Orange County coaches' poll had the Santa Ana Valley 
boys' soccer team ranked No. 1. And until Wednesday's loss to El Modena, Valley 
was undefeated in 13 matches, including three ties. But now, the Falcons are 
11-1-4, 1-1-1 in the Century League. 
</P>
<P>
 How the Falcons managed to stay undefeated is a tribute to their depth and to 
Bayati, who has somehow managed to field a cohesive unit despite the poor 
attendance and loss of players. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Bayati, he has no one to blame for his plight, and there are 
no easy solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "School comes first for these kids, work is second and then maybe soccer," 
said Bayati, who has been Santa Ana Valley's soccer coach for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayati said most of his players work 20 to 30 hours a week to help support 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand soccer is the last thing they have to do," he said. "Most of 
them are not going to be professional. Helping their family out is more 
important than soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior defender Oscar Lara works 20 to 30 hours a week at Pic 'N Save, but 
somehow he has been able to make every game and all but one practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach told me I'm the captain because I'm the most responsible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lara wonders how long he will be able to keep his title. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the hours working and going to school are beginning to wear me down," he 
said. "I have two older brothers who don't work. So besides my dad, I'm the 
only one working. I have to give all the money I make to my family. It's a big 
sacrifice to me, because I love playing soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 Lara is hoping he can continue his soccer career after high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad told me I can go to college if I get a scholarship," he said. "If not, 
I'll have to help out the family." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lara concedes the players are not the only ones making sacrifices this 
season. He credits Bayati for much of the team's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good man," Lara said. "He listens a lot. Other coaches will tell you 
to quit and forget about playing if you missed the practices we did. But he 
understands that we have to support our family." 
</P>
<P>
 Bayati said he is used to these kind of headaches, but he doesn't remember a 
more trying season than this one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We practice sometimes for only 40 minutes," he said. "Everybody takes off for 
work and the assistant coaches and I are the only ones left on the field. And 
usually the ones who do show up for practice are very sleepy. They can barely 
keep their eyes open because they've been working all night (and going to 
school all day.)" 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, Bayati expects the situation to worsen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new grading period is coming soon," Bayati said. "One guy has already 
told me he's in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Bayati already has lost starting forward Horacio Granado and starting defender 
Julian Valentine for the season because of grades, and recently got word that 
his leading scorer, Francisco Islas, might be ruled ineligible because he's too 
old. 
</P>
<P>
 Islas, who has scored 11 goals, has missed the last three games while the CIF 
waits for him to produce a birth certificate proving he is 17 years old. Orange 
High's record indicates Islas is 19. If Islas does not produce a legal birth 
certificate, he will be ruled ineligible and Santa Ana Valley likely will have 
to forfeit all but one of its victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayati said the loss of Islas might be too much for his team to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys have lost their confidence," he said. "They looked terrible 
(Wednesday against El Modena). You could see in their eyes that they don't have 
the confidence they had earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bayati said he's not ready to give up on his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team has surprised me already," he said. "Besides the five guys coming 
back, I didn't even know who was going to play. I got my goalie (Alphonso 
Limun) from the basketball team." 
</P>
<P>
 It's been that kind of year for Santa Ana Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very disappointing for us," Lara said. "But we have to keep going."

NOW THAT HE'S PLAYING OFTEN, DUCKS' CORKUM IS FINDING SUCCESS; HOCKEY: HE HAS 
MORE POINTS IN THE PAST 22 GAMES THAN IN HIS THREE SEASONS WITH BUFFALO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Mighty Ducks represented an opportunity for Bob Corkum, a chance to play 
every night and make a name for himself in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he hasn't blown it. 
</P>
<P>
 It probably would have never happened in Buffalo, where his old team, the 
Sabres, have a lineup stocked with talented centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Hawerchuk, Derek Plante, Pat LaFontaine and Bob Sweeney occupy the 
position this season, and it's safe to say a move to Anaheim was the best thing 
to happen to Corkum. 
</P>
<P>
 He played his 47th game Sunday night, scoring one goal in the Ducks' 4-3 loss 
to Vancouver at Anaheim Arena. It was his team-leading 35th point, a stat that 
amazes him as much as anything that's happened this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He gives no technical, drawn-out reasoning behind his scoring success this 
season. It's only happened because he's had a chance to play, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never crossed my mind," Corkum said when asked if he ever thought he would 
be the Ducks' leading scorer this far into the season. 
</P>
<P>
 How could it? 
</P>
<P>
 Anatoli Semenov and Terry Yake were supposed to be the Ducks' scorers this 
season. And for the most part, they haven't disappointed. Before suffering a 
dislocated elbow, Semenov scored nine goals with 15 assists in 29 games. Yake 
is the team's second-leading scorer with 15 goals and 15 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 But who could have known Corkum would contribute so much? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten the chances on the power plays," he said, trying to explain, "but 
I'd still rather have Anatoli carrying the puck up the ice than me." 
</P>
<P>
 Semenov's injury could have thrown the low-scoring Ducks into a funk after he 
went down in a Dec. 7 game against Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody had to step up and Corkum asked himself: "Why not me?" 
</P>
<P>
 He has scored in 10 of the past 13 games (seven goals and 10 assists) and 12 
of 22 (eight goals, 11 assists). 
</P>
<P>
 That's probably not going to grab many headlines in the next edition of The 
Hockey News or the Buffalo News, but consider this: Corkum has more points in 
the past 22 games than in his three seasons as a Sabre. 
</P>
<P>
 Corkum hasn't been fazed by the curious twists and turns the Ducks' first 
season has taken. He was ready for anything when the Ducks took him in the 
expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
 But he can't seem to do much about the Ducks' lousy play at Anaheim Arena, 
where on Sunday they lost for the 15th time in 22 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his teammates, he knows what's wrong, but correcting the shortcomings 
again was tough Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big thing is playing well at home," Corkum said. "On the road, you know 
you have to be ready or you're going to be blown out of the building. We don't 
have that feeling yet here." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, the Ducks hit the ice and went splat, falling behind, 4-0, by the end 
of the first period. They rallied in the second, starting with Corkum's 15th 
goal of the season 22 seconds in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was too late," Corkum said. "When you're down, 4-0, there's not a lot you 
can do against a team like Vancouver." 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody pressed Corkum about the Ducks' faltering play at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're in Chicago and they (the fans) get up and start applauding before 
the end of the national anthem, you're shaking in your skates because you can't 
wait to get started," Corkum said. "On the road, we're ready for anything. It 
think it's coming here." 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminating the mistakes would be a start. So would covering for teammates 
after a mistake is made would probably help, too, Corkum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Corkum believed the Ducks left goaltender Ron Tugnutt to fend for 
himself, which accounted for the four-goal deficit and Tugnutt's departure from 
the game after the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not blaming Ron," Corkum said. "We didn't give him a lot of help out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The realization that the Ducks lost another chance to stay in contention for a 
playoff spot, hit Corkum hard. He knew this was a game they might need late in 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 That's almost an absurd notion -- an expansion team making the playoffs -- but 
Corkum isn't counting out postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're aiming too low if you don't consider that," he said. "This division is 
really tight. Anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Take it from a man who has seen his share of surprising turns of events this 
season.

THE AMERICAN DREAM; A THRIFT ONCE BLASTED FOR 'REDLINING' HAS SHOWN IT CAN DO 
WELL BY DOING GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of minority groups had targeted American Savings Bank for several 
years as one of the state's worst "redliners" -- lenders that avoid poorer and 
minority areas -- and wanted to extract a written pledge that the thrift would 
provide more loans in such neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Greenlining Coalition picketed an American branch in downtown 
Oakland in 1989 and finally won a meeting in early 1990 with Mario J. Antoci, 
who had been brought in as chairman a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting went nowhere. Antoci promised that the Irvine thrift would quickly 
do better, but he would not give in to the coalition's demands for a written 
agreement, funding quotas or anything else.  
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Absolutely not. We're going to do it because it's the right thing to 
do, not because you told us to do it,' " Antoci recalled recently. "I didn't 
want to have the Greenlining Coalition later taking credit for what we were 
going to do just in the normal course of business -- what we felt was good 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition representatives walked out, ending the meeting abruptly. Its members 
continued to badger the thrift and testified against it in congressional 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the latest data in, it is clear Antoci has delivered on his promise. 
American Savings provided poorer households and minority borrowers in 1992 with 
more than the Greenlining Coalition could have hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 American Savings has become the state's premier mortgage lender in low-income 
neighborhoods, devoting a greater percentage of its loan money than any other 
major financial institution to such areas. It also is the second-biggest 
provider of home loans to low-income families and one of the top lenders to 
African Americans, Latinos, Asians and other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, American has shown the industry that there is gold in those 
neighborhoods. Contrary to what some banking regulators believe, American has 
found that such loans are safe and profitable -- so much so that loans to low- 
and moderate-income households constituted 37% of the $3.8 billion in loans 
that the thrift funded last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have done the biggest about-face we have ever seen," said John C. 
Gamboa, co-chair of the Greenlining Coalition. "It's one of the few times that 
a promise has been more than kept." 
</P>
<P>
 So thorough has the changeover been, Antoci said, that American already meets 
the Clinton Administration's proposal for stiffer requirements in the Community 
Reinvestment Act, the federal law that mandates lending in poor and minority 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 While the coalition fumed about the thrift's poor record, Antoci quietly 
overhauled how the institution looked at low-income borrowers and how the S&L's 
employees sought their business. 
</P>
<P>
 It put branches in East Los Angeles in 1990 and in the Crenshaw District in 
1991, making it the first financial institution in nine years to open a branch 
in that African American community. 
</P>
<P>
 It altered lending criteria to fit the cultures: Latinos were not rejected as 
too risky because they held numerous jobs, and African Americans with no credit 
history were encouraged to show other proof that they were a good credit risk. 
</P>
<P>
 American's new program was never set in stone. It evolved as loan officers 
found new ways to help borrowers qualify for mortgages. Procedures still change 
as the savings and loan helps fund such concepts as nonprofit apartment 
complexes for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 American's lending record is but one aspect of its effort to reinvest in the 
communities in which its 165 branches operate. 
</P>
<P>
 It has formed partnerships with various companies to develop and help 
revitalize inner cities. It was also among a host of companies providing 
additional money and services in South-Central Los Angeles after the 1992 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The staff is especially user-friendly," said Lori Gay, president of Los 
Angeles Neighborhood Housing Services. "You get the sense that community 
reinvestment is important at every level. It's Mario Antoci's dream of 
(American) being a community reinvestment bank that reaches down to all 
levels." 
</P>
<P>
 American's employees serve on community housing panels in South-Central Los 
Angeles, and they turn out for such neighborhood spruce-up events as 
"paint-a-thons." They also help in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 One executive formed an employment program for the YWCA in Santa Ana so the 
organization could begin arranging jobs for residents of its Hotel for Homeless 
Women. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrift has been "most generous," said Mary Douglas, the YWCA's executive 
director. American has provided $100,000 over two years to help the Santa Ana 
YWCA meet its operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, a federally 
chartered funding source for thrifts and banks that make home loans, praise 
Antoci and American's directors for their leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have that focus at the top, then everybody throughout the 
institution has it," said Gary Curley, an executive at the San Francisco bank.  
</P>
<P>
 He rates American at the top of the list for reinvesting in the communities it 
serves. 
</P>
<P>
 Minority rights advocate Robert Gnaizda of San Francisco, Greenlining 
Coalition's lawyer, pointed out that American accomplished its changeover in 
just three years, disproving assertions by bankers that such lending programs 
take up to 10 years to show any results. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the coalition in its annual report used American as a yardstick to 
measure how California's biggest banks addressed their communities. The banks 
had abysmal records in lending to poorer households and to minorities, the 
coalition concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamboa and Gnaizda now urge federal regulators to hold American up as a model 
for other banks and S&Ls that fall short of fulfilling their low-income lending 
obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Other financial institutions, particularly thrifts such as Home Savings of 
America and Great Western Bank, do exemplary jobs at meeting their CRA 
obligations. But none has come so far in so short a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Formed at the end of 1988 from the rubble of the failed American Savings & 
Loan -- then the nation's largest and most troubled thrift -- American Savings 
Bank started out the new year without a coordinated effort at low-income 
lending. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it did not even have a community outreach department, something 
Antoci was used to working with during his long tenure as president of Home 
Savings in Irwindale. So he created one and placed John Nunn, a senior vice 
president for retail banking, in charge. Nunn was well qualified; he is also an 
African American. 
</P>
<P>
 Antoci staffed the department with Latinos, African Americans, Asians and 
other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset, American's directors wanted the outreach department to be the 
best at fulfilling CRA obligations, Nunn said. That meant getting loans to the 
inner city and other poorer neighborhoods, not simply throwing money at 
community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a really in-depth business plan," Nunn said. "It called for opening 
new branches (in low-income areas), implementing new initiatives, setting up 
partnership programs." 
</P>
<P>
 But the results for 1990, the first year federal law required detailed 
statistics to be kept, were not very impressive. Although American devoted a 
fifth of its loans to low-income neighborhoods, the amount actually lent to 
low-income families was only 1.1% of its total loans. Worse, when 
moderate-income borrowers were thrown in, the total grew only to 5.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, Nunn figured out, was that American's loan officers going into 
South-Central Los Angeles, for instance, were based in Hollywood and also 
covered middle-class areas, where they found it was easier to make home loans. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Nunn said, executives learned that when the thrift turned down 
white or Latino applicants, they asked why and what they could do to qualify. 
When the thrift turned down African Americans, they just left. 
</P>
<P>
 The steps American took to correct those and other problems transformed the 
S&L quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Its 1992 results, released four months ago, put it on a pedestal. American 
again poured 20% of its mortgages into low-income areas, but that was four 
percentage points ahead of its closest competitor, Great Western. In addition, 
its loans to low-income families grew to 8.3% of total loans, second only to 
Great Western's 10.5% and well ahead of the 6.7% statewide average for all 
lenders. American's loans to low- and moderate-income households grew to 25.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Antoci said that 1993's results will show that the thrift put more than 10% of 
its home loans in the hands of poorer families and provided an additional 27% 
of its mortgages to moderate-income households. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the changes that American instituted were not new ideas. Loan 
officers, for instance, often checked to see whether prospective first-time 
mortgage borrowers had been paying rent, utility bills and other recurring 
payments on time. 
</P>
<P>
 It instituted a "second look" to review rejected African American applicants, 
and now is rolling out that review process to other minority groups to become 
more active in helping them to qualify for mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 What American did was to institutionalize such alternative lending standards, 
giving them a stamp of approval so that all loan officers could use them. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, it found such lending immensely profitable. Poorer households -- 
which devote more of their life savings to housing than more affluent families 
do -- were more motivated to make monthly payments and keep their homes, so 
fewer borrowers were delinquent on their loans. As a consequence, the S&L had 
to set up fewer reserves to cover possible loan losses, lessening drain on 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, most low-income borrowers can only make a down payment of 10% of 
the sales price instead of the conventional 20%. Such loans are considered 
riskier and are thought to justify an interest rate a quarter of a percentage 
point higher. Lenders typically charge higher rates for such loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "So all in all, we're getting a higher yield in general, maintaining lower 
loss reserves and facing fewer foreclosures," Antoci said. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest factor in American's success, he said, was putting branches in the 
communities the bank wanted to reach out to. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't do it from the outside looking in," Antoci said. 
</P>
<P>
 American, with $17.3 billion in assets, will continue to make more mortgage 
loans to inner-city neighborhoods, Antoci said. But he knows the S&L's 
percentages will probably drop as the economy improves and the thrift starts 
making more and larger loans in middle-class and affluent areas. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, though, he is quite pleased with the results -- and results, he notes, 
are all that really matters. Lending in Low Income Neighborhoods 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20% of home loans originated by American Savings in 1992, the most 
recent year for which figures are available, went to low-income areas. That's 
twice the statewide level and higher than many large commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
 American Savings: 20.2% Great Western: 15.9 Home Savings: 13.4 World Savings: 
12.9 Western Federal: 12.5 Directors Mortgage: 11.0 Bank of America: 9.2

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: THE BIG SURPRISE OF '94: A MANIA FOR U.S. STOCKS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The standard wisdom about the stock market in 1994 is that it's going to be a 
tough year. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Wall Streeters have another idea: They see a buying mania coming, 
similar to the one that drove the Dow Jones industrial average up 36% between 
January and August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound too far fetched? Of course it does -- which is exactly why the super 
bulls are so intrigued with the possibility. The market usually confounds the 
majority view, often with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just see all of these people who want to be first to call the top in this 
market," says Richard Eakle, whose Eakle Associates is an independent market 
research firm in Fair Haven, N.J. What he doesn't see, Eakle says, are many 
investors who believe that stocks could rocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Marko Budgyk, chief investment officer at Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin in 
Century City, also has been touting the mania theme to clients in recent 
months. While most investors believe that stocks are already high-priced 
relative to corporate earnings, the nature of bull markets is that they take 
prices to wild extremes that surprise nearly everyone, Budgyk says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late-1980s, he notes, "People were bearish on the (then high-flying) 
Japanese market -- and it went up another 100%" before finally peaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the U.S. market today, Budgyk says, "I think the most likely 
scenario is that this market has 20% it can add in a fairly short period of 
time." A 20% rise would take the Dow industrials from Friday's record close of 
3,867.20 to about 4,640. 
</P>
<P>
 There is much more than simple contrarianism underlying the mania-predictors' 
logic. In many ways, the backdrop for stocks today resembles the scene in 
January, 1987 -- when the Dow began its stunning climb from 2,000 to the 1980s' 
bull market peak of 2,722.42 reached on Aug. 25 that year: 
</P>
<P>
 * Then, as now, the economy was steadily improving. After languishing at low 
to moderate growth rates for most of 1986, the economy picked up a head of 
steam in '87. Real gross domestic product, which had grown at less than a 2.5% 
(annualized) rate in the final three quarters of 1986, expanded by nearly 3.2% 
in the first quarter of '87, then topped 4% growth in each of the final three 
quarters of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise today, the economy is clearly on the mend. And as business and 
consumer confidence in the future rises, so too will expectations for corporate 
profit growth -- the ultimate driving force behind stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, operating earnings for the blue-chip firms in the Standard & Poor's 
500-stock index leaped 27% from 1986 levels, surprising many investors and 
helping to fuel the market's surge. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Kaufman, editor of S&P's Outlook market newsletter, predicts a 17% rise 
in S&P-company operating earnings this year, and most Wall Streeters have 
similar, relatively modest projections. But if earnings exceed estimates -- and 
many fourth-quarter reports released so far have done just that -- stocks could 
benefit dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 * Inflation was seen as vanquished in 1987. Helped by a steep plunge in oil 
prices, the Consumer Price Index rose just 1.1% in 1986 -- a statistic which, 
when released in mid-January of '87, helped stoke investor optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the government reported that the CPI in 1993 advanced a mere 2.7%, 
the lowest figure since '86. 
</P>
<P>
 The perception of low inflation is important, because it can keep financial 
markets from panicking should interest rates move gradually higher with the 
strengthening economy. Indeed, rates ratcheted higher during much of 1987, but 
that proved to be no restraint on the Dow's climb from January to August of 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
 * The '87 bull market was viewed as aged. Sound familiar? By the end of 1986, 
there was general disbelief that stocks could soar in '87, because they had 
been advancing for more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The current bull market is more than three years old, and the arguments 
against a sharp rise in prices today are the same as they were in January, '87: 
The bull is simply too mature for such tricks. In retrospect, of course, 
investors had badly underestimated the potential left in the market in '87. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One oft-cited negative sign back then was the so-called divergence of market 
indexes: The Dow utility stock index topped out in January of '87. Many Wall 
Streeters viewed that as ominous, because a peak in utilities often foreshadows 
a bear market. But the Dow industrials paid no attention to the utilities as 
the buying mania took hold that winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the broad market has advanced in recent months even though the Dow 
utility index reached its all-time high last September, and has slumped since. 
</P>
<P>
 * Foreign buyers could be a wild card -- again. Foreigners' robust appetite 
for U.S. stocks in 1987 -- and for U.S. assets in general -- was a surprise 
contributor to the '87 buying mania. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, while much attention has been paid to the unprecedented demand by 
American investors for foreign securities in 1993, little notice has been given 
to foreigners' rising purchases of U.S. assets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 12 months ended last Sept. 30, foreigners provided 20% of net U.S. 
savings available to fund the federal deficit and provide new business 
investment, up from virtually nothing in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Schlossberg, senior economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco, notes 
that foreign demand for U.S. investments has been increasing for six 
consecutive quarters but is still well below the 1987 peak -- when foreign 
investment accounted for 40% of net U.S. savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Eakle, of Eakle Associates, believes foreign buyers may find U.S. stocks 
irresistible in 1994, in part because the U.S. market badly lagged most foreign 
markets last year. The S&P 500 index's price gain of 7.1% in 1993 was 
embarrassingly small compared with the 116% average rise in Hong Kong share 
prices, the 47% rise in German stocks and even the 20% rise in British shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Because investors worldwide now are conditioned to follow the biblical line 
that "the last shall be first," the U.S. market's meager gain last year should 
automatically attract foreigners here in '94, on the expectation of a catch-up, 
Eakle says. "I think this is going to be the U.S. market's year in the sun," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are signs that that is already happening: Many of the emerging markets 
that were red hot last year, such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Mexico, have 
suffered deep selloffs since Jan. 1. Besides sending native investors in search 
of a safer haven such as the U.S. market, the selloffs overseas could slow the 
pace of Americans' investment in foreign markets. That may mean U.S. buyers 
keep more of their money here in '94, providing more fuel for a mania. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, individual investors' renewed demand for U.S. stocks, 
especially via mutual funds, has stunned analysts who expected a slowdown 
because of the blip up in interest rates since fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Discount brokerage giant Charles Schwab & Co., which offers a convenient 
one-stop shopping program for mutual fund buyers, says it's on track to sell a 
record amount of stock funds this month. Investor fund purchases are running 
2-to-1 ahead of redemptions, Schwab says. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Twentieth Century fund group in Kansas City, Mo., the firm said it had 
a record number of phone calls on Jan. 3, many from people looking for stock 
fund ideas for the new year. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of mushrooming demand for stocks makes a buying panic "very 
possible," concedes Bradlee Perry, veteran investor and head of the Babson 
Group of mutual funds in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money is just pouring into equity mutual funds and that is going to work its 
way very quickly into the market," he says. "You're seeing a market where bad 
news -- unless it's really disappointing -- has no effect on investors." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But is there really a good reason to pray that the mania prediction, a la 
1987, comes true in 1994? Eakle, who expects the Dow to reach 4,300 by the 
third quarter, admits that he's hoping he isn't surprised by a far bigger gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vertical markets don't have happy endings," he says. That was certainly true 
of the 1987 mania, which ended in an October crash: From its August peak of 
2,722 to its October low of 1,738, the Dow lost 36% of its value. (The Dow 
recovered enough by the end of '87 to show a 2.3% gain for the full year.) 
</P>
<P>
 There are reasons to think that this time, even a bona fide buying panic would 
be much more orderly and stretched out. For one, the "collars" imposed on the 
market after the '87 crash by the New York Stock Exchange limit volatility. 
Whenever the Dow rises more than 50 points on any given day, computer-guided 
trading is automatically slowed. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, if 1994 brings another record in new stock issuance, that would 
have the net effect of acting like a sponge for fresh investor dollars -- 
limiting the cash chasing the rest of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the central message here is that the positives substantially outweigh 
the negatives for U.S. stocks. Mania or not, it may be time to just sit back 
and enjoy the ride.

EXECUTIVE SAYS EX-EMPLOYER CHEATED HER OF OWNERSHIP STAKE; WORKPLACE: THE 
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IS INVESTIGATING THE COMPLAINT.

<P>
 Barbara Bunte thought her success was evident and her retirement savings 
assured. 
</P>
<P>
 During six years as West Coast regional director of Franklin Mortgage Capital 
Corp., she built the operation into a major mortgage banking business, 
expanding it from 13 employees to 180, from funding $5 million in new home 
loans each month to funding $200 million a month. 
</P>
<P>
 So it came as a shock to Bunte that, while she was home in April recuperating 
from a broken ankle, her boss announced to the staff that she was resigning. 
But that wasn't the case, she said: In fact, at age 55, she was unceremoniously 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, she learned later, she may also have lost her retirement account: 
100,000 shares of Franklin stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was sold in mid-December to Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a major 
New York brokerage and investment bank, for $30 million. That amounts to $9.43 
a share, which would make Bunte's stake worth $943,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunte alleges that Stephen P. Terry, Franklin's former president, fired her 
without cause and then sold the Falls Church, Va., company to DLJ without 
informing her and without acknowledging that she owned a 3% interest in 
Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
 After trying repeatedly to get what she says is her due, Bunte filed a 
complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The federal agency has 
referred the case to its enforcement division for investigation. An agency 
spokeswoman said such attention to a complaint by an individual is rare. Citing 
SEC policy, she would not comment further on the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other top managers at the Tustin operation -- the largest of three 
Franklin Mortgage offices nationwide -- have also said that they were forced 
out during the last few years and have complained that they were treated 
unfairly. Apparently none of them had a written agreement, though, as Bunte 
had. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry has not responded to several requests in the last three weeks for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 He was quoted in December in National Mortgage News, an industry magazine, as 
saying that Bunte resigned voluntarily and therefore forfeited the right to her 
100,000 shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson Dean, managing director of DLJ Merchant Banking Partners, said the 
Franklin Mortgage sale was not hindered by the SEC investigation of Bunte's 
allegation. However, he said, DLJ has an agreement with Terry that the 
investment bank will not be responsible for Bunte's claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a matter between Steve Terry and Barbara Bunte," Dean said, adding 
that DLJ plans to leave Franklin's current management in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunte and Terry met when they were both employed by Merrill Lynch. She was a 
senior vice president and regional director based in Tustin; he was a vice 
chairman based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch closed its Tustin operation, but an investor purchased the 
branch and, in March, 1987, sold it to Terry's newly formed Franklin Mortgage 
Capital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Bunte's leadership, the West Coast operation became the most successful 
of the three regional operations of Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the West Coast operation originated nearly $2.4 billion in loans, 
according to company documents supplied by Bunte's lawyer. By comparison, the 
Virginia operation made $774.5 million in new loans that year, and the Texas 
operation made $16.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunte said that her efforts for Franklin helped make the company an attractive 
acquisition for DLJ. She says she was forced out at Franklin to prevent her 
from sharing the benefits of the deal. When she left Franklin, she was told 
that her shares were worth $490,000 -- about half of their value at the price 
subsequently paid by DLJ. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunte was unaware of DLJ's interest in the company, she said, when she was 
pushed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks before she lost the job, Bunte had suffered a broken ankle and torn 
ligaments. She was at home recovering, she said, when Terry called and offered 
her a position that would have required her to travel by air. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of an ear problem, she said, she cannot travel in airplanes. Terry was 
aware of that, Bunte said, so was offering her a job that he knew she could not 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 9, Terry announced in a memorandum to Franklin's staff that Bunte had 
resigned. She tried to cash in her company shares at the time, she said, but 
Terry said he would not give her the money unless she signed an agreement not 
to compete with him in mortgage banking. She refused to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the summer, the two continued to discuss a settlement, Bunte said, 
but could not agree. She filed the SEC complaint at the end of October. 
</P>
<P>
 "I trusted this man," Bunte said. "I guess I trusted him to the point of being 
stupid."

 Eli Lilly & Co. Cutting AIDS Research: The giant pharmaceutical company has 
halted in-house research on HIV treatments as part of the pharmaceutical 
company's continuing restructuring plans, officials said.The company's AIDS and 
HIV research was limited, with just one potential drug in the first phase of 
human tests. That study won't be abandoned, but Lilly will search for a partner 
to continue work. "There are other studies that are in the process of being . . 
. closed down in order for us to focus those resources in areas where we feel 
we have a competitive advantage," said Carlos Lopez, executive director of 
infectious diseases research for Lilly. The move comes as the 
Indianapolis-based company tries to shrink its operations and staff to save 
money.

 Court of Appeal to Review Workers' Comp Decision: A sweeping ruling that threw 
out workers' compensation claims filed by a group of 10 laid-off International 
Rectifier employees will be reviewed by the California Court of Appeal. The 
original decision last April by Long Beach workers' compensation Judge Frank S. 
Falero sparked controversy by accusing the workers, their lawyers and doctors 
of conspiring to commit insurance fraud. Falero's ruling was appealed by 
Beverly Hills Multispecialty, the medical practice where the 10 workers were 
evaluated and treated, and whose bills totaling $158,000 were disallowed by 
Falero.

 Ryland to Target New Market: Ryland Group, the nation's third-largest home 
builder, said it will change its focus in California to target entry-level 
buyers -- putting the company in head-to-head competition with Kaufman & Broad 
Home, the state's biggest builder.Ryland Chief Executive R. Chad Dreier 
announced the shift on Friday. Ryland has traditionally built higher-end homes 
for second- and third-time "move-up" buyers in California. But that market has 
been hard-hit by the real estate recession. In contrast, Dreier said, there 
still is "pent-up demand" in California for low-end homes for first-time buyers 
-- the market Kaufman & Broad has successfully targeted. Dreier had been chief 
financial officer at K&B until he was lured to Columbia, Md.-based Ryland in 
November.

 Inventories Up 0.6% November: The Commerce Department said November's rise in 
inventories at the nation's businesses was the biggest increase since January, 
1991.Sales were even stronger, up 1.1% in the fourth consecutive gain. 
Inventories on shelves and back lots totaled a seasonally adjusted $875.1 
billion. Sales totaled $606.9 billion. Sometimes rising inventories can be a 
danger signal. As they pile up, factories cut back production so they're not 
swamped with unsold goods. However, analysts aren't concerned by the current 
inventory gain because much of it came in areas where sales are strong. The 
inventory-to-sales ratio in November was 1.44, down from 1.45 a month earlier.

AIRLINES CUT 4TH-QUARTER LOSSES 90% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. airlines lost money in the traditionally poor fourth quarter despite an 
unexpectedly steep drop in fuel prices, industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 But carriers are expected to lose only about $275 million in the final quarter 
compared to $2.7 billion lost in the 1992 fourth quarter, proving that the 
troubled industry is slowly recovering, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The expected fourth quarter losses will follow widespread profits posted by 
carriers in the third quarter. Airlines begin reporting earnings next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry often loses money in the fourth quarter, which is the year's 
weakest, due to higher costs that stem from inclement weather and limited 
vacation travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quarter is normally a loss unless it's an exceptionally good year," said 
David Swierenga, chief economist at the Air Transport Assn., a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry results will be skewed by the five-day flight attendants strike at 
American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, which will cut revenues for 
its parent, AMR Corp., and boost those of others. "I think the quarter is going 
to be tough to evaluate because of the American strike," said Rose Ann Tortora 
of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 AMR said last month that the strike will cut its fourth-quarter earnings by 
about $160 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But the strike at American will actually boost revenues at rivals United 
Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which picked up extra traffic from passengers 
left stranded by canceled flights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The traffic that moved onto other airlines will be an incremental plus to 
them," Swierenga said. 
</P>
<P>
 But only regional low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co. is expected to post 
a profit.

GM, UNION REACH ACCORD AT TRUCK PLANT; AUTO MAKERS: UAW MEMBERS, WHO HAVE BEEN 
ON STRIKE FOR SIX DAYS IN LOUISIANA, ARE TO VOTE TODAY ON THE TENTATIVE PACT. 
</P>

<P>
 General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative 
agreement to settle a six-day strike at the auto maker's Shreveport, La., 
compact pickup truck plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides reached an accord on a local pact Sunday morning after about 40 
hours of talks. A vote on the contract was set for this afternoon, said Warren 
Danford, financial secretary for United Auto Workers Local 2166. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the contract were not released, but Danford said he expected it to 
be ratified. 
</P>
<P>
 If the agreement is approved, the 2,300 hourly workers at the plant could be 
back on the job by Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees, frustrated by a lack of a local agreement and a work pace that they 
said was too fast, walked off the job Tuesday after talks failed to produce an 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same thing it's been all the time -- manpower," Danford said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tentative agreement is equitable for both GM and the UAW," said GM 
spokeswoman Mary Ann Tyler. "It continues to support our needs in managing the 
facility to meet competitive targets as well as addressing the concerns of the 
work force." 
</P>
<P>
 Since GM reached a new national three-year agreement with the UAW last 
October, about 48 of 119 local agreements remain unsettled, many of them in 
GM's truck and components divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike is the first walkout since GM and the UAW reached agreement on a 
new national labor contract in October covering about 254,000 hourly U.S. 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both GM, the U.S.' biggest auto maker, and the UAW declined to release details 
of the agreement before the ratification vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The Louisiana assembly plant makes 816 Chevrolet and GMC S-Series and Sonoma 
compact pickup trucks a day, compared with a rate of 768 a day last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The trucks, also made at GM's Linden, N.J., plant, are among GM's best-selling 
vehicles. The vehicles were redesigned for the 1994-model year. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts had estimated that a strike at the Shreveport plant could cost GM 
about $3 million a day if it resulted in a shortage of new trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's in the ballpark, assuming a gross variable profit of about $4,000 a 
vehicle," said Nicholas Lobaccaro, of S.G. Warburg & Co. in New York. "There's 
a lot of interest in these trucks by dealers." 
</P>
<P>
 GM has about a 90-day supply of its small pickups on hand, which is above the 
65- to 70-day supply considered normal, industry figures show. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the UAW had threatened to strike GM's parts plant in Flint, Mich., 
unless negotiators moved quickly to settle the strike at Shreveport. The UAW 
said it wouldn't tolerate a lengthy strike at the truck plant.

 Paramount's Davis Says Viacom Was the Right Deal: Martin S. Davis, chairman of 
Paramount Communications Inc., said in an interview with Time Magazine that the 
company's original merger deal with cable firm Viacom Inc. was "the right deal. 
I'll say that to my dying day," Davis said in the interview in the Jan. 24 
edition of Time."I wouldn't have done a thing differently. Seriously. What we 
did was the right thing in our view, and I would do it again today. I could not 
conceive of it coming out the way it did." The entertainment giant has been the 
target of bids by Viacom and QVC Network Inc., which is run by Barry Diller, 
the former head of Paramount's Hollywood studio. After a Delaware court battle 
that set the stage for an auction of Paramount, the company agreed to a merger 
with QVC.

 Chevron Begins Pumping Oil at New North Sea Site: Chevron Corp. said it has 
begun to pump oil from the North Sea's Alba field, which is believed to hold up 
to 400 million barrels of recoverable oil. Chevron U.K., operator and majority 
owner of the project, expects peak production of 70,000 barrels a day later 
this year.Partners in the project have spent $1 billion on the first phase of 
the Alba development. Plans for Phase 2, to develop the southern portion of the 
field, are under discussion. Alba, which was discovered in 1984, is the first 
of a "new generation" of North Sea fields likely to yield significant output 
from zones about half as deep as most North Sea fields, said Charles Smith, 
Chevron U.K. managing director.

 Limits on Foreign Ownership to Remain: Finance Minister Hong Jai-hyung said in 
a radio report that the government will keep in place a regulation that limits 
the stake overseas investors may take in local companies to 10%.In an interview 
with the state-run KBS radio last week, Hong said the ceiling will remain 
intact for at least the first six months of this year. However, Hong declined 
to say when the adjustment will be made. The ministry has promised the U.S. 
government that the limit on investment will be relaxed this year. However, 
South Korean officials have been reluctant to raise the ceiling, saying that an 
increase in the influx of overseas funds will contribute to inflation.

CHINA EXPECTS BOOM TO BRING ANOTHER TRADE DEFICIT IN '94 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 China, which had its first trade deficit in four years in 1993, is likely to 
have another one in 1994, a government economist predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 China reported a $12.2-billion deficit last year.It blamed the deficit on 
strong demand for construction and raw materials fueled by the nation's booming 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 China will be helped in 1994 by the continuing shift of its exports from raw 
materials to high-priced finished goods, and also by the opening of more 
foreign-invested joint ventures that often produce for export, the China Daily 
Business Weekly said Sunday, quoting Wang Huaian, a trade ministry economist. 
</P>
<P>
 "But inflation and money shortages are still biting and pushing up export 
costs," the paper quoted Wang as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has said it wants the economy to grow substantially more slowly 
in 1994 than the 13% it grew in 1993, but Western economists are skeptical that 
that will happen.

REOPENING HAIPHONG TO WORLD'S BUSINESS; TRADE: MEMORIES OF WAR STILL LINGER, 
BUT RESIDENTS ARE LOOKING AHEAD TO THE OPENING OF AN EXPORT PROCESSING ZONE.

 This major northern port city was at the crossroads of the Vietnam War more 
than 20 years ago, a funnel for arms and ammunition to fight the Americans and 
a frequent target of U.S. warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with talk of lifting or easing the 19-year-old U.S. trade embargo, 
Vietnam's third-largest city is hoping American businesses will join other 
foreign companies in investing in a new concept -- an export processing zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The zone would allow any country to bring in raw materials and produce goods, 
then export them to another country tax free. After one year, the companies 
must pay an income tax. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in May, 1972, that President Richard M. Nixon ordered the mining of 
Haiphong Harbor in retaliation for North Vietnam's Easter offensive against 
South Vietnam, a U.S. ally. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a year later, in January, 1973, the United States and North Vietnam 
signed the Paris peace agreement and all American forces were withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The war went on for two more years before South Vietnam fell to the North on 
April 30, 1975. The United States evacuated its embassy and imposed the trade 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The slogan is, 'Forget the past,' " said Hoang Van Dinh, director of 
Haiphong's foreign affairs office. "If they come here as commercial ships, 
they're welcome. If they come here as warships, we'll fire." 
</P>
<P>
 The men who fought the Americans then are still around today, in retirement, 
enjoying their grandchildren who, unlike them, have peace to look forward to 
instead of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Their brown uniforms are as faded as the war. They are like the old soldier of 
the British war ballad who never dies but only fades away, trotted out for 
official occasions and to meet the press. They hesitate to bash America these 
days, instead saying the past should be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a mistake when the U.S. attacked Vietnam, but a mistake of the 
government," said retired Lt. Gen. Dang Kinh, 72. He commanded the troops in 
Haiphong in 1972 during the large-scale American attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can ignore the mistake, leave it behind," said Kinh, wearing a chest full 
of medals from wars against the Japanese, French and Americans. "We think we 
should forget the past and we wish it could never return." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a difficult war," said Dinh, the foreign affairs director. "But also 
now it is a difficult peace." 
</P>
<P>
 This second time around, it is not the U.S. bombers or the mines that have 
hurt Haiphong. Instead, nature and the sea have taken their toll on the port. 
It has fallen upon hard times, even though the city is thriving under a free 
market economy. Haiphong has grown from a wartime population of nearly 1 
million to 1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the Paris peace agreement, the United States agreed to send in Navy 
minesweepers to clear Haiphong Harbor. In July, 1973, the port was declared 
open to ocean traffic, but it has never reached its capacity of 6 million tons 
per year. During the war, it was handling about 2 million tons or less and last 
year reached a high of 4 million tons. 
</P>
<P>
 Sand and mud from the mountains upstream of the Cam River have made the harbor 
too shallow to handle ships over 10,000 tons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese government has given Vietnam a $170-million long-term, 
low-interest loan for a two-year project to dredge the harbor and upgrade the 
port facilities, including the purchase of bigger cranes and the enlargement of 
warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiphong has reclaimed nearly 25,000 acres of land from the sea. Many 
Vietnamese have been resettled there. About a third of the land has been set 
aside for the new export processing zone and the first three factories are 
expected to be built there this year. These include two shoe factories and a 
garment factory backed by investors from Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinh said more than 20 businesses from Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, 
France, Russia and Australia have invested in joint ventures with the 
Vietnamese in Haiphong. He said some Americans had made unofficial visits. "The 
Americans come too late," he said.

 Beijing Files With SEC to Sell Bonds: Overcoming its longtime reluctance to 
tap into international capital markets, the nation took an initial step toward 
its first worldwide bond offering.The Beijing government filed with the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission to sell $1 billion of 10-year bonds, to be 
underwritten by Merrill Lynch & Co. Previously, China has avoided capital 
markets and relied on international borrowing. Commercial and primary 
government loans accounted for 80% of the country's $69.3 billion in external 
public debt as of Dec. 31, 1992, according to Bloomberg Business News.

 Jardine Matheson Unit to Close Offices: Jardine Transport Services (China), a 
transportation arm of British conglomerate Jardine Matheson, will close more 
than half of its mainland offices, the South China Morning Post reports. The 
transportation company is caught in a licensing dispute with mainland officials 
who have said that the company is now allowed only one office in each city in 
which it operates, the paper said.The dispute comes just four months after 
Jardine Matheson Group directors went to Beijing on a goodwill visit to heal a 
rift between Beijing and the company. Jardine had come out in support of Gov. 
Chris Patten's political reform plan in 1992, a scheme that China vehemently 
opposes. Soon afterward, commentaries in Chinese papers began criticizing the 
British conglomerate.

 Increase in Overseas Investment Is OKd: The government said it approved $1.6 
billion in overseas investments by the country's companies in 1993, an 87% 
increase over 1992. The figure excludes China, the largest recipient of Taiwan 
overseas investment last year, where approved investment more than quadrupled 
to $1.14 billion from $246.9 million, according to the Investment Commission. 
Taiwan companies are required to either report overseas investments or, for 
larger projects, obtain government approval in advance.

 It's natural for people to want to shy away from stock funds when the market 
hits record highs, as it has in recent days.

 After all, the name of the game is to buy low and sell high, and that's hard

 Placentia investor Gilbert Golden, for instance, says he's concerned that 
higher income taxes or implementation of the Clinton health plan could knock 
stocks and stock funds for a loop this year or next. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those factors have to have some impact on corporate profits," says Golden, a 
retired company auditor. He plans to hold off on putting more money into U.S. 
stock funds until the market comes down a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden isn't alone in harboring a cautious outlook. Various psychology or 
sentiment measures show that investors are fairly skittish right now. The Dow 
Jones industrial average closed Friday at a record 3,867. 
</P>
<P>
 However, people who wait for corrections to occur sometimes wait in vain. For 
investors like Golden who are optimistic long term but worry about bumps along 
the way, a number of strategies can help reduce the risks of investing when the 
market looks expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 One such approach is dollar-cost averaging, the idea of easing into stock 
funds by investing relatively small amounts on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Emery Jensen, a commercial-insurance underwriting manager in Glendale, Ariz., 
has been investing $100 a month into two separate domestic stock funds for the 
past year, with the money taken directly out of his bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a painless way to invest, because when you don't see the money, you 
don't miss it," says Jensen. He became familiar with the concept by having 
money deducted from his paychecks and invested in his 401(k) retirement plan at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen says he doesn't know what to make of the market trading at such high 
levels. But he adds that a dollar-cost averaging strategy eliminates a lot of 
the worry, because if his funds fell he would buy more shares with future 
purchases for the same cost. 
</P>
<P>
 An offshoot strategy, known as value averaging, takes a somewhat different 
tack. Here, the idea isn't to put a specific amount of money into a fund each 
month or quarter. Rather, you want to ensure that your account grows by a 
certain amount. 
</P>
<P>
 How is that different? Consider this example: Suppose your goal is to have 
your account increase by $100 each month, and suppose further that it rises by 
that much one month simply because the fund appreciates. If so, you wouldn't 
need to add any more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, if the fund jumps by $200 one period, you would actually sell $100 
worth of shares. Or if it declined by $50, you would contribute $150 to stay on 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This strategy may perform better than dollar-cost averaging because it forces 
you to buy more shares when prices are low and buy fewer or even sell some when 
the market is high, says Harvard professor Michael E. Edleson, author of the 
book "Value Averaging" ($22.95, International Publishing Corp., Chicago). 
</P>
<P>
 But drawbacks include more work, more taxable transactions and the challenge 
of coming up with some big cash to invest following months when stock prices 
really tank. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are additional wrinkles to ease into the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Lydon, a spokesman for Fabians' Investment Resource newsletter in 
Huntington Beach, says his firm recommends that new clients commit a third of 
the amount they want to invest into a stock fund, then wait for that to 
appreciate by 5%. When that happens, they would commit the second third, and so 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Incremental purchasing gives people a plan, so they can emotionally handle 
the ups and downs of the market," says Lydon, whose firm also makes use of 
market timing to help limit risk. 
</P>
<P>
 As another alternative, you might consider a simple buy-and-hold or averaging 
strategy using slower moving equity-oriented funds, such as those listed in the 
accompanying chart. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce fluctuations, some managers load up on conservative stocks or anchor 
their portfolios with a lot of bonds or cash holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 One advantage of these types of funds is that they typically pay bigger 
dividends -- and when these payments are automatically reinvested, investors 
enjoy a type of dollar-cost averaging. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors with substantial bond-fund holdings can gain some equity exposure in 
another manner -- by reinvesting dividends into stock portfolios that are part 
of the same fund family. 
</P>
<P>
 This is another form of dollar-cost averaging and may provide comfort to 
people who don't want to risk their original principal, although it obviously 
won't work for investors who need to cash their bond-fund dividends to meet 
living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As yet another risk-reducing strategy, you might consider buying some 
international funds. This might seem like a contradiction since foreign stocks 
are generally riskier than U.S. equities, especially in countries where the 
national currency is not pegged to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 But by combining a small amount of foreign with U.S. funds, investors can 
reduce their overall volatility, as the various markets will move in different 
directions, or at least degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 For a global strategy to work, however, shareholders need to learn to view 
their holdings as part of an overall package -- without worrying too much about 
bumps and bruises among individual funds. 
</P>

 Americans are becoming more optimistic about saving money but apparently have 
mixed feelings about investing it, according to a survey by the American 
Capital fund family in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 1,000 people surveyed in January, 41.9% rated the next two to three 
months as a good to time invest, up from 38.3% in December. A rising number 
also indicated they would put more money into "savings or investments" over 
that period. 
</P>
<P>
 But only 33.3% rated the stock market as promising over the next two to three 
months, down from 35.3%. And both stock and bond funds lost support over that 
period. The asset category showing the biggest jump in investor enthusiasm was 
real estate other than one's own residence. 
</P>
<P>
 An American Capital spokesperson attributed the general uptick in enthusiasm 
to an improving economy and continuing low interest rates. Easy Riders 
</P>
<P>
 Investors looking for some stock-market exposure without much risk might 
consider some of the following mutual funds. None has lost as much as 5% in any 
quarter since 1988 nor posted an annual loss over that period. In addition, all 
have had the same manager in place over this span. 05,24,18,08,08,10 Max. Avg.

CITYSCAPES / HUGO MARTIN: DO-IT-YOURSELFERS GET A TASTE OF THE HAIR OF THE DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It probably started with those do-it-yourself carwash places, where you drop 
about a dozen quarters into a slot and blast your car with a high-powered water 
nozzle like some carwash Rambo. Then came restaurants where you cook your own 
steak. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's next? A concert where you write your own symphony? A psychiatrist's 
office where you lie on a couch and tell yourself about your terrible 
childhood? 
</P>
<P>
 These were the questions that bubbled up when I drove past U-Wash Doggie, a 
do-it-yourself dog- and cat-grooming shop in my Studio City neighborhood. Had 
society come to the point where we need a special location to shampoo our Shih 
Tzus? Unless your pet is a Clydesdale or a boa constrictor the size of a 
telephone pole, put the smelly little bugger in the bathtub and scrub. What's 
the big deal? 
</P>
<P>
 I decided to suspend further judgment until I had investigated. To be fair, my 
pet experience had been limited to a cat that does not require my assistance in 
its personal hygiene. 
</P>
<P>
 I found myself at the doggie wash, being introduced to a friend's 85-pound 
border collie mix named Pikku. The name supposedly comes from the Finnish word 
for "small," but this animal was the size of a Shetland pony with hair like Don 
King. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew immediately there would be trouble. Pikku yelped and struggled as her 
owner wrestled her through the shop's door, grunting, "She hates baths." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Gamero, who launched the U-Wash Doggie business three years ago, 
explained the deal: For $10 to $14, depending on poochie's size, you get the 
use of an apron, shampoo, a bathtub, brushes and an industrial-strength hair 
dryer. Or for $20 to $40, you can drop off your putrid pooch and the shop does 
the dirty work. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamero got the idea when he was having troubles washing his golden retriever 
in his bathtub years ago, deciding that "if I'm having problems with my dog 
myself, other people are too." 
</P>
<P>
 Gamero opened his first shop in Santa Clarita. The messy-mutt biz grew so 
rapidly that he sold partnerships for shops in Studio City and Burbank, and he 
plans to open several more, including one in Woodland Hills. He is not alone in 
this business. Shops with names such as E-Z Pet Wash and My Beautiful Dog-O-Mat 
have sprouted all over town. 
</P>
<P>
 My first problem was getting Pikku into the tub, which was about three feet 
off the ground so I wouldn't need to bend over to scrub her. Gamero offered a 
stepladder specially made to get mutts into the tub. Pikku would have nothing 
to do with it. She just sat on the floor, staring at the tub, eyes rolling in 
terror. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Pikku's owner lifted the dog into the tub. I chained her to the side 
to keep her from squirming around. 
</P>
<P>
 I was ready to fire a burst from the hose when Janet Benedict, one of the 
shop's owners, suggested that I first comb off excess hair with a soft wire 
brush. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time my arm grew tired of brushing, I had about 10 pounds of hair in 
the tub, on the brush, on my hands and in the tub's drain. Once I got Pikku 
soaped down, she did what comes natural to wet dogs: She shook, hurling gobs of 
suds and long, coarse hairs in all directions. My white sweat shirt looked like 
a sort of odd, gray wool sweater. 
</P>
<P>
 Benedict had taught me a trick to keep dogs from shaking -- just lift one of 
the dog's front legs so she would be too unbalanced to shake. This had no 
affect on Pikku, an incredibly well-balanced animal who could have gone on 
shaking if I had hung her upside down from the ceiling. And indeed, she howled 
as if I had. Long, loud, eardrum-piercing howls, lowered only when Benedict 
began tossing Pikku dog treats. 
</P>
<P>
 Several shakes and howls later, I was ready to use the industrial-strength 
hair dryer that was supposed to dry off the average head (human, not canine) in 
five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pikku's bulk soaked up about 20 minutes, more time than I need to wash and dry 
a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The final touch: cologne. Gamero sprayed Pikku with a delicate aroma sure to 
drive the male dogs in the neighborhood mad. 
</P>
<P>
 So there's Pikku, fluffy and shiny and smelling like the perfume counter at 
Saks. 
</P>
<P>
 And here's me, looking like I had been dipped in tar and dragged through a 
toupee shop. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when it struck me. 
</P>
<P>
 The tub. 
</P>
<P>
 The tub was lined on all sides with long black hairs that formed groovy little 
tie-dye designs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A disaster," Pikku's owner agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was the tub that made me realize why do-it-yourself pet grooming shops 
are the boom biz of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 I may have been a mess, but at least when I got home I could clean up in a tub 
that does not look like it is lined with gray shag carpet.

WOMAN DROWNS TRYING TO SAVE SON; TRAGEDY: SHE IS AMONG SEVERAL RESCUERS WHO 
FALL INTO A MOUNTAIN LAKE AS THIN ICE GIVES WAY. THE 10-YEAR-OLD BOY AND OTHERS 
ARE PULLED TO SAFETY. 
</P>

<P>
 For Analiza Kiat and a dozen friends, it was supposed to be a day of fun and 
games in the snow near Wrightwood. But when they decided to picnic at a nearby 
lake because there was little snow to be found, the trip turned to tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiat's 10-year-old son crashed through the thin ice that covered part of 
half-frozen Jackson Lake. Then the ice broke under the mother, who could not 
swim, as she ran to his aid. And then at least four other people fell into the 
water while responding to the chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 It all happened in a frantic 15 minutes. In the end, Kiat, 33, of Panorama 
City, drowned in the frigid water while her son, Ninoy, was rescued by a 
20-year-old bystander, Christian McFarland. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I really started panicking was when everyone started falling into the 
water. It was like being in a movie," said McFarland, a Pierce College student 
who sheriff's and U.S. Forest Service officials called a hero for saving Ninoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad the boy is safe," McFarland said Sunday, "but I wish the mother was 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred about 1 p.m. Saturday at five-acre Jackson Lake, just 
inside the Los Angeles-San Bernardino County line near Big Pines. Forest 
Service officials said the episode illustrates the dangers that can arise when 
normally sunbaked Southern Californians head for winter fun. 
</P>
<P>
 The lake has signs posted warning visitors not to tread on the ice because it 
usually does not get thick enough to support people. But the dead woman's 
brother, Joseph Kiat, said Sunday that his group did not see the signs until it 
was too late, and that they ventured out onto the ice only after seeing many 
other people playing there. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everyone was playing there and having fun, you're going to go out and play 
too. That's what happened," said Kiat, of Northridge, at whose home family 
members gathered Sunday to mourn Analiza Kiat. They were buoyed only by the 
news that Ninoy was to be released Sunday night from San Bernardino County 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiat said his sister, a single mother who worked part time as a nurse in Santa 
Monica, had emigrated from the Philippines in 1987 and settled into the house 
she shared with her son and a relative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her life was beginning to have some meaning. Everything was starting to come 
along. Now it's just stopped," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest Service spokeswoman Shawn Lawler said the lake is a popular stopping 
spot for visitors, but no Forest Service personnel are stationed there and 
there is no way to keep people away from it in winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the drowning, Lawler said she doubted that the Forest Service would 
attempt to restrict public access to the lake, preferring instead to continue 
to warn people to stay off the ice. She said Kiat's death was the first 
ice-related drowning at the lake that Forest Service officials could recall, 
although people occasionally fall through the ice and are rescued. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time emergency crews arrived Saturday, all the people except Analiza 
Kiat had been helped from the water by friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a problem we have every winter. We're constantly stopping and telling 
people to get off the ice," Lawler said. "Because it's Southern California and 
it doesn't freeze as much as in other places, the ice just isn't thick enough 
to walk on. We put up signs and they get pulled down and used for snow 
sledding," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Kiat said his group had been out on the ice for several minutes when 
Ninoy, who was playing an ice hockey-like game, fell into the near-freezing 
water when the ice cracked. Analiza Kiat and the others followed. As people 
nearby began shouting, McFarland said he saw the commotion and began running 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarland said he did not know exactly what he would do -- but the decision 
was soon made for him. The ice cracked under McFarland as well, dunking him 
into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 His first move was to swim for the boy, who was going under. As he did, other 
members of his and the Kiat party also began falling in. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, McFarland said, he began to weaken. He passed the boy to a woman 
from his group who was in the water while he managed to get back onto the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, McFarland said, he used one hand to grasp a sheet of plastic that 
another man held as a makeshift safety line, and used the other hand to pull 
the boy and the woman from his group out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time the mother, who had been flailing in the water, had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy in a swimsuit went 
into the murky water in a vain search attempt. Analiza Kiat's body was found 
about two hours later near the lake's bottom by another deputy in scuba gear 
who had been flown in by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 As the sheriff's diver pulled Kiat's body from the lake, Lawler looked across 
the partially frozen water and saw another group of people watching the process 
-- standing on the ice.

GUN BATTLE, STANDOFF CAP WILD CHASE; VIOLENCE: HEAVILY ARMED PAIR TAKE A 
HOSTAGE IN HALL OF RECORDS BUILDING. ORDEAL BEGINS WITH SACRAMENTO CARJACKING, 
ENDS IN CIVIC CENTER CRASH 400 MILES AWAY.

<P>
 A government building in Downtown Los Angeles was ringed by police 
sharpshooters past midnight as a dramatic hostage standoff capped a day-long, 
400-mile journey that began as a carjacking in Sacramento, led to a wild 
high-speed chase over the Tehachapis and a gun battle in the crowded streets of 
Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 After their stolen truck crashed in the heart of the Downtown Civic Center, 
the gunmen took a Los Angeles County employee hostage as they forced their way 
into the Hall of Records Building with powerful weapons, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight hours later, police were still negotiating by phone with the pair. A 
woman hostage, seized seconds after a collision with another vehicle ended the 
chase at Temple Street and Broadway, was believed to be unharmed early this 
morning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two bystanders were slightly wounded as the gunmen and Los Angeles police 
exchanged shots in Chinatown; two other people, including a CHP officer, were 
injured when the stolen pickup crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they've killed before and would kill again if necessary," said the 
carjacking victim, Michael McKeen of Woodland. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeen, a part-time newspaper delivery man, was at a Sacramento Burger King 
early Sunday when the gunmen ordered him into the back of his truck with 
several hundred newspapers. The pair later freed him on a dirt road in a 
vineyard near Delano -- but not before showing off their 9-millimeter 
semiautomatic weapons fitted with laser sights and silencers. 
</P>
<P>
 As authorities in Los Angeles hacked down trees surrounding the building to 
get a better view Sunday night, police negotiators were in touch with the 
suspects, two Asian men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some demands have been made and we are in negotiations," said LAPD spokesman 
Lt. John Dunkin. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are pretty hard-core," said LAPD Officer Arthur Holmes. "They've 
got laser-sighted weapons; they're not afraid to shoot. These are not nice 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 As negotiations continued, a Brinks armored truck, with the company name on 
the sides covered by paper and tape, pulled up to the intersection outside the 
Hall of Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Into the night, officers, who had access to the lobby of the building, 
appeared to be playing out scenarios for resolving the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The odyssey began 400 miles to the north at the Sacramento fast-food outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came up to me and told me to get face-down on the ground," McKeen, 33, 
said Sunday night. He said the men told him to lie face-up in the back of the 
truck and keep quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeen said the men told him he would not be hurt if they followed his 
instructions. He gave them the $200 he had and they drove to Bakersfield, where 
McKeen withdrew another $300 from an automated teller machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they turned back north and released McKeen in the vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeen called authorities and about 90 minutes later, just after 3 p.m., Kern 
County sheriff's deputies spotted the blue 1992 Chevrolet S-10 pickup truck 
heading south on Interstate 5 near Frazier Park, a town in Kern County near the 
Los Angeles County line. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase hit speeds of 110 m.p.h., and at the county line, California Highway 
Patrol officers joined the Kern County deputies. Dunkin said shots were fired 
at CHP officers in three patrol cars as the pickup raced south into Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Golden State Freeway, the stolen truck veered briefly down the Harbor 
Freeway and into Chinatown, where Los Angeles police joined the chase. Once, 
the truck reportedly stopped at a red light, and the law enforcement convoy 
halted behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Los Angeles police exchanged gunfire with the men in the truck. 
Some shots -- whether they came from the police guns or the suspects' is not 
known -- slightly wounded two bystanders, one superficially and the other more 
seriously. The injuries were not life-threatening, a Los Angeles city Fire 
Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing down Broadway, the blue truck collided with a white pickup truck at 
Temple. The suspects then ran a few yards to the Hall of Records, one of 
several public buildings in the Civic Center, and traded shots with CHP 
officers, Dunkin said. Inside, behind the bullet-shattered glass doors, they 
grabbed their hostage. It was just after 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 As police, sheriff's deputies and CHP officers scrambled to seal off Downtown 
streets, the search for the suspects and the hostage began through the plazas 
and walkways around the building, which is webbed with tunnels, stairwells and 
hallways. 
</P>
<P>
 Police observed one gunman with a chrome-plated revolver in one hand and a 
blue steel "laser weapon" in the other hand. McKeen described the suspects as 
Asian, one in his 40s and the other in his 20s. Both spoke English and the 
older one told McKeen he was from Laos. 
</P>
<P>
 To demonstrate their firepower to McKeen, they stopped the truck north of 
Bakersfield and fired at a post. He said the older gunman had "apparently 
killed someone before and was trying to get away. . . . He was prepared to die. 
He would go down fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing for his life, McKeen told the gunmen that he is married, has three 
children and a fourth is on the way, and would cooperate with them. "If they 
were going to kill me, they would have killed me by now," McKeen said he 
thought at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 After they drove McKeen to near Delano and released him, "They shook my hand 
and told me 'Good luck.' " Crime Rampage 
</P>
<P>
 A daylong crime spree that began as a carjacking and kidnaping in Sacramento 
led to a high-speed chase over the Tehachapis and a tense hostage standoff at 
the county Hall of Records in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 1) Suspects hijack part-time newspaper delivery man Michael McKeen at 
gunpoint, take $200 from him and drive south. 
</P>
<P>
 2) McKeen is forced to withdraw $300 from an automated teller machine. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Suspects turn back north and release McKeen in a vineyard near Delano. 
</P>
<P>
 4) McKeen calls authorities, who catch up with the suspects in Frazier Park 
and begin pursuit toward Downtown Los Angeles at speeds up to 110 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Two bystanders wounded by gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 6) Two injured when truck crashes. Gunmen enter Hall of Records and take 
employee hostage.

DWP CLASS FOR WOMEN ENROLLS 222 -- NONE ARE HIRED 
</P>

<P>
 This class mixes physics with weightlifting, basic algebra with hauling a 
heavy toolbox up and down stairs. All the students are women, and child care is 
offered down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Three nights a week, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has 
conducted a much-praised program designed to introduce women to one of the 
great male bastions of city employment -- the skilled craft positions at the 
DWP. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite good intentions and the expenditure of $400,000, the utility's 
efforts have become a frustrating exercise resulting in very little change: 222 
women have graduated from the Utility Craft Pre-Training Program in the past 
year, but not a single one has been hired. 
</P>
<P>
 As with many government programs to increase the number of women and 
minorities in the work force, numerous obstacles have arisen. They have 
included city hiring rules that give preference to city employees, a fear of 
lawsuits by disgruntled male applicants and a plethora of more experienced men 
competing for the same positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It couldn't be more frustrating," said Carol L. Nageotte, a journey-level 
electrical mechanic at the DWP who is an instructor. "I know it's going to take 
a while to see the fruits of our labor." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 99% of the DWP's skilled craft positions -- such as steam plant assistant 
and toolroom worker -- are held by men, officials said. Other trade jobs have a 
slightly higher female representation. 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity to work for DWP wages, which range from $20,000 to $45,000 for 
entry-level positions, has attracted a variety of students to the experimental 
training program, some coming from as far away as San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Carrillo, a former executive secretary, wants a position that will get 
her out of the office and pay a good wage. Patricia Wright has been unemployed 
for two years and needs to pay her bills and help support her two children. 
</P>
<P>
 For Tina Sultzbaugh, another recent graduate of the classes, the DWP is a 
family affair. Her brother works there and her uncle retired from the utility 
after decades there. She has worked in factories and considers the DWP a stable 
work environment that pays well. 
</P>
<P>
 Basic math, electricity and tool identification are crammed into the six-week 
course. So is hauling a wooden extension ladder around a parking lot and 
climbing the stairs with a toolbox in one hand and a roll of electrical cables 
in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know why molecules pass through copper wire," said Carrillo, a recent 
graduate. "I know what causes a short circuit. I know more physics than I ever 
wanted to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the classroom, the DWP recruitment effort has sparked bitter debate 
from all sides, the same sort of controversy that has surrounded the city's 
affirmative action efforts for female police officers and firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring of women police officers is further along than the DWP's efforts, 
largely because the city is under a federal consent degree that enables it to 
select women who score lower than some men on the police eligibility test. 
</P>
<P>
 The police force is now about 14% women -- up from 2% a decade ago. City 
Council members say their goal is to reach 43%, the same ratio as women in the 
area work force, but city bureaucrats say that is unlikely to occur soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department has gone from no women firefighters in 1980 to about 40 
today. Still, women represent only 1% of the work force. The city is working to 
increase that figure through recruitment efforts and a 10-week exercise program 
in which female candidates are paid to prepare for their biggest hurdle in the 
process -- the physical abilities test. 
</P>
<P>
 At the DWP, some male job-seekers complain that they are being excluded from 
the training classes, and organizers plan to open them up to both sexes 
eventually. Employee unions have objected to some aspects of the program as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Some longtime employees resent it too, saying they fear that under-qualified 
women will be hired into the trenches, where they say high voltage and 
dangerous equipment are commonplace and one wrong move can have deadly 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the women graduates are disgruntled. A group complained last month that 
the city refused to allow them to take all the job exams they were promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Phyllis Lynes, a city personnel manager, acknowledges that some of the city's 
actions have proven controversial. "We wanted so much to make a difference that 
we might have gone too far in what we were proposing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The department tried to help women by altering the Civil Service rules for the 
exam to become an electrical mechanical trainee. Women fill just two of 186 
such slots, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 First, DWP officials wanted the certificate from the training course to be 
deemed adequate preparation to take the test -- instead of the traditional 
experience in the field. Then, even more controversial, they wanted to select 
top women candidates from the city's eligibility list, which is based on test 
scores, before moving on to the men. 
</P>
<P>
 A host of groups -- from labor unions to employee associations representing 
ethnic minorities -- cried foul and the department backed off on the second 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Another plan to create a special job classification for entry-level women, 
called a craft trainee, has met with similar protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a horrendous record of women in the trades," said Brian D'Arcy, 
business manager for Local 18 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers. "But instead of doing any preliminary work, they just wanted to force 
women onto the work force. It's a very delicate issue for the employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Another controversy developed last month when the most recent graduates of the 
certificate program were told that they could not take the test scheduled for 
Jan. 8 to become warehouse and toolroom workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that was one of the tests participants had been told they would 
qualify for, the city Personnel Department altered the test requirements so 
that only city employees could qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynes explained that there are only a handful of openings for warehouse and 
toolroom workers this year and plenty of applicants applied from within the 
city, including 60 women. 
</P>
<P>
 Some graduates say the city betrayed them after they invested so much time in 
the class. Led by Carrillo, they have been urging city officials to open up the 
exam. 
</P>
<P>
 The women won a delay in the test and council members directed city personnel 
officials to find a way for the women to compete for positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when that question is settled, DWP officials expect the controversies to 
continue as they attempt to bring gender balance to this entrenched male 
terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Davis, DWP human resources director, said the program, which has received 
honors from outside groups, will only succeed if it is allowed to work over 
time. "It's not an immediate program," she said. "It will take a long, long 
time to change the work force."

L.A. SCENE / THE CITY THEN AND NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CECILIA RASMUSSEN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been called a lot of things over its long life: the Ribbon Highway, 
California 26, Ramona Boulevard, and finally the San Bernardino Freeway and 
"I-Ten." 
</P>
<P>
 But for at least 30 years, travelers have called it a pain in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Bernardino Freeway began more than 100 years ago as a 
three-quarter-mile-long dirt road with railroad tracks running down the middle. 
All of it cut through a 500-acre development called Ramona Acres, which is now 
Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona Acres was the brainchild of James de Barth Shorb, a pioneer who also 
founded the city of Alhambra. By 1887, 215 families had bought lots from Shorb 
in what he advertised as a "fog- and frost-free" neighborhood, with its own 
railroad station, lumberyard, post office and, of course, real estate office. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorb had named the town after one of his young and willful daughters, Ramona, 
who would become more famous for inspiring a novel than a subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Helen Hunt Jackson, researching a book on Southern California, was 
visiting the Shorbs one day when little Ramona burst into the room to glimpse 
the famous author. Rather than being dismayed by Ramona's abrupt manners, 
Jackson instantly adored the spirited child and decided to name her next 
heroine Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's "Ramona" became a novel about a romance between a half-Mexican girl 
and a Cahuilla Indian youth. It was adapted into a play that is still staged 
each summer by locals in the hills outside Hemet. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several version of how the name "Ramona" came to adorn the novel. 
The character was said to be a composite of several women Jackson had met, one 
of them a basket-maker named Ramona Lubo. And little Ramona Shorb's own 
grandmother was a California native named Maria Ramona Yorba Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 As the town of Ramona grew, so did surrounding cities, and by 1916 Ramona 
residents decided it was time to stop Alhambra, South Pasadena and Pasadena 
from dumping their sewage in Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
 The citizenry found their town had developed an image problem: It smelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsfolk decided a more verdant-sounding appellation would help give the town 
a fresh start. When Ramona was incorporated in 1916, it renamed itself Monterey 
Park after the nearby Monterey Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea seemed to work. In 1931, the original three-quarter-mile Ramona 
Boulevard had grown to match the city. It became several miles of paved 
two-lane road, lined with a drugstore, a bakery and a Piggly Wiggly grocery 
store. The state was so impressed that it christened Ramona Boulevard as 
California 26, the first thoroughfare in the county to be declared a state 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1935, in the midst of the Depression, Ramona was linked to Garvey Avenue 
and California 26 became a four-lane marvel, a state-of-the-art, technically 
perfect 30-mile scenic highway that snaked through the rolling hills of the San 
Gabriel Valley, linking the booming citrus industry of Pomona to the Downtown 
Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1939, even that kind of road was not enough for the freewheeling suburbs of 
Southern California. Legislation authorized a new kind of highway, with no 
intersections and no right of access from adjacent property. No one even knew 
what to call these super-roads; "stopless motorway" was one cumbersome 
suggestion. In 1940, the first was christened the Arroyo Seco Parkway -- now 
the Pasadena Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 As the postwar population explosion and new suburban neighborhoods overtook 
the orange groves, "Ramona Highway" was promoted to freeway status. 
</P>
<P>
 But traffic only got worse, and in 1949 at Aliso Street in Downtown Los 
Angeles, the state Transportation Department began constructing the western end 
of a new six-lane Ramona Freeway. It would parallel the old road, which the 
city had outgrown. 
</P>
<P>
 As construction crews moved east into the San Gabriel Valley, residents began 
to complain. Property owner Charles Hassheider, unconvinced that these new 
freeways would make driving easier, told The Times: "It would take a road pilot 
to direct motorists how to get to West Covina or Covina from this freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 In the eight years it took to build, the freeway's name was changed. In 1954, 
state officials abandoned Ramona Freeway for San Bernardino Freeway. They 
thought naming the freeway after its destination made more sense than naming it 
for a fictional character. At one point, locals were calling it the "Ribbon 
Freeway" because of the ribbon-cutting ceremonies held by each city it passed 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1958, it was done -- the second freeway to be completed in Los Angeles 
County (the Hollywood was begun earlier but finished third). It was four miles 
long and cost $28 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the San Bernardino Freeway, which began as dirt lanes the width of a 
wagon with a railroad track down the middle, has grown to eight lanes of car 
and truck traffic plus two lanes of busway; it still has a train track down the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
 It rumbles day and night. The noise could awaken the spirit of Ramona herself.

STREET SMART: BEACH BLVD. SEGMENT WILL BE RE-STRIPED -- ONE OF THESE DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Do you know if there are any plans to improve the lane markings along Beach 
Boulevard between Imperial Highway and Whittier Boulevard in La Habra? The 
boulevard is marked for two lanes in each direction, but the right lane is so 
wide that drivers treat it as if it were two and sometimes three lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is very confusing and dangerous. You never know when someone will go ahead 
and decide there is enough room to pass you on the right. I have almost been 
hit twice preparing to make a right turn from the right lane as someone speeds 
by between my car and the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Murray, La Habra 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans agrees that Beach Boulevard needs to be re-striped in the area you 
mention and has submitted a proposal to re-stripe the boulevard from two to 
three lanes between Imperial Highway and Whittier Boulevard, said Caltrans 
spokeswoman Rose Orem. 
</P>
<P>
 This does not mean the project will happen overnight. Once it is funded, the 
earliest the work might begin is early 1995, Orem said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past several years, I have noticed that all sizes of trucks 
(including 18 wheelers) use the No. 2 lane (second from the left) on a 
four-lane freeway. Under the California Vehicle Code, are trucks of any size 
(other than pickup trucks) allowed to drive in the No. 2 lane of a four-lane 
freeway? What size trucks are allowed in the No. 1 and 2 lanes? 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Quong, Orange 
</P>
<P>
 You are right about large trucks being restricted to slower lanes of freeway 
traffic, said Officer Steve Kohler of the California Highway Patrol in 
Sacramento. And the CHP issues thousands of citations a year to truckers who 
violate the rule about this. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Vehicle Code states that any truck or tractor with three or 
more axles, or any truck or tractor pulling another vehicle, is restricted to 
the right two lanes (the No. 3 and 4 lanes). 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller trucks, like UPS delivery trucks and U-Haul moving vans, can travel in 
any lane, Kohler said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the CHP issued 12,662 citations to drivers of large trucks for 
driving in the faster lanes, Kohler said. And in the first six months of 1993, 
5,804 drivers were cited. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I own a small pickup truck which is equipped with only two seat belts. You had 
mentioned that riding in the bed of the truck is now illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 How are parents with just a pickup and a child able to go anywhere without 
breaking the law? 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Sweeney, Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 There is no quick fix to your predicament. This month in California it became 
illegal for anyone, regardless of age, to ride in the bed, or rear cargo area, 
of an open pickup truck. Drivers and passengers alike can be cited for 
violating this law. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are cracking down hard on this one because there's no denying how 
unsafe it is to ride in the bed of a pickup truck. CHP Commissioner Maury 
Hannigan reported last month that 86 people were fatally injured while riding 
in the beds of pickup trucks in 1991 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the only way 
now to legally carry passengers in a truck bed is to retrofit the truck with 
seats and seat belts that meet federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is easier said than done, because those written standards don't 
exist. It is further complicated because the CHP, which is responsible for 
enforcing this new law, is not in the position to decide whether retrofitted 
truck beds meet federal standards, said Steve Kohler of the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers may ride in a truck bed without benefit of a seat or seat belt if 
the truck has a camper shell over the truck bed, said Kohler said. No law 
prohibits passengers from riding in this manner and there would be no citation 
for riding without a seat belt. The caveat here, however, is that neither the 
CHP nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration consider it safe to 
travel unbelted, even if a camper shell provides some overhead protection.

MAN DIES TRYING TO BLOCK TRUCK TOWING HIS CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 27-year-old man who tried to keep his car from being towed died Saturday of 
injuries he suffered when the tow truck ran over him, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Morales Lopez of Orange died of internal injuries at UCI Medical Center 
in Orange, said Lt. Robert Gustafson. 
</P>
<P>
 The tow truck driver, Russell Welch, 34, was not cited, police said. An 
investigation is continuing into the accident, which occurred at 8:30 p.m. at 
the Orange Eastridge Apartments, 121 E. Trenton Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustafson said Lopez, who lived at the apartment complex, apparently parked 
his car on a private lot without the required parking sticker provided by the 
apartment managers. As his car was being towed, Lopez got into a shoving match 
with the driver towing his car, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after his car was hitched onto the tow truck, which drove slowly down the 
street, Lopez ran alongside the truck and threw punches at the driver, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, "the victim was knocked to the ground and ran over by the tow 
vehicle," Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Few neighbors in this 24-unit complex saw the confrontation. Relatives and 
friends who shared the apartment with the victim declined to discuss the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the manager of the apartment, Sebastian Pulido, Orange Eastridge 
has a contract with Tows R Russ of Orange to tow cars illegally parked in the 
lot, which is in the back of the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The towing company has a security officer who periodically patrols the lot, 
Pulido said. 
</P>
<P>
 The security guard apparently requested that Lopez's car be towed, Pulido 
added.

DRY DAYS BRING UNEASE; WITH WINTER RAINFALL WELL BELOW AVERAGE, DROUGHT FEARS 
EMERGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Prado Dam Basin is practically bone dry. The Santa Ana River is trickling 
at just half its normal flow. And coastal and mountain regions everywhere are 
experiencing rain and snowfall significantly below normal precipitation for 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which has raised the specter among water experts in Orange County and 
throughout the state of a new drought that could be ushered in by an extremely 
dry 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned," said Jay Malinowski, a spokesman for the Metropolitan 
Water District, which imports water from Northern California and the Colorado 
River to supply about half the needs of Southern Californians. Should current 
trends continue, he said, water shortages can be expected this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this weather holds up through the end of February," he said, "we will be 
very alarmed." 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice Roos, chief hydrologist for the California Department of Water 
Resources, is also keeping an eye on the weather. "I would characterize the 
situation by saying that we're slipping into what looks like a dry year," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their concern is prompted by the numbers, which show that statewide rainfall 
to date is only about 60% of what falls by this time in an average year, 
measured from July 1 through June 30. In addition, experts say, the amount of 
snow in the mountains -- important because it melts in the spring to become 
part of the water supply -- is only about 40% of average. 
</P>
<P>
 These figures are especially dramatic when compared to last year, when 
rainfall was 155% of average and snowfall about 170%. That was the year that 
marked the end of a major, six-year drought during which Californians saw such 
drastic conservation measures as water rationing, heavy fines for overuse and 
laws against watering lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County the current dry season is evidenced in some very visible 
ways. Prado Dam Basin, which supplies about 75% of the county's water, is 
almost dry at a time when it should be looking like a lake. The flow of water 
in the Santa Ana River, which feeds into the area from neighboring Riverside 
County, is about 200 cubic feet per second -- roughly half the normal flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our three big water months are December, January and February," said James A. 
Van Haun, executive assistant to the manager of the Orange County Water 
District, which provides water for much of Orange County. "We're at the middle 
of January now and we haven't received any appreciable precipitation since the 
beginning of December." 
</P>
<P>
 And communities all over the county are experiencing dry spells that 
practically make the sagebrush crackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that fact, county residents still jittery from the recent Laguna fire 
should not conclude that the dry weather necessarily translates into increased 
fire hazards, county firefighters say. While lack of rain tends to dry out 
existing underbrush, making it more flammable, it also tends to inhibit the 
growth of new vegetation, which could fuel a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a mixed bag," said Emma Day, a spokeswoman for the Orange County 
Fire Department. "It all goes back to the nature of where we live; basically 
it's a desert." 
</P>
<P>
 To bolster her argument that fires -- which are also affected by such things 
as wind conditions and temperature -- do not necessarily thrive in dry weather, 
Day pointed to recent Orange County statistics. In 1990 -- a drought year -- 
297 Orange County fires consumed about 15,500 acres, she said. The next year, 
one of the driest in memory, 316 fires consumed only about 220 acres. And in 
1993, an extremely wet year, the Laguna fire alone -- the most devastating in 
county history -- destroyed 16,682 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, water officials say, the dry weather and the demands it places on water 
supplies are not to be taken lightly, particularly with water storage levels 
not yet fully recovered from the ravages of the last drought. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Metropolitan Water District, Malinowski said, the projected supply of 
water for Southern California -- assuming average rainfall -- almost exactly 
equals the projected demand. So any shortage of rainfall, he said, will be 
water snatched from the tap. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as if our checkbook zeros out at the end of each month," he said. "You 
wouldn't want to run a household that way and it's no way to manage water." 
</P>
<P>
 Water officials say they still have a long way to go before declaring 1994 a 
drought year, however. Generally speaking, hydrologist Roos said, conditions 
are considered droughtlike only when lack of precipitation makes a given year 
one of the driest 10% on record. In such cases -- usually well after the rainy 
season has ended -- the head of the California Department of Water Resources 
makes a recommendation to the governor, who then acts upon it. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, according to Roos, the department issued a report positing a 
25% to 30% chance that such a recommendation would be made this year. Another 
report is due out early next month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely way behind average," Roos said, "but we're not yet down to 
critical." Drier Season So Far 
</P>
<P>
 Rainfall this season is far below last year's total and also less than the 
yearly average. Totals, in inches, in four Orange County locations between Oct.

'SCHINDLER'S' AUTHOR TOPS LOCAL GROUP'S LIST; BOOKS: UCI PROF. THOMAS KENEALLY 
DRAWS 500 TO JEWISH CENTER, WHERE HE RECEIVES AWARD FOR BRINGING HOLOCAUST 
ATROCITIES TO LIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Australian author Thomas Keneally, feted from one end of the country to the 
other for writing "Schindler's List," told an overflow crowd here Sunday that 
the Holocaust stands as an "overwhelming event" in human history that should 
never be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 A bearded, balding man with a flair for quick one-liners, Keneally enthralled 
the audience of more than 500 people at the Jewish Community Center with tales 
about his native Australia and about the making of the decade-old Holocaust 
book that is now a Steven Spielberg film. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in an emotional moment that capped his appearance and drew a standing 
ovation, Keneally exchanged hugs and kind words with Leopold (Paldek) Page, the 
Beverly Hills Holocaust survivor who inspired him to write the story of Oskar 
Schindler. A Nazi industrialist, Schindler is credited with saving the lives of 
more than 1,200 Jews during World War II by taking them in to work at his 
factories and protecting them. 
</P>
<P>
 The work of Schindler and Page, the author said simply, "makes them giants." 
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa event marked a homecoming of sorts for Keneally, a writing 
professor at UC Irvine since 1991. He had been on leave for a year to do 
political work in Australia, but he has now returned to Orange County to resume 
his place on the faculty, teaching two graduate classes on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the whirlwind of attention that has come his way in recent weeks as a 
result of the Spielberg movie, Keneally has sipped cocktails at a reception 
with the President and First Lady in Washington. He has been toasted by 
Hollywood luminaries and taken part in an awards ceremony presided over by 
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Ginsburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Keneally said he found the reception he received Sunday from Orange 
County's Jewish community "extraordinary," as he was presented with a 
humanitarian award for helping bring to public light the atrocities suffered by 
the Jews during the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter read to the audience, Spielberg wrote that the Jewish community 
leaders "made a very wise choice" in bestowing the honor on Keneally. "Plainly, 
you're a mensch, " the Yiddish term for a good, responsible person, Spielberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the Keneally event had been sold out for weeks, and so many people 
lined up afterward to have the author autograph copies of his book that 
organizers had to block the doorway to allow the author time to attend a 
private reception with event patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Keneally has penned 21 books, but "Schindler's List" was pure happenstance in 
its origin. 
</P>
<P>
 In a story that has been told and retold as the publicity surrounding the 
movie has grown, Keneally and Page recalled Sunday how they met in 1980, when 
the author walked into Page's Beverly Hills leather-goods shop to look for a 
new briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
 When he heard Keneally was an author, Page recounted, he announced that he had 
a story worth telling. He took Keneally to the back of his shop to show him 
assorted documents on Schindler that he kept on file -- "in case a situation 
like this happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Keneally was intrigued by the story, and after only a few discussions with 
other survivors, he said, he was committed to the project. "It was such an 
astounding book," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, he said, remained faithful to the original work. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the time constraints of a movie, Keneally said, "you have to 
coalesce events a little bit, jam them together. But it's absolutely true to 
the spirit of the events." 
</P>
<P>
 Some have criticized the movie for extolling the role of a Nazi in the war, 
suggesting that Schindler acted as much out of financial and personal gain as 
humanitarian motives. But in the eyes of several survivors at Sunday's event, 
Schindler's role in history should remain untarnished. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God the (Schindler) critics are in the tremendous minority," said 
Page's wife, Mila, who polished shell casings for seven months at a Schindler 
factory. "To me and to the majority of the survivors -- the Schindler Jews as 
we call ourselves -- he is a hero."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; HEARINGS TO EXAMINE NOISE, TRAFFIC DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has decided to hold public hearings in response to complaints 
from residents about noise and traffic generated by trucks owned by Barr Lumber 
Co. and Trend Offset Printing. 
</P>
<P>
 Two residents, Lew Petix and Russ Iiams sued Trend Offset Printing and the 
city of Los Alamitos in August, seeking $2.5 million in damages for what they 
contend were disruptions to their lives and the city's failure to enforce city 
code. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit is pending in Orange County Superior Court, according to their 
attorney, R.M. Anthony Cosio. 
</P>
<P>
 About two dozen residents who attended last week's council meeting said that 
it is about time the city solves a problem that has dragged on for years and 
made their lives miserable. 
</P>
<P>
 Beside noise and traffic, some residents have complained about odor and dust 
generated by the two businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been slow in coming, but at least we're making some progress," said 
Andrew N. Leonard, who heads the homeowner association of a six-unit 
condominium complex across from Barr Lumber Co. 
</P>
<P>
 A traffic study conducted by a city consultant in December indicated that 
Trend Offset Printing and Barr Lumber Co., generate a significant amount of the 
truck traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Trend Offset Printing, at Catalina and Cherry streets, which prints TV Guide, 
other magazines and government forms in an eight-building compound, generates 
more than 60% of the truck traffic from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., the study showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr Lumber Co., at Los Alamitos Boulevard and Catalina Street, uses an 
average of 35 trucks a day, according to the study. The rest of the traffic is 
generated by other businesses in the area, which is dotted by single-family 
homes and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Thompson of BSI Inc., the city's consultant, said that using alternative 
routes, limiting truck traffic in the area and posting signs will ease the 
congestion without hurting the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will not eliminate all truck traffic but will keep the businesses viable," 
Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trend Offset Printing Manager Ron Montgomery said that rerouting truck traffic 
"is probably the best alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the residents' complaints, Montgomery said that his company has 
removed a loading dock facing the residential areas, prohibited employees from 
parking on the streets after 5 p.m. and reduced the noise level. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken (the residents') laundry list and spent a lot of time and money 
to meet what's on the list," Montgomery said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; RESIDENTS ORGANIZE TO BLOCK REALIGNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of the upscale Bellehurst area are banding together to fight a City 
Council decision to realign Burlingame Avenue so that it connects with Dale 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 By creating a four-way signalized intersection at Dale, residents say, it will 
add more traffic to the neighborhood, devalue their properties and degrade 
their quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 residents met Thursday night at a nearby school to organize 
opposition to the project. A petition aimed at stopping the project is already 
circulating in the neighborhood, said Burlingame resident Teri Raymondo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've decided that we are definitely united on the issue," Raymondo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents also discussed the possibility of a recall effort of the three 
council members who voted for the realignment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up to them to realize the impact on this street is going to be 
horrendous," Raymondo said. "But we're holding off (on a recall) in hopes they 
will see the light and they will choose to do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymondo said residents are also expected to attend Tuesday's City Council 
meeting -- changed from today because of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday -- 
to voice their opposition once again to the council members. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Jan. 3 meeting, the council voted to approve the Burlingame realignment 
plan, despite stiff opposition from residents at a public hearing in December. 
The project, estimated to cost as much as $9 million, also includes building a 
railroad underpass on Dale Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Other alternatives included realigning Dale with Monticello Avenue, which also 
leads to the residential tract, or leaving it as a T-intersection that ends at 
Malvern Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents also criticized the city's environmental study on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our street is going to become one of the main thoroughfares in and out of the 
area," Raymondo said. "There hasn't been action by the City Council to 
safeguard our area." DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ROSSMOOR; ELECTION TO BE HELD ON WALL MAINTENANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A special election will be held Nov. 8 to determine whether the Rossmoor 
Community Services District should take over the repair and maintenance of the 
Rossmoor perimeter wall, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters will also be asked if they are willing to pay an estimated $15 a year 
for 20 years in additional property taxes to create a fund to pay for the cost 
of maintaining the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 3-2 vote, directors of the Rossmoor Community Services District board 
last week decided to toss the question of the wall to the voters after 
struggling with the issue for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're delighted," said Shirley Bailey, president of the Rossmoor Homeowners 
Assn., which has been asking for the special election. "Our role now is to make 
sure everyone understands what their choices are." 
</P>
<P>
 The dilemma posed by the 37-year-old brick wall is practical and emotional. 
Some residents of the unincorporated community argue that the 1 1/2-mile-long 
wall has historical value and must be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 But since a 100-foot section of it collapsed during an earthquake in 1992, and 
other sections weakened by the quake are in danger of toppling down, the wall 
has also become a safety hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Services District, the county and city officials of Seal Beach 
and Los Alamitos have refused to accept responsibility for maintaining the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
 But after an October survey showed a majority of the residents want to repair 
and maintain the wall, board directors agreed to put the issue on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is sufficient public interest," board director Margrit Kendrick said. 
"We don't know how the (special) election will turn out, but we have to be 
responsive to the feelings in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Sheldon, the district's general manager, said the election would cost 
about $1,000 and will coincide with balloting for two seats on the Community 
Services District's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms of Kendrick and Joyce Bloom, who opposed the special election, will 
expire in November. Both said the fate of the wall is likely to be an election 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloom said it was wrong to spend money on a special election without residents 
mounting a petition drive to qualify a ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, it is ridiculous" to take over the repair and maintenance of 
the wall, Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Jim Alexander also opposed holding the special election. Directors 
John Hunt and Linda Goodrich joined Kendrick in voting for approval. BERT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; FACTORY DENIED MORE TIME TO BUILD WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission last week refused to give a vitamin manufacturer more 
time to build a 22-foot-high wall to keep factory noise from disturbing 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Ng, facility manager of the Viva America Westar plant at 1239 Victoria 
St., asked the commission last week to give him another year to begin 
construction of the wall and a roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors have complained about noise from generators, trucks and outdoor 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a study done by Westar, the factory produces more noise than the 
city's maximum standard of 55 decibels. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission approved a plan for the wall almost a year ago, but Ng said the 
company has discovered a need for design changes and is unprepared to pull 
building permits to begin the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Libby Cowan said she thought a year was too long for 
such an extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Jane Henry, who lives near the factory, asked the commission not to 
grant a one-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
 "The noise is unbearable," she said. "We are suffering, and have been for two 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the commission rejected an application by Rhonda Donahue to 
conduct massage therapy and nutritional counseling at 3001 Red Hill Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue said she would also like to sell nutritional products to people after 
counseling them. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Mark Korando said the business should be in a commercial 
zone of the city, not the industrial site where it is proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue said she will consult with an attorney to decide whether to appeal the 
decision to the City Council. WILLSON CUMMER

 City Councilman James Flora has taken a job as a field representative for 
state Sen. John R. Lewis (R-Orange). 
</P>
<P>
 Flora, 67, will work part time representing Lewis at community events in La 
Habra, Brea, Fullerton and Buena Park and deal with chambers of commerce, 
community organizations, city officials and businesses.He started the new job 
earlier this month, making $400 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired Southern California Edison employee also serves as chairman of the 
county's Local Agency Formation Commission. Flora was appointed to the 
commission in 1988 and has served as chairman since May of last year, when 
Supervisor Don Roth resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairman, Flora presides at LAFCO meetings. LAFCO's members have the power 
to approve the creation of cities or special districts and annexations. He said 
commissioners will be considering consolidating special districts in the coming 
year in an effort to reduce bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm retired, so I have time" to hold two public offices and work for Lewis, 
Flora said. "I want to be involved and devote a lot more time to what I think I 
can do. And there's no conflict at all between the three jobs. . . . I'm glad 
I'm busy." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; NEW DIRECTOR STARTS AT FREE SENIOR CENTER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Laurie Gray-Smith has started work as the new director of the Costa Mesa 
Senior Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith-Gray said one of her priorities will be to help build a $4-million 
endowment for the nonprofit center -- one of only two senior centers in the 
county that are not city-operated. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior center in Orange is also run by a nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith-Gray, a county resident since 1978, most recently worked for more than 
two years as the director of senior programs for the Volunteer Center of 
Greater Orange County. The program places 1,500 seniors in volunteer positions 
at more than 200 agencies around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have 150 of my volunteers here, so I'm still home," Smith-Gray said on her 
first day at the senior center. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith-Gray said the center has a $450,000 yearly operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The center gets 45% of its annual budget from the city and is working toward 
becoming financially independent from the city within four years, said Susan 
McLoughlin, the former director. 
</P>
<P>
 McLoughlin said she resigned to spend more time with her child and husband and 
will stay on for a few weeks to help the new director. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith-Gray said she had a lot of fund-raising experience while working as 
director of the Assessment and Treatment Services Center, a Santa Ana Heights 
counseling center for juveniles. She was director for four years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 seniors use the center each day, Smith-Gray said. She said about 
16,000 seniors live in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The free senior center, which offers a variety of programs and classes, is 
open to people age 50 and older. It is at 695 W. 19th St. WILLSON CUMMER

<P>
 Short of land and locations for parks and sports facilities, the city approved 
an agreement last week to work with the Saddleback Valley Unified School 
District on improving recreational and cultural amenities for the city's 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 At their respective meetings last Tuesday, the City Council and the district's 
Board of Trustees approved a resolution pledging mutual cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution states that both entities recognize that "there is a shortage 
of land available to provide recreational and other cultural opportunities for 
district students and residents of Laguna Hills" and that the city and district 
desire to maximize those opportunities "through more efficient use of available 
space."

 The city, which fits inside the 93-square-mile school district's boundaries, 
recently began construction on Cabot Park in the Nellie Gail Ranch subdivision. 
The new park will give residents of the 2-year-old city their first baseball 
and soccer fields. RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; SCHOOL TRUSTEES OK $180,000 IN CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustees for the Orange Unified School District have agreed to cut expenses 
for administrators and supervisors in an attempt to partially close a $480,000 
shortfall in its $107-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 7 to 0 Thursday night to OK nearly a dozen measures that will 
save the district an estimated $180,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The board approved ending cellular phone use and car mileage allowances for 
three administrators, maintaining freezes on three vacant leadership positions 
and reducing the budgets for recruitment and community relations. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with the cuts, the board still must slash an additional $300,000 from 
its budget to balance its ledger for 1993-94. The board is scheduled to 
consider on Jan. 27 eliminating up to 35 jobs in the classified department, 
which, if passed, would balance the district's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 However, at Thursday's meeting, the trustees postponed a vote on a proposal 
that would have either reduced their monthly stipends by 10% or cut their 
health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members now receive a monthly stipend of $380 plus a $450 health 
insurance package, which covers dependents. 
</P>
<P>
 An ad hoc committee composed of three board members will study the proposal 
and make a recommendation to the whole board at its meeting next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here for the money," said board member Max Reissmueller. "But I do 
say if we are to have competent people behind the mikes, we need reasonable 
compensation." MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; COUNCIL OKS TRAFFIC CONTROL MEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to residents' complaints, the City Council has approved traffic 
control measures for two of South County's busiest thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1, with Joel T. Lautenschleger dissenting, to put a 
traffic signal at the intersection of Alicia Parkway and Ramona Street. Council 
members were unanimous, however, in approving left turns into and out of Louisa 
Street at Moulton Parkway and taking other traffic-control measures in the 
subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that Lomas Laguna is somewhat landlocked, and in my opinion a 
traffic signal is something we should look at," Councilwoman Melody Carruth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff had recommended against installing the new traffic signal. 
</P>
<P>
 City Traffic Engineer Kenneth H. Rosenfield said a signal was not warranted by 
current traffic levels or the number of accidents at the Alicia and Ramona 
intersection. He said city employees could monitor the intersection and 
recommend a signal, if needed, at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Lautenschleger agreed with Rosenfield, saying more study should be 
done. 
</P>
<P>
 But speakers representing about 40 residents at the meeting said the signal 
was needed immediately to allow them access to the Aliso/Wood Canyons Regional 
Park and a trail across Alicia and to protect them as they make left turns into 
and out of Ramona at Alicia. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, children and other pedestrians, horseback riders and motorists at 
the intersection must negotiate Alicia's increasingly busy six lanes, where 
cars travel over 55 m.p.h. The intersection is about a quarter-mile from the 
nearest signal at Alicia and Moulton. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield estimated the cost of traffic signals for the intersection at 
$90,000 and said they could be installed in six months to a year. The city 
plans to negotiate with the county Harbor, Beaches and Parks department for the 
necessary funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's approval for the left-turn access at Louisa and Moulton, which 
will be reviewed after a year, will enable Lomas Laguna residents to avoid 
using other side streets and making U-turns to drive into their subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the council, Rosenfield said that installing signs and striping 
for the left-turn access at Louisa and Moulton and the streets inside the Lomas 
Laguna development will cost about $2,500 and can be completed in about three 
weeks. RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; YOUTHS WIN FUTURE CITY COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The year is 2195. The city is Ancona. There is no pollution, no crime, no 
traffic jams. The futuristic city is efficient, practical and the ideal place 
in which its creators would want to live. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Ancona's founders, Jeff Carroll, an eighth-grader at Bernardo Yorba 
Junior High School in Yorba Linda, said his idealistic city "eliminates the 
problems we have now." 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll and classmates Cory Jobst and Jacob Smith, who spent nearly 100 hours 
creating their vision of the perfect city of tomorrow, won the top award 
Saturday in the National Engineers Week Future City competition at the Buena 
Park Hotel and Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The finals in the contest, sponsored by Rockwell International and nationwide 
engineer societies, took place among seven schools that had earned top scores 
during preliminary judging on Friday. Seventh- and eighth-grade students from 
27 schools in Orange and Los Angeles counties participated. 
</P>
<P>
 The three finalists from Bernardo Yorba Junior High School will be going to 
Washington to participate in the national finals during National Engineers 
Week, Feb. 20 to 26. The national championship team wins a trip to the U.S. 
Space Camp in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really an honor. We put in a lot of man-hours into this project," said 
Carroll, who is interested in pursuing a career in computer science. "We 
learned how to cooperate as a group -- and it gave us a little window of what 
the future might hold." 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly 80 students who participated used their wildest imaginations to 
conjure up their perception of a perfect world. The assignment was to build a 
complete city with transportation, housing, energy, police and commerce. The 
various cities had stadiums, retirement homes, seaports, airports, satellites, 
recycling plants, even an animal reserve for endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest is designed to excite youngsters about math and science, said B.J. 
May, manager of corporate and community relations for Rockwell International. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets them involved in a hands-on, fun activity that lets them better 
understand how engineering benefits society," May said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students, in teams of three, envisioned such cities as Utopia, the city of 
perfection, N.E.P.T.U.N.E. -- New Energy producing Prototype for Transportation 
Unifying the Natural Environment -- and Western Lake City, where nature's 
beauty still exists in the year 3237. 
</P>
<P>
 These places of another time have clean environments, no unemployment, 
transportation systems that are pollution-free, underwater agricultural systems 
and energy that is electric or solar. 
</P>
<P>
 Vibrant, dull and subdued colors expressed moods of the 3-D scale-model 
cities, and different materials and textures, including wooden blocks, foam, 
paper plates and plastic materials, were used to visualize their 
computer-generated blueprints. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of eighth-grade students from South Junior High School in Anaheim was 
among finalists with their city of Cheven. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Zuniga, Cheryl McClusky and Tom Orosco built their model city with 
features such as a fusion nuclear power plant -- emitting no nuclear waste -- 
earthquake-proof buildings and "magnetic levitation elevated transport tubes 
that offer rapid, quiet and pollution-free passenger mobility." 
</P>
<P>
 "The future is in our hands," McClusky said. "If everyone has good ideas 
toward the environment, then everything will be OK, because the future is what 
we make of it." DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; DALAT CITY REUNION 'LIKE COMING HOME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The memories came in a flood for Anh Nguyen as she watched young girls in ao 
dai, the traditional long Vietnamese dress, parade on stage during a fashion 
show at the Westminster Cultural Center on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnamese dancers and singers also performed during the two-hour cultural 
show, capping the festivities as more than 1,000 local Vietnamese residents who 
had lived in Dalat City in Vietnam gathered for the first time since leaving 
their country more than 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like coming home," said Nguyen, a Westminster resident who helped 
organize the event. "It was an occasion for people who have not seen each other 
for a long time to meet and talk about old times." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen said that Dalat City, about 200 miles north of Saigon, is a resort in 
the highlands famous for its cool mountain climate, lakes, waterfalls, pine 
trees and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a major tourist attraction and the site of some of Vietnam's best 
schools before the Communist government took over in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the generals from the former Vietnamese army studied at the military 
academy in the city, said Thach Nguyen, Anh Nguyen's husband, who went to a 
French high school there. 
</P>
<P>
 Thach Nguyen said Dalat City was spared from heavy damage during the Vietnam 
War, but many of the schools have now closed, the city is in general disrepair 
and tourism is practically dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government now owns most of the hotels and buildings," said Anh Dung, who 
left Dalat City for the United States two years ago. "The businessmen who run 
the city's tourist industry have all left." 
</P>
<P>
 Thac Nguyen said he hopes the gathering of former Dalat City residents will 
lead to future efforts to help the city, particularly in reviving tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday, people were thinking more about Dalat City's past, not its future. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the songs, dances and a fashion show, people tried to remember what it 
was like when the city was considered one of the most beautiful in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer David Do of Irvine performed a haunting song about a man leaving his 
lover in Dalat City. 
</P>
<P>
 Do said the city is like a lover that one has left behind and hopes to come 
back to someday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really loved that city," Do said, who had studied at the National College 
of Agriculture in Dalat City. "I thought I would live there forever." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very romantic place," said Marianne Tam Young Young, 54, who went to 
a high school run by Catholic nuns in the 1950s. "I have fond memories of the 
city and hopes to go back there someday." BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; 2 NAMES ADDED TO SADDLEBACK SEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saddleback Community College District trustees have added two candidates to 
their search for a new chancellor after two previous prospects removed 
themselves from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald L. Singer, president of San Bernardino Valley College, and Larry L. 
Stanley, president of College of the Mainland in Texas City, Tex., were 
interviewed last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer, who has also served as president of Crafton Hills College in the San 
Bernardino Community College District, holds doctorate of philosophy, master of 
science and bachelor of arts degrees from USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley was named College of the Mainland president after serving as chairman 
of the school's arts and humanities department and its division of fine arts. 
He holds a master of arts degree from Sam Houston State University and a 
bachelor of science degree from Baylor University. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees in December interviewed four finalists: Clarence W. Mangham, 
administrator of facilities planning and credentials for California Community 
Colleges in Sacramento; Theodore Tilton, provost of the central campus of the 
College of DuPage in Glen Ellyn, Ill.; Jerry W. Young, superintendent / 
president of Chaffey Community College in Rancho Cucamonga; and Dianne G. Van 
Hook, superintendent / president of Santa Clarita Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hook recently withdrew her name from consideration, as did another unnamed 
candidate before being interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although trustees previously said they hoped to name their selection before 
the holidays, they have given no new target date since broadening their search. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna L. McFarlin, Irvine Valley College president, has been serving as interim 
chancellor since Aug. 31, when Chancellor Richard Sneed retired.

SAN CLEMENTE FIRE LEAVES 34 HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire gutted two apartments and damaged another Sunday afternoon, leaving 34 
people homeless, officials said. Nobody was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire began at about 1:10 p.m. Sunday in the 100 block of 
Escalones.Witnesses said it started on a ground-floor apartment, traveled to a 
second-floor apartment and swept to another building, Acting Fire Capt. Mike 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators were searching for clues that the blaze may have been triggered 
by arson, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three San Clemente fire engines, one Orange County fire engine and one county 
firetruck responded to the blaze, which took 24 minutes to extinguish. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Iannaccone, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross, said the agency was 
providing food and shelter at a local motel for 14 adults and 20 children. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said there were eight people living in one apartment and nine in 
another, but said he could not account for where all 34 people were living.

SERVICE IN COMPUTER AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 12-year-old with a computer, modem, the right telephone number and mom's 
charge card can book round-trip tickets for two to Aruba in minutes without 
calling a travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
 But the home computer and on-line services like Compuserve or Prodigy haven't 
replaced travel agents.If the future is in interactive television, travel 
agents say they'll need to focus even more on providing a service that 
travelers want and trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to provide some level of service they can't get from a wired box," 
Travis Tanner, president of Carlson Travel Network, one of the country's 
largest agency chains, said in a recent speech to travel executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's a travel channel that allows viewers to call up video of a 
potential vacation spot and make reservations, or an on-screen chat with the 
travel agent, the industry is hoping to use the technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same kind of thing happened when (computerized reservation systems) came 
in. People said (travelers) are going to bypass us, but it made us grow," said 
Earlene Causey, head of the American Society of Travel Agents and owner of VIP 
Travel Agency of Baytown, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 The big chains are probably in the best position to exploit the new 
technology. Smaller agencies such as Causey's need to pull together into groups 
that can make their services available on interactive systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe 10 years from now, there will be less brick and mortar and we'll join 
with clients on interactive television," she said.

O.C. ENTERPRISE / ANNE MICHAUD: PET OWNERS DO GROOMING AT JOY SELF DOG WASH; AT 
'SHAMPOOCH' IN ORANGE, THE CUSTOMER PROVIDES THE ANIMAL AND THE BUSINESS 
PROVIDES THE SOAP, TOWELS AND TUBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fistfuls of hair in the drain pipes, a dirty tub, a bathroom that looks as if 
it was wetted down with a hose. Such are the pleasures of bathing a dog or cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared with that scene, Joy Self Dog Wash is what its name promises, said 
co-owner Benjamin Park -- a joy. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop offers soap and towels, brushes and protective aprons, eight clean 
tubs and short leashes to hook the pet's collar and keep Fido or Muffy in 
place. There are ramps to lead heavy dogs into tubs too. 
</P>
<P>
 Pet owners can stop by and give their pet a wash for $6.99 for a cat or small 
dog to $12.99 for an extra-large dog. Anti-flea soap or powder costs extra. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, who opened his Orange shop in November with partner Peter Kim, said 
customers include the Orange Police Department and lots of parents with their 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice for families," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Park and Kim said they believe theirs is Orange County's first self pet wash 
-- sometimes called "shampooches." There are at least three in Los Angeles 
County, and the number is growing, according to industry watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Petlist, a Brooklyn, N.Y., company that supplies tubs and grooming tables, has 
outfitted about a dozen self pet washes around the nation, and it has orders 
for seven more. Petlist's controller Andrea Roach said at least three large pet 
supply companies are also planning to launch their own chains. 
</P>
<P>
 Roach said her company's sales were up 20% last year because of the volume 
orders. The self-wash shops generally use three to eight tubs, versus one or 
two tubs used by professional groomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pet groomers charge $22 or more to bathe and comb a dog or cat. The self 
washes offer a less expensive alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Roach said she doesn't believe groomers will suffer from the competition, 
though. They clip nails and clean ears during a bath session, which many 
amateurs cannot do. 
</P>
<P>
 Groom & Board magazine agrees. In a May, 1991, article, the magazine said that 
self washes seem to attract customers who would normally bathe pets at home, 
instead of luring people away from professional groomers. 
</P>
<P>
 The self washes "tend to do well in middle-class and upper-middle-class 
neighborhoods, rather than elite areas," said Karen Long MacLeod, editor of the 
Chicago-based trade publication. "The elite tend to go to a groomer for 
bathing." 
</P>
<P>
 The do-it-yourself washes have thrived in urban areas, MacLeod said. They are 
in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The volume of dogs (in metropolitan areas) would support it," said MacLeod. 
Also, "clearly, if you're keeping your dog inside, you'll want to bathe him 
more often." 
</P>
<P>
 Self washes may have grown up in urban areas, but they were born in the middle 
of California farm country in Carmichael in 1989. It was a combination 
professional grooming salon and do-it-yourself wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Many shops combine the services, MacLeod said. Do-it-yourself shops sometimes 
have a groomer on hand to do the work that requires some skill, such as fur 
clipping. Groomers can also suggest products to relieve skin and coat problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange, Park and his two employees are equipped more with affection for 
animals than with any professional grooming talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Park closed a 12-year-old landscaping business, Evergreen Landscaping, last 
January because, at 55, his shoulders were too stiff for the work. He is a 
native of Korea who moved to Orange 15 years ago so that his four sons could 
receive an education in the United States, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the sons are adults -- the youngest is in law school. So, Park said, he 
does not need as much money as he once did, and he decided to enter a field of 
work simply for the love of it. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Kim, who are friends from church, visited self washes in Burbank and 
Culver City before they opened their shop Nov. 21. They established it near a 
strip of pet supply stores, one of which Kim owns, on Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Park said 37 pets, on average, bathe at Joy each week. He is hoping for a good 
crop of fleas this spring, which he figures will push that number up to 50 by 
the summer.

ANNE TSUI: PROFESSOR, UCI GRADUATE SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Christian, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anne Tsui, a professor in the UCI Graduate School of Management, studies the 
way people interact at the office -- supervisors and subordinates, whites and 
racial minorities, men and women, old and young. In recent research, Tsui 
discovered that today's emphasis on promoting women and minorities has 
alienated another group of people -- white men, who express difficulty in 
adjusting to a diverse workplace. Older people, she says, feel they have been 
left out altogether. Tsui, 45, chats with Times staff writer Susan Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A common assumption might be that minorities experience the greatest level 
of discomfort in a workplace where most of the employees are white. But your 
study says white men, even if in the majority, have a tougher time working with 
minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
 A: That may seem surprising at first glance. But during the early integration 
of schools and neighborhoods, we found that the opposition came largely from 
the dominant groups. Whites did not like non-whites sharing their neighborhoods 
and classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Minority individuals sort of take it for granted that that they are different 
in our society, and over time they have learned to accept it. Perhaps 
minorities have built a greater level of tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So minorities are more accustomed to interacting with people of other 
races? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. Furthermore, looking again at integration, being able to move to a 
white neighborhood in some ways is a symbol to minorities that they have 
succeeded. The same is true at the workplace -- minorities' presence in a 
predominantly white population generally means they are better off than if they 
were in an all-minority environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the same can be said regarding women. Historically, women working at 
predominantly female companies -- in the service industry, for example -- have 
lower-paying jobs. So when a woman works for an organization that is 
predominantly male, she generally has a higher level occupation. That suggests 
greater satisfaction with her job. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did your study show whether white men are more comfortable with minority 
men or with women at the workplace? In other words, which is the bigger 
discomfort factor -- race or gender? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Gender. Men like being with other men. They have their own culture -- they 
know how to talk to each other, they know how to behave with each other. When a 
female enters their work group, it creates a whole new dynamic, it inhibits 
their camaraderie. So, of course, they feel less comfortable. We all like to be 
ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your study implies that while many companies today are focusing on creating 
an environment sensitive to the concerns of minorities and women, that white 
men are being neglected. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Exactly. Many major companies have programs and projects intended to 
advance the careers of women and minorities. Understandably, the white male is 
wondering, what about me? Jobs and promotions are a scarce resource. The more 
attention that is given to women and minorities, the more fear there is among 
white men that they are not getting equal access to high-level positions.  
</P>
<P>
 Our research suggests that in an effort to remedy past practices that 
disadvantaged women and minorities, we should not ignore the reaction of the 
majority. The sense among white men that they are being neglected is neither 
right or wrong -- these are legitimate, real feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Yet to some degree, don't companies have to sacrifice some of the interests 
of the majority to further the rights of the minority? If it were left to white 
male supervisors to do the hiring, wouldn't they tend to hire the people they 
feel most comfortable with -- more white males? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's a natural human tendency to be attracted to those with whom you are 
similar -- whether in race, age, sex, educational level, religion. That 
tendency affects the way we make choices in terms of whom we like to work with. 
So, yes, a diverse workplace is something that companies have to impose upon 
men.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: You mention age. Should age be included more frequently in the diversity 
discussion? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The diversity issue goes well beyond race and gender. People react first 
and foremost to observable differences, and age obviously is an observable 
difference.  
</P>
<P>
 We did a study where we asked supervisors to rate their subordinates. We 
wanted to see if race, gender and age affected the supervisors' judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 Older subordinates underneath young supervisors fared the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 There could be a number of factors involved. Perhaps in some cases the 
subordinate thinks, "I'm older, I'm more experienced" -- and has resentment, so 
doesn't go the extra mile. Still, clearly there is an age bias. 
</P>
<P>
 This issue is particularly important because of the aging baby boom 
generation. We'll soon have a high proportion of older workers. That's going to 
set up a whole different dynamic at the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How can companies promote a better understanding among employees in a 
diverse workplace? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Through seminars, programs, management training courses, reading materials. 
Some companies have special celebrations of ethnic holidays and family days. 
All those things can be very useful in getting people from different 
backgrounds to talk to each other and to appreciate differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, companies need to do a better job of explaining the qualifications 
necessary for a position so that employees don't make up their own beliefs. 
Often, the white man's reaction is, "She was picked because she is a woman and 
a minority." That's not fair to either person. It's easier to deal with getting 
passed over for a promotion if you understand that the competitor is at least 
as qualified as you. People do not always judge their success by promotions and 
high salaries. They just want equal opportunity. If the decision process is 
fair, people will accept the outcome. The issue of diversity is simply an issue 
of how people treat each other. 
</P>
<P>
 On how employers should deal with the concerns of white men. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's productive for companies to say, 'White males, you 
shouldn't complain because you've had it good for so many years.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On the adaptability of minorities in the workplace. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Minorities have learned to cope with being different in the working world, 
but white men haven't had much experience in that regard." 
</P>
<P>
 On age bias. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Older people are a valuable asset to a company. Certainly, young people are 
the source of new ideas. But older people have experience and knowledge of the 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 On her own experience as a minority and as a woman. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to make others feel comfortable with me. The responsibility should not 
always be on the other side to adapt -- we should help each other."

 Analyst review: "Imperial Credit is a good little company and very well 
positioned. It has added a higher margin business to keep revenues up after the 
drop in refinancings. The stock remains inexpensive on both a reported and 
value added earnings basis. Our price target over the next 12 months remains 
$20. During third quarter 1993, the company originated $1.8 billion vs. $800 
million last year, an increase of 225% . We expect originations to remain 
strong during the remainder of the year. The servicing portfolio, however, grew 
to only $2.9 billion vs. $2.3 billion last year, an increase of only 26%. The 
much slower growth in the portfolio is due to the company's high level of 
servicing rights sales." -- Steven Eisman, analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., New York

enjoy coaching during matches because it involves the whole picture . . . not 
just grooving a single tennis stroke."  
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs down: "If you love tennis, there's not much to dislike about this job. 
If it rains, you don't work. Unfortunately, all those hours on the tennis court 
take a large physical and mental toll."  
</P>
<P>
 Advice: "The best instructors have a basic love of the game. It feels good 
when I see student improvement because of lessons. The best instructors are 
always improving their own game and learning new teaching methods." 
</P>
<P>
 Salary range: Paid by commission. An average full-time instructor can earn 
$15,000 to $45,000. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Educational and training requirements: Extensive experience and certification 
in match play, lessons and rules of the game. The United States Professional 
Tennis Assn. provides education, teaching standards and instructor 
certification. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected demand: The tennis business seems to follow the economy. As the 
economy picks up, so does the demand for tennis lessons. As long as tennis 
tournaments are on television, people will want to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Major employers: Tennis clubs, resorts, city- or county-run recreational 
facilities and some fitness centers.

ENFANT TERRIBLE; NEW YORKERS CAN'T DECIDE IF THE MAYOR'S SON IS A CUTE SIDEKICK 
OR A SPOILED IMP. BUT THEIR REAL WORRY: IS GIULIANI A SOFTY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALDINE BAUM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a face. What a city. 
</P>
<P>
 New Yorkers have been chuckling and clucking over the last three weeks since 
the new mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, was upstaged during his inaugural address 
by his 7-year-old son, Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 During the swearing-in of the 107th mayor, the boy -- a chubster with a blond 
mop, Chiclets teeth and a winning grin -- joined his dad -- a stern-faced 
former prosecutor -- at the lectern as he delivered the most important speech 
of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 While the mayor opined for 17 minutes about pressing public problems, young 
Andrew was busy mugging, waving and blowing kisses. He yanked his dad's sleeve, 
gestured to his little buddies in the audience and, in the middle of the 
outdoor speech, toppled a pitcher, spilling cold water down his dad's leg. 
</P>
<P>
 When the father bemoaned the city's "structural deficit," the son gave a 
lion-sized yawn; when Dad declared that New York would again be the "capital of 
the world," the boy belted out the next line with him: "It should be so and it 
will be." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mayor Dinkins, I salute your accomplishments," said Papa Bear to his 
predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me, too!" added Baby Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 No kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 With his Alfred E. Neuman smile (What me worry?) and pudgy fingers, young 
Andrew brought the clown center stage -- a proverbial fresh breeze at a hot-air 
event where most adults are usually too guarded to let their clowns loose. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, young Andrew is precisely the kind of kid New Yorkers either love or 
savage. He has a perfect face for urban Angst . 
</P>
<P>
 And by 6 the next morning, talk radio was at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get the fat kid off the stage!" screamed host Don Imus, New York's equivalent 
to a cup of black coffee with a raw egg. In his view, the kid was obnoxious, a 
distraction from the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "No normal kid could get by with that," Imus said during a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing the on-air harping, father Giuliani called in to get him to lay 
off. Imus immediately put the mayor on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked him," Imus said, "but I told him very rapidly we could get very sick 
of this kid in New York." 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, he added: "We don't lay off anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 In the days that followed, there was a lot of Andrew-joking on shows like 
Letterman, as well as arm-chair psychoanalysis about Rudy and Donna Hanover 
Giuliani's parenting skills. 
</P>
<P>
 And of course there was the usual dose of irony. Oh, so this is how Mr. Law 
and Order is finally playing in a liberal city -- he can't even control his own 
kid. Ha ha ha. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps during the inauguration the mother should have affectionately 
restrained the boy or ushered him back to his seat, suggested one television 
analyst. Or maybe beforehand Andrew should have been prepared with an 
explanation of the seriousness of the event, a pediatrician was quoted as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Anny C. Dietz, a dean of discipline at a junior high school in Queens, wrote a 
letter to the editor of New York Newsday saying she found Andrew's behavior 
"abusive to the spectator" who wanted to hear the new mayor's speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally voted for the mayor," Dietz said, "but now I have misgivings 
about his ability to fight abusive behavior in a city of millions when he 
cannot do that in his own family of four."  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, most of the criticism was aimed at Andrew's mother, a television 
reporter for most of her career. No one expected the father to tussle with the 
boy during the speech, but perhaps the mother could have. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giulianis, who also have a 4-year-old named Caroline, defended Andrew's 
antics, explaining that during many campaign appearances with his father over 
the last four years, Andrew had often stood by his dad at the podium. And more 
relevantly, the night before the inaugural address Andrew had practiced the 
speech with his dad. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the normal course of events," said his mother during an interview 
last week. She recalled how on election night, Andrew was up until 3 a.m. to 
hear his father give their victory speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have let Andrew understand that even if Daddy is making a speech, if 
Andrew wants to be with his dad, he can be there," she said. "That's important 
to his self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if perhaps her son is hyperactive -- a question raised by observers 
of his rambunctiousness -- she was offended by the personal nature of the query 
and briefly stopped the interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you should ask that kind of question and I don't think we 
should answer that kind of question," she snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said she had turned down all requests for interviews with Andrew. 
"That's out of the question," she said. "He's a child and shouldn't be put on 
the spot like that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The media machine and coffee-shop chatter has been revved up, analyzing and 
over-analyzing as New York is once again exposed to the criticism of not 
knowing whether it has a Nerf ball or a nuclear bomb in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 (To further explain New York's relationship with the media, the Village Voice 
devoted its entire Media column -- last week titled "Honey I Blew Up the Kid" 
-- to the Andrew thing.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even "Saturday Night Live" got into the act with an Andrew skit that was not 
nearly as cruel as it was to Chelsea Clinton when her dad got his new job. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, many New Yorkers were quietly thrilled by this deviation from the 
dull inaugural script. 
</P>
<P>
 It's rare that something human is injected into the barbaric process that 
allows politicians to ceaselessly bore people with platitudes. And after all, 
this was the third ceremonial oath-taking since Giuliani won election Nov. 2. 
Who could blame the kid for getting into the act? By Jan 2., it was a bit old. 
</P>
<P>
 In the great tradition of using political kids as an means to an ends, 
Giuliani milked Andrew's headlines. The boy had managed in one morning to 
humanize a cold robotic image that had plagued Giuliani during four years of 
campaigning that started when he lost to David Dinkins in 1989.  
</P>
<P>
 Although aides had quietly carped to reporters about giving the kid so much 
coverage, the new mayor didn't miss an opportunity to go on every talk show, 
with a denouement appearance on David Letterman's "Late Night" last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Letterman didn't want Giuliani there to talk about privatization of 
city services. 
</P>
<P>
 As he strode through a side entrance to the Ed Sullivan Theater, and even 
before reporters could ask set-up questions, the mayor was popping off 
one-liners.  
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to Andrew before I came here and he gave me a lot of good material," 
the mayor said, uncharacteristically grinning. This from a man who, as one 
political reporter described, "views arrogance as virtue, the tough decisions 
as sacrament." 
</P>
<P>
 Letterman opened the show by explaining that the mayor was a fill-in guest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to have his son Andrew, but tonight Andrew is with Koppel on 
'Nightline,' " deadpanned Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Giulianis deflected criticism that their son was a distraction from the 
inauguration, Andrew did turn out to be the ultimate distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than focusing on a possible 10,000 layoffs, some New Yorkers were 
guffawing over Andrew's antics and his dad's conclusion that they were a 
"really sweet thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49-year-old mayor's best friend from childhood, Msgr. Alan Placa, vice 
chancellor of the Diocese of Rockville Centre on Long Island, says the mayor is 
not an indulgent older father. 
</P>
<P>
 "An indulgent parent buys a lot of junk for his kids and pays no attention to 
them," says Placa, who adds that he and Giuliani were fellow pranksters in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mayor sure showed America that he might be a softy. 
</P>
<P>
 On "Letterman," Giuliani said that for Andrew's eighth birthday at the end of 
the month, he wanted a really big dog. But his daughter, Caroline, wanted a 
really small dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we're going to compromise," the mayor said. "We're going to get both -- a 
big one and a small one."

 American folklore hums with the romance of hopping a midnight boxcar on a 
freight train bound for glory. 
</P>
<P>
 But back in the 1930s, riding the rails was a grim way of life for many who 
had lost jobs, homes, even families to the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the American History Project wants to hear from those who spent childhood 
or teen-age years wandering. A documentary film on the era is in the works, and 
all stories are welcome.

amazing," co-producer Michael Uys said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: A wealthy youth "de-princed" at 16 when his millionaire father 
lost everything. He wound up drifting west to become a dock worker and labor 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 And a woman whose vivid memories of being hungry, weary and homeless still 
flare up as nightmares if she skips dinner or becomes too tired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our missing piece is people of color -- African Americans, Native Americans, 
Asians and (Latinos) -- so we can include as many voices as possible," Uys 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To participate, send a letter or audio tape to Uys and co-producer Lexy Lovell 
at the American History Project, 300 Hicks St., Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201. DOUG

IN PURSUIT OF A FINE MESS OF MEMORIES

 Every now and then I go out to look for Laurel and Hardy. I visit the concrete 
Silver Lake steps where they dragged the piano crate in the 1932 Academy 
Award-winning short, "The Music Box." I drive through Culver City intersections 
where they spurred masses of people into hat-stomping (or pants-ripping or 
pie-throwing) riots. A few weeks ago, I dined at an Indian restaurant inside 
the building they drove by in an old Ford in their 1929 film, "Bacon Grabbers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Damn," I thought, "missed 'em by 65 years!" 
</P>
<P>
 Last June 16, Stan Laurel's birthday, I went to Forest Lawn in Burbank to 
visit his grave. The spirit of Laurel and Hardy movies, at least, seemed to be 
with me. I got lost cruising around the cemetery in a car that squeaked like a 
shrieking peacock and repeatedly drove past a funeral in progress, complete 
with a delicate, tinkly harpist. The solemn mourners eyed me with increasing 
fear at each pass. I resisted an impulse to scratch my head and smile 
helplessly. 
</P>
<P>
 When I finally found Laurel's resting place (after taking a wrong turn that 
led me to Buster Keaton's), I deposited some sort of mutated snapdragon that 
was all my budget allowed and whistled the old Laurel and Hardy theme song, 
also known as "The Cuckoo Song." You know how it goes -- ending with that 
repeating "COO-koo, COO-koo." Well -- and this is the God's truth -- when I 
finished, the mockingbirds picked up the "COO-koos." I couldn't decide whether 
it was poignant or eerie. Or funny. 
</P>
<P>
 And, yes, on the way out I got lost and squeaked past that funeral again. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not alone in my odd pursuit of Stan and Ollie. Lots of other people go 
out and look for them, too. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, for such people, two guidebooks to the pair's movie sites: the 
painstakingly researched "Pratfall" (Vol. 2), written by Bob Satterfield and 
friends and published by the Valley-based Way Out West Tent of the Sons of the 
Desert, the durable local chapter of the international Laurel and Hardy 
appreciation society; and "Following the Comedy Trail," by Leon Smith, a former 
Los Angeles Police Department detective who includes Laurel and Hardy and "Our 
Gang" locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Why such interest? It occurs to me, with the 102nd anniversary of Oliver 
Hardy's birth Tuesday, that aside from originality and comedy, "the boys" 
symbolized love, bravery, friendship, dignity, perseverance, undying loyalty 
and innocence in the face of merciless absurdity and chicanery. I have no 
argument with Kurt Vonnegut's appraisal of them as angels in his novel, 
"Slapstick." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's a little more to it. Tied up in my periodic searches for Laurel 
and Hardy, and in the guidebooks, is a search for old L.A. -- that more 
innocent series of communities connected by great, formidable Pacific Electric 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 To wit, when I see a Red Car cruising down Hoover Avenue in the duo's "Hog 
Wild" (1930), I drink up the scene, trying hard to imagine what it must have 
been like to ride on that Red Car. When I see Stan and Ollie haul that crate up 
those pristine steps in that young Silver Lake neighborhood, I am there, trying 
to breathe that less complicated 1932 air along with them. The movies -- and 
their remaining landmarks -- are time travel. 
</P>
<P>
 I went out looking for Laurel and Hardy again a few weeks ago, at the 
Hollywood Heritage Museum. It seemed a good place to try. The Silent Society 
and the Society of Operating Cameramen were hosting a fund-raiser there for a 
commemorative plaque to be placed at the foot of the "Laurel and Hardy Steps" 
in Silver Lake. The evening's program featured a few old comedies shot at the 
steps -- including "The Music Box" -- and Ray Bradbury.  
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury read aloud his old short story, "The Laurel and Hardy Love Affair" 
(published in "The Toynbee Convector") for the crowd of 50 or so. It concerns 
two lovers united because they liked to look for Laurel and Hardy. Most of 
their dates, in fact, are spent picnicking at the steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing a kindred spirit, I later phoned Bradbury. The author offered that the 
museum reading had moved him to resurrect an unpublished 30-year-old short 
story also focusing on Laurel and Hardy and to polish it up. ("So we'll see now 
if we get someone to publish this," he said, incredibly enough. "You can never 
tell.") He summarized the story. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's called 'Another Fine Mess,' " Bradbury said. "In it, the ghosts of 
Laurel and Hardy run up and down the (Silver Lake) stairs late at night. This 
woman who lives nearby hears them shouting at 3 o'clock in the morning, goes 
out, can't see anything, and hears the 'music box' (piano crate) tumbling down 
the steps. 
</P>
<P>
 "She calls her friend, who's an expert on motion picture history, and they 
both go out and listen. And they say to each other, why are they here? Why are 
they letting the 'music box' chase them down the stairs, and then come up 
again? And they theorize, well, maybe they want to hear one last time, 'We love 
you.' Maybe we didn't give them enough love while they were alive. Could that 
possibly be?" 
</P>
<P>
 (In actuality, it could. Biographers suggest that the comics, especially 
Hardy, who died in 1957, probably did not realize how deeply they were 
appreciated.) 
</P>
<P>
 "And finally, one of the ladies leans forward and calls down the steps into 
the darkness, 'You know, we love you. You don't have to come here and haunt the 
steps anymore. You can be at peace because you know that my friend here and I 
love you.' Then they hear the voices going down the stairs, and they have 
second thoughts. They say, 'Well, don't go away forever. Once a year come back 
here so we can say it all over again, "We love you." ' And then they stand 
there, both of them weeping, and the sounds disappear down into black and white 
Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After our chat, I drove into Technicolor Los Angeles -- specifically, to the 
steps (between 923 and 935 Vendome Street). They're surrounded by homes now and 
overgrown with bougainvillea and jade plants. The placid and civilized little 
neighborhood of "The Music Box" has long given way to graffiti, bars on windows 
and back yards full of Dobermans. 
</P>
<P>
 I walked up and down the 131 cracked stairs where Stan and Ollie played 
Sisyphus with a piano, slavering guard dogs snarling at me. I pictured their 
horse-drawn delivery wagon in the street below, and Laurel yelling up the 
stairs to beleaguered Hardy that an angry cop wants to talk to "the other 
monkey," meaning Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
 I knocked on a door of one home that does appear in the movie and talked to a 
nice young guy named Jiro Yamaguchi, a classical Indian percussionist who plays 
Thursday nights at nearby Paru's. He told me that people come by "every couple 
of weeks" to look at the steps and that "they tend to be a little older." 
</P>
<P>
 I found evidence of the visitors. A gentleman named Mauro Simonini had 
carefully printed two messages on the steps, in large black letters. The first 
read, in Italian: "A S. Laurel & O. Hardy, con affetto, Mauro Simonini, 
Livorno, Italia, 10-16-93." The second referred to the pair as "Stanlio" and 
"Ollio," their characters' Italian-esque names in the 1931 feature "Fra 
Diavolo." It read: "A Stanlio e Ollio, i grandissimi con infinito affetto -- 
Mauro." (Translation: "To Stan and Ollie, the great ones, with infinite 
affection.") 
</P>
<P>
 I stood there, reflecting on the people who look for Laurel and Hardy: Ray 
Bradbury, who looks in his typewriter; members of the Society of Operating 
Cameramen and the Silent Society, who are looking in a plaque; Mauro Simonini, 
who came halfway around the world to seek them in the old L.A. steps of Silver 
Lake; the Sons of the Desert, who celebrate their work and memory all year long 
-- and me. And it struck me that a person couldn't ask for any greater gift. So 
happy 102nd, Ollie. Con infinito affetto.

FASHION; MARTY AWARDS HIGHLIGHT MENSWEAR MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent turn of women's fashion toward the dark side -- burlap dresses, 
exposed bosoms, tear-away shifts -- has many people looking for light. The 
women's wear designers seem lost, but maybe the minds behind menswear have 
something to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the hope late last week at the Biltmore in downtown Los Angeles as 
the Fashion Assn. put on fashion shows, panel discussions and chalk talks about 
the glory of spring and summer menswear for the nation's fashion press. As part 
of the package, the California Mart hosted its annual California menswear 
awards show Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve-year design veteran Jules Weinsieder won the top award, the Marty, for 
his Santa Barbara-based M. Julian/B. Free collection of leather jackets. The 
Rising Star award went to Michael Lew of Los Angeles for his line of 
contemporary sportswear called Imaginary Concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Mossimo (Giannulli) would win," confessed a surprised Weinsieder 
after the announcement. "My 13-year-old son was sure Moss would win. And on the 
way to the awards, my wife made me stop at Rudnick's in the Valley so she could 
buy two Mossimo T-shirts." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinsieder's sexy whip-stitched and laced leather jackets made a bigger hit 
with the voters than did Mossimo's street-savvy thermal shirt jackets and 
wheat-colored jeans. The thrice-nominated Giannulli is in danger of becoming 
the Susan Lucci (always a nominee, never a winner) of the Marty awards. 
</P>
<P>
 After two days of fashion watching, it seems fair to say that menswear is not 
as far adrift as women's wear -- a fact that has not gone unnoticed by the 
cognoscenti. Menswear is expected to fuel a chunk of the 3% to 4% increase in 
consumer sales projected for '94, industry analysts say. After its three-year 
roll in the gutter with grunge, anything would be an improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The prevailing palette for spring and summer was ivory, white, cream and 
beige. Jackets were very soft and often unlined. Pants were even softer, many 
of them pajamalike. Many of the California designers have streamlined their 
street wear; baggy shorts are now only loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based Chip and Pepper Foster showed great multicolored striped 
denim shorts from their Brand F collection. TV star and Brand F financial 
backer Kelsey Grammer modeled for the design twosome, who look like a cross 
between the rock duo Nelson and the "Full House" twins. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeans fit again, some even fit tight. Banded-collar shirts were quite popular, 
and where there's no collar, there's no tie. Oversize sweaters and T-shirts 
replaced flannel shirts.  
</P>
<P>
 The mismatched vest, often in a heavy knit, or nubby woven fabric appeared to 
be a must-have of the season. Another was the Birkenstock sandal; the ugly, 
flat slabs with two heavy straps were worn with suits and shorts.  
</P>
<P>
 In the myriad events off the runway: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tom Julian, fashion director of the Fashion Assn., whipped himself into an 
excited froth as he talked about single-breasted three-button jackets replacing 
double-breasted varieties. (Menswear takes baby steps.) 
</P>
<P>
 * A Haggar rep took the microphone to do an infomercial about his firm's 
wrinkle-free pants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Julian introduced an outfit of khaki pants, sport jacket, shirt and tie as 
the perfect option for dressed-down Fridays. It seems retailers are ready to 
pounce on the trend toward relaxed corporate dress codes as a whole new 
category of dressing. As if the sweaters and slacks already in men's closets 
won't do.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: NO REPAIR IS IN SIGHT FOR TV BLURRING; TELEVISION: EVERYTHING 
AND EVERYONE ON THE TUBE THESE DAYS IS STARTING TO LOOK LIKE LIGHT 
ENTERTAINMENT. 
</P>

 Curtain up. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorena Bobbitt goes on trial for severing her husband's penis, a champion 
figure skater is under a cloud after her Olympic rival is severely whacked with 
a metal baton and Bill Clinton plays the saxophone in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
 It's happening again, television's blurring and fading, everything merging the 
way colors bleed together in a washing machine. The result, Norman Corwin has 
written, is a "contagion," a remote control-zapped cheapening or trivialization 
of "a whole culture" through TV's portrayal of everything as "piffle." 
</P>
<P>
 Layers and layers of complexity equal piffle? The situation, media analyst 
Neil Postman argues, is not that television is entertaining but that it 
presents everything as entertainment. In this framework, all of TV is show 
time, a stage on which comedy and drama, reality and fantasy exist side by side 
as equal and identical. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything is theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Or as Frank McConnell, another media observer from academe, puts it, when 
everything, whether tragedy or farce, is presented as spectacle, the result is 
confusion. His McLuhanesque summation: "The real and the fictional, the serious 
and the trivial, become hopelessly blurred, until only the uninterrupted, 
zombifying carrier wave itself is the 'real' meaning of the transmission." 
</P>
<P>
 Blurring. "Dan Rather goes one on one with President Clinton in Prague." That 
introduction, on a recent edition of "The CBS Evening News," segued to an 
interview that saw anchorman and saxman continuously framed as a twosome, 
equals before the camera. Just as Rather and Clinton were in a subsequent 
interview from Moscow. And as NBC anchor Tom Brokaw and Clinton were in still 
another interview from Moscow, the traditional line separating interviewer and 
interviewee wiped away by TV's need to celebrate its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course you recall actors Brokaw and Rather from their appearances this 
season with actor David Letterman, who also interviewed Vice President Al Gore, 
among many other performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Blurring. A network newscast shows that consummate stage-crafter Clinton at a 
town meeting in Moscow urging a youth in the audience to "come shake hands with 
me. Maybe you'll be President some day." End of story. 
</P>
<P>
 Next comes a commercial break, an advertisement for a movie. "The critics are 
applauding. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Blurring. You look in on cable's new Television Food Network hoping to hear 
about, of all things, food. Instead you find comic Judy Tenuta in the kitchen 
with Robin Leach, doing her greasiest, bluest stand-up material about Roseanne 
Arnold and First Lady Hillary Clinton, the perpetual foil of entertainer Rush 
Limbaugh, who also has appeared on Letterman's CBS show, as well as on NBC's 
"Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
 Blurring. Kathleen Sullivan, a former network news anchor, morning show host 
and sportscaster, has a new TV gig touting Weight Watchers, just as the 
credibility Robert Young earned as kindly old Doc Welby helped him sell Maxwell 
House coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Blurring. Champion skater Tonya Harding is all over the news as her bodyguard 
and two others are arrested in connection with the beating of her rival, Nancy 
Kerrigan. Although not formally charged with anything, Harding at midweek was 
labeled "trash" by ESPN's house primitive Jim Rome, and the tease on CNN's 
"Crossfire" that evening asked rhetorically whether she should be "stripped" of 
the U.S. Figure Skating Championship she had just won in Detroit after Kerrigan 
was forced to drop out. In a predictable overlapping of news and entertainment, 
moreover, Harding has become the butt of guilt-presuming jokes by late-night 
talk show hosts. Her life, their punchline. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's own press conference was carried by CNN during a recess in the 
Bobbitt trial, which it has been airing live while running intermittent printed 
messages of other news such as, "Clinton ends busy day in Russia with dinner in 
Moscow." 
</P>
<P>
 Blurring. She's demure and respectful, answering questions with "yes, ma'am" 
and "no, ma'am." She speaks softly with a Spanish accent. Her black hair 
tumbles to her shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of Puerto Rican Maria in "West Side Story," though, this is 
Equador-born Lorena Bobbitt, on trial for cutting off the penis of her husband, 
John Wayne Bobbitt, with a carving knife. 
</P>
<P>
 The title of this spectacular? "CNN Live: Lorena Bobbitt Trial." As opposed to 
the William Kennedy Smith trial, the Rodney King and Reginald Denny beating 
trials, the Menendez trial and -- bank on it if charges are filed -- the coming 
TV-studded Michael Jackson trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorena Bobbitt's temporary insanity defense rests on the jury believing that 
her husband repeatedly beat and raped her (he denies it) to the point that she 
went uncontrollably berserk. She claims the penis incident followed one of 
those rapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "His right shoulder was on my face, my mouth. . . . I said I didn't want to 
have sex. . . . He started to pull down. . . . He force himself into me. . . . 
He was hurting me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Either a helluva a victim or a helluva actress, Bobbitt last week broke down 
on the stand and wept much the way Eric Menendez did in describing alleged 
sexual abuse by his father and Patricia Bowman did in describing an alleged 
sexual attack by Smith, a charge on which he was ultimately acquitted. 
Continually pulling off white tissues like they were life preservers, Bobbitt 
was a sorrowful, pathetic figure, her eyes half-open, tears streaming down her 
cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a recess. Then immediately on the screen another face, with more tears 
streaming down cheeks, as Mary Ellen Durant told her story of alleged incest on 
CNN's "Sonja Live." 
</P>
<P>
 On TV, society's confessional of the '90s, just about everything becomes 
either soap opera or light entertainment, all rendered the same. Multiple TV 
movies about the Menendez and Bobbitt cases are already in the works. The 
Harding-Kerrigan incident is bound to have its two hours on prime time, too. 
And one of these nights, Bill Clinton will sit in with Letterman's Paul 
Shaffer.

FILM PARTNERS HAVE NO REGRETS; MOVIES: BARRY LEVINSON AND MARK JOHNSON ARE 
SPLITTING UP, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN GOODBY FOREVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE DUTKA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood divorces need not be bitter. In moviemaking, as in life, two people 
who've shared a harmonious partnership can wake up one morning with disparate 
needs and goals. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was with the director-producer team of Barry Levinson and Mark Johnson, 
who turned out such hits as "Diner," "Good Morning, Vietnam," and the Academy 
Award-winning "Rain Man." After 10 movies and 12 years, they suggest, the time 
had come to call it quits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hate for people to think there's any animosity between us," says 
Johnson, who first met the director when they both worked for Mel Brooks in 
1977. "We're not trying to split things up and see who takes the children. 
We're pleased and relieved. He'll work on his projects. I'll work on mine. And 
we are still working on a number of movies together." 
</P>
<P>
 Thoughts of a breakup began to surface early last spring when the two found 
themselves operating in very different spheres. Johnson was immersed in 
pre-production on "A Perfect World," a project Levinson sidestepped because of 
reservations about the script. Levinson was focused on NBC's police series, 
"Homicide" and writing "Jimmy Hollywood," an upcoming spring release about an 
actor on the fringe of show business, which Johnson and he were shooting for 
Paramount Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Levinson's voracious directorial appetite left him little time for 
their production company, Baltimore Pictures, Johnson found himself carrying a 
disproportionate amount of the load. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a director, I work fairly constantly," Levinson explains, "so overseeing a 
broad slate of other people's movies became complicated and overwhelming. It 
becomes a question of philosophy: How many things can you -- and do you want to 
-- watch over? Producers are concerned with getting movies made, but that's 
never been my priority. Once you open the door to producing other people's 
projects, you drift away from those you feel passionate about." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only last April that the twosome signed a lucrative three-year, 
non-exclusive deal with Paramount Pictures, which received news of the split 
less than two weeks ago. Though Johnson and Levinson expect to continue 
developing and producing existing projects at the studio, it's still uncertain 
what the future holds. 
</P>
<P>
 "No discussions have taken place," Levinson says. "Given the corporate battle 
(between Viacom Inc. and QVC Network) to take over Paramount Communications, 
I'm sure the studio has more important things on its mind." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Industry insiders place the ball in Paramount's court. "Since the production 
entity with which the deal was signed no longer exists, the deal is null and 
void," says one. "Paramount now has to decide whether it wants to deal with 
each one of them separately -- which might be done on a case-by-case basis. 
From the studio's point of view, the deal wasn't a bad one. They own all the 
projects currently in development and, in less than a year, came away with 
'Jimmy Hollywood' -- a movie they like." 
</P>
<P>
 News of the rupture took the studio by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one saw it coming," admits one Paramount source. "Barry and Mark seem to 
have the perfect relationship and there doesn't seem to be any hidden agenda. I 
suspect Mark just wants more identity and independence." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is currently in pre-production on "The Little Princess," a Warner 
Bros. movie based on Frances Hodgson Burnett's 1905 classic, written by "Fisher 
King's" Richard LaGravanese. He and Levinson will be producing HBO's "Paley," a 
project based on the life of the CBS founder, which will begin shooting in a 
few months, as well as MGM's feature, "Donnie Brasco," the story of an 
undercover FBI agent, which, pending the selection of a director, will get 
under way in the spring. The two also collaborated on "Quiz Show," a project 
based on the Charles Van Doren TV scandal and directed by Robert Redford, which 
is scheduled for release by Hollywood Pictures in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, says Johnson -- who reportedly turned down the opportunity to 
head Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment last year -- his plans are 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Levinson is almost set to direct "Disclosure," a Warner Bros. release based on 
Michael Crichton's new novel about a female executive charged with sexual 
harassment at a high-tech company in Seattle. Levinson was called in when 
creative differences arose between Milos Forman and Crichton, who is producing 
the picture himself. Though there are ongoing discussions about what tack to 
take, says the director, the chances of moving ahead "look good." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Says Levinson: "I like suspense, but usually don't want to direct that type of 
film. In this case, however, the male/female dilemma was intriguing. My movies 
generally deal with the inability of men to deal with women and, (by reversing 
the traditional sex roles), Crichton turns the issue of sexual harassment 
around on itself. That's often more effective than exploring it head-on. In the 
'60s, the issue was pushing the nuclear button. The insane 'Dr. Strangelove,' I 
thought, spoke much louder to the topic than an earnest, straightforward drama 
like 'Fail Safe.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ending the partnership, says Johnson, fills him with "sadness." "I see this as 
a real passing," he says. "I'm leaving behind a part of my youth, my coming to 
maturity as a filmmaker. I'll miss being part of Barry's movies. I don't know 
of anyone as good as he is. I'm certain there will be pangs of jealousy when I 
see some terrific movie he turns out." 
</P>
<P>
 Levinson, who plans to move to Northern California before year's end, delivers 
a less nostalgic, slightly tongue-in-cheek, eulogy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been preparing for this for a while now," says the director, "so the 
breakup isn't especially traumatic. It's a conclusion we had to come to. This 
certainly doesn't seem as dramatic as when Martin and Lewis split up. Now, 
that's something that really killed me."

 Home Box Office, its "The Larry Sanders Show" and "HBO Comedy Hour: John 
Leguizamo's 'Spic-o-Rama' " were the big winners at the 15th annual National 
CableACE Awards, while the best movie or miniseries category saw a reversal of 
the Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
 HBO took 34 of the 88 awards signifying excellence in cable television among 
programs presented between Sept. 1, 1992, and Aug. 31, 1993. The winners were 
announced in a pair of ceremonies, with 74 categories revealed Friday night in 
non-televised proceedings at the Biltmore Hotel and 14 Sunday night in a 
nationally cable-televised event from the Pantages Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Showtime was second with 10, Cable News Network and ESPN each had six and the 
Arts & Entertainment Network, Discovery Channel and Disney Channel each had 
five. Sixteen networks won at least once. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry Sanders" and "Spic-o-Rama" each received four CableACEs, the most of 
any program. "Sanders" was tabbed as the best comedy series, beating a field 
that included HBO's "Dream On," which won two years ago, and MTV's 
controversial animated series, "Beavis and Butt-head." Starring Garry Shandling 
as a television talk-show host, "Sanders" has won the category in both of its 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The series got its other awards in the best actor in a comedy series, with Rip 
Torn triumphing over co-stars Shandling and Jeffrey Tambor; writing in a comedy 
series with Shandling and four others cited, and Todd Holland for directing in 
a comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spic-o-Rama" won for comedy special, directing in a comedy special, 
Leguizamo's performance and writing in a comedy special. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendie Malick of "Dream On" maintained her streak of being honored as the best 
actress in a comedy, winning for the third consecutive year, matching the 
show's run. "Dream On" was also cited for best editing in a comedy/music 
special or series. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering 
Mom" took best movie or miniseries honors, defeating fellow HBO nominees 
"Barbarians at the Gate" and "Stalin," which shared best made-for-television 
movie Emmys. Its star, Holly Hunter, added a CableACE for best actress in a 
movie or miniseries to the Emmy she also won for the role. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Dennehy won for best actor in a movie or miniseries for Turner Network 
Television's "Foreign Affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Other awards included: CNN's "Larry King Live," bypassed a year ago, won as 
best talk-show series; Michael Jackson as the top performer in a music special 
or series for his Bucharest concert on the ill-fated Dangerous Tour carried by 
HBO and Walter Cronkite as program interviewer for the Discovery Channel's "The 
Holocaust: In Memory of Millions." 
</P>
<P>
 Three special awards were also presented. The Golden CableACE, the industry's 
highest honor for a special project or program, was given to American Movie 
Classics for its film preservation festival. Michael J. Fuchs, chairman and 
chief executive officer of HBO, won the Governors Award, honoring an individual 
for outstanding achievements in advancing the development of cable programming.

was built. Among the winners:

OSCAR WINNER STEVE TESICH JUST SAYS NO TO HOLLYWOOD VIOLENCE; LECTURE: SPEAKING 
AT CHAPMAN, THE 'BREAKING AWAY' SCREENWRITER SAYS HE REJECTS MOST FILM PROJECTS 
OFFERED HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Tesich may be a successful screenwriter, but he has conflicted feelings 
about Hollywood. Great place to get ahead, great place to make pots of money -- 
but not always such a great place for an idealist. 
</P>
<P>
 The artistic compromises can be so severe that Tesich, who won an Oscar for 
his "Breaking Away" script in 1979, says he spends much of his time turning 
down offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Movies I won't do and won't see begin with this ," Tesich said Friday night 
after his lecture at Chapman University, raising his hand to symbolize a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's too much violence. There aren't any (films) that deal with rape 
without promoting it -- they glorify it like a number from a musical. You 
become saturated by it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Tesich, at Chapman for two weeks while teaching an advanced writing class as 
the campus' screenwriter-in-residence, added that writers are also worn down by 
the industry's reliance on quick, easy resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also avoid (projects) that are too simplistic," he said. "There are too 
many formulas. I don't want life to be (portrayed as) a Beckett play, but I do 
want balance. People . . . need that balance." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Tesich pointed to greed as the prime evil. "It's always the 
bottom line. (The studios) aren't even happy with a little money; everything 
has to be a blockbuster." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Tesich, 50, is busy finishing his novel, titled "Karoo" and set in 
the United States. That doesn't mean he's given up on films; considering 
Tesich's history, the Hollywood pull is strong, despite his reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 Tesich, a Yugoslavia native who came to the United States at 13, started 
writing for the New York theater scene in the late '60s. He wrote six plays 
produced Off Broadway and had something of a hit with "Division Street," which 
was creamed by critics but has since enjoyed a revival afterlife on stages 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came "Breaking Away," Tesich's first screenplay. The coming-of-age movie, 
starring Dennis Christopher and Dennis Quaid, wasn't a huge box-office winner, 
but it did set Tesich's career on a new and lucrative path. 
</P>
<P>
 He went on to adapt John Irving's "The World According to Garp," and also 
wrote "American Flyers," "Eleni" and "Four Friends," among others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While recalling those pictures, Tesich said he had special affection for 
"Breaking Away" and "Garp." 
</P>
<P>
 "The first of anything -- your first love, your first girlfriend -- always 
mean the most, so 'Breaking Away' is my favorite," he explained. "And 'Garp' I 
love a lot because it was such a wonderful experience. It also started a lot of 
nice things for some talented people, like Robin Williams and Glenn Close." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the sort of reflection the Chapman Auditorium audience seemed to 
crave. The questions following Tesich's 45-minute talk, which dwelt on the 
plight of America more than the bright of Hollywood, tended to focus on the 
author's experiences rather than his politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Tesich, however, wasn't interested in rehashing his career but opened up a bit 
when asked why he writes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I became a writer to survive as a human being," Tesich said with a small 
grin. "I write out of necessity, not compulsion. I do it so I can be decent to 
everybody else, including my family. It really keeps me together and happy." 
</P>
<P>
 As for what he prefers to create -- novels, plays or screenplays -- Tesich 
said each provided joy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly don't think novels have more artistic merit than screenwriting," 
he noted. "A film by Bergman can mean as much to me as a book by Dostoevsky." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During his lecture, which Tesich called "a State of the Union by a private 
citizen," the author criticized this country for not addressing urban decay and 
for seeking simple solutions to complicated problems abroad. He also questioned 
why the culture makes media figures, if not heroes, out of such people as 
Oliver North. 
</P>
<P>
 "This glorifies . . . the person who can get away" with taking an outlaw path, 
Tesich said, later adding that "we are living in a glitzy dark age. The 
information highway won't help us in where to go. . . . We have a lack of 
vision and unity."

CROWD UNITES AT HARBOR IN HONOR OF KING; CELEBRATION: THE EVENT TO REMEMBER THE 
SLAIN CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER IS FILLED WITH APPRECIATION, MUSIC, POETRY AND ART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There was a mix of poetry, music, art and crafts Sunday as hundreds of people 
crowded the Ventura Harbor in early celebration of today's Martin Luther King 
Jr. holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time that the harbor offered the event in honor of the slain 
civil rights leader. But its significance was not lost on one young man. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teacher told me all about how (King) went on a bus and he was a black 
person who paid, but how the white people said he couldn't sit down because he 
was the wrong color," said 5-year-old Alexander Gastrein of Oak View. "I think 
that's pretty mean." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, the boy's mother, Suzy Gastrein, listened as Daisy Cotton recited some 
of her poetry on the steps of the Windrose Gift Shop. Scores of others joined 
Gastrein as Cotton ambled through poem after poem detailing the triumphs and 
suffering endured by blacks and others in the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was moving, but I also thought there were not enough black 
people here listening to it," said Gastrein, a black woman who recently moved 
to Oak View from France. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm French," she said. "Our histories are different, but I still feel part of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton, who said she spent a good part of the 1950s working with King at 
leadership conferences and other rallies in the Deep South, said the holiday is 
a chance for people of all colors to look back at past indiscretions. 
</P>
<P>
 King himself, however, may not be too proud of America in the 1990s, Cotton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would be perhaps appalled because his dream is still a dream and not a 
reality," she said. "There are some positives that he would realize, but a lot 
of things he struggled against -- poverty, injustice and oppression -- are 
still existing." 
</P>
<P>
 But inside the exhibit hall Sunday, where artists and crafts people were 
selling their wares and tickets for a brunch today at the Oxnard Community 
Center, the mood was far more celebratory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a time to come together and remember the teachings of Martin Luther 
King," said Joelle Gray of Oxnard, who was selling books by black authors at a 
booth in the exhibit hall. "It's a happy time. Maybe somewhere, someone will 
say, 'Hey, we can all get along.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Across the room, Deborah Coleman and Audree Robinson manned a booth that was 
selling figurines, clothing, prints and posters. Four years ago, the two 
sisters founded Afro American Images, a business as well as an effort to 
promote awareness and pride in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to put out positive black images," Robinson said from behind the 
table. "Used to be you'd have to go to two or three places to find a pretty 
black doll that some girl would want to play with. Now, people are becoming 
more aware that a Barbie doll can be black and still be salable." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea James heard about the Ventura Harbor celebration Saturday night and 
decided that it was worth a look. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to see Martin Luther King's birthday celebrated in a different 
area," the Pasadena resident said while looking over the selection of wares at 
a table manned by vocalist Mikki Bouchard. "It's a sense of being and a sense 
of pride that everyone should have." 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard, selling earrings and other handcrafted artifacts to raise money for 
a trip later this year to Atlanta, said she was at the harbor Sunday mostly for 
the young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, they'll see something that will enlighten them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Events to honor King continue at 8 a.m. today with a peace march from Plaza 
Park to the Oxnard Community Center, where a brunch and keynote address by 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) are planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Martin Luther King Committee of Ventura County is sponsoring the eighth 
annual brunch and celebration, and more than 1,000 people are expected to 
attend.

EDUCATORS REACH OUT TO STUDENTS; COUNSELING: SUPPORT GROUPS, STARTED BY THE 
VENTURA DISTRICT, TOUCHES ON ISSUES RANGING FROM SELF-ESTEEM TO EATING 
DISORDERS TO COPING WITH PARENTS' DIVORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Last year, Beth's feelings about her chaotic family life spilled over into her 
behavior at school. 
</P>
<P>
 After her mother was hospitalized for emotional problems, the Ventura High 
School student began to break down in tears in the middle of her classes. "My 
friends would try to help me," the 17-year-old said. "But they couldn't do 
anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she attends group counseling -- at school. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11th-grader is one of about 200 students at Ventura High who miss one 
class per week to attend support groups on issues ranging from self-esteem to 
eating disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 All together, Ventura High has 18 such groups and plans this spring to launch 
two more -- one to bring together female African American students and another 
to help young people deal with grief. Most of the groups are led by 
professional counselors who volunteer their time. 
</P>
<P>
 Praised by local mental health professionals as both thorough and extensive, 
Ventura High's network of support groups won the school a state award last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura High officials say some of the credit for the program goes to the 
Ventura Unified School District board of trustees, which eight years ago issued 
a policy requiring school counselors and administrators to actively intervene 
in the personal problems of their students. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by concerns about drug and alcohol abuse among students, the district 
initially launched the school-based support groups, called the student 
assistance program, at its two high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the program has trickled down to the lower grades so that nearly every 
school offers some type of group counseling, including elementary school 
support groups for children from divorced families. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's attention to students' mental health reflects the changing role 
of public schools, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no longer just teaching the academics," said Ricardo Nargi, the 
district's director of personnel and special education services. "We've been 
thrown into the role of doing a lot of things that families normally would have 
taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 Educators said that sometimes they must pay attention to students' emotional 
well-being before they can help children achieve academically. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got kids who are for one reason or another emotionally hurting, 
it's going to negatively affect their academic performance," Nargi said. "When 
they're not preoccupied with other problems, they can occupy themselves with 
the task of learning." 
</P>
<P>
 And Ventura High is doing more than any other Ventura school to help students 
cope with their personal problems, educators and county mental health experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the district gives all of its schools some state and federal money for 
their student assistance programs, Ventura High is the only one that takes 
additional money from other school funds to pay for a full-time program 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials credit the coordinator, Cheryl Meyers, with the program's 
success at the high school. 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey last year, Ventura High officials found that children who had 
attended the various support groups had improved their school attendance by 
76%. Their grades had also gone up, but only slightly, Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers believes that grades did not show more improvement because each group 
meets for only eight weeks, too short a time to foster a dramatic improvement 
in students' study habits. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials said they are thrilled that the support groups are 
encouraging students to come to school more regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been able to keep kids in school," Principal Jerry Barshay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students who attend the groups said they look forward to the sessions all 
week, knowing that they will have a chance to air their troubles in a safe 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 In all of the groups, students agree to keep everything discussed during the 
sessions strictly confidential. And most groups are single sex -- either all 
boys or all girls -- to help students feel more comfortable about divulging 
their problems with family members or with romantic relationships, Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth, who began attending the support group after her mother was hospitalized, 
said she gets more support from the group than she has ever received at home. 
Beth is the student's middle name; school officials withheld her first and last 
names to protect her privacy.

"It helps me relax."

 Beth attends a group that focuses on boosting students' self-esteem. But many 
of the other groups deal with substance abuse problems and include students 
caught drinking alcohol on campus who have chosen to attend the counseling 
sessions instead of being suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to state and federal money, the student assistance programs at 
Ventura High and other Ventura schools depend on volunteer help from local 
therapists and counselors to lead the groups. 
</P>
<P>
 John Lieberman is community liaison for a local drug-treatment facility that 
pays for him to spend one full day each week at Ventura High, running five 
groups on self-esteem, substance abuse and for children of alcoholics. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the various groups focus on helping children talk honestly about their 
problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major focus in our groups is the kids being able to be honest about 
whatever's going on in their lives," Lieberman said. "If we can give the kids 
an hour a week, it gives them a safe place where they can dump their guts and 
get back into class and do the work they need to do."

STREET SMART: WAITING IS THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH SLOW WALK SIGNAL 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a patient person, but even I get frustrated with the walk signal on Loma 
Vista Road when I want to get to the Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to cross the street, you have to push the button and wait. And 
wait. And wait. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes forever for that light to change. Most times, I end up just taking my 
chances with the speeding traffic and cross on red. 
</P>
<P>
 Why does it take so long to get a walk light? Can anything be done to speed 
things up? 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Richardson, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, you'll just have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 It may seem unfair, but button-activated walk signals are designed to defer to 
heavy traffic, Ventura Associate Traffic Engineer Robert Yalda says. 
</P>
<P>
 When the walk button is pushed, it sends a message to a series of loops buried 
beneath the roadway. The command to activate the walk sign doesn't kick in 
until there is a break in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 That means the more traffic there is, the longer you have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 And it doesn't do any good to take out your frustration by leaning on the 
signal button, Yalda says. 
</P>
<P>
 "One push of the button has the same effect as 10," Yalda said. "If people 
keep pressing the button, it's just going to break." 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the link between the Moorpark and Simi Valley freeways opened, 
traffic on Los Angeles Avenue in Moorpark has gone down considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 But a red left-turn arrow at the intersection of Los Angeles and Condor Drive 
does not reflect that change. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrow for cars turning east onto Condor stays red for most of the green 
light time for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to the reduced traffic on Los Angeles, very few cars are crossing this 
intersection going north. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the red arrow be eliminated to allow cars to turn left when the light is 
green? 
</P>
<P>
 This would remove long, unneeded waits at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Kessler, North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark public works director agrees that the red left-turn arrow at 
Condor and Los Angeles is unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state Department of Transportation doesn't, and it gets final say at 
this intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on complaints from people who are forced to wait through the red arrow 
although there is very little traffic, Public Works Director Ken Gilbert sent a 
letter to Caltrans asking that the arrow be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans Senior Engineer Peter Wong wrote back to Gilbert and rejected the 
request. Wong said the red arrow helps traffic move more efficiently at the 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong also said that intersections with red arrows like the one at Condor and 
Los Angeles are less accident-prone than those without the arrows. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Wong did say the timing has recently been adjusted on the signal "to 
minimize minor inconveniences to the motorists." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said Caltrans will keep a close eye on the intersection and make 
further changes when it feels that they are necessary. 
</P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 There's a sign problem on the Moorpark Freeway that causes confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Right where the Moorpark Freeway meets the Ventura Freeway, it splits off and 
two lanes go to the left toward Los Angeles and two to the right, toward 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the two lanes going to the right quickly merge into one 
lane. But there is only one sign, on the right-hand side, indicating that the 
two lanes are merging into one. 
</P>
<P>
 I have seen some close calls as drivers in the left lane suddenly realize that 
they have to merge. 
</P>
<P>
 This problem could be solved by adding a second sign on the left side of the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this possible? 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Schmitt, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 How about a second lane instead? 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a request from the city of Thousand Oaks two years ago, 
Caltrans has been working on plans to do away with the merge and keep two lanes 
all the way from the Moorpark Freeway to the Ventura Freeway, Caltrans Traffic 
Engineer Bob Houle says. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly when the second lane will be added is not clear, Houle says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Caltrans will probably not add a merge sign on the left side 
of the freeway because it might confuse motorists splitting off toward Los 
Angeles, Caltrans Engineer Tony Colella says. 
</P>
<P>
 If drivers act with caution and pay attention to the road ahead of them, they 
should not have any problems noticing that it is getting narrower, Colella 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Colella says he will check out the area to see if another sign 
can be added until the second lane is put in.

FATHER PIROLI'S TRIAL IS CREATING TURMOIL IN CATHOLIC COMMUNITY; SIMI VALLEY: 
ARCHDIOCESE HAS RESPONDED ANGRILY TO THE PRIEST'S ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIS 
FORMER SUPERIOR. NONETHELESS, ST. PETER CLAVER PARISH IS THRIVING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before a single witness has testified, the collection-plate embezzlement trial 
of Father David Dean Piroli has already shaken the Catholic Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In a case that lists Cardinal Roger Mahony himself among the potential 
witnesses and leaves some parishioners dismayed, the accused Simi Valley priest 
has become the accuser. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli's lawyer charged last week that the priest was framed in the $60,000 
thefts by a fellow priest who wanted to hide his own embezzlement of church 
funds and cloak his gay lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Allan Steele allowed the defense, but said he will not let jurors hear 
any evidence relating to homosexuality. And diocesan officials Thursday angrily 
attacked all of Piroli's accusations against Father James McKeon, declaring 
them "a gross injustice" and the diocese "appalled." McKeon has declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tone has been set for a trial that threatens to lay open the usually 
private affairs of a Catholic parish. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors are expected to see ledgers showing the mysteriously shrinking coffers 
of St. Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley and Sacred Heart Church in Saticoy, 
the parishes from which Piroli is accused of taking $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also expected to learn how the case came to light: 
</P>
<P>
 On May 27, 1992, a Hollywood merchant's post-riot jitters led police to 
investigate his complaint about loiterers outside the Sears store. There, 
police said they found Piroli sitting in a Chevrolet Lumina belonging to St. 
Peter Claver Church with a man named Israel Palacios, $10,000 in small bills 
and small amounts of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles prosecutors dropped drug charges because the amounts were too 
small to warrant a case, and embezzlement charges because they were in the 
jurisdiction of Simi Valley police, who picked up the investigation and filed 
the case with the Ventura County district attorney. The county's grand jury 
indicted Piroli on two counts of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Piroli trial unfolds, jurors may hear McKeon, former head pastor of St. 
Peter Claver, describe how he bailed a wired, agitated Piroli out of the 
Hollywood police lockup following the arrest, only to have him disappear a few 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be told that while Piroli was missing, church officials discovered 
another $50,000 in small bills and parishioners' donation checks in his room at 
the rectory -- although the judge said he will not allow jurors to hear 
evidence that gay pornography, fireworks and a switchblade knife also were 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 And they will hear testimony about the priest's arrest six weeks later at the 
California border, where immigration officers told reporters that they caught 
him driving in from Mexico with two illegal immigrants -- one of them Palacios. 
Steele said he will not, however, allow testimony that the men were found in 
the car trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele said he will let defense attorney Richard Beada give evidence and argue 
that McKeon framed Piroli because he feared that the younger priest would blow 
the whistle on him. But Steele refused to let Beada introduce evidence the 
lawyer said would back his claim that McKeon was seen at a gay bathhouse in 
West Hollywood and that the money was taken to finance a gay lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Peace said in court that she hopes to prove 
that Piroli was fleecing his flock at both churches -- he was assistant pastor 
at Sacred Heart from 1986 to 1990 and at St. Peter Claver until 1992 -- to 
finance a drug habit and ultimately his friendship with Palacios. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Peace secured the judge's permission to show jurors a photo Piroli 
had of Palacios clad only in swim trunks, although Steele said he will not let 
a police officer testify that Palacios is a male prostitute unless Peace 
presents evidence of a criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 And she will be allowed to introduce testimony about the drugs found in 
Piroli's church-owned car. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither attorney is expected to talk much about the case outside court. Steele 
imposed a gag order on them last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the sins alluded to in court in the Piroli case -- embezzlement, drug 
use, immigrant smuggling -- will reach the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 But the revelations following Piroli's 1992 arrest and the countercharges he 
flung at his former superior last week have saddened his former parishioners, 
church officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 As the trial unfolds, Piroli's former flock is ready to forgive and forget, 
said Father Dennis Mongrain, the new head pastor at St. Peter Claver. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church is a community of human people, and we are all weak and wounded in 
our lives. We need God's help and his healing," Mongrain said in an interview 
last week. "When we look at Father Dave and Father Jim, we see a little of 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Parishioners seem to be praying for Piroli and McKeon, particularly in light 
of last week's allegations, said Richard Hamm, the parish deacon. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the priests are no longer with the parish -- Piroli was suspended 
following his arrest and McKeon was transferred in June to a post as senior 
priest at St. Jude's Catholic Church in Westlake Village -- the people are 
distancing themselves from the case, Hamm said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a long time in people's lives, and time heals," he said. "It's 
becoming the idea that this is happening some place else and not to us as 
individuals. . . . It will be a real blessing when this is over and we can get 
on with our parish life." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the church seems to be prospering in the wake of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Parish enrollment is up from 1,500 families to 2,000, and the parish seems 
filled with new life, Hamm said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mongrain has formed new volunteer and social groups for children and 
teen-agers in the parish, stabilized the church's financial keel and generally 
injected new life into the community, Hamm said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be a real resurgence in the fellowship of the people," Hamm 
said last week. "We've got choirs at all the Masses now, and there's a real 
enthusiasm for the services themselves. He's very good. . . . I think our 
parish has healed itself pretty much." 
</P>
<P>
 Mongrain came in at a time when McKeon, who founded St. Peter Claver Church 
nearly 22 years ago, was probably ready to leave, Hamm said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he started the parish in 1972, he was very active and very much like 
Father Dennis is now," Hamm said. But growing health problems for the elder 
priest, now well into his 60s, began impairing his ability to lead the 
congregation effectively, Hamm said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the church was in itself ready for change," said Jim Carper, 
president of the parish council. "What happened was shocking, but I think the 
groundwork has been laid for the growth. With Father Dennis arriving on the 
scene, it was like Shakespeare arriving at the Elizabethan theater. . . . I 
just think the time was ripe." 
</P>
<P>
 Mongrain agreed that the church was ready for change inside and out. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, it has received new carpeting, a fresh coat of paint and a 
grassy front lawn where weeds once poked up through hard-baked dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many signs of life now," the pastor said. "The church is nearly 
filled at all the Masses. Collections are up again. People are confident we're 
growing again." 
</P>
<P>
 It also wants to restore people's faith in the church's business side. 
Officials have taken to putting out quarterly financial reports and noting in 
weekly church bulletins how much money comes in and where it is spent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the people were closely watching me," Mongrain said. "I felt they 
were wondering -- 'What will this priest be like? What will happen with him 
being pastor here?' " 
</P>
<P>
 As for St. Jude's, McKeon's new parish, churchgoers were dismayed about the 
charges against Piroli and the countercharges he has leveled against their 
senior priest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't appreciate it," one parishioner at morning Mass said Friday, 
declining to give his name. "It's not something I'd expect out of a priest." 
</P>
<P>
 Another said he believed that Piroli's defense speaks of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if I was guilty of something, I'd blame someone else and try to 
divert attention from myself," said the man, a Westlake Village resident in his 
60s who would not give his name. "I'm of the age where I believe priests are 
little more than just men." 
</P>
<P>
 "It just doesn't seem possible that one priest could set up another," said 
John Schmidt, a parishioner from Westlake Village. "You'd hope they'd be above 
that, as priests, especially for the children's sake. They don't know that some 
priests really do have feet of clay -- they're more human than we'd like them 
to be."

DOWNTOWN RENOVATION SLOW GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR., SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a frustrated Moorpark Chamber of Commerce last week abandoned plans to 
stage a weekly farmers market on High Street -- an idea supported in theory by 
a wide constituency -- it illustrated the historic difficulty Moorpark has had 
in revitalizing its downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have for years listed High Street renovation at or near the top 
of their wish lists. But the effort to energize the city's sleepy commercial 
district has been slow and contentious, often falling victim to infighting 
among various factions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main reason that things fall apart is just politics, politics and power, 
pure and simple," said Joy Cummings, chairwoman of the Moorpark Old Town 
Merchants Assn. "The city wants to do things their own way, and they have no 
idea what they're doing because they won't listen to the people who know what 
the street needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings and other merchants formed their group in 1991 in the hope that a 
united front could fight more effectively for the kind of improvements they saw 
as necessary to save their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we were being ignored, and there had been talk for all these years 
about doing something for downtown and nothing had ever been done," Cummings 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 The association made its first goal the addition of stylish benches, planters 
and trash receptacles along the commercial strip. The ensuing battle, Cummings 
said, was indicative of the city's approach to downtown redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 After selecting a design and finding a manufacturer willing to provide the 
amenities for $6,000, Cummings and association members spent two years trying 
to persuade the city to purchase the items. In the end, council members decided 
to go elsewhere and spent $20,000 on other versions of the same items, which 
were installed late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings and some other merchants have criticized the new furniture -- made 
partly of recycled plastic and aluminum -- as unsightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The street-furnishing escapade was a classic example," Cummings said. "The 
message came through to us merchants loud and clear that we don't have the 
class or the know-how to know what is needed downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Paul Lawrason and other city officials disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of opinion," he said. "She was dead-set on a certain style of 
furniture, which we felt aesthetically and technically was not as appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 And while Cummings and other critics say the city has been slow to make 
improvements that would help turn downtown Moorpark into a tourist and 
shoppers' destination, Lawrason said the city has made steady progress toward 
that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have spent more money in that small area than anywhere else in the city," 
he said. "We spent several million dollars to improve streets, storm drains, 
gutters, sidewalks. . . . The city's made substantial investments in those 
public improvements as a foundation for things that are going to happen in the 
future, and people have just simply not considered that and don't care to see 
that the city has moved forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Scott Montgomery said the 10-year-old city has always been willing 
to make the High Street improvements, but has only recently had the necessary 
tools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason that change has taken so long on High Street boils down to two 
things: opportunity and money," Montgomery said. "Opportunity in the sense that 
up until now the city would have virtually had to force private property owners 
to do certain things with their property to achieve that Old Town area -- and 
that doesn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city's acquisition last year of 4.7 acres of prime commercial real estate 
on the south side of High Street -- and the funding of a redevelopment agency a 
year ago -- have paved the way for real improvements, Montgomery said. The city 
this week will consider whether to use one acre of the land for a park. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the acquisition by the city of much of the Old Town area, there is now 
opportunity. The reality is that it will take years, because of money," 
Montgomery said. "The biggest hurdle keeping us from having the Old Town area 
that everybody wants is not conflict, it's not a disagreement in vision; it's 
money, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 Others believe that it may take more than money. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be a more organized group to handle this," Moorpark Chamber of 
Commerce President Francis Okyere said. "There has to be a group of chamber, 
city and downtown merchants formed to move forward with this project. When any 
one of us tries to do anything individually, it's unsuccessful." 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence, he pointed to the chamber's failed attempt to draw shoppers 
downtown with a weekly farmers market. 
</P>
<P>
 Although City Council members, merchants and residents expressed broad support 
for the idea, Okyere's specific proposal eventually became mired in months of 
negotiations with the city and merchants over location and competition with 
existing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the chamber announced that it was shelving the still-popular idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at downtown and definitely everybody agrees that something has to be 
done," Okyere said. "The question is, who's going to do it?" 
</P>
<P>
 While the chamber leader said the answer lies in some type of standing 
committee made up of chamber, merchant and city members, Lawrason prefers a 
less formal approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to get mired into a committee or group situation where 
achieving some consensus is not possible or difficult at best," Lawrason said. 
"We have the responsibility for doing it, the elected officials. We could just 
do a plan, have some meetings, a few workshops and let the public have as much 
opportunity for input and to be a part of it as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Cummings said the battle to revitalize High Street has left her 
frustrated and skeptical of the public process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid to ask them for anything any more because any time we ask them to 
do anything for us, they do it their own way, mess it all up and the street 
looks worse than before," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings, who has owned The Gas Station clothing boutique for seven years, 
said she is dreading a pending city project to install historic-looking 
lampposts on the street -- something the association requested shortly after it 
was formed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am terrified that they are going to tear up the streets all summer, kill 
our business and after it's all done, we're going to have no better street 
lighting than we have now," she said. "Whenever they come in and spend their 
millions, they always end up hurting us more than helping us. I'm past getting 
excited about anything."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; PUBLIC INVITED ON HIGH-TECH NAVY 
DESTROYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Joe Silva, Sunday's tour of the Navy destroyer USS Merrill was an event 
that caused the 70-year-old former Navy signalman to reflect on his service 
during World War II and later during the Korean conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, on vacation from Brookings, Ore., said he read about the Spruance-class 
destroyer's open house in a local newspaper and knew that he had to take one of 
the 45-minute tours of the warship docked at the Naval Construction Battalion 
Center in Port Hueneme on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing gave me the shivers," Silva said. "The technology inside this 
vessel is nothing short of amazing. We were throwing rocks at the enemy 
compared to what this thing can do." 
</P>
<P>
 The open house was a part of the Merrill's stop at the Naval Surface Warfare 
Center -- a tenant command at the Seabee Center that helps engineer and test 
weapons systems, according to Terri Reid, a Navy spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. Steven Busch, the Merrill's skipper, said he was impressed by the level 
of questions from visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been impressed by the turnout and by their interest in the detailed 
workings of the ship," Busch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been fun to show the public exactly what their tax dollars have 
purchased." 
</P>
<P>
 After waiting in a dockside line that stretched along half of the Merrill's 
563-foot length, visitors were taken aboard the high-tech destroyer for the 
tour that gave them rare glimpses of a warship's combat information center -- a 
below-decks room where the ship's automated weapons and radar systems are 
controlled and monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour also included stops on the ship's bridge, its missile bays, its two 
automated five-inch deck guns and an aft hangar that houses two attack 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 Busch said the Merrill, based in San Diego and commissioned in 1976, is the 
first destroyer to fire a Tomahawk missile. 
</P>
<P>
 Its primary mission as a warship is to hunt down and destroy enemy submarines, 
but it has also served tours of duty in the war-torn Mediterranean and most 
recently in narcotics search missions with other federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 15 months, the vessel has been in port during retrofit 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks resident Roy Lewis, 44, said that when he heard about the public 
visitation on a local TV station, he jumped at the chance to go aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't everyday get a chance to see a ship like this up close," Lewis 
said. "I was very impressed." J. E. MITCHELL

 Four Oxnard residents, including the city attorney, were honored by the local 
district of the California Parks and Recreation Society for their volunteer 
services during the society's annual awards dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Gillig, Richard Arias, and Peter and Irene Morales were honored during 
the dinner, held Friday at the Goebel Senior Center in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillig, 48, Oxnard's city attorney since 1988, was chosen for his efforts in 
raising more than $10,000 to renovate the Colonia Park swimming pool, which had 
been closed since 1991 because of budget cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Arias, 43, who does vocational training for the state and volunteers as a 
referee for Oxnard's Recreation and Community Services Department, was selected 
for his work with the youth basketball program at Durley Park. Arias has also 
organized basketball tournaments to benefit youth athletic activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moraleses, both retired, were chosen for their work with Oxnard senior 
softball teams. Peter Morales, 73, worked 450 hours last year coaching the 
league, and Irene Morales, 69, helped to raise more than $4,000 to support the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Morales also spent more than 400 hours as a driver for the city's Senior 
Minibus program, which provides transportation for senior citizens. CHRISTINA

 An 18-year-old Oxnard woman was killed early Sunday after the car she was 
traveling in left the roadway and rolled into a celery field along 5th Street, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Perez was pronounced dead at the scene after she and two others were 
ejected from the car, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other people in the car sustained injuries described as moderate to 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police responded to the traffic accident about 12:30 a.m. Sunday along 
5th Street just west of Victoria Avenue. Investigators could not say what 
caused the car to leave the road or who was driving it. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Deputy Coroner Craig Stevens said there is no indication that alcohol 
played a role in the crash but that toxicology tests would be done on Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, who was sitting in the left rear seat and was not wearing a seat belt, 
is survived by her parents and at least one brother, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other Oxnard residents were also injured in the accident, police said: 
Charles Rosales, 18; Victor Madueno, 18; Perla Ruiz, 23, and Dinnie Franco, 24.

COUNTY ISSUE / BACK-TO-BASICS SCHOOL; THE VENTURA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS 
TENTATIVELY APPROVED A BACK-TO-BASICS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, WHERE CHILDREN MUST 
ADHERE TO A STRICT DRESS CODE AND DO MANDATORY HOMEWORK, AND PARENTS MUST 
COMPLETE VOLUNTEER WORK. THE EFFORT IS THE DISTRICT'S ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE 
PARENTS WITH WIDER EDUCATIONAL CHOICES. DO YOU SUPPORT THE IDEA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joseph Spirito, Superintendent, Ventura Unified School District  
</P>
<P>
 The reason I brought it to the board for their approval was I kept hearing 
from parents about what they would like to see happen in the schools. This 
school will offer more choice for parents. I believe this kind of school 
setting will not only offer parents a choice, but will meet the needs of 
students who need that structure. I'm not talking about going back to the "See 
Dick and Jane" primers. What I'm speaking of is the whole issue of basics in 
education in terms of dress code, homework policy, parent volunteers and 
discipline. Also, a renewed emphasis on basic skills: basic skills in math, 
heavy concentration in phonics for reading and attacking word skills. Things 
that students need before they move onto more complex concepts. We have about 
7,500 K-5 students in our district, and I believe we have at least 300 to 500 
parents who would support this kind of school. The response from parents so far 
has been tremendous, overwhelmingly positive. I've even had parents who said 
they would be willing to take their kids out of private school for this. 
</P>

 John Gennaro, Ventura teachers union president, instructor at Balboa Middle 
School  
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I think it is a great idea. I think that one school will not be 
sufficient to fulfill the need. I know it's turning the clock back a little 
bit, but I think we can afford to do that. I think we need to incorporate 
modern technology and all that we have learned about educating students, yet 
put in a little more discipline. Too many families are so broken and scattered, 
with the parents just trying to hold things together, that they just don't have 
the time to take a more active part in their children's education. I personally 
don't have a problem with limiting teachers to more formal dress. As long as 
people know the rules going in and they sign on the dotted line, then it 
shouldn't be a problem. People keep saying we got this wake-up call from 
Proposition 174, but I don't believe that. The initiative was overwhelmingly 
rejected. But I think that we need to continually be improving what we do. 
Really, until society makes some fundamental changes, schools like this are a 
wonderful alternative. I don't think it's going to be a trend, but I think it's 
going to be another alternative.

 Wendy Lascher, Ventura lawyer, single parent of two students in Ventura 
Unified School District  
</P>
<P>
 Although my children are past elementary school, I doubt that I would have 
sent them to it. They are responsible and flexible and willing to accept 
diversity. It's probably right for some people. But I am uncomfortable with a 
parent being required to volunteer to work at the school three hours a week. 
That is a laudable goal, but it would be very difficult for some families. I 
know from personal experience that my week is so busy, I wouldn't have time to 
put in extra hours at school. I don't think you can say all children have to 
spend the same time doing their homework. Some kids are better able to get 
their homework done in a shorter amount of time. Although I would like people 
to take responsibility for looking better on their own, I am uneasy about 
decreeing what people should wear. We already have too much government and 
regulation. I like the idea of accountability and saying we have standards. But 
I think that the mental set behind this is a reactionary "edge-'em out" 
attitude. It's "Let's have everyone think the same, do the same and follow the 
same schedule."

 Helen O'Donnell, Second-grade teacher at E. P. Foster School in west Ventura  
</P>
<P>
 I don't know that you can honestly get parents in each week for three hours. I 
also don't know if we would have enough work for them to do. I have 30 
students. I know I have lots of things for my parents to do, but I don't know 
if I can come up with 90 hours a week. With regard to the dress code, I would 
like to see a stricter districtwide code put in place. I don't think girls 
necessarily have to wear only dresses and boys wear slacks, but you don't wear 
a shirt that advertises alcohol or drugs and you don't wear cutoffs. I don't 
mind the requirement that teachers dress more professionally. There is a 
possibility that schools with large minority populations, like E. P. Foster, 
could get shut out of the back-to-basics school. Our parents don't always have 
the ability to transport their students away from their neighboring schools. 
The majority of our parents have only one car and are working. I think there 
will be a lot of parents who say, "Yes, this is just what we need." And I think 
there are just as many parents who will say, "Sorry, too many restrictions. 
That's not for me." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Clifford C. Rodrigues, Board member, Ventura Unified School District  
</P>
<P>
 I support the general concept, but at the same time, I have concerns. Mound 
School, which is a magnet school, is not racially diverse. The back-to-basics 
school would also be a magnet school, and I would not want to create another 
situation like Mound. Parents who live in poor areas usually aren't able to 
transport their kids across town to go to magnet school. And poor parents who 
work all day can't take time off to volunteer at school. We want all kids to 
have access to this back-to-basics school, but I don't think this would readily 
achieve that. If we decide to achieve equity by busing kids, that would take a 
big chunk out of the budget. I don't think it is Dr. Spirito's intention to 
segregate students, but I am concerned that is what might happen. These 
concerns need to be taken into consideration.

 A Simi Valley junior high school student faces expulsion after being caught on 
campus selling LSD to 10 fellow students, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Sequoia Junior High School learned of the drug sales when several 
students told them that rumors about them had been circulating on campus.After 
investigating, Simi Valley police said they would allow the school district to 
discipline the children involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 students caught buying the powerful hallucinogen have already been 
suspended, and some were transferred to other schools, school board President 
Carla Kurachi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We treat this kind of thing very seriously," Kurachi said. "We don't want 
kids selling and we don't want them buying. It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
 Sequoia Principal Jan Britz said she was disturbed by the incident but was 
relieved that when confronted about the drug activity, the students involved 
were truthful. 
</P>
<P>
 "They pretty much owned up to it," Britz said. "We were very pleased with the 
way they handled it because the school has always tried to make sure that 
students come forward, even if they've made mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the fate of the student caught selling the drugs, Kurachi said the 
school board faces a difficult decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very serious matter to kick education away from a kid," Kurachi said. 
"It may be best for the kid to keep him in school, but you have to weigh that 
against the message you are sending to the other kids. We can't just look 
away." MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COUNTY, CITY READY TO EXTEND 
REDEVELOPMENT 
</P>

<P>
 With last-minute glitches finally resolved, the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors and Thousand Oaks City Council are poised to approve a contract 
that allows the city to extend the life of its downtown Redevelopment Agency 
until 2023. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors and council will vote on the contract Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement calls for the Redevelopment Agency to give the county some of 
the property tax dollars it collects from businesses along Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard. The county's receipts will increase steadily as the Redevelopment 
Agency takes in more money, jumping in stages from 20% to 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redevelopment Agency will also send some money to the local school and 
park districts. The rest will pay for city improvement projects, including a 
stadium at Westlake High School and a theater at Newbury Park High School. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials had objected to the city's plans because they feared the 
Redevelopment Agency would divert scarce tax dollars from flood control, fire 
protection and other vital services. But they agreed in principle to the 
contract granting them a certain percentage of the Redevelopment Agency's 
receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one thought we could do it, but we did," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "We 
were able to reach an agreement. It's just wonderful, because it allows us to 
start working on the theater and stadium immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 The Redevelopment Agency is set to expire in 2008, but it will be extended an 
extra 15 years. STEPHANIE SIMON

 East Ventura County sheriff's detectives are looking for help from the public 
to solve several recent thefts, including the theft of a hot-air balloon from a 
Newbury Park apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives are offering a $1,000 reward for information that would solve the 
theft of the balloon, which was packed in a jet-ski trailer in the carport of 
the apartment complex in the 1800 block of West Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Between Jan. 8 and 10, someone cut the chains locking the multicolored balloon 
and its basket to the carport, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives also are offering $1,000 for information leading to the arrest of 
three bicycle thieves who most recently forced the lock off a blue-green Huffy 
at 2:30 a.m. Jan. 6 from Spring Road in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Both rewards are part of the Sheriff's Department's Crime Stoppers program. 
People who call with information may remain anonymous and, if the information 
leads to an arrest with a criminal complaint filed, the caller will receive the 
reward. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crime Stoppers phone number is 494-TALK. MATTHEW MOSK
