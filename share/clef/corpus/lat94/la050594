 Where there are stock traders there's smoke . . . : The old Pacific Coast 
Stock Exchange building on Spring Street was the scene of a historic, though 
little-noticed, reform around 1980 -- one that would seem trendy today. It grew 
out of an atmospheric problem on the trading floor. "From time to time," 
recalls KNX reporter Jere Laird, "there'd be some smoke and a terrible acrid 
smell, like something was burning. We didn't actually have any fires but we had 
several evacuations and the Fire Department came out a few times." 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation eventually determined that the mysterious condition was 
caused by traders who were flinging their cigarettes on the floor, rather than 
stubbing them out in ashtrays, as they paced back and forth during hectic 
sessions. The embers were falling into floor ventilator shafts, igniting lint 
and other materials inside. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was that the Stock Exchange became what apparently was Downtown L.A.'s 
first no-smoking office building -- a tradition that continues in the new 
location on Beaudry Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this policy doesn't prevent investors from occasionally getting 
burned.

 His personal freeway collapse: No sooner did Curtiss Briggs package some 
chunks of the collapsed I-10 and label them "Actual Santa Monica Freeway Rubble 
. . . 6.6," than the magnitude was upgraded to 6.8.

 "It was hard to convince store owners that they would sell anyway because 
people didn't care about the magnitude," the Santa Monica entrepreneur said.  
</P>

 He says he sold about 800 bags himself and donated $670 of the proceeds to the

THE WAX TREATMENT: PRODUCE BEAUTY SECRETS REVEALED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The worst-kept secret of the produce industry becomes public knowledge Sunday 
when supermarkets will be required by the federal government to identify all 
fresh fruit and vegetables that are commercially coated with wax. 
</P>
<P>
 For those shoppers still in the dark at the produce counter: The shine and 
slippery gleam on apples, cucumbers, citrus, tomatoes -- and nearly two dozen 
other commodities -- is not the work of Mother Nature but more like the magic 
of industrial cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
 The new disclosure regulation, in the works for several years, has been all 
but ignored in the attention provided the comprehensive nutritional labeling 
requirements for processed foods that also go into effect Sunday. The U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration will oversee compliance on both the nutrition and wax 
labeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet consumers may find that the wax disclosures will be more prominent than 
the new fine print on soup cans and cereal boxes. All coated produce will now 
carry shelf tags or package labels identifying the presence of a resinous 
covering. In addition, some supermarket chains will post banners with the 
government-required language on waxing and a list of all fruits and vegetables 
that might be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, produce packing companies use a variety of food-grade coatings 
including vegetable-, petroleum-, beeswax-, or shellac-based waxes or resins. 
</P>
<P>
 "The use of wax on food goes back 2,000 years to when the Chinese used to dunk 
things in beeswax or paraffin to preserve it," says John McClung, vice 
president of the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Assn., an Alexandria-based 
trade group. "Today, waxes are used for several purposes, but mostly on 
thin-skinned items to prevent (dehydration) and wrinkling. Citrus is 
thick-skinned but porous and also needs a coating. Wax is used on melons to act 
as a barrier against bacteria and fungus. And, of course, wax is applied for 
cosmetic reasons -- to make produce attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the issue became a concern because of religious and/or lifestyle 
reasons. There was a time when the produce industry used an animal-based wax 
from rendered tallow for fruit and vegetable coatings that would be 
objectionable, for instance, for those on kosher regimens or vegetarian diets. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, research conducted by the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Assn. 
found that no animal-based waxes are currently being used on domestic or 
imported fresh produce. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing was never a public health issue but a consumer-right-to-know 
issue," McClung says. "Nobody has used tallow for a long time because it's not 
as good as other coating agents." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, a 1987 publication by the Natural Resources Defense Council claims 
that produce waxes do play a role in the food safety debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Waxing), in effect, seals the pesticide residues in the food," reads the 
NRDC report. "In fact, some pesticides are even combined with the waxes. For 
instance, waxes applied to citrus and tomatoes may contain fungicides." The 
report also stated that the waxes, by design, can not be washed off.  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, some segments of the produce industry are steamed at the new 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunkist Growers Inc., the Sherman Oaks citrus cooperative, is stuck with about 
$3 million in packaging that can not be used under the new regulation, 
according to Claire Peters, Sunkist spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The packaging will have to be reprinted or additional inserts will be needed 
in order to comply with the law. Both, she says, are expensive propositions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the apple industry, on the other hand, are considering 
whether to discontinue using wax on their commodity altogether. Under the 
regulation, growers can label their produce stating that "no wax or resin" was 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 Local supermarkets have already begun to comply with the wax regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Reynolds, spokeswoman for the Vons Cos., says the chain last week began 
installing posters on waxing. She says that some consumers' buying habits may 
be negatively influenced by the wax disclosures but didn't express any great 
concern about sales losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the regulation comes on the eve of the first harvest of 
California's major summer fruit crop, much of which will be flagged for the 
first time as being waxed.

 A number of the 1994 James Beard Awards, announced in New York May 2, went to 
Californians. The Perrier Restaurant of the Year Award: Spago. Humanitarian of 
the Year: Spago's owners, Barbara Lazaroff and Wolfgang Puck. Outstanding Wine 
Service: Valentino. Wine and Spirits Professional of the Year: Randall Grahm of 
Bonny Doon Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Three winners of of the Beard Book Awards were also by Californians. Fruits, 
Vegetables and Grains: "Faye Levy's International Vegetable Cookbook," by Faye 
Levy. Entertaining and Special Occasions: "Festive Occasions Cookbook," by 
Chuck Williams and Joyce Goldstein (tied with "Celebrations," by Joe Famularo). 
Italy: "Italy in Small Bites," by Carol Field. (Cookbook of the Year was not 
won by a Californian, though: it was Madhur Jaffrey's "A Taste of the Far 
East.") 
</P>
<P>
 Californians also did well in the Julia Child Cookbook Awards, given by the 
International Assn. of Culinary Professionals April 23. Bread, Baking and 
Sweets: "Bread Alone," by Daniel Leader and Judith Blahnik. General: "Fields of 
Greens: New Vegetarian Recipes From the Celebrated Greens Restaurant," by Annie 
Somerville (it also won the AICP's Cooks' Choice Award, voted by the general 
public). Illustrated/Photography "Greens: A Country Garden Cookbook" by Sibella 
Kraus and Deborah Jones. (Again, Best Cookbook of the Year went to a 
non-Californian, Darra Goldstein, for "The Georgian Feast.") Yes, Your Slimness

 "Be strong! You are the Condiment Czar and need not take orders from your 
potatoes (or your toast or your vegetables or your pasta)." Encouraging, and 
characteristically whimsical, words from a quarterly entitled the Dreaded 
Broccoli Newsletter, which aims to encourage better a diet through recipes, 
product evaluations and advice to the Condiment Czar. It's $14 for four issues 
from 121 W. 92nd St., N.Y. 10025. Footnotes to a Nutrition Label 
</P>
<P>
 You may already be intensely aware of the new FDA-mandated nutritional labels 
that go into effect Sunday, perhaps from the TV and radio public service 
announcements, or the note on baseball scoreboards or the postal cancellations 
in some areas reading, "The New Food Label: Check It Out." In brief, 90% of 
processed foods will now have to give more detail on their nutritional content; 
the serving portions the information is calculated for will be more consistent 
and realistic; the source of certain flavorings will be identified for people 
who avoid them for health or religious reasons; and products will be permitted 
cautious notes mentioning links between nutrients and health, if the FDA 
recognizes those links. 
</P>
<P>
 Note, however, that the daily percentage figures for fats and carbohydrates 
are calculated for a moderately active woman or inactive man over the age of 
51; younger people and most men have higher nutritional needs. Nutra-Sweet 
gives away a guide to calculate your needs: call (800) 632-8935. 
</P>
<P>
 Baby food labels will give nutritional information both for babies under 1 
year and those from 1 to 4 years. Incidentally, parents should not worry that 
baby food labels don't give figures for calories from fat, saturated fat or 
cholesterol. That's intentional -- babies need fat to grow. For more details, 
Gerber's has a hotline: (800) 4-GERBER.

 We have no idea why a company with a Midwestern name like Buckeye Beans and 
Herbs, Inc., is located in Spokane, Wash., but it is, and among other quaint 
foods it sells Baseball Pasta (shaped like balls, bats and mitts) a pasta soup 
mix called Extra Innings and Home Run pasta salad seasoning mix. You can order 
by calling (800) 449-2121. A Dressing From the 'Hood 
</P>
<P>
 Students at inner-city Crenshaw High School planted a vegetable garden a while 
ago with the idea of raising money for their college scholarship funds. But 
marketing the produce didn't work, so -- as has been widely reported -- they 
devised Straight Out 'the Garden, a mild garlic- and basil-based creamy Italian 
dressing. (It's made by a commercial company, as health regulations virtually 
require, but it's still their hope for getting to college.) Straight Out 'the 
Garden is now available at about 2,000 supermarkets in Southern California.

BEVERAGE BALANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I must add my two cents to the views presented in "Balancing Act: Matching 
Food With Wine" (March 31). 
</P>
<P>
 I find a good rule of thumb is that the nobler the basic product, the simpler 
its preparation, and the more complex the accompanying wine should be.There are 
few table experiences more sublime than a simple roast pheasant or partridge 
with a good red Burgundy from the northern Cote d'Nuits, for example. I think 
that Claret or older California Cabernet are the finest possible companions to 
roast prime rib. On the other hand, the more complex a dish is, the simpler the 
wine should be. Beef Burgundy will be best served with a young, fresh 
Beaujolais. Pasta with heavily spiced sauce also requires a simple and 
inexpensive wine such as Chianti or Cotes de Rhone, or a California Zinfandel. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest "eclectic" cuisines pose difficult choices for wine aficionados; 
currently fashionable ingredients such as cilantro and chilies are absolute 
wine-killers, as are strong cheeses. What can one serve with "a blue corn 
tortilla stuffed with rare grilled ahi tuna, cilantro, sun-dried tomatoes and 
shiitake mushrooms, topped with papaya and chipotle chutney, and feta cheese"? 
No wine of any delicacy or complexity need apply; it will be overwhelmed by the 
competing flavors. Beer is probably a much better choice, but if you must drink 
wine with these kinds of food, I recommend California Mountain Red.

OF SCHMALTZ AND GRIEVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I greatly enjoyed reading about a rarely remembered Jewish soul food in "Risky 
Gribbeness" by Dan Berger (April 28). My mother would also save the fat from 
her chickens in the freezer and periodically work her magic with an iron frying 
pan and a huge pile of chopped onions.Our family called the cracklings grieven 
, which would sit in a colander on the counter for several days until nibbled 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 However, our primary motivation in preparing grieven was to obtain a jar of 
fragrant yellow schmaltz to keep in the refrigerator for sauteing, for 
sandwiches and for the preparation of the most moist and delicious mashed 
potatoes imaginable. My mother always used schmaltz in place of butter for 
mashed potatoes and we seldom made gravy to go along with them.

GARDEN FRESH; SERVE LIGHTLY FLOWERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recently I had an hour to kill, so naturally I headed for the nearest 
supermarket. Ambling down the produce aisles, the air sparkling from mist 
bursting over fruits and vegetables, I yearned to taste everything. In the 
luxury section I stopped to admire the skinny enoki mushrooms from Malaysia, 
the alligator-skinned cherimoyas from Spain, the lime-green coils of 
fiddleheads from a riverbank who knew where. 
</P>
<P>
 And, what's this? A passel of Johnny-jump-ups! They could have come from my 
grandmother's garden! The price on the small beribboned box made me laugh out 
loud. 
</P>
<P>
 Forebears of pansies and violas, Johnny-jump-ups (Viola tricolor) are as big 
as the tip of my little finger -- although coaxed and force-fed, they can 
become as broad as a baby's fist. The top half of the flower is four rounded 
petals, the bottom petal large and round. Johnny-jump-ups look as though they'd 
been drawn by a child in kindergarten. They have monkey faces that smile and 
wink -- there's even a dot on the lower petal for a dimpled chin. Their faces 
are splashed purple, yellow, blue and rust-red. And when the primary-colored 
paints run low, they are lavender, cream, sky-blue and pink.  
</P>
<P>
 The most familiar flowers are called Helen Mount, and they're yellow and 
purple. King Henry is violet with a golden face and touch of blue. Cutie is 
mauve, gold and cream. Pretty is orangish red, yellow and gold. Yellow Charm 
(aka Prince John) is glowing yellow. 
</P>
<P>
 For centuries, potions and pastes of Johnny-jump-up flowers or leaves have 
been folk remedies for all sorts of ailments. (One of Johnny-jump-up's names is 
"heartsease.") But these days, the plants are prized more for the color and 
charm their edible flowers add to a dish. The flavor is lettuce-y but -- unless 
you have a mouthful of them -- too subtle to notice. Which means you don't have 
to worry about their taste being at odds with other elements in a composition. 
</P>
<P>
 The delightful plants are rarely more than ankle-high, with small, oval, 
toothed dark-green leaves and a tufted creeping habit. In this part of the 
world, Johnny-jump-ups are the welcome flower that tolerates shade.  
</P>
<P>
 As delicate as they appear, they're rugged. Seeing them frolic among 
nasturtiums beneath the live oak tree, I've had to apologize to them these past 
years. Because of drought, I could give only minimal water. I've never 
fertilized them -- that wouldn't make sense without water. But there is plenty 
of organic matter in their soil, which sustains them and makes the most of what 
water there is. And the high shade helps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, Johnny-jump-ups are perennials, but they self-sow as eagerly as 
any annual flower I know. As long as the soil isn't disturbed where the seeds 
land, masses will pop up -- the first flowers of spring.  
</P>
<P>
 The flowers do pop up here and there because when the seed cases ripen, they 
burst and tiny seeds can be flung across the garden. I've just found half a 
dozen plants romping in the lawn, far from their parents.  
</P>
<P>
 You can sprinkle seeds of Johnny-jump-ups where you want them to grow in early 
spring and be rewarded with flowers in about three and a half months. Or sow in 
autumn for the following spring -- but remember not to disturb that soil.  
</P>
<P>
 Refrigerate the seeds for 24 hours before sowing. They need dark to germinate, 
so cover them with fine soil and pat it down to make good connection, then 
cover with newspaper. Keep moist until they've sprouted. If you've sown in a 
flat, set it out of the sun at 65 degrees to 70 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Moisture is the key to success. Johnny-jump-ups grow best in rich moist soil. 
Along the coast, where summers are cool, you can give them full sun. Where it's 
warm in summer, give them bright shade in the afternoon -- perhaps under a tall 
tree. Where summers are really hot, give them bright shade all day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the kitchen, pick flowers early in the morning or within a few hours of 
serving. Because their stems are short, place them in a plastic bag with a damp 
towel and refrigerate. Since they're truly pest-free, I don't rinse 
Johnny-jump-ups before using. Were they to come from a dusty part of the 
garden, I'd pass them through warmish water and let them dry on a towel. But 
too much handling and they'll collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 No two faces in a crowd of Johnny-jump-ups are alike. Here are free spirits. 
Although the gorgeous big fat pansies we know were developed from these 
miniatures, somehow Johnny-jump-ups have escaped the breeders' grasp -- haven't 
been captured in a test tube and recast to anyone's taste.

 Fund-raising dinners can be a real bore. Just ask Robert Bookman, who 
co-chaired last month's benefit for the Los Angeles Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Having supported lots of charities, the Creative Artists Agency agent has 
encountered more than his share of dried-out chicken breasts and bad wine. So 
this year, instead of just another dinner at the Music Center (where most of 
the opera events are held), Bookman's brainchild was a casual afternoon wine 
auction benefit featuring a roster of great Los Angeles chefs and great wines. 
Or as he put it, "a non-traditional milieu." 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown's Biltmore Hotel was transformed into a vineyard with lattices and 
dangling grapes for the party, which was co-chaired by opera benefactor Warner 
Henry, who also owns a wine distributorship. Honorary co-chairs were film 
director/vineyard owner Francis Ford Coppola and former Capitol/EMI chairman 
and wine enthusiast Joe Smith, who also is responsible for all entertainment at 
the World Cup in Pasadena this summer.  
</P>
<P>
 The guest roster was equally eclectic: Sir Anthony and Lady Tennent, Terry and 
Dennis Stanfill, entertainment attorney Neil Papiano, and film producer Larry 
Turman. "It was a good cross-section of people that you don't usually encounter 
at these kinds of things," says Bookman. "Entertainment people, opera people, 
wine and food kind of people, Pasadena kind of people." Because it was a good 
group and because everyone had a swell time, the opera netted about $175,000 -- 
about $100,000 more than was anticipated.  
</P>
<P>
 Bookman thought he knew why the event was such a success. First of all, 
vintners donated wine for tasting, "so you had ample good wine and not schlock 
stuff." Secondly, a lot of really terrific restaurants, including Citrus, 
Patina, Campanile and Rex Il Ristorante, donated really good food. Says 
Bookman: "There was something about the ambience and just the whole Gestalt of 
the thing." In other words, it was fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Silverton of Campanile served this suave, grown-up Scotch caramel ice 
cream on top of apple pie at the Opera party, but it's a star on its own. 
Placing the churned ice cream in the freezer at least two hours before serving 
allows it to firm up and smoothes out its texture.

WINE: DAYS OF FUTURES PAST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The futures market in fine Bordeaux wines -- a symbol of frenzied wine 
collecting for the last decade -- has all but collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying wine futures is a tactic of wine collectors who pay a discounted price 
for wines well in advance of delivery to assure themselves of getting wines 
that will be difficult to find at a reasonable price later on, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
 But the combination of two poor vintages in a row (1991 and 1992); too many 
great vintages of the recent past (1985, 1986, 1988, 1989 and 1990); a weak 
U.S. economy, and the collapse of the complicated system of handshake 
agreements that supports futures deals have left consumers too wary to plunk 
down a dime even for wines with a stellar reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 One Los Angeles wine merchant summed it up this way: "Everybody is loaded with 
'88s, '89s and '90s, so there's no need to buy the vintage. And you're dealing 
in a weak vintage. Plus there is a lot of skepticism with the whole idea of 
futures because of what happened last year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What happened last year is best exemplified by the experience of Los Angeles 
wine collector Tom Pirko, who in 1991 sent off a check for $3,000 to buy a 
number of top Bordeaux wines from 1990, a vintage that was rumored to be one of 
the best of the century. He didn't expect to get the wines until 1993, but he 
didn't mind paying up front because he was getting a lower price than he'd pay 
when the wines were released. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, though, the system didn't work. When Pirko asked Calvert Woodley 
Discount Wines and Liquors in Washington about his order, they told him they 
couldn't get the wine as expected from a Detroit-area supplier, and efforts to 
find it elsewhere at a fair price fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
 Pirko wasn't alone. Oakland-based fine-wine merchant Premier Cru said they 
lost $250,000 when wine ordered from Cloverleaf Market of Southfield, Mich., 
never arrived. And hundreds of others were stung by 1993 collapses in the wine 
futures business. One Los Angeles wine collector said he lost thousands of 
dollars in the bankruptcy of a London wine merchant. Another London futures 
dealer closed after failing to deliver wines. 
</P>
<P>
 Many retailers who wound up with shortfalls absorbed losses as they tried to 
compensate consumers. Pirko, for example, was offered other wines by Calvert 
Woodley. But some buyers simply lost money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of the futures system, though not front-page news, nevertheless 
caused reverberations among U.S. wine lovers. It showed the futures system to 
be little more than a "chain of faith" that fails if a single link breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Barney Rhodes, a Napa Valley wine collector and one of the first U.S. futures 
dealers, says futures began in the mid-1950s, when winemakers in Europe needed 
cash and wine buyers wanted rare wines at a discount and were willing to pay in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back then, a lot of French vineyardists had no cash, and their pickers had to 
be paid in cash each day," says Rhodes, who in the early 1960s imported Chateau 
Lafite-Rothschild. "So some of the negociants (middlemen who buy bulk wine from 
growers to sell lots to other wine merchants) would get them to sell tonneaux 
(96-case lots) before the wine was bottled." 
</P>
<P>
 As futures sales became more prevalent, consumers grew accustomed to buying 
before delivery. The negociants ' price led to a price for each wine offered to 
wholesalers in the United States. These would be passed along to retailers, who 
could post prices for top Bordeaux. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All buyers put down a full- or part-payment based on faith that the merchant 
would deliver their wine. Merchants had faith the wholesalers would deliver, 
and wholesalers had faith the import companies had the right to buy the amount 
of wine they took orders for. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you pay two years prior to delivery, you always get an excellent price," 
noted Los Angeles wine collector Bippin Desai. "The 1990 Bordeaux were paid up 
in 1991 and today the price for every 1990 is 30% to 50% higher, plus some of 
them are not available. The 1990 (Chateau) Lynch-Bages was about $275 (per 
case) then and it's at least $350 today. The 1990 Margaux was $600 to $650; now 
it's about $1,000." 
</P>
<P>
 But Desai is critical of speculators who tried to sell their wines at a profit 
soon after they bought them. And, he noted that some speculators lost money 
when the demand flagged for once high-flying wines. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who speculated on 1986 Bordeaux are losing money on them, says Desai. 
And he says today's prices for 1988 Bordeaux are now even lower than the 
futures prices. "Too many people have too much wine, and this weakens the 
trade," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Futures deals are not covered by state or federal laws, says Manny Espinoza of 
the state Alcohol Beverage Control department, who admits that regulations on 
futures were considered in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were concerned about the potential for fraud," says Espinoza. "What 
happens when the person doesn't deliver on the goods or goes south with the 
money? Basically it's people operating on the honor system, on faith. But there 
were no major problems then," he said, so no laws were enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the bad rap the 1991 vintage has gotten (including the fact that 
weather was so bad in Pomerol that there was no Chateau Petrus produced during 
that vintage), the wines aren't that bad. 
</P>
<P>
 I tasted the five 1991 First Growth Bordeaux two weeks ago and can say that 
they are quite good. The wines are lean but classically made, with nice 
structure. They are quite tart, however, and need time to develop. But they are 
certainly better than the last poor Bordeaux vintage, 1987, and considering 
recent prices for these wines, the $50 retail price you'll pay for a bottle of 
Chateau Margaux or a bottle of Chateau Latour seems a fair price. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reports out of Bordeaux say the rainy weather that hurt the vines in 1991 did 
far less damage in the Saint-Estephe commune, and that these wines fared better 
than those of other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, 1992 was also a poor vintage in Bordeaux -- so poor that 
Alexander de Lur-Saluces says he scrapped his entire production of the classic 
dessert wine Chateau d'Yquem, the top-rated Sauternes. There is also no futures 
market for any 1992 Bordeaux, according to merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 There are early indications that futures trading isn't quite dead, though, 
despite the turmoil of '93. Sources say the first offering of 1993 red 
Bordeaux, which is still in the barrel, sold out quickly and at prices well 
below those of 1990, with great interest shown by Belgian and Swiss buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one of the top U.S. wine retailers, Peter Morrell of Morrell & Co., 
is advising customers not to order 1993 Bordeaux futures. Morrell calls '93 
another poor vintage. "We predict there will neither be great demand nor 
capital appreciation to be realized from early purchase of the 93s as futures," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrell said most 1993 red Bordeaux are better than 1991s and 1992s, but that 
they are still astringent and bitter.

MOTHER'S DAY; THE COMEBACK COOKIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY EPHRON, Ephron is currently one of the producers of the movie A Little 
Princess for Warner Bros. Her last novel, Biodegradable Soap, was nominated for 
a PEN-West Fiction Award. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My grandmother could only make three things: spaghetti, chopped liver and 
cinnamon cookies. She served the spaghetti -- seriously overcooked No. 10 
noodles -- with her special tomato sauce, which we still refer to as "Grandma's 
tomato sauce." It was made with one can of cream of tomato soup, one can of 
milk and a stick of butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Every weekend, I would go to visit Grandma. I'd play canasta with her and Mrs. 
Chaney (the woman who lived in the apartment next door), eat Grandma's 
spaghetti, drink five glasses of apple juice, eat 20 cinnamon cookies -- and 
get sick. Regularly. It was ike a ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 My sisters and I all make Grandma's chopped liver. Once, about 10 years ago, I 
made her spaghetti because some childhood longing for comfort compelled me to 
-- I felt really sick after I ate it. But none of us got Grandma's cinnamon 
cookie recipe before she died, which was the one great thing she made. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after her death, my sister Nora and I convinced Evelyn Hall, the 
wonderful woman who cooked for our family, to try to help us re-create the 
cinnamon cookies. My mother worked full time and had four children, so one of 
the luxuries she afforded herself was a cook. Evelyn was amazing. She was from 
Louisiana, weighed 200 pounds, chewed tobacco after dinner and was proud of 
saying she was " 3/4-and- 1/8 Negro and 1/8 Cherokee Indian," which I believed, 
because she could sneak silently into a room whenever I was doing something 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She was always happy, if a bit gruff, and dinner was always perfect unless the 
Dodgers were losing. In fact, we could always tell by the second course how the 
Dodgers were doing because of Evelyn's mood and the way the food tasted. During 
the World Series (which the Dodgers were in almost every year of my childhood) 
we were sometimes afraid to go into her kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Her fried chicken, her pancakes (her secret was to separate the eggs and beat 
the egg whites separately), her macaroni and cheese, her baked beans (made with 
bacon), her ham, pierced with cloves with a brown sugar crust, her turkey, her 
stuffing, her lemon meringue pie with its golden brown top, her black-bottom 
pie, her apple pie, which was not too sweet and had the lightest, flakiest 
crust (which she swore she made from the recipe on the back of the Crisco can), 
her anything-American-you-can-think-of, are still the best I've ever tasted. 
</P>
<P>
 And because of the years she had spent with my mother, who was a couch gourmet 
(she rarely ever cooked but loved to read cookbooks), Evelyn was a fabulous 
gourmet cook as well and could make bouillabaisse, Yorkshire pudding and 
hollandaise sauce (those signature gourmet dishes of the '60s) with the best of 
them. Evelyn also had another talent -- she could make anything after she 
tasted it once. 
</P>
<P>
 So, one afternoon after Grandma died, my sister and I went into Evelyn's 
kitchen and asked her if she would help us make Grandma's cinnamon cookies. She 
didn't say, "I ain't sturtin' you," which is what she said when she meant "no," 
so we figured that we'd won as Evelyn took down the pale-green mixing bowl that 
she made everything in and put the bin of flour, a carton of eggs, the sugar 
tin, a jar of cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder and the vanilla on the 
kitchen table. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first batch was too heavy, more like a shortbread cookie than the light, 
flaky, cookie we remembered. The second batch had too much butter and brown 
sugar and tasted like Tollhouse cookies without the chocolate chips. The third 
batch was too gooey. The fifth batch was close, but Nora, who was critical even 
at the age of 18, rejected them, saying that they weren't crisp enough. She was 
right. By the sixth batch, we gave up. 
</P>
<P>
 Nora was baffled: Evelyn could make anything if she'd tasted it once. I 
suspected it was because Evelyn didn't really think too much of my 
Grandmother's cinnamon cookies. Compared to Evelyn's cream cheese pastries, 
which were rolled and filled with homemade raspberry jam and topped with 
powdered sugar and toasted walnuts, they weren't much, but, if you were a kid, 
they were exactly right -- a crispy, flaky cookie that crunched in your mouth, 
with a thin layer of air beneath the top crust, not too sweet, and topped with 
the perfect combination of cinnamon and sugar. You could eat about a hundred of 
them. We were sure the recipe was lost, and every four or five years, one of us 
would say, usually when one of our own children was around, "Remember Grandma's 
cinnamon cookies?" 
</P>
<P>
 About a month ago, Anna, my 7-year-old daughter, was bored one day after 
school and said, "Mommy, can we make some cookies?" From the shelf I pulled 
down a cookbook I'd bought at a garage sale. The book was "A Cook in the 
Parlor," an American cookbook from the '40s that has such chapter headings as 
"The Husband Cooks," "The Men Are Wearing Black Ties" and "Cooking in a 
Bandbox" (i.e., a small apartment). 
</P>
<P>
 I found a recipe called "Cinnamon Crisps." The dough took about 10 minutes to 
make. We let it chill for a couple of hours, rolled it, cut it with cookie 
cutters and put the cookies in the oven. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When I opened the oven, I started to get excited, and when I tasted them, 
there they were: Cookies very much like my grandmother's cinnamon cookies 
(except Grandma used to sprinkle a cinnamon sugar mixture on the top). I made a 
copy of the recipe and sent it to each of my sisters. The only word of caution 
that I have is this: Be careful not to serve them with apple juice and 
spaghetti. A COOKIE THAT IS VERY MUCH LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER'S CINNAMON COOKIE

CINCO DE MAYO; CELEBRATING TRADITIONAL MEXICAN COOKING; HOLIDAYS: FOUR LOCAL 
MEXICAN COOKS SHARE THEIR RECIPES FOR A GREAT CINCO DE MAYO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 " Mucho trabajo (it's a lot of work)," says Linda Vega as she pushes an 
extraordinary jumble of ingredients through a giant sieve. Among them are 
pasilla chiles, sesame seeds, almonds, peanuts, raisins, anise seeds, crisp 
fried tortillas, cinnamon, cloves, peppercorns, garlic and onion. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega, 62, is at work in the kitchen of Diana's Mexican restaurant on Pacific 
Boulevard in Huntington Park. What is she making? One more ingredient tells the 
story. It's a circle of Mexican chocolate that deepens the brick-red color of 
the sauce being strained to silky smoothness. This sauce is the key element in 
mole poblano ( mole from Puebla), a dish as appropriate to today's holiday, 
Cinco de Mayo, as corned beef is to St. Patrick's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Cinco de Mayo commemorates a stirring battle between Mexican defenders and the 
invading French in Puebla on May 5, 1862. This aristocratic city is known for 
things other than combat, though. Its greatest contribution may be the ornate 
cuisine that flourished in its convents. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the battle, Sor Andrea de La Asuncion, a Dominican nun from the 
Convent of Santa Rosa, produced the magic mole formula. The lavish stew 
delighted the visiting dignitaries in whose honor it was prepared, and it went 
on to become one of Mexico's most popular dishes. On that memorable day, the 
mole was made with turkey -- one that had been fattened on chestnuts and 
hazelnuts. Today, chicken is more common. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vega is from Guadalajara, not Puebla, but insists that her mole is just as 
good as the original. "I make it the same," she says. For 14 years, she has 
cooked at Diana's, which is one of six restaurants that grew out of a little 
market opened by Hortensia Magana in Gardena in 1969. Diana's Mexican Food 
Products is a busy operation. In addition to the restaurants, it has a central 
commissary, produces tamales and manufactures tortillas that are shipped as far 
as Japan. But there's still room for Vega's brand of individuality. 
</P>
<P>
 She works in the old way, gauging quantities by sight rather than weighing and 
measuring. And she has quite a following. Customers can tell when Vega is away 
because the food tastes different. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega takes almost no time putting together the bread pudding known as 
capirotada. Grabbing handfuls of toasted sliced bolillos, Vega starts the 
layers in a deep dish, tossing in almonds and peanuts, raisins and prunes, 
coconut and cubes of cotija cheese. When the pudding is served, more coconut 
goes over the top along with a sprinkle of grajea -- multicolored tiny candy 
balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, boiling syrup fills the kitchen with the warm, sweet scent of 
cinnamon. Brown sugar cones called piloncillo turn the syrup a rich brown . . . 
but what is that bobbing in the pan? Apples? No. They're tomatoes, which Vega 
will remove before pouring the syrup onto the pudding. What are they doing 
there? " Sabor (flavor)," Vega explains. And, she adds, " tradicion ." This is 
the way it has always been done in her family. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For restaurant service it is easier to boil the chicken separately, then ladle 
the sauce over each serving, but it is much better when the chicken is cooked 
in the sauce. Simply prepare the sauce as described, then combine sauce and 
cut-up chicken in Dutch oven and cook over medium heat until chicken is tender, 
about 45 minutes. Red Mexican rice and refried beans accompany the mole at 
Diana's. DIANA'S MOLE POBLANO

<P>
 1/2 pound dried pasilla ancho chiles 
</P>
<P>
 1 (3 1/4-ounce) circle Mexican chocolate

</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons blanched almonds 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons sesame seeds 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons raisins

</P>
<P>
 1 tortilla, fried crisp 
</P>
<P>
 5 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 (3 1/2- to 4-pound) chickens 
</P>
<P>
 Remove and discard seeds and stems from chiles. Place chiles in saucepan, 
cover with water, bring to boil, remove from heat and let chiles stand until 
soft.  
</P>
<P>
 Place chocolate in bowl, cover with warm tap water and let stand 10 minutes, 
until slightly softened but not dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
 In large, heavy skillet or Dutch oven combine peanuts, almonds, sesame seeds, 
raisins, anise, cinnamon sticks, cloves, peppercorns, garlic and 1 slice onion. 
Cook over low heat, uncovered, very gently 30 minutes, stirring often to keep 
from burning. Place in bowl and cover generously with water. Soak until 
slightly softened, making them easier to grind. 
</P>
<P>
 Drain chiles. In batches, combine some of chiles and some of cooked onion 
mixture, fried tortilla and chocolate in blender and blend until finely ground. 
To facilitate blending, add chile soaking liquid and liquid in which nuts and 
spices were soaked. Sauce should be very fluid rather than paste. 
</P>
<P>
 Put through sieve to eliminate solids. Add sugar and salt to taste. Heat oil 
in 3-quart pot. Add remaining onion slice and cook until lightly browned. Add 
sauce mixture to onion and oil and simmer 15 minutes. Sauce can be prepared in 
advance and reheated at serving time. Makes about 7 cups sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 Cut chickens into serving pieces. Place in Dutch oven and add water just to 
cover. Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer, covered, 45 minutes, or until 
tender. Place serving of chicken on each plate and top with 1/2 to 3/4 cup 
sauce. Makes 8 servings.

 A Lenten dish, capirotada is so popular it is being added to the regular menu 
of Diana's restaurants. Shop for bolillos in Mexican bakeries and supermarkets 
that carry large lines of Mexican ingredients. Add more of the nuts, fruits and 
coconut, if desired.

</P>
<P>
 The wonderful, earthy aroma of cooked dried corn draws you to Rogelio's 
Tortilleria. Once inside, it's impossible to leave without an armful of fresh 
corn tortillas and a sack of Petra Anguiano's tamales -- sweet ones to go with 
coffee, savory red or green chile tamales for dinner or a snack. Women from the 
neighborhood drop in for masa -- lots of it -- to make their own tamales and 
tortillas. One orders 35 pounds, which her husband carries off in a big black 
speckled pot. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogelio's, located on Huntington Drive between downtown Los Angeles and South 
Pasadena, is a shop that is so modest it doesn't even have a sign. The only 
clues to what goes on there are the big corn hoppers at one end of the building 
-- the hopper is no longer used -- and the sacks of corn and corn flour that 
are piled in the yard.  
</P>
<P>
 This is a family business, run by the Anguianos. Petra Anguiano is from 
Guadalajara; her husband, Raoul, is from Guanajuato. The busiest part of the 
day is 4 to 7 a.m., when the tortilla line pumps out the day's merchandise. 
Later on, Petra might spend a couple of hours at the counter next to the rack 
that holds tortillas, tostada crisps and bags of dried chiles. Rogelio's also 
makes flour tortillas, both with and without lard, and sells carnitas on 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 The dish Petra would serve for Cinco de Mayo is, of course, made with 
tortillas. Entomatadas are similar to enchiladas, only the tortillas are coated 
with fresh tomato sauce rather than spicy red chile. The platter is decorated 
so prettily that you can hardly stand to disrupt the artistry. Temptation 
overcomes that feeling quickly, and you find that entomatadas are entrancingly 
light. All that's inside is shredded chicken. On top and round about are 
lettuce, avocado, cheese, sour cream, onion and radish slices. 
</P>
<P>
 For Cinco de Mayo, Petra would also serve rice, beans, flan and, to drink, 
horchata (sweet and made with ground rice) or "una coca ." Entomatadas are 
practical and nutritious, she says proudly, sketching the way the platter 
should be arranged. Best of all, they're " muy facil de hacer (very easy to 
make)." 
</P>
<P>
 PETRA'S ENTOMATADAS 
</P>
<P>
 1 (3 1/2- to 4-pound) chicken 
</P>
<P>
 2 cloves garlic, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 6 tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 3 cloves garlic, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 2 jalapeno chiles, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 bay leaf 
</P>
<P>
 1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce, optional 
</P>
<P>
 1 dozen tortillas 
</P>
<P>
 Lettuce, whole leaves and shredded 
</P>
<P>
 Sour cream 
</P>
<P>
 1 large avocado, sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1 or 2 tomatoes, sliced 
</P>
<P>
 Grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
 Sliced onion 
</P>
<P>
 Sliced radishes 
</P>
<P>
 Place chicken in Dutch oven. Add water almost to cover, garlic and salt to 
taste. Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer, covered, until chicken is tender, 
about 45 minutes. Drain, reserving broth for another use. Shred meat, 
discarding skin and bones. 
</P>
<P>
 Boil tomatoes until softened. Drain. In blender or food processor, grind 
tomatoes with onion, garlic and jalapenos, if desired, to puree. Heat 3 
tablespoons oil in large saucepan. Add tomato mixture and bay leaf. If tomatoes 
do not have good color, add canned tomato sauce. Season to taste with salt. 
Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat each tortilla quickly over burner of range, then fry few moments in oil, 
just to soften. Dip each tortilla in hot tomato sauce and remove. Place some of 
chicken on each tortilla and roll as if rolling enchilada. Arrange lettuce 
leaves around edge of large platter. Place shredded lettuce in center. Arrange 
entomatadas on lettuce. Top each with spoonful of tomato sauce, then with dab 
of sour cream, 1 avocado slice and 1 tomato slice. Sprinkle all over with 
Parmesan cheese. Arrange onion and radish slices around edge of platter. Makes 
1 dozen, or 6 servings.

</P>
<P>
 If there's anything Charlotte Reyes doesn't like, it's what she calls "phony 
Mexican food." So she cooks her own, using old family recipes. And the dishes 
turn out so well that friends tell her to open a restaurant. Several of Reyes' 
recipes have wound up in print -- in a cookbook called "The Stuffed Tiger" put 
out by 97th Street School in Los Angeles. Reyes is a teacher's aide there and 
also teaches art. She's an artist herself, good enough to sell her work. 
Sketches of fruit and kitchen implements decorate her classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 For Cinco de Mayo, Reyes suggests tacos filled with ground beef and finely 
diced potato. "That's the way my grandmother used to prepare them," she says. 
Toppings such as cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, sour cream and a spicy 
salsa are served on the side. The salsa blends three varieties of hot chile, 
which gives it plenty of fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes was born in Los Angeles, far from her grandmother's home in El Paso. But 
her mother, Rosa Jimenez, has passed on many of the old family recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes would accompany the tacos with red Mexican rice, refried beans dressed 
up with cheese and green chiles and a light dessert such as Jell-O or fruit 
cocktail; her family avoids sweets. If it weren't for that restriction, she 
would serve flan. 
</P>
<P>
 To make refried beans, Reyes adds boiled pinto beans to hot oil and mashes 
them until soupy and creamy, working in Jack or longhorn cheese while mashing. 
Then she puts in canned chile strips and more cheese. Reyes seasons the rice 
with onion, garlic salt and tomato sauce and often adds vegetables such as corn 
or carrots. But think twice about adding peas, she warns. "Kids don't like 
them."

chiles, add tomato sauce. Makes 3 cups. Martha Castillo 
</P>
<P>
 Andres Castillo detests chicken. But he loves his mother's pollo en salsa de 
naranja (chicken in orange sauce). "It's the only way he'll eat it," says mom, 
who is Martha T. Castillo of El Sereno. You can see why that would be. The 
chicken is sweet and fruity, covered with a syrupy sauce that turns it a 
vibrant golden brown. As thick as a glaze, the sauce contains raisins and nuts 
along with orange juice, herbs and other seasonings. For a grand celebration, 
Sherry can replace part of the orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Castillo was born in Los Angeles and raised in Zamora, Michoacan. The 
pollo recipe came from her grandmother, who lived in Purepero, a few miles from 
Zamora. The recipe was perfected by an aunt, Eloisa Torres de Mora. Torres 
taught cooking and specialized in this and other dishes from Mexico's alta 
cocina (high cuisine). 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo has changed the procedure slightly. I make it "the lazy way," she 
says. That means using ready-made ground pasilla chile rather than frying, 
soaking and grinding whole dried chiles, as her aunt would have done. The chile 
enhances the rich taste but does not turn the sauce hot. 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo would serve the chicken with traditional Mexican accompaniments on 
Cinco de Mayo. That means beans and rice. Instead of red Mexican rice, she 
would choose a white rice seasoned with chopped cilantro. She also does a red 
rice, cooked with onions, garlic, tomatoes and a cilantro sprig on top. 
</P>
<P>
 The beans would be refried. Then there would be green salad and fried 
plantains. Castillo slices the ripe fruit and fries it in olive oil until 
browned. Guests would drink sodas with the chicken and fruit for dessert, 
nothing more caloric and sugary because the meal is rich enough. 
</P>

<P>
 Castillo usually omits the nuts, but they add a nice crunch to the dish.

HOME COOK: REASONABLE RISOTTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While working on a revision of the "Fannie Farmer Cookbook" recently, I needed 
to find a good, simple risotto recipe. But I didn't want to call for Arborio 
rice, which is difficult to find in some parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 When cooked, Arborio rice is creamy but firm in the center and blends 
perfectly with broth that is gradually added and absorbed by the rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwilling to do without a risotto recipe, I went to the supermarket and bought 
a medium-grain rice, Calrose, which is grown in California. Using this 
inexpensive, easily found rice I made the most wonderful risotto I've ever had. 
</P>
<P>
 With the risotto, I like this lemon pudding cake, which is an old favorite and 
a lovely light dessert. An almost magic transformation happens in the oven, 
creating a creamy lemon pudding covered with a light sponge cake. 
</P>
<P>
 CALIFORNIA RISOTTO 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup medium-grain white rice 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups boiling chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup boiling water 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Heat butter and oil in large heavy-bottomed pot or deep skillet. Add onion and 
cook over moderate heat 2 to 3 minutes until onion is just tender but not 
browned. Stir in rice. Cook 1 minute more, until rice is heated and coated with 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir in 1 cup boiling chicken broth and let simmer until liquid is mostly 
absorbed, stirring frequently to prevent sticking. Add remaining cup hot broth 
and continue simmering and stirring until absorbed. Stir in boiling water and 
continue to simmer and stir. Cook 20 minutes. Taste for doneness. Rice should 
be very creamy and slightly chewy in center, but not dry. Add more hot liquid 
if longer cooking is necessary.

WESTSIDE WATCH: MURAL, MURAL ON THE WALL, WHAT'S THE SAFEST SEX OF ALL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a town flooded10 glossies, one head shot in Hollywood is, uh, turning a lot 
of heads. 
</P>
<P>
 A 100-foot-tall vinyl canvas mural depicting a gorgeous blonde was draped last 
week from the roof of the 9000 Building on the Sunset Strip with the heading 
"No Glove, No Love." 
</P>
<P>
 Artist Mike McNeilly says he hopes his work, which cost about $50,000 and took 
30 days to produce, will spread AIDS awareness among teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such a resurgence of comic book, cartoon characters and I felt this 
was the best way to send a message to young people," McNeilly said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom of the mural lists the toll-free number of one of the project's 
sponsors, AIDS Project Los Angeles, a nonprofit health organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization and McNeilly say they have received dozens of calls 
complimenting the mural. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's expression, McNeilly said, is meant to convey a mixture of passion 
and doubt at that moment when fateful decisions on sexual relations are made. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (the public) are her lover, and when faced with such a situation we have 
to decide before going any further."

 DEJA VU: Talk about a stroll down memory lane. There was state Sen. Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica), front row center at the Odyssey Theatre, watching a stage 
actor portray him as a criminal defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 A politician's worst nightmare? 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly. It was a special performance Monday of "The Chicago Eight 
Conspiracy Trial" -- presented as a fund-raiser for Hayden's gubernatorial 
campaign. Another former Chicago Eight defendant -- UCLA professor John Froines 
-- was also there. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast was duly impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the actor who portrays Hayden was heard to ask the senator, "Was I 
OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 A prosecutor, whose role was particularly convincing, said: "I'm really a 
Democrat, you know."

 NAME FROM THE PAST: Venice attorney Mike Sidley, who is running against state 
Sen. Ralph Dills (D-Gardena) in the June 7 primary, got a recent endorsement 
from a familiar name: Ford Roosevelt, grandson of President Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
 The endorsement helps the candidate bring up the Sacramento tenure of Dills, 
whose district includes Venice, Westchester and Marina del Rey. Ford Roosevelt 
"pointed out that Dills was first elected to the California state Legislature 
in 1938, during his grandfather's second term in office," according to a press 
release from Sidley's office. 
</P>
<P>
 But the endorsement does not seem to ruffle any feathers in the Dills 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "So?" responded Tim Mock, Dills' campaign manager. "I don't get the point." 
</P>
<P>
 Mock added that Dills' 50-plus years of experience in politics is "a benefit 
to the South Bay." 
</P>
<P>
 Dills, in fact, met FDR as a young state lawmaker.

 LOCKYER'S HELP: And speaking of Dills, state Senate President Pro Tem Bill 
Lockyer (D-Hayward) has thrown his support behind the Gardena Democrat in the 
June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer criticized another of Dills' opponents, Torrance Councilman George 
Nakano, a Japanese American, for running against Dills in the primary. Dills 
has long been personally and politically allied with Japanese Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I have heard is that council member Nakano is a very fine person," 
Lockyer said. But he noted that Dills was vilified by colleagues in 1943 when 
he was a state assemblyman for opposing Japanese internment camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something wrong about terminating" Dills' career when it is "about to 
end anyway because of term limits -- by someone who is from the (Japanese 
American) community," Lockyer said. "People's memories should not be so short." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakano, who was in a relocation camp for four years during World War II, 
called Lockyer's comment "a very condescending remark." 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone took a strong stand against women's rights, does that mean a woman 
shouldn't be able to run against them?" Nakano asked.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: CELLULAR-TOTING POSTAL CARRIERS GET A DIRECT LINE TO 
CRIME-FIGHTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 POSTAL POSSE: Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night will stay a 
couple of Redondo Beach mail carriers from the swift completion of their 
appointed rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But a run-down battery in a cellular phone might temporarily keep them from 
dropping a dime on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 45-day experimental program sponsored by the Redondo Beach Police 
Department and the Redondo Beach-Hermosa Beach district of the U.S. Postal 
Service, two mail carriers have started toting cellular phones to report 
crimes, suspicious activities, hazardous waste problems or any other threats to 
public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 If they see a problem, such as a crime in progress, or notice that an elderly 
person hasn't picked up his or her mail in several days, the letter carriers 
can press a button on the phones, and they'll immediately be in contact with 
the cops. The phones also may help stem the increase in robberies of mail 
carriers in recent years, said Redondo Beach Postmaster John Puskas. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to be our eyes and ears out there," said police crime 
prevention supervisor Wayne Windman. If the trial program -- which the police 
call the "postal posse" -- is deemed successful, it may be expanded to mail 
carriers on all 96 routes within the postal district.

 WELL, MAYBE NOT: Chevron officials say that the news that its refinery would 
change its name from "Chevron El Segundo" to "Chevron South Bay" was a false 
alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement raised eyebrows since the city was named in honor of the 
refinery. El Segundo means "The Second," referring to the oil company's second 
refinery in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 So the company, in a press release this week, clarified the name change: "The 
term 'Chevron South Bay' applies only to their community information campaign 
and was not intended to replace the name of the refinery." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Chevron South Bay" name appears in ads promoting the refinery's new 
reformulated fuels program. Refinery officials acknowledged that at a refinery 
tour two weeks ago, it did not make clear that the refinery officially remains 
"Chevron El Segundo."  
</P>
<P>
 "We consider the community 'second to none' and have no plans to change the 
name," the press release stated.

 PLAY BALL: The hit movie "A League of Their Own" chronicled the true-life 
story of a women's professional baseball league that was launched during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, amateur baseball enthusiasts, including original members of the league 
and cast members from the movie, are trying to recapture some of that past 
glory by launching a nationwide women's league, albeit amateur. The first 
tryouts for six teams on the Westside and South Bay, open to women 18 to 65, 
attracted 20 people at Westchester High School on Sunday, said Tom Duarte, 
president of the National Adult Baseball Assn.'s Los Angeles-South Bay Chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 The hope is that the league -- which includes 42 cities nationwide -- will 
spawn a professional women's league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see it go back to where it used to be," said Pepper Paire Davis, 
a catcher in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League from 1944 to 
1953 (It was disbanded a year later). "We can get back that same enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
 Megan Cavanaugh, who played a plain-Jane character in the movie, will be among 
the cast members who have a team called Pepper's Peaches, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 More tryouts will be held in Westchester this Sunday.

 KILLING FIELDS: For a goat, it seems like a great gig: A grassy, eight-acre 
field in El Segundo with all the weeds you can eat and all the water you can 
drink. 
</P>
<P>
 But the goats, whose job is to crop weeds and grass in a storm-drain basin 
near the airport, have had a rough time. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as eight have been found dead in the last two years, the victims of 
savage dog attacks. Last month, Big Daddy, an older goat, leaped 30 feet off a 
ledge to his death after he was cornered by two dogs, officials said, and Nana, 
a feisty 5-year-old, was injured in her second attack. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, animal control officers have been unable to trap the dogs, which 
they believe dug under a 6-foot chain-link fence to get to the goats. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, they say, peace might return to the grassy El Segundo field. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, animal control officers caught two stray shepherds in a trap on 
the field. The wild dogs were given lethal injections a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the city has repaired the fence, and officials plan to buy more 
goats. At $50 to $100 each, they save the city an estimated $15,000 a year in 
maintenance costs, said city Sanitation Supervisor Hank Schoenmeier. 
</P>
<P>
 And Nana is recovering nicely in a Hawthorne shelter, where she sometimes naps 
with a friendly duck. Officials say she'll soon be sent to an animal sanctuary 
in San Bernardino. QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "And to think it all started when I inherited two horses, a wagon, and a 
shovel . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 -- Linden H. Chandler, on the preservation of 28 1/2 acres of his land atop 
the Palos Verdes Peninsula. The land was appraised at $5 million and donated to 
the local land conservancy in exchange for $1.4 million and tax breaks.

POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: DILLS' JAPANESE AMERICAN RECORD IS PUT ON THE LINE.

ELECTIONS; RIVAL THREATENS SUIT OVER LETTER CHARGING TAINTED BUSINESS 
PRACTICES; BITTER BATTLE ESCALATES IN GOP RACE FOR 36TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
NOMINATION. RON FLORANCE ACCUSES SUSAN BROOKS OF DECEIVING VOTERS ABOUT HIS 
PAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A letter accusing candidate Ron Florance of having a tainted business 
background has escalated a bitter war of words in the Republican primary race 
for the 36th Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance, a former Palos Verdes Estates councilman, threatened to sue Rancho 
Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks after she mailed the letter to members 
of the South Bay Young Republicans last week. The action led to a heated 
meeting between the Florance camp and Brooks' husband, Jim Brooks, an adviser 
to her campaign.  
</P>
<P>
 "You are trying to run a deceptive campaign," Allan Hoffenblum, one of 
Florance's campaign consultants, told Jim Brooks at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 A potentially fractured party could result when the winner of the primary 
faces Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) in the November general election, 
Hoffenblum said. The district is split almost evenly between Democrats and 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brooks' campaign argues that Florance's financial background is relevant. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what a primary is all about," Jim Brooks said. "It's a shakedown to 
determine who is the fittest to go against Jane Harman." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent press releases, Brooks charged that Florance, who owned Carriage 
Realty on the Palos Verdes Peninsula from 1982 to 1988, has been named in more 
than 40 lawsuits in the last nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Florance said that only one of the lawsuits went to trial, and he 
prevailed. Many of the lawsuits, he said, were claims against Carriage Realty 
after a 1984 state Court of Appeal ruling that held real estate brokers 
responsible for disclosing all facts affecting property sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruling exposed Carriage and other firms to a flood of frivolous 
suits, Florance said, and many claims were thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been named in cases involving divorce, suicide," he said. "It was so 
ludicrous, so crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Brooks campaign has also pointed out that Florance is still entangled 
in litigation involving the Wallace Ranch development, an uncompleted tract of 
85 luxury homes that were to be built in the late 1980s on a 24.1-acre site at 
Armaga Spring and Highridge roads in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 If Florance has to testify in a trial scheduled for October, Brooks said, he 
would be a weak opponent against Harman with the November general election just 
around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, Florance and two partners are seeking at least $900,000 from 
Peninsula Wallace Partners, the company to whom they sold the Wallace Ranch 
development in 1988. Florance said that at the time of the sale, the buyers 
agreed to take responsibility for a disputed contract with Coast Construction 
Co. of Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast, which was to have been the general contractor, was dropped from the 
project in 1988, and sought to recover more than $3 million in damages. 
Peninsula Wallace Partners, which includes developer Ed Miller and the Japanese 
bank Mitsui Fudosan, refused to settle the dispute, and Coast sought to recover 
damages from Florance and his partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance and his partners settled with Coast for $900,000 in September, but 
then sued Peninsula Wallace Partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is they knew full well about the controversy over the contract," 
Florance said. "We pointed that out to them. . . . They assumed responsibility 
for the contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Florance said that the Brooks campaign has been relying on "bum research" to 
hang a shady business background on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the shady real estate deal in all of this?" Florance asked. "This is a 
desperate act. It is not right." 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting last week, Florance offered not to mention his opponent if 
Brooks did the same. Brooks did not accept the offer. In a press release issued 
Monday, the campaign again brought up litigation involving Florance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We absolutely will not use any gutter tactics," Jim Brooks said, but the 
campaign will continue to give voters information to help them choose the best 
candidate to run against Harman. "You have to look at the whole person."

RESIDENTS CALL FOR CRACKDOWN ON GANGS ALONG HOLLYWOOD BLVD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Shea would like to see Hollywood Boulevard cleared of gang members who 
cruise the sidewalks and streets, blocking traffic and often committing crimes. 
Unfortunately, though, it has been the gang members doing the clearing lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea, president of the Ivar Hill Community Assn. and member of a local police 
advisory group, was walking on Hollywood near Highland Avenue a week ago Sunday 
when, he said, he was attacked by a group of teen-agers strolling down the 
sidewalk. Shea said he escaped by darting into stalled traffic, but not before 
the youths -- whom he recognized as local gang members -- struck him several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess something scared them because they took off running down Highland," 
Shea said. Nevertheless, "it's been kind of scary down there the past couple of 
weekends." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, gang cruising -- a perennial problem along a world-famous 10- to 
15-block stretch of the boulevard -- has lately shown signs of becoming worse 
than ever, residents and business owners say. Some would like to see the 
partial police barricades that are erected weekend nights replaced by a total 
blockade of the thoroughfare then. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang members have been walking in groups along sidewalks, intimidating 
passers-by, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the street, the cruisers not only tie up traffic, but have been linked by 
residents and community activists to other ills such as prostitution, drug 
trafficking and violent crime. Classified police reports recently reviewed by 
The Times showed that the area around Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street tops 
the entire western part of the city in aggravated assaults, robberies and 
rapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Sunday morning, Los Angeles resident Mario Vasquez, 17, was killed at 
Hollywood Boulevard and Van Ness Avenue in what police believe was a shooting 
related to gang cruising. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea said gang shootings near Hollywood and Highland are relatively common on 
weekend nights, when congestion is the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest violence has come despite numerous community efforts to curb 
cruising, including a year-old barricade program. City Department of 
Transportation and Police Department officers typically block one lane of 
Hollywood Boulevard to control traffic, making it easier for authorities to 
check vehicles for violations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nocturnal mix of tourists, residents and gang members, many of whom 
motor in from other parts of the city, has made for an overwhelming exercise in 
traffic control, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of cruisers go (to Hollywood Boulevard), people from all over the 
state," said Detective Kevin Rogers of the LAPD's West Bureau CRASH anti-gang 
unit. "You've got just hundreds and hundreds of cars, which drive back and 
forth hundreds and hundreds of times." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, residents are reviving calls for a total street blockade, perhaps 
from Vine to La Brea Avenue, on weekend nights. They complain that gang members 
are drawn by Hollywood's anything-goes reputation and criminal underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Nudelman, a longtime community activist, said: "All the other 
communities -- Whittier, Broadway, Elysian Park -- have banned cruising, and 
Hollywood has become the dumping ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Several activists and residents said they have asked Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg to address cruising problems on the boulevard. She could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, a blockade was in effect on the boulevard but was dropped 
after complaints from merchants that it kept tourists away, said Chris 
Baumgart, a board member of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and an architect 
of the barricade program. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is evidence that the current situation is not helping business 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Arby's restaurant near Hollywood and Highland closed, and 
company officials cited crime as a contributing factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be anyone who came to L.A. wanted to go to Hollywood Boulevard," 
said William Brusslan, president of the KFF Management Co. in Sherman Oaks, 
Arby's franchising agency. "But not anymore. I think people are afraid to walk 
down the boulevard."

EX-CONSERVANCY OFFICIAL WILL HEAD NEW STREISAND CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A candidate seemingly chosen before the job was advertised has been named 
academic director of the Streisand Center for Conservancy Studies to be based 
in Malibu, winning out over more than 100 other applicants for the 
$70,000-a-year post. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state parks agency, has given the 
job of running the environmental research and conference center to Madelyn J. 
Glickfeld, a professional planner and former conservancy board member. An 
internal memo last fall appeared to say she would get the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The unsigned memo was written more than a month before the position was 
advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials involved in the selection said Tuesday that Glickfeld's 
appointment was not predetermined, and that her professional qualifications and 
knowledge of the Santa Monica Mountains made her the best choice for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not too illogical to assume that after 111 or even 11,000 applications, 
she still might come out first," said Jerome C. Daniel, chairman of the 
conservancy board. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Monday evening meeting that concluded after midnight, the board voted 7 
to 1 to put Glickfeld in charge of the Streisand Center, to be based at the 
Ramirez Canyon estate that Barbra Streisand donated to the conservancy last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Glickfeld, a staunch environmentalist and member of the state Coastal 
Commission since 1987, must also be approved by the Mountains Recreation and 
Conservation Authority, an affiliate of the conservancy. But that approval, 
which was expected Wednesday night, seemed assured because three of the 
authority's four board members have voiced support for Glickfeld. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials said 111 candidates, some of them highly qualified, 
responded to advertisements for the post of academic director. But a memo 
obtained by The Times from conservancy files under the state Public Records Act 
appeared to concede the job to Glickfeld before it was advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-page memo, titled "Ramirez Canyon to Do List," is dated Nov. 2, 1993 
-- about two weeks before the Streisand donation was announced and more than a 
month before the director's job was advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 Tasks outlined in the memo included "consider where to put program manager 
Madelyn and asst." On another page, the memo referred to the "program manager 
(Madelyn G. posn)." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials said they believed the memo was written by a staff 
member of the Mountains Conservancy Foundation, a nonprofit group that receives 
grants from the conservancy and is involved in maintaining the Streisand 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the conservancy board at the time, Glickfeld already knew of 
Streisand's gift and had expressed an interest in running the conference 
center, officials said. She resigned from the conservancy board in November, in 
part so she could seek the job. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the memo "probably should have used terminology that was more 
descriptive of the position and not a person," said Belinda Faustinos, deputy 
director of the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some conservancy officials said Tuesday that they were unaware of the memo 
until a conservancy critic who also had obtained a copy raised the subject at 
Monday night's board meeting.

PLAYA VISTA CRITICS ASK JUDGE TO BLOCK $7-BILLION PROJECT; DEVELOPMENT: SAVE 
BALLONA WETLANDS GROUP ARGUES THAT BUILDER'S ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES FAILED TO 
ASSESS THE EFFECT OF ADDITIONAL TRAFFIC AND AIR POLLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opponents of the vast Playa Vista development near Marina del Rey asked a 
judge this week to block the planned $7-billion project, saying that a study of 
its environmental impact was flawed and that Los Angeles officials should not 
have approved it. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for Save Ballona Wetlands said the study by developer Maguire Thomas 
Partners failed to disclose the cumulative effects the project would have on 
Westside traffic and air pollution.  
</P>
<P>
 Kate M. Neiswender, the attorney, called the voluminous environmental impact 
report "grossly deficient." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the developer and the city, meanwhile, defended the project as 
being environmentally sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The group -- not to be confused with Friends of Ballona, another local 
environmental group -- filed its lawsuit against the city under the state's 
Environmental Quality Act after the City Council approved the project's first 
stage in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, which began Tuesday in Santa Monica Superior Court, is scheduled to 
conclude early next week. A decision by Judge David M. Rothman is expected 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its approval last year, the City Council voted to settle a 
long-simmering lawsuit by Friends of Ballona aimed at ensuring that the 
developer spends up to $10 million to restore and preserve the 270-acre Ballona 
Wetlands on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friends of Ballona, whose settlement agreement with the developer would be 
jeopardized if Save Ballona Wetlands were to succeed in court, has joined with 
the city and the developer in opposing the group's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit represents the last legal obstacle in Maguire Thomas' effort to 
construct what could eventually become the largest development project in the 
city's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Although financing has yet to be arranged for the first stage, Maguire Thomas 
officials have said that progress is being made and that they hope to make an 
announcement in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 The first stage involves construction of 3,246 residential units, 1.25 million 
square feet of office space, 35,000 square feet of retail space and 300 hotel 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Playa Vista would become a community of 29,000 residents, and 
serve as a workplace for 20,000 people. It would have 5 million square feet of 
office space, 595,000 square feet of retail space -- roughly equivalent to that 
of the Westside Pavilion -- and 1,050 hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Playa Vista, which stretches for three miles from the San Diego Freeway almost 
to the Pacific Ocean, would also have its own yacht harbor with docks for up to 
840 boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Civic, business and labor leaders have hailed the project as a potential boon 
to the area's ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents have argued that the project is too big, will create too much 
air and water pollution and overwhelm traffic in the heavily congested corridor 
between Santa Monica and Los Angeles International Airport.

PROPOSALS SOUGHT FOR NAVY LAND; DEVELOPMENT: COMMITTEE DEBATES PLANS FOR 27 
ACRES IN SAN PEDRO. QUESTIONS ARISE OVER PLAN FOR A HOMELESS SHELTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Pedro residents are seeking alternative uses for 27 acres of surplus Navy 
property, as doubt lingers over a homeless project that federal officials 
approved for the site.  
</P>
<P>
 The property could be used as a Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy nature 
preserve, senior citizen housing, Los Angeles Police Department training 
ground, or Habitat for Humanity housing for disadvantaged families, said Doane 
Liu, chairman of the San Pedro Area Reuse Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were among 10 alternatives discussed at a committee meeting last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the plans are preliminary, Liu said, the community is trying to 
develop as many ideas as possible for the Taper Avenue site, which Navy 
personnel will leave when the Long Beach Naval Station closes this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult for us to go much further until we know whether or not the 
property is going to be available for those uses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials gave permission this year to Turner's Technical Institute, a 
South-Central business school, to run a homeless center for up to 880 people. 
But a number of questions have been raised about the institute and its 
application.  
</P>
<P>
 The federal Housing and Urban Development Department is investigating whether 
two large tanks containing aviation fuel are too close to the 140 housing units 
on the site to meet federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is expected to complete its investigation this week, spokesman 
Jack Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Department of Health and Human Services, which approved Turner 
Technical's application in February, is conducting an investigation of the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the homeless shelter plan allege that Turner Technical's former 
executive director, Johnathon Marzet, forged letters of support and falsified 
his educational qualifications in the application for the site. Marzet resigned 
from the institute after the allegations were made. 
</P>
<P>
 The application also claims that the organization has the financial support of 
at least 18 local businesses, but Marzet has declined to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
 Marzet said last week that four shelter agencies in San Pedro have agreed to 
form a consortium to help Turner's Technical run the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nancy Berlin, community services director of Harbor Interface Shelter, 
said although the groups have met with Marzet, none agreed to help.  
</P>
<P>
 The institute's plan seems overly ambitious, Berlin said, and too many 
questions have been raised about the application. "Nobody really wants to move 
ahead until it's all cleared up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marzet met with the San Pedro organizations April 18 after he resigned from 
Turner's Institute, but did not tell them he was no longer the group's 
executive director, Berlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Priscilla Turner, president of Turner's Technical, has declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Marzet, her neighbor in South-Central, said he had not seen Turner for a long 
time and that she was on the East Coast visiting her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Marzet had told The Times it could interview Turner and the the 
group's board of directors last week, he was unable to arrange that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear who is running Turner's Institute. The office on South 
Broadway is often closed. A secretary said Marzet is still working for the 
organization as a volunteer.

CENTINELA SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL LAY OFF 14 TEACHERS' AIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SANDELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Centinela Valley Union High School District said it will lay off 14 
teachers' aides and reduce the hours of 20 others in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board voted 3 to 2 on April 28 to make the cutbacks at Hawthorne, 
Leuzinger and R.K. Lloyde high schools.Administrators said the cuts were 
necessary because of a reduction in state funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The move will save the district about $240,000 next year, said Darlene Daniel, 
coordinator of personnel services. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts will affect programs for academically disadvantaged students and 
those with limited English skills, Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Michael A. Escalante, Ruth Morales and Pamela Sturgeon voted to 
make the cuts. Jean DeSimone and Sheila Stachowiak voted against the layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are lots of areas of waste that could be cut first," Stachowiak 
said. "This just hurts the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 But others on the board said the affected programs need to support themselves 
because of the district's financial difficulties. "These programs need to be 
self-sustained," Morales said. "That was not happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators said the district, on the verge of bankruptcy last year, 
probably will receive $800,000 less from the state next year than expected.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRIME NOT UP IN SOUTH BAY, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The South Bay is one of the safest areas in Los Angeles County, police 
officials told residents who attended the first South Bay crime summit.  
</P>
<P>
 Statistically, crime levels in the area are the same as they were five years 
ago, Torrance Police Chief Joe De Ladurantey told about 60 people at the 
Torrance Cultural Art Center on April 27.  
</P>
<P>
 A panel of eight police officials and seven city officials addressed the 
audience and answered questions. Panel members urged the residents to look 
beyond media reports in assessing the crime in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate good news doesn't sell newspapers or make more people watch 
TV," said Capt. Herb Pettus of the Sheriff's Department. "(People) conclude 
that our communities are deteriorating based on those reports, and that's not 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 Homicides in Lomita remain steady at one or two a year, Pettus said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most prevalent crimes we deal with are grand theft and burglary," he 
said. "Our next biggest problem at Lomita is traffic congestion."  
</P>
<P>
 De Ladurantey said public safety is the most important issue in South Bay 
cities and that police are trying to quell the community's fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Reducing crime, especially among youths, is a joint responsibility for police 
and the community, panel members said. 
</P>
<P>
 De Ladurantey said that by 2004, the United States will have 30 million 
residents from ages 13 to 19, representing the highest percentage of teen-agers 
in history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It lies with each and every one of you to come up with solutions," he said. 
He urged parents to keep their children busy to keep them out of trouble.  
</P>
<P>
 "Make them tired," he said. "Fill the clock."  
</P>
<P>
 A Youth Services Division has been added to the Torrance Police Department in 
an attempt to work with youngsters and dissuade them from crime, he said. One 
of their activities is midnight basketball. SUSAN WOODWARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors will hold a public hearing today on funding of 
lifeguards and beach groomers on beaches not owned by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is facing a $900-million budget deficit, and officials have 
threatened to pull services from Redondo Beach and Manhattan Beach on July 1 if 
the cities do not contribute more money. 
</P>
<P>
 City councils in both cities have refused the county requests for more funds, 
saying that the majority of beach visitors do not live in their cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's 105 lifeguards watch over swimmers year-round on 31 miles of 
beaches, including those in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have said they will find other ways to care for the beaches and 
protect swimmers and surfers if the county cannot. JAMES BENNING

<P>
 Six patrol supervisors from the Lennox sheriff's station have been disciplined 
for failing to prevent a deputies' pre-dawn beer party in Alondra Park that 
ended with a deputy firing his handgun into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five deputies earlier were suspended for one to 30 days for 
participating in or failing to report the party, which was staged by deputies 
who were on standby duty during the Calabasas/Malibu fires Nov. 4.One deputy 
fired one or two shots from his 9-millimeter service pistol during the party. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Jack Scully, commander of the 245 deputies and supervisors assigned to 
the Lennox and Marina del Rey sheriff's stations, said two lieutenants and four 
sergeants were punished with one- to 10-day suspensions without pay. Scully 
would not identify the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although none of the suspended supervisors participated in the beer party, 
Scully said, "they should have done some things to check more closely" on the 
deputies under their command that night. GORDON DILLOW

<TEXT>
<P>
 Inglewood School District Supt. George McKenna -- touted as a hero by his 
supporters and reviled as an autocrat by his detractors -- has been hired by 
the Compton Unified School District as a deputy superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood trustees did not renew McKenna's $98,000-a-year contract in August, 
primarily because of budget concerns. It expires June 30, district spokeswoman 
Elizabeth Norwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Compton, McKenna's job will be to overhaul the city's three high schools, 
which are beset by many of the same ills facing Inglewood -- low scores on 
state standardized tests, ethnic tension between African Americans and Latinos, 
and bilingual programs that are deemed inadequate to meet the needs of 
non-English-speaking students. McKenna will be paid $103,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his first duties will be to equip the science labs at the schools and 
improve the curriculum.  
</P>
<P>
 McKenna, who was not available for comment, came to Inglewood after a 
television movie portrayed him as a hero who turned around a Los Angeles high 
school, and he leaves the city after a stormy six-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 A search is under way for a new Inglewood superintendent. LISA RICHARDSON

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; SKY-DIVING PEN PALS VISIT PUPILS -- BY CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The pen pals of a class of first-graders at South Bay Junior Academy decided 
to drop in for a visit. But Federal Aviation Administration officials wouldn't 
permit it. 
</P>
<P>
 The pen pals are the Sky Hawks, Canadian parachutists who perform sky-diving 
demonstrations throughout Canada and the United States. After corresponding 
with the children for several months, the sky divers wanted to jump from a 
plane and land on the school grounds, but could not get a permit to do so.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the parachutists arrived by car recently to demonstrate their 
equipment and give autographs to the eager youngsters.  
</P>
<P>
 The children tugged at the men's jumpsuits, asked questions such as, "Did you 
ever land on anyone's house?" and oohed and aahed over a videotape of their 
visitors' sky-diving show.  
</P>
<P>
 Dropping toward the ground at 120 m.p.h., the divers join hands and form 
intricate formations, with smoke grenades strapped to their feet leaving 
colorful trails through the sky.  
</P>
<P>
 First-grade teacher Deborah Reedy heard about the diving team after she placed 
an ad for pen pals in a teachers magazine. Her students wrote letters to the 
team, asking them about their favorite colors and whether they saw snakes in 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we received those letters, we were really surprised," Capt. Eric Perey 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 In response, the sky divers offered to appear in person as a side trip from 
their training area in Riverside. The group spends several weeks each year in 
California before the weather warms up enough to jump in Canada.  
</P>
<P>
 Perey said they plan to come back next year and hope their message will come 
by air mail. By then, they may be able to persuade aviation officials to let 
them parachute onto the schoolyard. MARY GUTHRIE

TOPICS / HOUSING; BUILDING A SOLID FOUNDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After building 20 housing developments for senior citizens or families in 
Southern California in as many years, Brentwood developer Thomas Safran is 
accustomed to pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 15-year debate, the Los Angeles City Council in March approved his 
plans to build a 64-unit senior citizens project along the Venice boardwalk 
despite protests from nearby residents who complained it was too dense. 
</P>
<P>
 And his latest project in Carson has been no cakewalk, either. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city known for its heavy industry, he is building a senior citizens' 
complex on the formerly contaminated site of a onetime metal-plating plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers had to dig 65 feet to remove soil contaminated by a leaking 
underground fuel tank before ground could be broken last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a complicated web of financing involving a host of government agencies 
and financial institutions had to be secured before the project, Avalon 
Courtyard, could be built. 
</P>
<P>
 It all took five years, but Safran rolls with the punches. To Safran, 49, the 
Avalon Courtyard project has gone smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's second nature to me," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 His goal is to create low-cost housing indistinguishable from commercial 
apartments, even though he says he could make more money in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled to open in early 1995, Avalon Courtyard blends Colonial and 
Mediterranean designs, including balconies, window shutters and red-tile roofs. 
The building will include a community recreation center, an arts-and-crafts 
room, two courtyards and a subterranean parking garage. It also will feature 
extensive landscaping; utility lines will be buried.  
</P>
<P>
 Safran's philosophy pleased city officials, who selected him after touring 
some of his previous projects and those of six other developers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of (the other applicants' buildings) were long hallways that looked like 
a cheap motel," said Carson Redevelopment Director Adolfo Reyes. "They didn't 
have the personal touch."  
</P>
<P>
 When the project is complete, a resident with an annual income of $20,280 or 
less will be charged $509 a month for a one-bedroom apartment; those making 
$16,900 or less will pay $418 a month. The city will provide additional rent 
subsidies to some Carson residents, although the guidelines have not been 
determined.  
</P>
<P>
 The city will pay about $2.5 million of the $9-million project. The California 
Community Reinvestment Corp. will invest about $2.5 million, and Mission 
Housing Investments, a subsidiary of Southern California Edison, will invest 
about $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "To do these kinds of projects takes a joint effort," Safran said. "You now 
have many more layers of financing." 
</P>
<P>
 Local governments invest in such projects in part because the state now 
requires cities to have a blueprint to provide low-cost housing. Money for 
housing, however, is still tight, and there is no guarantee of a payoff when a 
project is built. Safran will earn a development fee, but the exact amount 
depends on the project coming in on budget. When he manages the place, rent 
increases will be limited to corresponding rises in median incomes of 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is controlled," said Safran, who manages all but one of the 
projects he has developed. 
</P>
<P>
 So why stay with it?  
</P>
<P>
 "Money isn't the only factor," Safran said. "When you are all done, you have 
created a home for (seniors and families)." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, his Sun Valley complex for low-income residents won two awards 
for architectural design from the Pacific Coast Builders conference, a trade 
group that encompasses 14 Western states and the Pacific Rim countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The 241-units, called Strathern Park Apartments, are scattered among 18 
buildings. Instead of hallways, there are staircases or sidewalks to each unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The project also won praise from Los Angeles officials, who had been trying to 
clean up the site, which included several vacant homes and an encampment for 
vagrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartments "have been a very substantial contribution to the 
neighborhood," said John McCoy, director of housing for the Los Angeles 
Community Redevelopment Agency.  
</P>
<P>
 Safran's projects have not always been welcomed. Consider the opposition to 
the Venice complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carson project, however, encountered different problems. There were a few 
delays as workers removed dirt contaminated with gasoline. And Los Angeles 
County health agencies had to approve the work before building could begin. 
</P>
<P>
 The city and Safran do not know how many will apply to live in the p r oject, 
although new South Bay affordable housing projects in recent years have 
attracted thousands of applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 That type of demand would please many commercial developers, who are 
struggling because of a lack of commercial apartment projects. In fact, they 
now call Safran and take him to lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I explain to them how complicated it is -- how much red tape there is -- 
by the time the meal ends, they are not as enthusiastic," he said. "The bill 
just sits there. And they are the ones who took me out to lunch."

COMMUNITY NEWS: HERMOSA BEACH; COUNCIL AMENDS ZONING LAWS TO PERMIT FILMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Film companies are welcome to shoot scenes in Hermosa Beach's photogenic 
neighborhoods, city officials say.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted unanimously recently to amend the city's zoning codes 
to permit filming in and around homes.Officials hope to prevent a rerun of last 
year's battle with residents over the filming of the television show "Beverly 
Hills 90210." 
</P>
<P>
 A Torrance Superior Court judge ordered the show's producers to stop filming 
at an oceanfront home after residents complained that the crews, trucks and 
heavy equipment disrupted the neighborhood. The judge ruled that the filming 
violated city laws prohibiting business activity in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The council said the city's zoning codes failed to reflect the city's "film 
friendly" position. "We just hope if good film companies want to come down and 
shoot films in our city, that they consider us," said Mayor Sam Y. Edgerton.

<P>
 A public hearing is scheduled for tonight on whether to allow an exotic male 
dance troupe to perform at the Strand nightclub in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Manpower Australia, a group of dancers who slowly strip to skimpy swim trunks, 
is scheduled to begin a 10-day stint at the club Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said Tuesday they would not decide whether to change the 
club's entertainment permit to allow such an act without hearing from residents 
near the nightclub at 1700 S. Pacific Coast Highway. The hearing is 7 p.m. in 
the City Council chambers. JAMES BENNING

COMMUNITY NEWS / MID-CITY: SAFETY GROUP LAUNCHES DRIVE TO FUND POLICE 
SUBSTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group concerned with public safety in Koreatown and the Mid-City area is 
organizing a campaign to fund a police substation and community center, 
possibly in a former bank building that is also on the wish list of other 
neighborhood groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koreatown Public Safety Assn. is laying the legal and organizational 
groundwork to raise the estimated $2 million needed to establish an endowment 
to maintain and operate the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The association hopes to acquire use of the building at 1819 S. Western Ave. 
through an arrangement between its owner, the Bank of America, and the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of America, city officials and representatives from the Police Department 
and community groups have had preliminary discussions about using the building 
for community purposes. Bank officials said they are continuing to work with 
the Police Department on the disposition of the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the public safety association's involvement, several neighborhood 
groups, including the Harvard Heights and Western Heights neighborhood 
associations, expressed interest in the building as a community center.  
</P>
<P>
 Joe Ryan of the Los Angeles Community Reinvestment Group, which represents 
five local neighborhood associations and seeks to promote community 
reinvestment by financial institutions under the federal Community Reinvestment 
Act, said established neighborhood groups should be given the first opportunity 
to manage the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan pointed to a January, 1992, statement the bank made to the Federal 
Reserve System's Board of Governors, which states that the corporation would 
consider transferring closed branches to "a community-based, nonprofit 
organization on a case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said bank and police officials told him that the neighborhood groups lack 
the capacity to run the facility, but he said they are missing the point. 
"Institutions have to take a chance on this neighborhood," Ryan said. 
"Institutions not taking risks in this community is why we had the riots." JAKE

COVER STORY; THE SOIL OF TURMOIL; LAND PRESERVE WELCOMED WITH WARY EYE ON DEAL 
THAT SAVED IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The field is awash with vibrant color. Bright yellow mustard flowers stand 
head-high, mingling with golden fiddleneck and a purple carpet of filaree. 
Golden stars, patches of white wild radish and foxtails peek out from the 
native grasses and the barley left over from the days when cattle grazed on the 
land.  
</P>
<P>
 There's no prettier time than spring to view the plants in bloom on the 
Chandler Land Trust, 28 1/2 acres of open area atop the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a clear day, you can see all the way to the mountains and Downtown Los 
Angeles," said Mike Kilroy, vice president of the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land 
Conservancy, as he wandered through the dewy grass recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The property -- 26 acres in Rolling Hills Estates and 2 1/2 acres in Torrance 
-- is one of the last pieces of natural open land in the densely populated 
South Bay. And most of the Chandler acreage is now controlled by the land 
conservancy under a complicated real estate deal settled Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the property was dedicated as the Linden H. Chandler Preserve in 
honor of the 94-year-old family patriarch who has owned the land since 1955. 
The family also owns Chandler's Palos Verdes Sand and Gravel company on Palos 
Verdes Drive East.  
</P>
<P>
 Those involved with the sale -- the land conservancy, the city of Rolling 
Hills Estates and eight members of the Chandler family -- say the land 
overlooking the Palos Verdes Golf and Country Club will remain protected for 
recreational use forever.  
</P>
<P>
 But the deal to acquire the open area is not without controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no secret that Kilroy is a self-employed developer involved in at least 
six housing projects in the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas. Critics say he 
has links to peninsula businessman Barry Hon, who has built residential and 
commercial developments for 35 years. Hon has obtained legal access to the 
Chandler property along Empty Saddle Road, fueling suspicions that he has an 
interest in developing the land.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, attorney Andrew Sargent, an environmental activist, says the 
purchase and sales agreement among the parties does not guarantee the land will 
remain undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
 Acquisition of the property, which is appraised at $5 million, hinged on 
Rolling Hills Estates obtaining $1.4 million in Proposition A funds, the Los 
Angeles County parks bond act. Initially, the conservancy, which put no capital 
into the deal, proposed that it would own all 28 1/2 acres. But the city wanted 
something for the purchase price and, in the end, got eight acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 6.8 acres and $100,000 was immediately donated to the conservancy by 
the trustees, eight members of the Chandler family. Over the next five to 20 
years, they will donate the remaining land to the conservancy in exchange for 
$3.6 million in tax breaks. Meanwhile, the conservancy is leasing the whole 
property for $1 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Those questioning the deal include Rolling Hills Estates Councilwoman Jacki 
McGuire, several residents, and Sargent, who is president of the Coastal 
Conservation Coalition -- an umbrella group representing 11 environmental 
organizations, but not the local land conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 They say the deal was rushed through the City Council during the busy 
Christmas season, without public hearings or formal council approval. And they 
charge that the city paid too much for the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The council) spent more time discussing what we were going to do about 
getting rid of our 20-year-old office furniture than we did on spending this 
$1.4 million," McGuire said. When the council formally ratified the deal Jan. 
11, after escrow had already closed, she alone voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice Singer, who lives near the property on Dapplegray Road, was the only 
resident to address the council that night. He told council members they did 
not have authority to spend $1.4 million without a public hearing. The council 
said it followed both the letter and the spirit of the law, and if it had not 
closed the deal quickly, it would have lost a one-time opportunity to preserve 
the land. 
</P>
<P>
 McGuire and Sargent also question the tax breaks the Chandler trustees will 
receive. The setup is similar, they say, to Barbra Streisand's recent donation 
of her Malibu estate to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. That deal 
sparked controversy when it was discovered Streisand could avoid tax on as much 
as $15 million in earnings, based on an appraisal that valued the 22.5-acre 
property several million dollars higher than an earlier $11.9-million asking 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chandler trustees were on the verge of selling the peninsula land to a 
consortium of Chinese developers for $2.1 million when the peninsula land 
conservancy stepped in with the alternative proposal, McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a value of $5 million, the counteroffer was based on what critics consider 
an inflated appraisal commissioned by the sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked for a copy of this appraisal before the deal, and no one would give 
it to me. I have a lot of problems with it because the city should have 
purchased, with its $1.4 million, more than eight acres . . .," McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Robertson Jr., one of the Chandler trustees, said two other appraisals 
had valued the land at $4.8 million and $6.22 million. The middle value was 
accepted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The appraisal by Mark S. Malan of Long Beach is based on a 28-house 
development, even though the land is zoned for five houses. Kilroy argues that 
the portion of the land in Torrance is zoned "very high density" and this helps 
explain the appraised value. But Torrance planner Cynthia Burgess said Kilroy 
does not have his facts right. The 2 1/2 acres are zoned "light agricultural," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The appraisal also compares the undeveloped land to land with $500,000 homes 
located on the other side of Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilroy said the Chandlers refused to complete the deal unless the appraisal 
came in at a "sufficiently high level." If the value of the land had been 
deemed low, he said, the conservancy and the city would have lost the land to 
the developers.  
</P>
<P>
 Kilroy, 30, who has lived on the peninsula since childhood, often visits the 
Chandler land, the second piece acquired by the conservancy since it was 
founded in 1988. As he walks through the tall mustard, he identifies several 
plant species and stops to chew on a piece of sweet fennel. He also explains 
how the property could have been turned into a profitable subdivision, pointing 
out good locations for houses. 
</P>
<P>
 McGuire said Kilroy's background as a developer, his links to Hon and his role 
as the main instigator in negotiations between the three parties in the recent 
acquisition have combined to raise suspicions among area residents. 
</P>
<P>
 McGuire also questions the conservancy's plans to spend about $25,000 
surveying peninsula residents about whether open space should be preserved and 
how it should be financed. The Palos Verdes Land Holdings Co. Inc., a 
subsidiary of the Hon Development Co., has donated $3,500 toward the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Hon has tried for years to develop a golf course in the Portuguese Bend area 
of the peninsula. The area is subject to landslides, and a building moratorium 
has stymied his plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents fear the conservancy might trade the Chandler Preserve for land 
in Portuguese Bend, about 400 acres of which is owned by Hon. The conservancy 
has proposed preserving this parcel and another 450 acres of undeveloped land 
on the southern slopes of the peninsula.  
</P>
<P>
 Hon was not available for comment, but Michael Mohler, vice president of Palos 
Verdes Land Holdings, and Kilroy deny they have any plan for a land swap 
involving the Chandler property. Kilroy answers critics by saying the 
conservancy is an apolitical organization, speaking neither for nor against 
development, with no formal relationship to Hon. The conservancy has no 
intention to develop, sell, or trade the Chandler land, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Sargent of the Coastal Conservation Coalition said the agreement 
would not legally stop the conservancy from trading the land and has a loophole 
that would allow trustees to lift the development restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I'm wrong," Sargent said, "but looking at the paperwork, I have some 
fears that the land won't be protected. The possibility is there for it to be 
developed." 
</P>
<P>
 Kilroy said the legal documents have a series of checks and balances, 
including several grant deeds and a conservation easement prohibiting 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I defy anyone to come up with a way to safeguard that -- or any -- land 
more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most city officials seem pleased with the deal. "The deal accounts for all the 
reasonable possibilities in the future, and all that are left for the potential 
development of the site makes it prohibitively expensive," City Manager Doug 
Prichard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Barbara Rauch said preserving the land was a personal achievement for 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lived here for 27 years and my children ride horses," she said. "And 
it's such a beautiful area to go ride on because you really feel like you're in 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
 A ravine and a series of equestrian trails wind around the grassy land, 
eventually leading riders to wind-swept knolls. 
</P>
<P>
 The acreage supports skunks, raccoons, opossums, gray foxes, gophers, mice, 
red-tailed and red-shouldered hawks. Peacocks, who also nest there, beg for 
food at neighboring homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Local naturalist Don Gales, who has studied the peninsula since 1955, said 
some plant species, including the Palmer's Goldenbush shrub, seemed to be 
restricted to the area.  
</P>
<P>
 Most open space in the South Bay has been swallowed up by development in the 
past 50 years, said Frank O'Brien, chairman of a citizens' advisory board 
fighting to preserve and upgrade the Ken Malloy Harbor Regional Park in San 
Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have barely one-tenth the amount of recommended parkland for the present 
population, far less than in other American and European cities," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 And growing public awareness of shrinking natural land has led to a surge of 
grass-roots activity throughout the United States, according to the 
Washington-based Land Trust Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance President Jean Hocker said at least 1,000 land trusts such as the 
peninsula land conservancy have sprung up across the country, helping to 
preserve more than 3 million acres of land. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to take action to protect the places where they live and work and 
they aren't willing to wait for government or anyone else to do it," Hocker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many, including appraiser Malan and people who attended the recent dedication, 
praise the Chandlers' generosity.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you one thing. The people of Rolling Hills got a gift," Malan said.

 The family has been a significant landholder on the peninsula since 1926. In 
that year, Linden H. Chandler bought his first parcel from Frank Vanderlip Sr., 
who had been assistant secretary of the Treasury under President William 
McKinley. In 1955, Chandler bought the area now known as the Chandler Land 
Trust from South West Portland Cement.  
</P>
<P>
 "And to think it all started when I inherited two horses, a wagon, and a 
shovel . . . " Chandler said at his birthday party this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Robertson, Chandler's grandson, said as children, he and his brothers and 
sisters played on the land that is now the preserve.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased to be able to contribute to the memories of future generations 
by preserving this piece of our past," Robertson said at the dedication. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, resident Linda Miller, who rides her horse along the property's trails, 
said area residents must keep a close eye on what happens to the land. "It's 
going to have to be watch-dogged. We want it preserved, but we are questioning 
the ultimate motives. If (the conservancy is) acting out of good faith, then 
that's wonderful." Chandler Preserve 
</P>
<P>
 The Linden H. Chandler Preserve on the Palos Verdes Peninsula is 28 1/2 acres 
of open space commonly known as the Chandler Land Trust. Visitors may walk or 
ride horses over the rolling grassland that is covered with wildflowers in the 
spring.

COMMUNITY NEWS / VENICE: POLICE SEEK TRIO IN 3 SUNDAY CARJACKINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A trio of carjackings on the Westside were all believed to be the work of 
three youths who police said apparently stole the cars for the "joy of ripping 
them off." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that they're going to sell the cars' parts, just the joy of ripping 
them off.It's crazy," said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Ted Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
 Two carjackings occurred near Venice High School about 4:25 a.m. Sunday, 
Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first one, the suspects approached a man in a 1994 Ford Bronco, fired a 
shot into the air to force the man out and then stole the truck, Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 minutes later the three, believed to be 17 or 18 years old, forced a 
woman to give up a 1986 Honda Civic at the same intersection, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio drove the Honda to a gas station where they left the car, robbed a 
patron and stole his 1992 Ford Explorer, Sgt. Doug Abney said. One of the three 
allegedly fired a shotgun at the man but missed, Abney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three fled and remain at large.

COMMUNITY NEWS / MID-CITY: MAHONY PRESIDES OVER SLAIN PRIEST'S FUNERAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of parishioners and dozens of fellow clergy bade farewell this week 
to a Roman Catholic priest who was slain last week while vacationing in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal Roger Mahony presided over the funeral Mass on Monday for Louis A. 
Gutierrez at St. Paul's Catholic Church on West Washington Boulevard, where 
Gutierrez had been pastor for nine years before his recent transfer to Holy 
Spirit parish.He was buried at Resurrection Cemetery in South San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez, 61, was shot to death April 26 in a motel room. A fellow priest in 
an adjoining room told police he heard a crashing sound around 6:15 a.m. and a 
slamming door, but police have little else to go on. No arrests have been made.

COMMUNITY NEWS / SANTA MONICA: HOSPITAL TO OFFER FREE HEALTH AIDS FOR WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Women oversee their families' health care needs to such an extent, experts 
say, that they often forget to look after their own health. 
</P>
<P>
 To acknowledge that reality -- and to observe Mother's Day -- the Santa Monica 
Hospital Medical Center will offer an array of free health information and 
services for women this month at the Santa Monica Place shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to draw attention to the health of women, many of whom are the health 
care guardians of their families," said Ted Braun, the hospital's spokesman. 
"Many women are so busy, they forget about their own health." 
</P>
<P>
 The first public clinic, "Body, Mind, Spirit, a Celebration of Contemporary 
Women," will feature free blood pressure tests and screenings for skin cancer 
and other health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 At the clinic, to be held from noon to 4 p.m. Saturday at the mall's Center 
Court, information will be available on breast health, breast self-examination, 
nutrition, maternity and reproductive medicine. Nine female physicians will be 
on hand to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout this month the medical center will sponsor weekly seminars at the 
shopping mall and the hospital on such topics as "Women, HIV and AIDS: What Are 
the Odds?" and "Menopause: Beyond the Myths." Low-cost mammograms will also be 
offered.  
</P>
<P>
 For information on the free seminars or to make an appointment, call (800) 
922-0000.

CITY HALL ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 LOS ANGELES 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has asked the Police Commission to allow off-duty officers to 
wear their uniforms while moonlighting as security guards in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent fatal shooting of a man outside the Hollywood Palladium prompted 
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg to call for permitting private entertainment 
venues to hire uniformed police as security officers. 
</P>
<P>
 In her motion Tuesday, Goldberg said uniformed police acting as security 
guards would help stem problems in the Hollywood theater and movie districts, 
which draw 2 million tourists per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department restricts uniformed moonlighting officers to work at 
high school sporting events and dances, filming locations, movie premieres and 
public facilities such as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Sports Arena. 
BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills' sales tax revenue went up 1.8% during the final quarter of 
1993, taking in about $2.8 million, the city manager told the City Council on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales tax revenue for the last three months of 1993 rose almost $50,000 over 
the same period in 1992. The 1993 fourth quarter take was the highest in the 
past five quarters, a consultant's survey showed. 
</P>
<P>
 "By and large, the Beverly Hills market is doing rather well compared to other 
cities in Los Angeles County," said City Manager Mark Scott. The consultant, 
Hinderliter, De Llamas & Associates, told him that the data indicate the city 
may be in an economic upswing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday approved spending $41,900 for a consulting firm to 
study the impact on traffic of a proposed theater and shopping complex on the 
200 block of North Beverly Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The site is a city-owned parking lot, but officials have discussed developing 
it as a complex that could include 2,800 theater seats and a 
250,000-square-foot department store.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LANE VICTORY UPDATE; D-DAY SHIP BREAKS DOWN NEAR ACAPULCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five days after leaving Los Angeles on a 9,000-mile voyage to England, the 
restored World War II cargo ship Lane Victory and its crew of retired merchant 
seamen has been stalled near Acapulco, Mexico, by a malfunctioning boiler. But 
the ship's 54 volunteer crew members, whose average age is 68, hope that the 
ship will be able to make it to ceremonies June 6 marking the 50th anniversary 
of the D-day invasion on the Normandy coast of France. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prognosis is good," said Bob Lace, treasurer of the San Pedro-based 
Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II, which owns the 455-foot ship. Lace 
said radio reports from the ship indicated that oil had leaked into one of the 
ship's two boilers. Although the leak was repaired at sea, the boiler has to be 
cleaned out with chemicals that are available only in port. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday morning the Lane Victory was 60 miles outside Acapulco, Lace said, 
and was limping toward the port on one boiler at a speed of 5 knots, one-third 
its usual cruising speed. If the contaminated boiler can be cleaned in 
Acapulco, the ship could resume its voyage in a few days, Lace said. 
</P>
<P>
 The veterans group, which rescued the Lane Victory from mothballs in 1988 and 
spent years renovating it, has invested countless hours and hundreds of 
thousands of dollars preparing it for the D-day trip. After numerous delays, 
the ship steamed out of Los Angeles Harbor on Friday while hundreds of 
well-wishers staged a wharf-side bon voyage party. GORDON DILLOW

 Council members voted 5 to 0 Monday to videotape their sessions for play on 
local cable TV.Officials have yet to set a start date, time or channel for the

 The cost is expected to be minimal, officials said. City officials say they 
may use a donated home video camera or buy one. Copley/Colony Cablevision will 
supply technical assistance and videotapes as part of its contract to provide 
cable service in the city.

 FRESH START 
</P>
<P>
 After a disappointing college career, former Serra High football standout Erik 
Simien could have a future in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 At least his agent thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole package is still there," said Erik Aldridge, a Serra graduate and 
an agent for Marshall-Harris Sports Management based in Seattle. "He still 
looks like Charles Atlas." 
</P>
<P>
 Simien, a 6-foot-2, 245-pound outside linebacker, signed a rookie free agent 
contract with the Philadelphia Eagles and survived the cut at last weekend's 
mini-camp. He reports to another mini-camp June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Eagles signed three free agent linebackers and sent the other two home," 
Aldridge said. "(Simien) will play with them in the preseason." 
</P>
<P>
 Simien was a prep All-American at Serra and enjoyed a successful freshman 
season at Notre Dame. But after suffering an injury as a sophomore, he lost 
ground in the program and transferred to Nevada Las Vegas, where he finished an 
injury-plagued college career with a losing team. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldridge says Simien looks at the NFL as a new beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hasn't been this excited about football since his freshman year at Notre 
Dame," Aldridge said. "It's a chance for him to go out there and show people 
what type of player he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Aldridge's other clients have signed with pro teams. Former St. Bernard 
standout Terrill Steen, an outside linebacker from San Diego State, signed with 
the Sacramento Goldminers of the Canadian Football League, and former Dorsey 
standout Beno Bryant, a running back and return specialist from Washington, 
signed with the Rams. PROM NIGHT 
</P>
<P>
 A few Morningside High baseball players apparently thought getting ready for 
the prom was more important than showing up for a game. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Monarchs forfeited their Ocean League game against Beverly 
Hills on Friday because they didn't have enough varsity players to field a 
team. Morningside's prom was Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the guys decided to get ready for the prom," Monarch Athletic 
Director Barry Slocum said. "It kind of hurts when kids put that priority 
before the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills Coach Bill Erickson said his school was not informed of the 
forfeit until half an hour before the 3 p.m. game at Beverly Hills. This was 
after Beverly Hills had changed the starting time from 7:30, at La Cienga Park, 
to accommodate Morningside's prom. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he felt about the forfeit, Erickson said: "Pretty crappy. Our kids 
were all there. The umpires were there. The field was all prepped. The stands 
were filling up. It just stinks." 
</P>
<P>
 Slocum, who was not at school Friday, said Morningside first-year Coach Tom 
Seyler probably could have played the game by bringing up junior varsity 
players, but decided to play the JV game and forfeit the varsity game. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Seyler) has talked about disciplining the seniors who didn't show up," 
Slocum said. "If I had been here, I would have tried to see us take a team over 
there. I hate to see us forfeit. We definitely plan on playing the rest of our 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 The forfeit dropped Morningside to 0-10 in league play. THE FEW, THE PROUD 
</P>
<P>
 Rommuelle Gatongay, who plans to join the Marines after his graduation from 
Narbonne High, will be prepared for at least one aspect of military life. 
</P>
<P>
 Long hikes should be a breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Gatongay finished the Southern Pacific Conference dual meet track season 
unbeaten in the 1,600 and 3,200 meters. He also competed in the 800, winning 
four of seven conference races, and ran on Narbonne's 1,600 relay team. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a super competitor," Narbonne Coach Kevin Matherly said. "He never says 
'Quit,' just 'What's next?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Gatongay's attitude carries over to the classroom, where he maintains a 3.8 
grade-point average out of a possible 4.0. In track, his best times this season 
are 4 minutes, 36 seconds in the 1,600 and 10:18 in the 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Matherly said Gatongay wants to attend college after following his brother in 
the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just became a U.S. citizen two or three weeks ago," Matherly said of 
Gatongay, whose family is from the Philippines. "He grew up here and finally 
got the paperwork done." 
</P>
<P>
 Narbonne, which was 3-4 in dual meets, hosted the conference prelims on 
Wednesday. The finals are Wednesday at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach. HOT 
HAWKS 
</P>
<P>
 The Redondo High baseball team, which clinched the Ocean League title last 
week, has no shortage of standouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior third baseman Steve Rawson entered the week leading the South Bay with 
10 home runs and 31 runs batted in, and has been impressive as a relief pitcher 
with a 3-0 record, three saves and a 1.62 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior shortstop Morgan Ensberg, batting behind Rawson in the cleanup spot, 
entered the week with a .436 average, 27 walks and 21 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 And senior second baseman Domonek Prince was batting .420 with 22 RBIs in the 
leadoff spot after going eight for 11 with seven RBIs last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Coach Tim Ammentorp had to pick a most valuable player, he said it 
would be senior pitcher-outfielder Scott Albin, who brought a 7-0 record and 
three-year varsity mark of 19-3 into Wednesday's game against Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want to lose any of our guys, but losing him would cause us the 
most headaches," Ammentorp said. "He wins." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Ian Herwig (4-2) has developed into a solid No. 2 pitcher for the 
Sea Hawks, despite being hit hard Saturday night in an 11-7 loss to El Segundo 
in the championship game of the Redondo tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was nothing new. In the past two seasons, the Sea Hawks are 0-5 
against El Segundo, coached by Redondo grad John Stevenson, and 38-9 against 
everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Eagles have made it rough on us," Ammentorp said. COLLEGE BOUND 
</P>
<P>
 * Tomika Cantley, a 6-2 center for Gardena High, has signed a letter of intent 
to play women's basketball for Long Beach State. Cantley averaged 13.2 points 
and 15.2 rebounds last season, leading Gardena to the City Section 3-A Division 
final, where it lost to Banning. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loyola Marymount has signed Beverly Hills first baseman Jeremy Booth, an 
All-American who chose the Lions over UCLA and Arizona State. Booth played 
catcher last season, when he batted .562 with five home runs and 62 RBIs. 
Loyola also signed Julie Grieve, a soccer player from Torrance, and Kim Qualls, 
a softball pitcher-first baseman from El Camino College and Narbonne. NOTABLE 
</P>
<P>
 * Harbor College clinched its ninth consecutive conference baseball title 
Tuesday by rallying for an 8-7 South Coast Conference victory over visiting El 
Camino. The Seahawks pulled within 7-6 on Grant Hohman's grand slam in the 
seventh inning and won it with two runs in the eighth. Harbor improved to 
28-12, 18-6 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 * Defensive backs Omarr Morgan of Hawthorne and Pa'a Pepe of Carson and 
offensive lineman John Welbourn of Peninsula have been selected to play for the 
South in the 43rd annual Shrine All-Star football game, featuring the top 
seniors in the state, July 23 at Citrus College. 
</P>
<P>
 * Torrance's Ted Oh shot a two-under-par 70 Monday to lead first-round 
qualifiers in the Pioneer League golf tournament at Griffith Park's Harding 
course. Five more Torrance golfers, including Oh's sister, Julie, a freshman, 
finished in the top 12 to advance to today's finals at Griffith Park's Wilson 
course. ROB FERNAS

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: WORKING MAGIC ON IRANIAN SPECIALTY

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oak is what makes the Magic Skewers: The Manhattan Beach restaurant has molded 
oak ceilings, oak slat walls, oak-framed glass-topped tables and a polished oak 
floor with four Persian rugs scattered about. 
</P>
<P>
 This elegant restaurant, now a respectable 8 years old, was opened by an 
immigrant from Iran named Amir Pourtemour, who had no previous restaurant 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The name Magic Skewers refers, of course, to that Iranian specialty, the 
kebab. With the combo kebab ($13.95) you get a heaping plate of rice pilaf, on 
which rests two long skewers of chicken and lamb flanked by tomatoes and 
onions. The lamb has been marinated in olive oil, onions, garlic, teriyaki and 
Tabasco before grilling. The juicy chicken gets the same treatment, as does a 
Cornish hen kebab ($11.95). 
</P>
<P>
 The mahi-mahi kebab ($10.95) is flavored with lemon, garlic and oil, then 
grilled with tomatoes and garlic. Shrimp scampi here ($10.95) means 10 large 
shrimp sauteed in butter, olive oil, tomatoes and garlic.  
</P>
<P>
 Sandwiches include pita bread stuffed with either one skewer of chicken 
($4.50) or sirloin steak ($5.50). 
</P>
<P>
 The Magic Skewers is at 1126 22nd St., Manhattan Beach. (310) 545-6755.  
</P>
<P>
 Open Monday through Thursday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Friday 11 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., 
and Saturday and Sunday noon to 9 p.m.

 It was 1991, and scientist Simon LeVay was riding a rocket. 
</P>
<P>
 His stunning discovery of differences between the brains of gay and straight 
men had propelled him from the obscurity of the laboratory to the news pages 
and talk shows -- a potent new spokesman for the belief that some people simply 
are born gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleagues at the prestigious Salk Institute in La Jolla cheered him as a 
hero. At gay bars, strangers offered to buy him drinks. The federal government 
stood by with half a million dollars in research money. Friends awaited his 
next move. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Albright, a neurobiologist and LeVay's closest friend at Salk, said: "All 
of us were curious about where he was going to take this." 
</P>
<P>
 LeVay surprised them all. He has ditched the laboratory and, from a makeshift 
office lent by the city of West Hollywood, is carrying out his boldest 
experiment so far. It is the upstart Institute of Gay and Lesbian Education, a 
one-of-a-kind night college where up to 200 gays and lesbians learn about a 
homosexual culture that has been as closeted as many of the students themselves 
once were. 
</P>
<P>
 What began in 1992 as a year's leave of absence from Salk to found IGLE with 
former West Hollywood planner Chris Patrouch has turned into a vastly new life 
for the 50-year-old LeVay. He has swapped scientific dispassion for social 
activism -- in the process, trading a reliable flow of research funding for an 
unpaid job and a trickle of $195 tuition checks. His office staff is an 
answering machine set up in the back room of the city building. 
</P>
<P>
 In LeVay's new life, a major discovery would be finding a home for the school. 
Once preoccupied with unlocking secrets of the mind, he now concerns himself 
with whether the Tuesday night gay literature class can get into its borrowed 
room in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 LeVay is also adjusting to the public role thrust on him after the brain 
discovery turned the shy scientist into an instant gay celebrity. He is still 
not good with names or faces and sometimes worries that he may have cost the 
school support by not remembering people he should have. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a lot more of an experiment, a lot more adventurous than stuff I've 
done in the past," said LeVay, his soft British accent intact after two decades 
in the United States. "For most of my life I've been buried in back rooms. This 
job has been so interactive socially." 
</P>
<P>
 You have to know some things about LeVay's past to understand such a 
turnabout. 
</P>
<P>
 LeVay, who says he first knew he was gay at 13, was in his adult life anything 
but a gay rights advocate. He and his longtime lover, Richard, lived away from 
San Diego's gay neighborhoods and attended gay pride parades once a year. "That 
was the measure of my involvement in the gay community," LeVay said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then Richard became sick with AIDS and LeVay took a year off from Salk to care 
for him. Richard died in 1990. After that, said friend and UC San Diego 
researcher Don MacLeod, "a lot of things changed" for LeVay. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to Salk, where he was known as a top-notch specialist on the 
brain's role in vision. But instead of continuing his work, he turned his 
attention in the laboratory to an entirely new area for him -- the question of 
sexual orientation. Friends said he opened up more about his own homosexuality. 
"I developed a sense of wanting to do something more with my life than I was 
doing before," LeVay said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was not ready for the reaction to his discovery that a tiny piece of 
the brain linked to sexual activity is smaller in gay men than in straight men. 
The finding -- the first evidence of a biological cause for homosexuality -- 
tossed gasoline on the raging debate on whether homosexuality is a matter of 
choice. LeVay was suddenly a nationally known champion of so many people who, 
like himself, had long believed they were born gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrouch, the West Hollywood planner, met LeVay at a meeting of a gay 
political group in 1991 and mentioned his idea for a gay university in West 
Hollywood, the center of gay social life in the Los Angeles area. LeVay loved 
the idea. Weary of growing administrative demands on him at Salk, LeVay threw 
his newfound celebrity behind the college, which he and Patrouch first planned 
to name Harvey Milk University, after the slain San Francisco supervisor 
revered by many gays. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was like a second coming out -- at least a much more public thing than I 
was used to," said LeVay. The two men got permission to use city rooms for IGLE 
classes and in 1992 opened the school that everyone now simply calls "Iggle." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearing the end of its fourth semester, the institute remains ever the 
experiment, surviving on a shoestring and the sweat of a few volunteers. It has 
attracted a devoted core of students to classes in gay psychology and fiction 
writing, and has hosted popular workshops and field trips exploring everything 
from earthquake faults to lesbian sea gulls. The Whitman-Brooks Foundation 
helped IGLE raise $4,500 for scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, progress is measured in wobbly baby steps. The school is not accredited 
and does not yet offer degrees. Enrollment had been climbing before it dipped 
this spring to a low of 50 -- a drop LeVay attributes to disruptions caused by 
the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Although LeVay had hoped for a 50-course curriculum, only five to 10 of the 
12-week classes have typically been offered. The school has no building of its 
own; rooms for classes are borrowed from hotels, other groups and the city. 
LeVay and IGLE board member Amy Ryan are what passes for an administration, 
responsible for everything from dreaming up classes to licking stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 The school marks LeVay's passage from scientist to gay activist. Though he 
still lectures and included his brain research in his 1993 book "The Sexual 
Brain," he has effectively bowed out of the laboratory investigations into 
whether sexual orientation has biological causes. Instead, he is co-writing a 
book on gay culture with Elisabeth Nonas, a lesbian novelist who teaches 
writing at IGLE. 
</P>
<P>
 And more than anything else, he is consumed with getting IGLE off the ground. 
LeVay sees the humble school as nothing less than an engine for social change 
-- a place "to make gays and lesbians into better ambassadors for the 
community." If straight people do not think they know any gays, LeVay said 
between sips of Earl Grey tea, "it's our fault." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say IGLE has created a haven where the spotlight is on the 
contributions of homosexuals and students need not fear what they reveal to 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it has to do with validation and erasing the subtle message that 
mainstream education gives that homosexuality shouldn't be talked about and 
that we're different from 'normal' people," said Tom Chatt, 32, a software 
engineer who has taken IGLE classes in ethics, European film, psychology and, 
now, gay literature. "It's the same reason people want to see gay and lesbian 
characters on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatt said: "If you want to have a gay community, it's important that it's 
more than just bars and a yearly parade." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's unique slant shows up in a course called "Gay and Lesbian 
Self-Identity Through Literature." Here, it is not controversial to assert that 
Shakespeare's sonnets were written to a young man or Emily Dickinson's love 
poems to her sister-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 In one class recently, instructor Luke Johnson, who holds a Ph.D. in 
literature from UCLA, urged his students to mine for gay meanings in various 
works that make no mention of homosexuality. The six students were assigned an 
Oscar Wilde story in which two male friends -- one of whom eventually kills 
himself -- are obsessed with finding out the true identity of the person to 
whom Shakespeare wrote the sonnets. Johnson wants to know what Wilde, 
imprisoned for homosexuality in the 1890s, may have been saying about his own 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did he think it was to be what we call a gay man?" asks Johnson. "What 
are gay men like?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Prone to suicide," answers one student. 
</P>
<P>
 "Artistic. Intellectual. Passionate," offers another. 
</P>
<P>
 There is symbolism in exploring homoerotic themes in the sonnets, Johnson 
tells the class. "They're a puzzle and a mystery and their meaning is hidden to 
us," he said. "There's something about being a gay man that makes you attracted 
to secrets, to unlocking secrets and sort of good at keeping secrets." 
</P>
<P>
 One of society's best-kept secrets, LeVay laments later, is just how many 
important literary figures were homosexuals. "Gay people don't even know that 
stuff," he said. "They just don't ever learn it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the classes deal with gay topics. The school has offered math and 
French -- producing smirks among observers who say gays do not need a special 
school for such subjects -- and may soon provide computer training. 
</P>
<P>
 There was not a single mention of gay themes during a recent 90-minute writing 
session led by novelist Nonas. But IGLE backers say it is important to have a 
"gay-friendly" setting, even when the topic is not gay. "I don't want to have 
to defend my choice of the way I live my life while I'm trying to write 
poetry," said Ryan, a chemist who has taken two classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step for LeVay and his infant school may be the hardest. Having found 
a loyal but small following as an informal adult school, IGLE must decide what 
it will grow up to be. 
</P>
<P>
 LeVay and some other board members favor taking the plunge and creating a 
formal degree program, perhaps only for graduate students. There has been some 
talk of linking up with another local school. But organizers are also nervous 
about giving up an open-door approach that puts a premium on community 
participation over academic rigor. "We don't want to abandon the students we 
have now," said board of directors member Debbi Winter. 
</P>
<P>
 And the school has never fully settled an identity crisis it was born with: 
whether it should concentrate on teaching gay and lesbian studies or simply 
teaching conventional subjects to gay and lesbian students. Even those in the 
gay community who are aware of the school say they are not sure exactly what it 
does. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't have a clear idea of what's going to make us distinct and 
what's going to make people come to us rather than Santa Monica College or 
UCLA," said co-founder Patrouch, who now spends his time tending a new store in 
West Hollywood called Urban Inversion. "The question of where we're going is 
still very much alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Bigger plans mean bigger annual budgets. LeVay figures the school will have to 
raise at least $200,000 -- three times last year's budget -- to hire a 
full-time administrator and maybe land a permanent site for the school. 
</P>
<P>
 LeVay smiles at the thought of being finally able to put up a sign for the 
Institute of Gay and Lesbian Education, marking for its students and the 
outside world this curious little project for which he gave up a career. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a little shingle out there," he said, "even that would be a triumph."

HOMEOWNERS TAKE OFFENSIVE AGAINST GANG VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 17-year-old boy was killed. An unrelated gang gun battle in Pvt. Anderson 
Park left three bystanders wounded. And residents were frightened.  
</P>
<P>
 So members of the Del Amo Homeowner's Assn. invited Carson officials and Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department representatives to a recent meeting to 
discuss how to stop violence in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to stop the killing and the drugs. We want to know from the officials 
what to do about it," said James H. Peoples, president of the association. 
</P>
<P>
 This week the homeowners presented the City Council with a petition signed by 
more than 200 people asking for increased police patrols in the area, stricter 
enforcement of park rules and a limit on the number of people allowed to use 
the park at one time. 
</P>
<P>
 They also want other security measures such as a gate at the entrance to the 
parking lot and a requirement that large groups make a deposit to cover the 
cost of additional security. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Michael I. Mitoma told the homeowners at the April gathering that 
miscommunication between Parks and Recreation employees and the Sheriff's 
Department kept deputies from breaking up the gang that was gathering before 
shots were fired. He said the parks staff was afraid gang members would have 
retaliated against them if deputies were called to break up the party.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our staff got very afraid of the situation and what would happen to them," 
Mitoma said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He guaranteed the residents jammed into the community room that such large 
apparent gang gatherings would not be tolerated in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 When homeowners complained about a lack of responsiveness from the Sheriff's 
Department, Mitoma gave out his home telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also cautioned residents about discriminating against people because 
they look like gang members. In working with people who want to get out of 
gangs, Mitoma said, it's important to allow them to use city facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either they're going to be in a park playing baseball or in the street 
shooting up your kids," Mitoma said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department officials said they understand that the two shooting 
incidents upset residents, but they pointed out that violent gang incidents in 
the area have decreased in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 No shootings have been reported in city parks since the incident, a spokesman 
said, but deputies arrested six gang members at Dolphin Park last weekend for 
consuming alcohol in public and playing loud music. MARY GUTHRIE

BOARDWALK: 2 FRONTS OF OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps if we all lowered our voices, we could get the Venice Beach 
refurbishment plan under way. Mr. Ryavec, we who oppose certain parts of your 
organization's plan are not scoundrels and obstructionists. We have a point of 
view that is shared by a substantial part of the Venice community, as evidenced 
by the heavy turnout and vigorous testimony at recent meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 We are in favor of large parts of the Venice Boardwalk Association's plan. 
Most of us agree that the pier should be repaired. Most of us agree that the 
restrooms should be refurbished (although we don't quite understand how making 
them better will also make them safer). Most of us agree that a skating path 
should be constructed adjacent to the bike path. We can easily settle the issue 
of "dangerous curves" on the bike path -- none of us favor "dangerous curves!" 
Most of us agree to refurbishing the pagodas, though we have minor differences 
on the design of those repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know Jerry Rubin, but I am puzzled by your relentless attack on his 
"plan" on the grounds that it contains large portions of your plan! Why not 
commend those parts of the alternate plan you agree with so that we can get on 
with the improvements? 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us are apprehensive about the entertainment pockets. There are valid 
arguments on both sides -- but it seems to many of us that the pockets are a 
first step leading to licensing and regulation. Surely we can have a civil 
debate on the issue, and come to some reasonable compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 The major source of the recent vigorous opposition to the VBA plan is the 
proposal to spend $1,650,000 on bricking the boardwalk and $315,000 (plus 
installation and wiring costs) on "historic" light fixtures that, admittedly, 
do not effectively illuminate the boardwalk so that they will have to be 
augmented by existing light standards. Your opponents feel that your plan is a 
$2,000,000 raid on public bond money for the benefit of boardwalk landlords, 
and that it will result in a gentrified strip shopping mall similar to the 
Third Street Promenade and Universal CityWalk -- the two ideals that proponents 
of your plan constantly cite. Keep in mind, Mr. Ryavec, that all of us are 
going to pay on those bonds -- not just the landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us would prefer to see that money spent on refurbishing the Pavilion 
so that it can become a major community cultural center. Many of us would like 
to see some of it spent on the Ballona wetlands. Those of us who oppose this 
part of the VBA plan (including, incidentally, many boardwalk merchants) feel 
that it would destroy the special nature of Venice Beach. That those who 
designed the plan spent four years on the task is hardly a reasonable response 
to our objections -- we would object even if you had spent 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 I frankly do not know how to resolve this impasse civilly. Shouting at each 
other is ineffective, and settles nothing. Perhaps we could have a referendum 
-- at least allow the residents and workers of Venice to select a proposal 
either to brick Ocean Front Walk and install the "historic" light standards or 
refurbish the Pavilion. Let's argue about the benefits and costs of each 
proposal, and agree to accept the populace's decision.

<P>
 Who would you travel across the city, state or world to see? 
tattooed-daredevil juggling chain-saws or a man selling T-shirts? The merchants 
don't bring tourists to Venice; the artists and entertainers do. The proposal 
(to renovate the Venice Boardwalk) is another example of crass commercialism 
leeching onto the back of art. 
</P>
<P>
 This is my home. I love Venice and the people that make it special and unique. 
I don't feel threatened by them in any way, but I do find this proposal a 
threat to our uniqueness. 
</P>
<P>
 They can build another Universal City; they can put down a red brick road from 
here to Disneyland, but they won't be capturing the magic of this community. 
They'll be destroying it. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think by now people would have learned that it's just this kind of 
aggressive "improvement" plans that have left holes of extinction in this 
world. And not only have we wiped out species of animals and plant life but we 
were duped into doing it by someone telling us it was for our own good. 
</P>
<P>
 Would anyone suggest straightening the Leaning Tower of Pisa to make it look 
more "appropriate?" 
</P>
<P>
 Would anyone suggest refurbishing the Venus de Milo back to some Hugh Hefner 
historical ideal to increase its value? 
</P>
<P>
 Should Venice be homogenized and sterilized and compromised to line the 
pockets of merchants? 
</P>
<P>
 I say no.

OUT AND ABOUT: CARVING OUT CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than a decade, Floyd Bell has been carving dolls depicting prominent 
African Americans from various historical periods. On Friday evening, he brings 
his works to the Los Angeles Airport Westin Hotel for a one-man show. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit, which includes figures modeled after Harriet Tubman and Frederick 
Douglass, continues from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his childhood, Bell has always liked to work with his hands. He learned 
to sew and make patterns while working at an upholstery company. Then, as a 
student at Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles, he became interested in 
woodworking. His father, a carpenter, encouraged his son to learn the craft. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from high school, Bell followed in his father's footsteps in 
the carpentry business. He returned to the classroom, earned a bachelor's 
degree and teaching credentials from Cal State Los Angeles, and began teaching 
woodworking classes at Westchester High School. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until Bell's wife, Karen, began collecting dolls that he developed 
an interest in doll-making. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people thought it was foolish for a grown man to be carving dolls," 
said the 58-year-old Los Angeles resident. "It made me want to make more 
(dolls) and share my work with people who admired them." 
</P>
<P>
 To produce a doll, Bell studies historical photographs and sculpts clay 
models. He carves the doll from such woods as mahogany and walnut, sands and 
oils it, and dresses the doll in clothing appropriate for the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's craftsmanship and style proved successful. Competing in contests, the 
Westchester teacher honed his doll-making style and has won several 
competitions. The breakthroughs led him to seek a critique by the National 
Institute of American Doll Artists, which evaluates artists' dolls. He is now 
one of only 50 members of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Between projects, Bell finds time to instruct his students in woodworking -- 
and he says, in lessons of diligence, responsibility, pride and citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I am filling a responsibility to educate our children," he said. 
"Someone has to take the time to contribute and pass on values." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit will be held at the Westin Hotel, 5400 Century Blvd., Los Angeles. 
Hours are 5:30 to 9:30 p.m. Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m. to 3 
p.m. Sunday. A scholarship dinner - dance at 6 p.m. Saturday will highlight the 
weekend event. Tickets are $45. Proceeds benefit the Floyd Bell Scholarship 
Fund to further the education of students who are interested in doll - making. 
Admission is free. Information: (310) 535-7526. CHRISTINA V. GODBEY

EDUCATION / MARY LAINE YARBER: HOW YOU CAN REALLY 'GET SMART' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harvard educator Howard Gardner and others have recently suggested that 
intelligence is more than scholarly or book knowledge. There may be seven kinds 
of intelligence, Gardner and others believe. 
</P>
<P>
 In last week's column, I summarized what Gardner has dubbed the "multiple 
intelligences": linguistic, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, intrapersonal, 
logical-mathematical, interpersonal and musical. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're weaker than you'd like to be in a category, there is good news: It 
is never too late to improve in any area. And it's fairly easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Linguistic intelligence, which involves speaking and writing clearly, is an 
area in which many people would like to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Ways to sharpen linguistic skills include reading a book a week, or at least 
one a month; joining a book club and going to authors' readings, which are 
generally free and often listed in Sunday newspaper arts and entertainment 
sections. 
</P>
<P>
 Browse through bookstores frequently, even if you're not going to buy, to be 
aware of current titles and authors. You can get the gist of many books this 
way and by reading newspaper book review supplements. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're short on time, listen to books on tape when you drive. You'll find 
them at most bookstores and public libraries. Keep a "reader's journal" in 
which you record passages that delight, incense or otherwise touch you. Try 
writing letters to characters or authors and rewriting disappointing scenes or 
endings or other responses to books. 
</P>
<P>
 To polish your writing, replace long-distance phone calls with letters. Keep a 
daily diary or journal. Take a writing course at a community college. 
</P>
<P>
 Improving your spatial intelligence, which denotes the ability to perceive and 
rearrange visual details, drawing or sketching accurately and thinking of new 
ways to arrange objects, can lead to some great new hobbies. 
</P>
<P>
 Some suggestions: Play Pictionary and other visual games, or do jigsaw 
puzzles. Read about movie-making, then rent some acclaimed films and examine 
the use of cinematic techniques. Build model cars, ships or airplanes. Take 
some crafts classes or visit art galleries, exhibits and museums. Try to sketch 
objects or people as accurately and detailed as possible. It may take several 
tries. 
</P>
<P>
 Read an introductory book about painting, and then analyze work you see in 
another book or exhibit for color, theme, light, composition, medium and other 
elements. 
</P>
<P>
 A new hobby of mine may also help: Learn about architecture, then name the 
techniques you see as you drive or walk around. 
</P>
<P>
 To improve your bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, those skills involving good 
physical control, you must become more athletic, coordinated or limber. 
</P>
<P>
 Some tips: Learn a new sport, yoga or a martial art. Join a group centered on 
a sport or activity such as a basketball league. Bodily-kinesthetic skills 
include hand-eye coordination, so such activities as carpentry, typing and 
shooting baskets might help too. 
</P>
<P>
 Logical-mathematical intelligence is perhaps the category that gives people 
more trouble than any other because so many falter in math and science. But 
polishing this area can even be fun: Play chess, dominoes, brainteasers (there 
are books full of them) and other logic-based games. 
</P>
<P>
 Read science magazines such as Omni or Scientific American and watch 
documentaries such as "Nova" on PBS. Study the scientific forces that affect 
people nearly every day: oceanography, seismology, ecology, climatology. Write 
out computations that you now perform with a calculator. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people have at least enough musical intelligence to say what kinds of 
music they like. But a more advanced level means that you can mentally "hear," 
recognize and reproduce melodies and rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hints: Play "Name That Tune" with the car radio. Learn a musical 
instrument. Listen to several different types of music; set your home or car 
stereo buttons to a variety of stations. Go to concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't have quite the circle of friends you want, it's time to work on 
your interpersonal intelligence -- that is, your ability to meet and get along 
with other people. 
</P>
<P>
 Some steps: Set aside some time each week in which you can call or write 
friends or relatives. Volunteer for a committee or other group project at work 
or school. Join a club or take a leadership position in one you already belong 
to. When listening to someone talk, maintain eye contact, listen carefully and 
don't interrupt or respond until he or she is finished. (It's called "active 
listening," and is highly endearing.) 
</P>
<P>
 Basic to all intelligences, I believe, is intrapersonal intelligence. That 
means simply knowing yourself (strengths, weaknesses, goals, preferences, 
dilemmas etc.). 
</P>
<P>
 There are several great paths to deeper self-knowledge: Make time each night 
to ponder the day's events and conversations. Keep a journal in which you 
record notable events or sort out problems. Write down and analyze your dreams. 
Seek counseling for nagging problems that you can't seem to beat on your own. 
Write down important goals and the steps needed to reach them. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on the seven types of intelligence and how to improve 
them, pick up a copy of "7 Kinds of Smart" by Thomas Armstrong. It's the most 
concise and practical book I've found on Gardner's theory of multiple 
intelligence.

 TENNIS FINALS 
</P>
<P>
 For 24 years, University Coach Tom Anderson has been battling cross-town rival 
Palisades for tennis supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors, winners of five City Section titles, have the upper hand this 
season, winning the Western League title and earning the top seeding for the 
4-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, the Warriors beat to Chatsworth in the semifinals at the Racquet 
Centre in Studio City. The championship match will be played Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have one of our deepest and best teams ever," Anderson said. "Probably the 
most matured team in terms of well-rounded kids who are students and athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 In a period when top tennis players are flocking to private schools, Anderson 
has a surplus of talent at his public school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors are led by senior Jay Jackson, who was third in City singles last 
season, and Daniel Unger, a three-year varsity singles player. Although the 
Warriors had the talent to compete for the City title, they received a boost 
with the transfer of Aapo Aro from Finland. Aro is 12-0 in singles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is almost equal to Jay and should be one of the top players in the City," 
Anderson said. "He's a wonderful kid." 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors are also strong in doubles, led by three-year varsity starters 
Jason Barkham and Matt Levin. ON TRACK 
</P>
<P>
 Valeyta Althouse and Beth Bartholomew of UCLA were selected as female track 
and field athletes of the meet in the inaugural California-Nevada collegiate 
track and field championships Saturday and Sunday at Drake Stadium. Althouse, a 
sophomore, set a school and Pacific 10 Conference record in winning the shotput 
with a put of 57 feet 9 inches -- the No. 5 collegiate mark of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartholomew, a senior, pulled away with last-lap surges to win the 1,500 and 
3,000 meters in 4 minutes 24.46 seconds and 9:44.22. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruin women won the meet, which featured 21 colleges from Divisions I, II 
and III as well as National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics schools with 168 
points. Fresno State and Stanford were second and third with 93 and 75 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Keisha Marvin won the 400 hurdles in 57.87 and anchored the Bruin 1,600 relay 
team of Shelly Tochluk, Cicely Scott and Darlene Malco to victory in 3:37.71. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott also won the 400 in 53.97 and Karen Hecox (16:24.98), Amy Acuff 
(5-foot-11 1/2) and Candy Roberts (175-3) earned victories in the 5,000, high 
jump and discus. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus Reed and John Godina won the 100 and shotput with season bests of 10.45 
and 64-6 1/2 for the UCLA men, who tied for second with Fresno State with 124 
points -- eight points behind winner Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins will play host to USC, Washington and Brigham Young in a 
quadrangular meet at Drake Stadium on Saturday. It is the Bruins' final home 
meet of the season. PROM NIGHT 
</P>
<P>
 A few Morningside High baseball players apparently thought getting ready for 
the prom was more important than showing up for a game. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Monarchs forfeited their Ocean League game against Beverly 
Hills on Friday because they didn't have enough varsity players to field a 
team. Morningside's prom was Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the guys decided to get ready for the prom," Monarch Athletic 
Director Barry Slocum said. "It kind of hurts when kids put that priority 
before the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills Coach Bill Erickson said his school wasn't informed of the 
forfeit until half an hour before the 3 p.m. game at Beverly Hills. This was 
after Beverly Hills changed the starting time from 7:30, at La Cienga Park, to 
accommodate Morningside's prom. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he felt about the forfeit, Erickson said: "Pretty crappy. Our kids 
were all there. The umpires were there. The field was all prepped. The stands 
were filling up. It just stinks." 
</P>
<P>
 Slocum, who was not at school Friday, said first-year Morningside Coach Tom 
Seyler probably could have played the game by bringing up junior varsity 
players, but decided to play the JV game and forfeit the varsity game. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Seyler) has talked about disciplining the seniors who didn't show up," 
Slocum said. "If I had been here, I would have tried to see us take a team over 
there. I hate to see us forfeit. We definitely plan on playing the rest of our 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 The forfeit dropped Morningside to 0-10 in league play. COASTAL UPHEAVAL 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester's baseball team was feeling pretty good April 27 after Scott Davis 
walked on four pitches to force in the winning run to give the Comets a 6-5 
victory over University in eight innings. University, however, regained a share 
of first place as Jose Navarro pitched a three-hitter on Thursday to beat the 
Comets, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing nine consecutive games to start the season, Venice remained in 
contention by winning its ninth game in a row. The Gondoliers swept two games 
from Palisades, 5-3 and 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "We starting to come together as a team," Venice Coach Kirk Alexander said. 
"We're a real young team. There are only six seniors out of the 18 players. We 
started taking our lumps early, but then just started playing better baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gondoliers scored two runs in the eighth inning to beat Palisades, 5-3, 
Friday. The win moved Venice into a three-way tie for first place with 
Westchester and University. The Gondoliers scored the go-ahead run when Erick 
Helms walked, stole second and scored on Gilbert Solis' run-scoring single. 
Solis, a three-year starter at third base, is batting .333. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the Western League race took another turn. Westchester shut out 
Venice, 8-0, to take sole possession of first place and Palisades upset 
University, 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Westchester series took something out of us," University Coach 
Jon Beckerman said. "I think there will be other surprises. This will be a 
dogfight to the end." SIGNINGS 
</P>
<P>
 * Beverly Hills first baseman Jeremy Booth signed a letter of intent last week 
to play baseball at Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the small school atmosphere and the direction the program is heading," 
said Booth, who chose Loyola over UCLA and Arizona State on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, Booth was selected The Times' 1993 Westside Most Valuable Player 
after batting .562 with five home runs and 45 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Booth has switched from catcher to first base. In 19 games, he is 
batting .407 with 11 doubles, two home runs, 25 walks and five hit by pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really pitching around me," Booth said. "I've seen six or seven 
fastballs for strikes all year. I mostly get curveballs in the dirt and 
fastballs up and in." 
</P>
<P>
 Selected as a high school All-American by Collegiate Baseball, Booth longs to 
earn a college degree, but will not pass up an opportunity to play professional 
baseball. Booth is looking forward to the June 2-4 major league draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless I get an offer too good to turn down, I plan to play at Loyola," Booth 
said. "You never know how long your baseball career will last and I don't want 
to end up pumping gas for a living." 
</P>
<P>
 * West Los Angeles College sprinter/jumper Lynette Christian has received a 
scholarship offer from USC. Christian, a former three-time City Section 
champion at Dorsey, set personal bests of 12.21 in the 100 meters, 24.71 in the 
200 meters and a conference meet record of 18-9 3/4 in the long jump in winning 
all three events during the Western State Conference championships Saturday in 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 * Former St. Bernard standout Terrill Steen, an outside linebacker from San 
Diego State, signed with the Sacramento Goldminers of the Canadian Football 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rasheed Hazzard, a 6-foot senior guard at Venice High, has signed with 
George Washington. Hazzard, the son of former UCLA Coach Walt Hazzard, averaged 
14.8 points a game for the Gondoliers. DEPARTING COACH 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica College women's basketball coach Traci Waites has accepted an 
assistant coaching position with Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Waites, 27, will be reunited with Wildcat Coach Joan Bonvicini, whom she 
played for when Bonvicini was coach at Long Beach State. As a junior in 1988, 
Waites led the 49ers to the Final Four. TITLE RUN

 * In response to "Ames Gets Life; Admits Betraying Double Agents," April 29: 
</P>
<P>
 My entire life I have strongly opposed both the death penalty and the use of 
physical torture by authorities against prisoners (as in Singapore). I have 
always felt that the use of these methods could never be justified under color 
of government authority. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I have been closely following the Aldrich Ames spying case: the 
betrayal of our country, the betrayal of our agents to torture and death, the 
millions of payoff dollars wasted on a yuppie lifestyle, and, most galling, the 
complete lack of remorse by the guilty couple. Now, I realize that I was wrong; 
capital punishment occasionally is the only reasonable recourse.

GUN DOWN THE TOOLS OF SLAUGHTER; HOUSE VOTES TODAY ON ASSAULT WEAPONS BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today, members of the House should cast an "aye" vote for a safer future for 
their home states, a safer future for the nation. They should vote for a 
federal ban on the manufacture and sale of most military-style assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 A shift of merely a handful of uncommitted lawmakers to the "yes" column will 
result in passage of this important bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The House version, like a similar measure that cleared the Senate last 
December, prohibits 19 types of semiautomatic rifles, pistols and shotguns and 
their look-alikes. The bill would ban possession of assault weapons 
manufactured in the future but would not affect present owners of such 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Assault weapons have amply earned their notorious reputation, particularly in 
California. Semiautomatic assault weapons were used in the 1984 McDonald's 
massacre in San Ysidro, the 1989 Stockton schoolyard slaughter and the 1993 San 
Francisco law firm murder spree. California voters should take note of which of 
their representatives votes against the ban and call them to account.  
</P>
<P>
 The Stockton attack, which left five schoolchildren dead and 30 others 
wounded, prompted California lawmakers to pass the first assault weapons ban in 
the nation, a 1989 bill that prohibited 67 specific military-style arms. 
</P>
<P>
 However, bullying tactics by the gun lobby prevented a preferable blanket ban 
on features such as high-capacity ammunition clips. Fortunately, the current 
legislation addresses that problem, limiting ammunition magazines to no more 
than 10 bullets. Why should any one person have enough firepower to bring down 
a small-town police force? 
</P>
<P>
 Those who enjoy hunting and target shooting would not be penalized by the 
House bill, for it exempts as many as 670 sporting arms. Hardly Draconian. 
</P>
<P>
 With 210 million firearms in circulation today, the United States has more 
than four times the guns it did in 1950. Though it's true that assault weapons 
make up a small percentage of the nation's ever-burgeoning arsenal, lawmakers 
must not lose sight of the fact that these paramilitary arms have but one 
purpose -- to quickly and efficiently kill human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of a ban insist that gun control is not crime control. That's true. 
Sensible controls on firearms are only one way to address the complex crime 
problem. But while debate on the fine points of the issue continues, assault 
weapons proliferate, spreading even more fear and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time for the House, like the Senate, to move to get a hold on the 
nation's runaway gun epidemic. It must pass the assault gun ban.

CITY COUNCIL WATCH; ENOUGH ALREADY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The legal bills for Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden, accused of sexual 
harassment, are stacking up at a rate of $25,000 a month. The total is 
$185,000, and climbing.The Los Angeles City Council had placed a $150,000 cap 
on his legal costs. So much for the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there no end to the costs that the city -- read taxpayer -- will bear in 
this litigation? The city attorney's office last year determined that the city 
must pay for Holden's defense, at taxpayer expense, because the accusations 
grew out of his employment -- a determination that has been questioned by 
critics. The city attorney's office said that to not pick up Holden's legal 
bills would require a prior determination that he is guilty; Holden has 
vigorously denied the charges, leveled against him by three former aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members say privately that they are uncomfortable with the 
payments but are legally required to make them. OK. But if the council members 
really feel bad about these expenditures, why don't they put their own council 
office budgets where their mouths are? Council office budgets come from 
taxpayer funds too, but council members are especially protective of money that 
directly affects their ability to operate. Maybe if council members suddenly 
couldn't hire a needed aide because a few thousand dollars per month was going 
to pay a colleague's legal bills, the council would find a way with the city 
attorney to bring the matter to a close.  
</P>
<P>
 It may be a dream, but during a time when the city is struggling to cover its 
debts it's a nice dream.

A MUTUAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT; NEWLY SIGNED AGREEMENT UNFETTERS ISRAELIS AS WELL 
AS PALESTINIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The theatrics that delayed and for a time seemed about to abort Wednesday's 
signing by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization of their historic 
accord can be taken as a paradigm for the tortuous peacemaking process that, 
with one major breakthrough achieved, now goes forward. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, apparently badly briefed about the nature of some 
maps he was supposed to sign, created a scene by appearing ready to walk out on 
the heavily attended ceremony. Explanations were quickly made, clarifications 
provided and eventually the signing took place. The way is now open at last for 
limited Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of 
Jericho, and for at least the partial lifting of the 27-year-long Israeli 
occupation. It will mark the beginning, as former Israeli Foreign Minister Abba 
Eban eloquently suggested in these pages Wednesday, of a liberation for Israel 
no less than for the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, there could be a hitch. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin says that 
Arafat wants a delay of two or three weeks in the transfer of authority because 
-- after decades of waiting and months of anticipation! -- the Palestinians 
aren't quite ready to take over. If that's the case blame Arfafat's notoriously 
inefficient managerial habits. Never willing to delegate authority, he has been 
woefully slow to name many of the administrators who are to take over such 
routine but vital civic functions as education, health and public welfare. 
Expectations among Palestinians for dramatic changes in their lives are 
understandably high. More delay in the hand-over to Palestinian officials may 
not be accepted calmly. 
</P>
<P>
 A key purpose of the limited self-rule plan is to show that Palestinians and 
Israelis can live side by side, if not yet in amity then at least cooperatively 
and civilly. How this test is met will have a big influence on the next phase 
of negotiations, which aims at reaching a final political settlement. Opponents 
of compromise on both sides can be expected to do their utmost to sabotage its 
prospects. More than ever, decisive and courageous leadership -- and maybe more 
than a little help from Washington -- will be needed to see this process 
through to a successful conclusion.

REP. DREIER ON KING VERDICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I don't usually write letters, but David Dreier's "The Injustice System 
Skews Value of a Life" (Commentary, April 26) demands a response. Rep. Dreier 
(R-San Dimas) should know better. The jury system is the cornerstone of 
participatory democracy.  
</P>
<P>
 Dreier's statement that compensatory damage awards are designed to compensate 
a victim for a portion of his injuries shows a lack of understanding of the 
law. Compensatory damages are intended to fully compensate the victim for 
injuries suffered as a result of the negligent or intentional acts of others. 
To award compensation for only "a portion" of a victim's injuries would be to 
deny him his full cup of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreier notes that Rodney King had previously been convicted of assaulting a 
man with a metal pipe. If that injured man had pursued his legal rights to a 
judgment against King, he could now enforce that judgment against any financial 
award paid to King. 
</P>
<P>
 In suggesting that the Legislature enact caps on awards of pain and suffering 
and that compensation should reflect the value that society places on 
individuals, Dreier overlooks that a jury verdict represents the decision made 
by 12 members of society as to the value of the plaintiff's claims. The jury 
was not required to award King $3.8 million; they could have awarded him much 
less, or nothing at all. So long as both sides in a fair trial are vigorously

 * As an elected legislator, Dreier may fairly be assumed to be more conversant 
with the law than the average citizen. As such, he has done us a disservice in 
failing to be more explicit in his column on King. He decries the fact that 
King is to be compensated for "injuries he received while committing a crime." 
My own understanding was that King received his injuries while lying on the 
ground being pounded like a 50-cent steak by four physically fit and heavily 
armed police officers wielding large wooden sticks. In all the times I watched 
that video in horror and revulsion, I was unaware that he was engaging in 
criminal activity.  
</P>
<P>
 Dreier also does an obscene disservice to the memory of LAPD Officer Christy 
Hamilton by invoking her name in this connection. Ms. Hamilton was tragically 
shot down in the line of duty, the random victim of a mindless assassin. She 
died heroically, facing the risks she knew she would face before she ever 
pinned on a badge. 
</P>
<P>
 King, on the other hand, unarmed, and unable even to rise, was viciously 
assaulted and battered by people who had taken an oath to protect us citizens, 
the same oath that Officer Hamilton took.  
</P>
<P>
 There is no basis whatever for comparison. If King had not received a dime, 
that would have had absolutely no effect on the compensation received by Ms. 
Hamilton's survivors. Her case has no shred of relevance to the King verdict. 
Dreier, in unabashed demagoguery, has grossly insulted her memory and, by 
extension, the memory of all officers who died in the line of duty.

 * As a staunch Democrat, I must say that I found it refreshing to read Rep. 
Dreier's perspective on King. Like Dreier, I, too, was deeply troubled by the 
apparent use of excessive force used to bring King under control. But never did 
I lose sight of the fact that King was a convicted criminal, driving under the 
influence of either drugs or alcohol and evading arrest while leading the 
police on a high-speed chase.  
</P>
<P>
 I was shocked at King's $3.8-million award and outraged to learn that the 
federal government only reimburses the family of officers killed in the line of 
duty a mere $123,530. It is unconscionable that 12 supposedly reasonable jurors 
came to the conclusion that injuries to a convicted criminal, which he received 
while breaking the law and resisting arrest, are of greater value than the life 
of a police officer. Dreier's conclusions are correct. This jury proved that in 
Los Angeles, crime does indeed pay -- and it pays big!

PRESS ANXIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The collective anxiety attack suffered by the folks attending this year's 
American Society of Newspaper Editors is justified (April 15). They have 
strayed from their foundation of printing facts and truth to the point where 
they are now uncertain about how to deal with it.They have established a 
depressing, negative tone to their stories that they apparently do not know how 
to correct. Yet they do not seem to understand why readers' opinions of the 
press continue to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
 These stressed-out editors are going to have to do some serious soul-searching 
to find their way out of this mess. One thing they might do is to sit down for 
a few moments and contemplate the statement Paul Newman made at the Academy 
Awards in March: "I think we're reminded too frequently about the things that 
don't work in this country and not enough about the things that do." 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, it would only be a start. But a good start.

BIG PAYOFF FOR A LITTLE UNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some encouraging news for California is coming out of Washington: The Pentagon 
will locate four regional finance centers in the state. That decision -- made 
after a strong bipartisan push by the California congressional delegation -- 
will translate into at least 1,800 new jobs. The centers will perform 
accounting work for the Army and other financial chores. 
</P>
<P>
 Every member of the delegation, the largest in Congress, signed a letter in 
December of 1992 seeking a regional center at Norton Air Force Base in San 
Bernardino. Their effort continued after the new Administration changed the 
plan from a few mega centers to 20 satellite centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reps. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton) and Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) deserve 
credit for taking the lead. Their districts will benefit directly because the 
closed Norton Air Force Base will get one of the coveted defense accounting 
centers. The base, which Brown represented when the long process began and 
which Lewis now represents, needs major tenants. The Pentagon financial center 
will constitute the first major reuse of the base. The new economic activity is 
expected to persuade other businesses to locate there, and that would mean even 
more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the promise of jobs that prompted hundreds of communities to lobby the 
Defense Department. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer campaigned hard, 
and California prevailed. No other state will get as many. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the site at Norton Air Force Base, the Pentagon is putting 
centers at another closed base, Ft. Ord, which is ably represented by Rep. Sam 
Farr (D-Carmel), and at the Oakland Naval Supply Center, in the district of 
Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Oakland). Reps. Bob Filner (D-San Diego), Duncan 
Hunter (R-El Cajon) and Lynn Schenk (D-San Diego) also worked hard in securing 
a center for San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 California desperately needs these new, high-quality jobs. The state economy 
had long been dependent on defense spending. Base closures and defense 
down-sizing hit this state disproportionately, causing the loss of jobs by the 
hundreds of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 This victory ought to set a precedent. California Republicans and Democrats 
should unite to flex their collective muscles more often.

ARMENIANS IN KARABAKH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The headline on your article "David and Goliath in Caucasus" (April 21) 
epitomizes the faulty premise of the article, namely that 120,000 feisty 
Armenians in the tiny enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh have successfully taken on 
the rich country of 7 million Azerbaijanis. 
</P>
<P>
 Karabakh Armenians are no more capable of carrying out this war of aggression 
by themselves than are the Bosnian Serbs capable of carrying out their war of 
aggression in Bosnia. In both cases, it is the motherland that provides all the 
war material and wherewithal to prosecute their wars of aggression. The 
Karabakh Armenians love to claim that all their material was captured from 
Azerbaijan forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Karabakh Armenians do not have the capacity to produce helicopters, tanks, 
armored personnel carriers, rocket launchers, etc. Probably 90% of it comes 
from Armenia itself, and some of that comes from Russian military units 
stationed in Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
 But the worse fiction perpetuated by your article and the Armenian American 
lobby is that Armenian soldiers are not involved in the fighting. I refer you 
to the April 16 article in the New York Times:  
</P>
<P>
 "The Armenian Government has long considered that the only Armenian citizens 
fighting in Karabakh have been volunteers like Mr. Gevorkian and that no 
Government troops have fought there. But the Martyrs Cemetery tells a different 
story." 
</P>
<P>
 The article then reports on the burial of an Armenian soldier and quotes his 
commanding officer as saying "six more of his soldiers were killed in the 
battle." He then reports "All of them, Mr. Yeghoian (the commanding officer) 
said, were members of the Armenian Government's Internal Forces, a special 
military branch of the Ministry of Internal Affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth of the matter is that this is not a fight between Karabakh Armenians 
and Azerbaijan. It is a fight between the Republic of Armenia and the Republic 
of Azerbaijan. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for Armenian forces to 
conduct a war of aggression that has resulted in the occupation of 25% of 
Azerbaijan, created 1 million Azerbaijani refugees and caused the deaths of 
more than 18,000 Azeris and the looting and burning of dozens of Azeri villages 
and towns.

PERSPECTIVE ON LATINOS; L.A.'S CULTURE COMES FULL CIRCLE; CINCO DE MAYO, A 
MINOR HOLIDAY IN MEXICO, IS A MAJOR CELEBRATION OF LOCAL MEXICANS' BECOMING THE 
MAINSTREAM. 
</P>

<P>
 Mexicans have long wondered why Cinco de Mayo is more of a to-do in the United 
States than it is in Mexico. Last Sunday, treading through a crowd of admirers, 
signing autographs, shaking hands, offering his cheek to fans' kisses, Juan 
Carlos Hidalgo, superstar disc jockey and one of the most listened-to men in 
Los Angeles, was bursting with pride over the success of the music festival 
that his radio station, KLAX, was hosting at the L.A. Sports Arena. Hidalgo, 
who arrived undocumented in this country 10 years ago and picked strawberries 
up the coast in Oxnard before breaking into radio, admits that the celebration 
is a commercial matter, yet its real value is in encouraging Southern 
California's Latinos to revel in their numbers and their strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of thousands showed up at the three all-day events held last Sunday 
to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. There was a shared feeling of progress among the 
mostly country-folk who came out to hear banda at the Sports Arena, the more 
urbane crowd swaying to salsa and merengue at the L.A. Fiesta Broadway, and the 
largely middle-class pop fans who crushed against perimeter fences to catch a 
better glimpse of the Puerto Rican "Adonis," Ricky Martin, at KLVE's 
celebration at Whittier Narrows Regional Park. Petra Carrasco of East Los 
Angeles echoed the sentiments of many celebrants when she told us there is more 
confidence among Latinos today than there was when she arrived from Mexico in 
1974. "Now we feel like this is our country," she said. "An event like today's 
could not have happened 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Until very recently, Cinco de Mayo was more a quaint recognition of past 
culture than a celebration of a living one. The more than threefold increase in 
L.A. County's Latino population between 1970 and 1990 has permanently changed 
the cultural ecology of Southern California. Simply put, the raw numbers of 
Latinos have created more space for being Latino. Today's immigrants are 
connecting their past and present in a way that previous generations of 
immigrants could not have fathomed. Second- and third-generation Mexican 
Americans are learning Spanish to cash in on business opportunities or because 
they're forced to deal daily with the newcomers who are more like their 
grandparents than like themselves. In 1970, English was the most commonly heard 
language in L.A.'s Latino neighborhoods. Today, two-thirds of adult Latinos in 
L.A. County are foreign-born. The assimilative process has been turned on its 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilingualism is becoming the norm among Latinos, not because of educational 
policy but because of market forces. Television and radio, videos and compact 
discs, supermarket chains and jumbo jets keep the old language and customs 
alive. Banda , the traditional Mexican musical style that has been given new 
life by contemporary bands' up-tempo interpretations, took the Mexican world by 
storm only after a Hollywood radio station decided to showcase it. Reporters 
from Mexico City called Los Angeles to find out about the newest Mexican 
musical craze. Former gang members have told us that donning sombreros and 
cowboy boots -- the requisite banda gear -- makes them feel like they're back 
to being Mexicans. But back from what? 
</P>
<P>
 The melee that erupted Sunday at Fiesta Broadway is a symptom of the mentality 
of marginalization that still exists in some parts of the Latino community. It 
is a lamentable holdover from the days -- only a few years ago -- when we were 
minorities, when we defined ourselves by virtue of our apposition to someone 
else. Contrasted with the cultural confidence of so many festival-goers, the 
gangbangers who instigated the violence don't feel part of a collective group 
but only their very small one. Three cholos who were among the crowd that began 
the fighting smiled triumphantly and asked for their picture to be taken while 
throwing their gang signs, the cryptic hand signals of their exclusive club. 
</P>
<P>
 Alienation from mainstream culture undoubtedly plays a role in the appeal of 
gang life to youth. Unfortunately, much of today's American youth culture 
glorifies marginality, the suffering and acting-out of the outsider, the cult 
of "not belonging."  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, while more and more Americans see themselves as minorities in one 
form or another, most Latino Southern Californians are finding comfort in being 
part of a community that is becoming the majority. Large civic events like the 
ones held last Sunday are defining moments in this emergence. Celebrants look 
around and see the depth and breadth of who they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Latino CPAs told us that the festival at Whittier Narrows gave them the 
feeling that they were connected to a larger civilization. A Guatemalan father 
of four listening to Colombia's Grupo Niche at the Fiesta Broadway accurately 
recounted for us the story of Cinco de Mayo -- the Mexican army's triumph over 
the French at Puebla on May 5, 1862. An Ecuadoran-born woman who spent the day 
waiting to see a Venezuelan singer confessed to having been Mexicanized in Los 
Angeles. Latinos in all their variety have begun to define themselves on their 
own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 While it was once assumed that the only way to become a true American was to 
strip away all other experience, today it is evident that strong ethnic and 
cultural identities actively reinforce what were once considered 
quintessentially American values. Adherence to tradition translates into strong 
family and religious ties as well as a healthy work ethic. A Latino juvenile 
probation officer told us last year that the closer a youngster's ties to 
Mexican traditional values, the less likely he or she is to wind up in serious 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, sociological literature considered ethnic identification a 
deviant behavior, along with abusing drugs and playing jazz for a living. Today 
Latinos have begun to value their own norms and ways of life. It is only the 
strength of our identity and our multirooted culture that can make the 
disaffected among us, particularly the youth, feel like they belong to the 
larger society. In fact, we are becoming the mainstream.

A GUN WIDOW'S REQUEST: COURAGE IN CONGRESS; ASSAULT WEAPONS: THEIR SOLE PURPOSE

By MICHELLE SCULLY, Michelle Scully is a San Francisco lawyer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last July 1 began with my husband John and me driving to work together in San 
Francisco, making plans for a long Fourth of July weekend. We had been married 
just nine months, but had been in love for nine years. We were best friends and 
felt incredibly lucky to have each other as lifetime companions. 
</P>
<P>
 By 3 that afternoon, our plans for the weekend and our entire lives were 
shattered. A deranged man had walked into my husband's law firm equipped with 
two TEC-DC-9 assault pistols, a .45-caliber pistol and more than 100 rounds of 
ammunition. Within minutes, eight people were dead, including my husband.  
</P>
<P>
 I was working in an empty office at my husband's firm when John came in to 
tell me that shots had been heard upstairs. We went into the hall, trying to 
leave the building, and saw a young man shot right in front of us. John and I 
attempted to hide in a nearby office, but were hunted down by this madman. My 
husband used his body to shield me from the flying bullets. When the shooting 
finally stopped, I opened my eyes to see my husband lying on the floor in front 
of me, blood coming out of his nose and mouth. He had been shot four times and 
fatally wounded in the chest. I had been shot in the right arm, and spent the 
next half hour sitting in a pool of blood, begging John to stay alive. He 
finally looked up at me and said, "Michelle, I'm dying. I love you." 
</P>
<P>
 I have not been the same since that moment. I now go through every day wishing 
there was some way that I could bring John back, because I can't stand the 
loneliness of living my life without him. I can't stand the pain on the faces 
of his parents, his sisters, his brother and his many friends. When John Scully 
died, a piece of everyone who knew him died too, because he touched everyone he 
met in a profound way. 
</P>
<P>
 I know there is nothing I can do to bring John back, so I have committed 
myself to preventing other John Scullys from dying. Unfortunately, it takes 
stories like mine to move the leaders of this country to action to take 
military-style assault weapons from our streets. These are not hunting or 
sporting weapons. They are weapons of war, designed to kill a large number of 
people in a short period of time. They have no place on our streets, in our 
schools or in our office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 It would appear that the House of Representatives believes that assault 
weapons aren't a crime problem, having left this measure out of its debate 
about crime and out of its omnibus crime bill. While it's true that these 
killing machines may not be the most widely used weapons, they are 10 to 20 
times more likely to be used in the commission of violent crimes than are 
conventional weapons. And assault weapons represent nearly 30% of the guns 
traced to organized crime, drug trafficking and terrorist crime.  
</P>
<P>
 My husband John committed the ultimate act of bravery by saving my life from a 
madman's bullets. Congress must only find the courage to pass a piece of 
legislation that will save lives and save others from the pain and loss that I 
will carry for the rest of my life.

NYNEX, VIACOM TO COLLABORATE ON NEW INTERACTIVE PRODUCTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nynex Corp. and Viacom Inc. said Wednesday that they will jointly develop 
interactive entertainment products in the United States and Britain in their 
first collaboration since the takeover of Paramount Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Nynex and Viacom plan to develop video-on-demand services using the extensive 
libraries of film and television programming controlled by Viacom and 
Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies will also work together to create interactive versions of 
Viacom's cable networks, which include MTV, Nickelodeon and VH-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Nynex and Viacom plan to develop interactive multiple-player 
games that would be delivered over the Nynex broad-band network. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies originally joined forces during Viacom's recent successful bid 
to acquire Paramount. Nynex contributed $1.2 billion to the Viacom war chest 
during the entertainment company's battle with QVC Inc.  
</P>
<P>
 "With this first series of joint projects, we will dramatically enhance our 
understanding of consumer interest in advanced television services . . . and 
begin to realize the promise of new areas of business, escalating the delivery 
of software from Viacom, including Paramount, around the world," said Frank J. 
Biondi Jr., Viacom's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom Class A shares jumped $1.375 to $27.375 on the Amex, while Nynex added 
37.5 cents to $37.25 on the NYSE.

DOLLAR CLIMBS SHARPLY AFTER U.S. INTERVENES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dollar ended sharply higher against the German mark and the Japanese yen 
Wednesday after the Federal Reserve System led the first concerted central bank 
effort in nearly two years to bolster the battered currency. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, blue chip stocks fell, succumbing to investors' jitters over 
the weak dollar and talk of an impending hike in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In a well-publicized and coordinated effort, the Fed and central banks from 15 
other nations stepped in to the world currency markets to buy dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealers said the intervention was heavy and concentrated against the mark. 
Some estimates suggested that monetary authorities both here and abroad spent 
between $3 billion and $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort left the dollar at 1.654 marks in late New York trading, up from 
1.637 marks Tuesday, and at 101.85 yen, up from 101.00. Analysts said the 
coordinated action was prompted by a growing recognition that a weak dollar was 
detrimental to both the United States and its industrialized partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two things are in the interest of all (industrialized) nations," said John 
Williams, chief economist at Bankers Trust. "One is stability in foreign 
exchange markets, and the second is the case that a stronger dollar is 
appropriate to slow the U.S. economy and help spur other economies." 
</P>
<P>
 Back on Wall Street, three days of advancing prices for blue chip stocks 
provided an incentive for investors to sell and collect profits. The Dow Jones 
industrials fell 16.66 to 3,697.75 on Big Board volume totaling 267.9 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Broader-market indicators heavily weighted with Big Board-listed issues also 
lost ground. The NYSE composite sagged 0.61 to 250.75 and Standard & Poor's 500 
stock index slid 1.31 to 451.72. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller stocks fared better than the rest of the market. The Nasdaq Stock 
Market composite index edged up 0.93 to 740.30 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market mirrored movements in the bond market throughout the day and 
when bonds bobbed off their lows in afternoon trading, stocks followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The focus for equity traders seemed to be the bond market," said James 
Schroeder, a market analyst at MMS International in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields edged lower, reversing a morning rise that followed the Treasury 
Department's announcement about the size of its next auction. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, new car sales data was lower than expected, soothing inflationary 
fears, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 The main 30-year bond closed at 7.33%, down from 7.34% on Tuesday. Both 
equities and bonds have been held back lately by the dollar's weakness against 
the Japanese yen, German mark and other key currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 A flagging dollar can depress stocks by inducing foreign investors to dump 
dollar-denominated equities and other holdings. Dollar weakness can also add to 
inflationary pressures. The specter of higher inflation has spooked the 
financial markets repeatedly this year. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the immediate reaction was relief when the major industrialized countries 
mounted a joint effort to support the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Williams, which has natural gas pipelines and a digital telecommunications 
network, rose 3 1/4 to 28 3/4 on news that it was studying a $2-billion offer 
for its Wiltel unit from LDDS Communications, which ended up 1/4 to 23 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * First Interstate Bancorp rose 1 3/4 to 82 3/4. Its chairman said the bank 
expected to exceed recently revised estimates for 1994 earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allied Clinical Laboratories surged 5 3/8 to 22 5/8 on a takeover offer from 
National Health Laboratories, which ended off 1/8 to 11 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Big Three auto makers were in the spotlight as they announced their April 
sales. Also, a story in the Wall Street Journal suggested that the major U.S. 
auto manufacturers haven't capitalized on opportunities to outmaneuver foreign 
rivals. General Motors fell 5/8 to 56 3/4 and Ford fell 1 to 60. Chrysler fell 
1/8 to 47 in heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
 * Apple Computer rose 2 3/4 to 33 after its investment rating reportedly was 
raised by Dean Witter Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas markets closed lower. Shares fell sharply in London as the Financial 
Times 100-share average fell 29.5 points, or 0.95%, to 3,070.5. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX average was down 3.27 points at 2,249.02. 
Mexico's Bolsa index fell 4.11 points, to 2235.12.

CITY HALL NEWS / ALTADENA; OUSTED CANDIDATE'S BID TO RETURN SPARKS RACE 
</P>

 Eights seats on the Altadena Town Council are open for election Saturday, but 
most of the attention is focused on one seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Vos Post's bid to gain a place on the council after he was expelled 
from his alternate spot this year has drawn four opposing candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 That is considerable campaign action in an election where six of the eights 
seats are occupied by unopposed candidates; in fact, five of the 13 people 
running for office are vying for the one seat that represents Census Tract 
4602. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-member council in the unincorporated hillside community is an informal 
advisory body to the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vos Post has brought a lot of attention to this census tract for all the 
wrong reasons," opponent Camille Dudley said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a March council meeting, sheriff's deputies arrested Vos Post and took him 
to jail after he refused to stop a speech in which he accused the body of 
corruption and election fraud, which he contends denied him a full seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Vos Post was elected as a council alternate, a substitute representative, last 
May after losing his bid to represent the tract to Craig Hall. Vos Post was 
suspended in October after he continuously accused the council of election 
fraud and attempted a citizen's arrest on a woman by letting the air out of her 
van's tires. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, a divided council removed him from office for violating the terms 
of his suspension, which prohibited him from associating himself with that body 
for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Vos Post's opponents include local Little League baseball coach Stacy Manning, 
retiree Francis Crunk, former forest service employee Gus Edmondson and 
ex-Councilwoman Dudley. 
</P>
<P>
 Vos Post, 41, a local computer business owner and publisher, said he has been 
targeted by some council members because of his outspoken opposition to the way 
they run the body. "My suspension, expulsion and arrest were all attempts to 
restrict my 1st Amendment rights to free speech and to stop me exposing 
corruption and election fraud," he said. The district attorney's office's 
decision not to file charges after his arrest was a victory for free speech, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vos Post said that as a council member he would fight to get back $100,000 to 
$550,000 for Altadena's county parks that has been spent at Castaic Lake in 
recent years and be a voice for cleaning up garbage on the streets of Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would continue to expose what he alleges to be corruption among 
officials. In the past he has alleged that present and former members are 
linked to narcotics, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kind of free speech that Vos Post constantly attempts at the Town Council 
is the same kind of free speech that is illegal if you are in a building and 
yell "Fire" when there is no fire," wrote Cue MacKenzie, a retiring council 
member who is overseeing the election, in a letter to the local press. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudley, 48, a city of Los Angeles building and safety department employee, 
said keeping the Altadena Sheriff's station open and revitalizing the business 
area along Lincoln Avenue are her priorities. Dudley is also co-chairwoman of 
the Friends of La Vina, a group opposed to a controversial 280-home hillside 
development at the end of Lincoln Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning, 29, a bookkeeper and part owner of Manning Press, said maintaining 
services at the county's Farnsworth Park for the children is her goal along 
with graffiti removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Crunk, 52, a retired engineer, wants to preserve the community and prevent 
what he calls overdevelopment. He said the council must be the county's eyes in 
insuring that zoning laws are obeyed and favors a county ordinance against 
large developments on relatively small lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmondson, 67, a retired U.S. Forest Service official, said neighborhood 
safety would be his major issue if elected. A Neighborhood Watch leader, he 
said that lobbying to keep the sheriff's station is the most important way to 
ensure that. 
</P>
<P>
 The other competitive race is in Tract 4603, where education activist Millie 
Lee faces Council Alternate Tom Cartwright.

RAPE ALLEGATIONS SPARK CONTROVERSY AT POMONA COLLEGE; DISCIPLINE: MAN FACES 
SCHOOL BOARD AFTER STUDENT CLAIMS HE ASSAULTED HER 2 1/2 YEARS AGO ON A DATE. 
CASE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT RIGHT TO CONDUCT SUCH HEARINGS. 
</P>

<P>
 As Pomona College students file forward to receive their degrees at the 
school's commencement ceremony May 15, one graduating senior will be wondering 
whether the diploma is his to keep. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, a female student filed charges with the college disciplinary board, 
accusing the senior of date rape in an incident 2 1/2 years ago. Although she 
concedes that she never objected to having sex with him, she says she did not 
consent to it and was left traumatized. 
</P>
<P>
 No police report was ever filed in the Pomona College case; no criminal 
charges were ever brought against the man. For that reason, The Times is 
withholding his name. The woman is not identified because Times' policy is not 
to name victims of rape or alleged victims of rape. Both students refused to 
comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Under school rules, the accusations pending before the college disciplinary 
board -- made up of 10 students -- could lead to expulsion. The accused student 
sued in court and won a stay of the board's hearing that allowed him to 
graduate but left open the possibility that his degree could be revoked if the 
disciplinary panel later finds him guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has put college judicial procedures on trial, raising questions about 
the line between private discipline and public justice: How much authority do 
private colleges have to issue judgments on what might otherwise be criminal 
charges? To what extent can or should they regulate students' behavior? And can 
they deny a defendant at a disciplinary hearing an attorney and other rights 
guaranteed in the Constitution? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Questions such as those have been under debate at colleges around the country. 
A Yale University basketball player who was expelled last year for an alleged 
rape sued the school over its disciplinary procedures. And a student accused of 
rape at Valparaiso University in Indiana demanded $12 million in compensatory 
and punitive damages, claiming the school violated his rights by excluding 
several defense witnesses from his hearing on the charge. The cases are 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Even advocates of women's rights are split on the Pomona College case. A USC 
law professor who is an expert on gender law says she finds so many faults with 
the accusations that she fears the case will cause some people to discount the 
whole idea of date rape. But some students at the prestigious Claremont 
Colleges, which includes Pomona College, have held an ongoing vigil to protest 
the delay in the hearing on the charges, saying that the case typifies subtler 
forms of sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Because date rape is notoriously difficult to prosecute, schools have created 
rules that are broader and easier to enforce than criminal codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our standard of proof is clear and consistent evidence," said Ann Quinley, 
the Pomona College dean of students. "It is possible for someone to be found 
guilty in a college hearing when they would not be in a court of law." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Rosen, the accused student's attorney, said the college should not be 
deciding the case at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not set up to deal with this charge, which is a very serious felony," 
Rosen said. "It's not the proper forum for that. . . . Do you really think if 
someone had been killed on this campus, this jury of juniors and seniors would 
convene to determine if it was premeditated or they acted in self-defense?" 
</P>
<P>
 The woman met the man at a Halloween party in 1991, when she was a freshman 
and he was a sophomore, she said in a written statement to the college's 
disciplinary panel. They were both drinking heavily, and at his suggestion they 
left the party for his room, where they began kissing and he undressed her. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she did not explicitly consent to have intercourse with him, but 
never objected. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she said, "I lay there in shock and scared and mentally frozen." The 
incident has troubled her ever since and always will, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next week, she expressed her shock and anger to him, and said he seemed 
sorry and sympathetic. Their occasional interactions afterward "could not have 
been more civil," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two years later, though, she decided to bring disciplinary charges 
against him, although she did not explain the reason for the delay. The accused 
man was summoned to appear before the disciplinary panel on April 22, but filed 
a lawsuit against the school protesting the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 20 a Superior Court judge stayed the hearing until May 24 -- allowing 
him to graduate. Last Friday the college filed an appeal, which was denied 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne said she would decide then 
whether the hearing will proceed. She added, though, that school rules 
prohibiting the student from bringing an attorney to the college hearing aren't 
appropriate in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is such a serious charge, and the circumstances are seriously open to two 
divergent interpretations," Wayne said. "He is entitled to an attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The statute of limitations for rape is six years, Wayne noted, so the student 
conceivably could be charged after the hearing. And if the accused student 
speaks at the hearing, his testimony could be used against him in a criminal 
trial, she said. Although the student would not be forced to testify, Rosen 
said declining would limit his client's ability to defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has the right not to self-incriminate," Rosen said. "He has the 
choice between waiving his privilege and giving his version of events at the 
disciplinary hearing or remaining silent and foregoing the right to defend 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pomona College's attorney Keith Johnson argued that the student code of 
conduct is independent of criminal law. And, he said, the claim that the 
hearing violates the student's due process rights "would apply to public, but 
not to private institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Colleges "have a very long history dating back to the Middle Ages of autonomy 
in regulating their own environments," said Gary Pavela, an education lawyer 
and director of judicial programs at the University of Maryland. "It's 
particularly important in an allegation of violence that the college be able to 
determine for itself who can use its facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 While the events described in the female student's statement may be a 
violation of the student code, University of Southern California law professor 
Susan Estrich said it most likely would not hold up in criminal court as date 
rape or any other crime. And that sets a dangerous precedent that could hurt 
those accused of rape and those victimized by it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the facts are so weak, because she waited 2 1/2 years, (because) 
there was no force used, (and) by her own statement she never clearly and 
unequivocally said no . . . to turn around and say to this young man you're not 
going to graduate from college is really unfair," Estrich said. "And it 
provides ammunition to conservatives who would like to turn back the clock 
completely on date rape." 
</P>
<P>
 Colleges recently have been crafting conduct codes that redefine rape and 
related conduct. At Antioch College in Ohio, a rule requiring students to 
obtain explicit mutual consent before exchanging even a single kiss became the 
butt of "Saturday Night Live" skits. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona College's rules on sexual assault define consent according to the 
California penal code as "positive cooperation in act or attitude pursuant to 
an exercise of free will. The person must act freely and voluntarily . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 But it takes that a step further, adding; "Consent requires a clear, explicit 
agreement to engage in a specific activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students at Pomona College say their campus rule requiring explicit 
consent is not a joke, but an important safety measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's too much gray area, and the rules they're making reduce the 
gray area," said William Clarkson, a recent graduate. "I guess it would reduce 
the risk of date rape, which is a very real threat."  
</P>
<P>
 Students learn about that rule in a workshop the first week of their freshman 
year, Clarkson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all part of the basic social contract," said senior Eumi Lee, who has 
participated in protests against the hearing's delay. "If these charges are 
true then he has violated that."

AUDIT CALLS FOR TIGHTER FISCAL CONTROL AT CAL POLY; EDUCATION: IRREGULARITIES 
WERE CAUSED BY MISCOMMUNICATIONS, INEXPERIENCE AND LACK OF OVERSIGHT, REPORT 
STATES. IT SAYS THE VIOLATIONS WERE ISOLATED INCIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An audit of two departments at Cal Poly Pomona found personnel and policy 
violations and recommends that the university tighten financial controls at two 
campus offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche said the violations appear 
to have resulted from miscommunications, inexperience, lack of information and 
lack of appropriate guidance. It called the violations isolated incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly President Bob Suzuki said in a statement that he was pleased that 
only minor problems were uncovered. He called the violations "honest mistakes 
made by people trying their best to do their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The irregularities were revealed in Times articles last year that detailed how 
friends of Suzuki were hired to promote the university in Asia. Henry and 
Jennifer Whang received $239,569 in salary, commissions and travel expenses 
during a year in which they took eight business trips to Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The California State University chancellor's office recommended the audit 
after policy violations were found in Cal Poly's continuing education office 
and its educational foundation, which raises money and runs the bookstores and 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit found that Cal Poly had acted inappropriately by paying Jennifer 
Whang a 15% commission for each foreign student she recruited, in addition to 
her base salary of $3,430 per month. The recruitment was part of her job 
description, the report said, and should not have provided extra money for her. 
</P>
<P>
 International travel claims submitted by the Whangs in 1991 and 1992 
"occasionally had incomplete supporting records," the audit said, because of a 
convoluted accounting system that allowed the couple to submit some claims 
through the university and others through the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the audit also found that international travel took place 
without the required approval of deans or vice presidents. On numerous 
occasions, travelers, including the dean of continuing education, Van Garner, 
submitted claims for fellow travelers, the audit found. 
</P>
<P>
 "While these do not reflect a consistent pattern, there were isolated 
instances which should be avoided in the future," the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit also provided a glimpse into the workings of Cal Poly's foundation 
and its continuing education department, which are normally not open to public 
scrutiny because they are separate, self-sustaining arms of the university not 
bound by public disclosure laws. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the audit, the continuing education department established two 
accounts totaling $55,000 to hold and disburse discretionary funds. The audit 
stated that some payments to the Whangs involved transfers of funds from these 
accounts, which the audit said has raised some concerns. The report recommended 
closing the accounts and transferring the money into a more tightly controlled 
reserve account. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit also found that some students paid the continuing education 
department in cash. That procedure, which was questioned, has been discontinued 
and cash transactions are now handled by the campus cashier, the audit found. 
</P>
<P>
 The Deloitte & Touche audit, released April 25, made several recommendations, 
including that Cal Poly: 
</P>
<P>
 * Require the foundation's executive director to approve all continuing 
education disbursements above $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Require the foundation's executive director and the vice president for 
academic affairs to review all travel budgets proposed by the dean of 
continuing education. 
</P>
<P>
 * Appoint a foundation travel coordinator to provide information on policy 
regarding per diems and air transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Appoint an employment liaison between academic and administration 
departments to avoid mistakes such as the compensation paid to Jennifer Whang. 
</P>
<P>
 In closing, the report found that the foundation, which has been without a 
controller for more than a year, would benefit from better financial 
leadership. Cal Poly's foundation is considering hiring a budget director. 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, Suzuki said the school will implement the audit's 
recommendations.

TOPICS / POLICE; OFFICER WRITES TELL-ALL BOOK ON PASADENA FORCE; A 16-YEAR 
VETERAN IDENTIFIES RACIAL INTOLERANCE AND ON-THE-JOB POLITICS AS MAJOR 
PROBLEMS. POLICE OFFICIALS SAY THAT'S ALL IN THE PAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A police officer with more than a dozen years of experience on the force has 
written a book that describes widespread discrimination and power-hungry 
sergeants as all part of a day's work in the Pasadena Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roses Have Thorns," a semi-autobiographical account of Officer Naum L. Ware's 
16 years with the department, details the trials and tribulations a young black 
police officer encounters after he accepts a job with the Pasadena department 
in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Ware, who is still with the department, said he wrote the book to try and make 
some good come out of his bad experiences with racism and favoritism on the 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 "This book is a manual for the green troops, it's an encyclopedia for the new 
people," said Ware, 35, in an interview at police headquarters. "It's supposed 
to teach them how to get by if they're not one of the beautiful people around 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, Ware's airing of his disenchantment with the department has not 
endeared him to Pasadena's top brass. Chief Jerry Oliver has not read the book 
and does not plan to, said Cmdr. Gary Bennett. Oliver became chief in 1991, 
well after the majority of Ware's problems had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got enough to do around here without reading his book," Bennett said. 
"I haven't read the book and probably won't. I don't know how much of the 
events he talks about are true, but it all happened in the past, and life goes 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Ware admits that much of his story is set a decade ago, many of the 
characters mentioned under pseudonyms in the story line are still with the 
department. Some characters in the book -- such as Sgt. Yoda and Lt. Highstrung 
-- have monikers that reflect how Ware sees their dispositions. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Officers Assn. President Dennis Diaz said that for many of his 
colleagues, the biggest challenge in reading the book is matching up the 
characters with their counterparts in real life. "He changed their names for 
good reason, although internally it almost didn't matter. Almost everybody's 
able to pick out who's who," Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The book is his version of what happened to him. But when it comes to the 
circumstances where he describes how he was treated, we know that is what 
happened," said Diaz, who has been with the department for nearly 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz recalled an incident when Ware wanted to leave the Northwest Crime Task 
Force, an anti-drug unit set up to police northwest Pasadena. Ware was one of 
the task force's best "buyers" and made countless drug arrests, but as time 
went on, the pressure of being undercover for eight hours a day wore on him and 
began to break up his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Ware put in for a transfer back to patrol, Diaz said, but the department did 
its best to force him to stay with the task force, telling him that he was 
ruining his career and putting him on graveyard shifts. "We all remember what 
happened to him when he tried to leave," he said. "We remember those incidents 
of how he was treated." 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz added that he had no idea the book was being written. "This is the first 
time that this has happened," he said. "We've gotten books about Pasadena or 
referencing cases in Pasadena, but nothing where an individual is still here 
and working when he wrote something." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ware only smiles when he hears about the reactions to his book, especially 
when he is told of the frowns on the faces of higher-ups and comments from 
other officers that publishing it was "departmental suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this is not going to change anything for me," he said, adding that his 
reputation as a troublemaker started when he complained as a rookie about being 
placed with a bigoted training officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put on that jacket then, and I've worn it for the rest of my career," said 
Ware, adding that he has never been promoted in his 16 years with the 
department, though he has consistently scored among the top candidates every

 He paid for the book's publication himself. He will not reveal how much it 
cost.

SCHOOLS; PUPILS PROTEST PLAN TO DUMP DIRT FROM CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jacob Ellis wants a new school building as much as any other student at South 
Pointe Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and 108 other students have made it clear that they do not want 
construction to harm a nearby canyon and the animals that live there. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed about a plan to dump dirt cleared from the future school site into 
adjacent Sandstone Canyon, the sixth-grade student circulated a petition among 
his classmates protesting the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had many pets and whenever they died I felt bad, so I don't think I could 
live with knowing I had a chance to stop animals from being killed," Jacob 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Diamond Bar Mayor Gary Werner said those concerns are already addressed in 
an alternate plan he has offered to the City Council, which would preserve the 
canyon but still allow school construction and other development to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Both proposals will be up for vote at a council meeting May 31, Werner said. 
</P>
<P>
 When a teacher told Jacob about the original plan to fill the canyon, he 
contacted Diamond Bar's Mayor Pro Tem Clair Harmony and asked what he could do 
to stop it. Harmony, who suggested the youth write a letter, printed the 
petition that Jacob composed. 
</P>
<P>
 "As most of you know, South Pointe School is planning to push a large amount 
of dirt, sand and rocks into the natural habitat of hundreds of animals," Jacob 
wrote. "Many people have been against it from the start, yet it is still going 
to happen. Now, if the city of Diamond Bar will not give the permits needed to 
push the sand, dirt and rocks into the ravine, that gives us -- people who care 
about wildlife -- time to take control and stop this from happening." 
</P>
<P>
 The petition was signed by 108 of his 900 classmates, and Jacob presented the 
petition Monday night at a public hearing before the Diamond Bar City Council 
and Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the animals need a place to live," said sixth-grader Katrina Whitson. 
"I would want another school, but they should find another place to put the 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 For five years, South Pointe has operated out of temporary buildings while the 
city, the school board, developers and environmentalists debated the fate of 
the school and the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The canyon is home to a dense stand of coast live oak as well as deer, 
rattlesnakes, the San Diego coast horned lizard and the California gnatcatcher, 
a rare songbird. 
</P>
<P>
 The original plan would level a ridge next to the existing school site, 
burying several hundred oak trees and filling the canyon with the dirt that is 
removed. The area would be divided among the new school, a park, and 
residential and commercial developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner's alternative plan would preserve the canyon and use the dirt as 
landfill for a housing development southwest of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Because not all homeowners within 500 feet of the proposed project were 
notified of the meeting, the council did not vote on the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Dabney, a developer participating in the project, said the current owners 
of the canyon property have agreed to the mayor's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Dabney said that although he commends the South Pointe students' interest in 
the environment, Werner's plan resolves issues they raised.  
</P>
<P>
 South Pointe Principal Marlene Ministeri said she hadn't known about the 
petition when it was making the rounds and was concerned that the students who 
signed didn't understand the issue thoroughly. She said plans to build the 
school have floundered for three years and the district is in danger of losing 
matching state funds for construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am in favor of any plan that will get the school built," Ministeri said.

BID TO FORCE RECALL OF SOTO FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Too few valid signatures were gathered to force a recall election of Pomona 
Councilwoman Nell Soto, according to the Los Angeles County registrar, but 
recall leaders say county officials made mistakes in their count. 
</P>
<P>
 Registrar-Recorder Beatriz Valdez last week deemed the recall petition 143 
signatures short of the 1,440 required to schedule a recall vote. The number 
required for a recall represents 25% of the registered voters in Soto's council 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 However, leaders of the Recall Soto Committee say any celebration on Soto's 
part may be premature. "It's not over 'till it's over and I think it's likely 
we're going to ask for a re-examination of the signatures," said Robert 
Jackson, 36, a recall proponent who lost to Soto in a 1991 council race. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he has "already found a lot of mistakes" in the rejection of some 
petition signatures and plans to ask officials to re-examine them. But he 
added: "Whether that adds up to enough (to qualify the recall) remains to be 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Soto said she has full confidence that the county was correct in declaring the 
recall petition insufficient. "If it had been the other way around, I would 
have taken (it) as it came, but some people around here don't take no for an 
answer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Jackson can't beat me in a regular election; if he comes back for another 
try I will prevail," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 1,648 signatures submitted by the committee, the registrar found 1,297 
to be valid. Valdez reported that 173 people requested that their signatures be 
withdrawn, and that others were disqualified for various reasons.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said the recall committee wants to see the 173 requested withdrawals 
of signatures. Many were on cards Soto distributed, Jackson said, and if 
necessary his group will go to court to review their validity. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona City Clerk Elizabeth Villeral announced the failure of the recall 
petition to the applause of Soto's supporters at last week's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall committee alleges that Soto caters to special interests. "She's 
taking a lot of campaign contributions from numerous special interests and then 
turns around and uses her vote for them," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto has denied the group's charges. She contends that there is no conflict of 
interest in receiving campaign contributions from those involved in issues 
because she promises nothing in return.

COMMUNITY NEWS: DIAMOND BAR ; COUNCILMAN'S VOTE ON DEVELOPMENT WAS OK, PROBE 
FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fair Political Practices Commission has found no wrongdoing by Diamond Bar 
City Councilman Gary G. Miller in relation to charges that he had a financial 
interest in a proposed 170-acre commercial and residential development. 
</P>
<P>
 A commission investigation found that there was insufficient evidence to 
support a complaint filed by the Diamond Bar Citizens to Protect Country Living 
alleging that Miller participated in a vote affecting the proposed development 
while having a financial interest in it. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission said Miller did not violate conflict-of-interest laws when he 
voted on the general plan because by that time he had sold the property.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST COVINA; COUNCIL SEEKS TO LIMIT ADULT BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 West Covina's City Council recently passed ordinances that limit 
adult-oriented businesses to areas zoned for manufacturing and require them to 
obtain permits and pay an application fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinances approved last month establish a $55 hourly fee for city staff 
to process such applications, said Liza Virata, the city's senior 
planner.Virata was unable to estimate how long processing would take. 
</P>
<P>
 West Covina has no adult bookstores or theaters, but concern has run high for 
three years since a restaurant -- which has since closed -- began staging shows 
with models in lingerie. "The lingerie was not opaque; certain anatomical parts 
could be seen," Virata said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they received numerous complaints from surprised patrons 
who had brought children to the restaurant. In response, the city enacted a 
temporary ordinance regulating such activities until a permanent version could 
be drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance has three pages defining which businesses fall under its 
provisions, including adult bookstores, adult hotels and motels, stores that 
sell adult merchandise, massage parlors, escort services, adult dancing 
establishments, venues where certain body types are exposed or stores that 
devote more than 15% of their wares to adult-oriented materials.

TRANSPORTATION: MTA DESIGN PRIORITIES FOR PASADENA LIGHT-RAIL LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority has acquired Santa Fe 
Railroad right-of-way and rail lines in the Los Angeles area at a cost of many 
hundreds of millions of dollars, yet MTA is planning to use only a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 For the part that will be used for light rail to Pasadena, MTA staff plans to 
remove and replace good bridges, rails and ties at additional millions of 
dollars, rather than defer replacement until needed.In addition, MTA staff is 
designing stations complete with escalators, elevators, stairways, snack bars, 
etc., at several million dollars for each, when all that is needed is simple 
wheelchair-friendly ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 If MTA could be persuaded to postpone or change these costly decisions, money 
would be available for other desirable features that should be in the design 
for the best interests of the public. Once cast in concrete, it will be there 
for a long time. Statements to the contrary notwithstanding, the point of no 
return has not been reached. There is still the opportunity for a better design 
that would be in the best interest of Pasadena and the cities east to 
Montclair. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink morning and evening commuter service on existing rails from 
Montclair to Los Angeles, via Pasadena, could begin tomorrow rather than in the 
distant future if and when light rail is in operation from Los Angeles to 
Pasadena. Double tracking for light rail can be constructed concurrent with 
Metrolink operation. Also, funding for Metrolink comes from a different cookie 
jar. 
</P>
<P>
 Light rail to Pasadena would be assured and not be jeopardized by the present 
shortfall of funds, and questionable innovative financing for funds for 
undergrounding short sections in Pasadena and Highland Park would be avoided.

EDUCATION: THE VALUE OF DRESS CODES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding your article on Monrovia High School students staging a walkout to 
protest the dress code there (March 24): Finally high school is getting to 
important issues such as an appropriate dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt the code will provide more help for the graduates to find jobs than 
will reading, writing and arithmetic. Or maybe we'll have the most properly 
dressed members of unemployment lines anywhere in the world.

SCHOOLS: SAN GABRIEL, ALHAMBRA DISTRICT BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a 29-year subscriber to the Los Angeles Times, I was appalled and 
disappointed to read in the San Gabriel Valley section your headline stating 
"Election Creating School District Is Invalidated" (March 24). 
</P>
<P>
 Your headline is especially offensive in that it creates a grossly inaccurate 
impression that some sort of final conclusion, adverse to San Gabriel Unified 
School District (SGUSD), has been reached.Unfortunately, many people only scan 
headlines -- the juicier the better -- without reading the article's contents. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit being heard by Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne, Alhambra 
School District is desperately attempting to kill San Gabriel Unified District. 
SGUSD is now responsible for its own high school students. Alhambra wants to 
force SGUSD students back into Alhambra's San Gabriel High School, which with 
3,300 students is vastly overcrowded, as are Alhambra's other two high schools. 
Many people in our area are unaware that despite its name, San Gabriel High 
School is owned, operated and controlled by Alhambra School District, and is 
located within the city of Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a great white shark, Alhambra is trying to keep their power dominant and 
complete. It is outrageous that the huge Alhambra School District, whose three 
existing high schools are bursting at the seams with student overpopulation, 
should be so greedy.

COVER STORY; DOUBLE WHAMMY!; WHAM-O'S SAN GABRIEL HEADQUARTERS WAS ONCE A 
ROLLICKING JOINT FULL OF HULA HOOPS, FRISBEES -- AND EMPLOYEES. THEN THE 
COMPANY WAS SOLD AND MOST OF THE JOBS WENT ELSEWHERE. NOW, UNCERTAINTY LOOMS AS 
A NEW OWNER TAKES OVER. BUT OH, THE MEMORIES.

<P>
 Oh, how the place once shook and shimmied, wobbled and whirled, this twinkling 
toy factory that turned out Whing Dings and Nutty Knotters and Zip Zaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, two new USC grads, Rich Knerr and Arthur (Spud) Melin, dreamed up 
this whimsical place called Wham-O in 1948; two wacky best friends who once got 
arrested in Pasadena for hurling rotten oranges at each other as teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they began a mail-order business by making 75-cent slingshots in the 
Knerr family garage, then moved on to ship a pirate's treasure chest worth of 
toys around the world -- Silly String, Slip 'N Slides, Frisbees and dozens more 
-- from the company's San Gabriel complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they masterminded a ring of plastic called the Hula Hoop, the 
world's ultimate rock 'n' roll toy of the late '50s, a hip-wiggling invention 
that exploded onto the scene at a time when TV cameras shot Elvis from the 
waist up. Oh, how Knerr and Melin miss the Hula Hoop's heyday, when the world 
came calling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole world went crazy with Hula Hoop," recalled Knerr, now a 68-year-old 
Arcadia resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "They called us the 'Fun House.' We acted kind of nutty on purpose," said 
Melin, a 69-year-old Irvine resident. 
</P>
<P>
 But their improbable story -- one of two local boys who made history -- is all 
but forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Wham-O's story is shoved aside in the recently released Hollywood 
movie "The Hudsucker Proxy," a fictional account of the Hula Hoop's making, 
starring Tim Robbins and Paul Newman. The story is a dark one, about how a 
corporate board's scheme to ruin Hudsucker Industries is thwarted by the 
company's invention of the wildly popular Hula Hoop. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a bittersweet juncture for Wham-O -- just when Hollywood is making the 
Hula Hoop a shining star again, the company's spotlight continues to fade, 
almost to black. On May 31, Mattel Inc. takes over when it closes a deal to buy 
Kransco, Wham-O's parent company. Mattel, the country's largest toy maker, is 
not saying what changes, if any, are in store for Wham-O. 
</P>
<P>
 Knerr and Melin, who retired 12 years ago and are still best friends, say 
little about Mattel, only that the pairing looks to be a good match. Publicly, 
Wham-O employees say they do not know what to expect from Mattel; privately, 
they worry that the new owner will shut down their offices and reassign 
operations to one of Mattel's Southern California plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Wham-O's San Gabriel complex -- which made and shipped 100 million 
Hula Hoops in the first 16 months of the toy's introduction -- mostly handles 
administrative duties for its parent company; no toys are made or invented 
there anymore. Now, the possibility looms that the Wham-O complex will 
disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Wham-O has shrunk like an image in a fun house mirror. A 
skeleton crew of 20 -- down from more than 1,000 -- runs the once-bustling 
company. Now, Wham-O's 171,000-square-foot complex and its eight buildings are 
as quiet as a tired big top, with suite after suite of abandoned offices and 
warehouses so empty that you could fling a Frisbee from end to end without 
hitting a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 It's eerie all right, the stillness of a place that once buzzed with the whiz 
of shrink-wrap machines and the glee of Knerr and Melin at play, shooting each 
other with Air Blaster toy guns and plotting practical jokes, such as the time 
when Knerr shipped a baby elephant to his partner's wife in San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very sad," Melin said. "(Wham-O) just went down to almost nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Now when you go out there, there's zero, OK?" said plant manager Larry 
Frazier, a 26-year employee, sadly spreading his empty hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Wham-O's transformation began in 1982, when Knerr and Melin decided to retire 
and sell the company to Kransco for $12 million. Within five years, the San 
Francisco-based toy and sporting goods manufacturer shifted most of Wham-O's 
production to Mexico, laid off all but a few of the 300 full-time staff 
members, and stopped hiring the 300 to 500 temporary workers who came aboard 
during the busy season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, Wham-O created and shipped 40 to 50 products a year; now, the 
San Gabriel warehouse sends out only three Wham-O products -- the Hula Hoop, 
Frisbee and Hacky Sack -- that are made elsewhere and then shipped in for 
distribution. Wham-O stopped making toys in San Gabriel more than 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 More than three decades after the Hula Hoop craze, Wham-O's office staff works 
on promotions, advertising and product development for Kransco, which makes 
Hula Hoops in Virginia Beach and Frisbees in Mexico. The staff still works out 
of Wham-O's aging original buildings, with stained carpet and worn linoleum. 
</P>
<P>
 But oh, what a place it was, started by two buddies who believed in a plastic 
tube in bright colors and ignored the scuttlebutt that said no, sir, you can't 
sell a rinky-dink garden hose for three bucks. But the colorful hoops turned 
into an overnight sensation, creating such hysteria that the Japanese police 
banned the "Hura Hoopu" from Tokyo streets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Hula Hoop's heyday in the late '50s, workers cranked out 20,000 Hula 
Hoops a day in Johannesburg, Tokyo, Paris and five other plants; in San 
Gabriel, supervisors set up production lines in the warehouse, the parking lot, 
the hallways, wherever there was room. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a time of endless madness, a toy so famous that it is displayed in the 
Smithsonian Institution and listed in Webster's dictionaries. Following the 
credits for "The Hudsucker Proxy," a disclaimer says that the Hula Hoop 
actually was invented by Wham-O's founders, "a true American success story." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the real story, of how the world fell in love with Wham-O. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wham-O's founders grew up as two playful boys, always scheming, little 
entrepreneurs to the bone. At age 9, Knerr made rubber band guns out of wooden 
apple crates and clothespins, hawking them to kids on his street in South 
Pasadena. Melin grew up in Pasadena; at age 10, during summer vacations in 
Newport Beach, he turned into a mega-fisherman -- he rigged up a clothesline 
over part of Balboa Bay, attached 50 hooks with bait and collected the 
morning's catch by rowboat. Then he loaded his red wagon with ice and sold 
fresh halibut and bass door to door. 
</P>
<P>
 The two hit it off when they met as teen-agers, kindred spirits. After 
college, neither wanted to work for his father -- Knerr's dad was in industrial 
real estate, Melin's in the lumber business. They decided to sell their 
homemade slingshots after their barber suggested that there might be a few 
bucks in it. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1948, the two buddies started a little sporting goods company, moving from 
the Knerr family garage to a rented space in Alhambra. They made the 
slingshots, hunting knives and crossbows with a band saw they bought from Sears 
for a $7 down payment. They came up with the company's name, based on the sound 
of a slingshot hitting its target -- Sling-O? Slam-O? How about Wham- O? Within 
a few years, their mail-order business was pulling in about $100,000 a year, 
enough for the partners to buy their first building in San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither partner fancied himself a toy maker. Until one day, when they took a 
chance on a simple piece of plastic that skimmed the air like a flying saucer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It happened on the beach one day when a fellow and his flying disc caught 
their eye. The disc player, Fred Morrison, called his invention the "Pluto 
Platter" and agreed to sell it to Wham-O. Knerr and Melin renamed the disc 
after a funny cartoon character. Afterward, the two marketing whizzes just 
winked when the curious asked if the Frisbee worked via invisible string. In 
1957, they put out their first toy, the Frisbee, and took their first turn down 
the road to fame. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, a friend told them that they ought to see the bamboo rings that 
Australian kids twirled in exercise class. So, without seeing the Australian 
version, Knerr and Melin decided to fiddle with a hoop of their own that they 
made of ash wood and bound with rawhide. They asked a visiting Australian toy 
maker to show them how the hoop worked, but the guy only could only manage a 
whirl or two before it fell at his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 But one Saturday in the office, Wham-O's 22-year-old research and development 
engineer picked up the hoop and got it twirling around his waist like crazy. 
The engineer, Dick Gillespie, was on to something, and the partners knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone just fell off their chairs, they couldn't believe it," said 
Gillespie, 58, a San Gabriel resident. 
</P>
<P>
 The partners set out to find the right material for the hoop -- something that 
swung soft on the body. The wood wasn't right, so they decided to go with 
plastic, a substance that had then just recently come into popular use and it 
was lighter and more flexible. Then the name -- Twirl-a-Hoop? Swing-a-Hoop? How 
about Hula Hoop? 
</P>
<P>
 The madness began. 
</P>
<P>
 Knerr and Melin tested the hoop on local schoolchildren; one of the Hula 
Hoop's first trial runs was at a Pasadena elementary school in the summer of 
1958. They told the students: You master the hoop, and it's yours. Oh, how the 
faces of the children lit up when they got the hang of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, they improvised by twirling the hoop around their necks, then their 
feet, defying gravity and social conventions at the same time. Even Gillespie's 
wife, who told him that the hoop action looked "nasty," got hooked and, three 
months later, climbed on a table in New York to demonstrate the toy in front of 
industry buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the toy industry, skeptics scoffed and then ate their words. Consider the 
bigwig New York City toy distributor who looked down his nose at a 22-year-old 
Gillespie, peddling a colored piece of plastic. No thanks, said the bigwig, 
eating his Danish pastry off a linen napkin. But a month and a half later, the 
bigwig showed up at Wham-O's New Jersey plant, rolled up his suit sleeves and 
helped load trucks so that the Hula Hoop would get to his distributors on time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hula Hoop craze died down in the early '60s, almost as quickly as it had 
started, but by then, Wham-O was on a roll. The company had one tiger by the 
tail in the Hula Hoop and kept looking for others. In the 1960s and '70s, 
Wham-O put out dozens of toys, whatever caught the partners' fancy. Half the 
fun was in the toy's name, which rolled off the tongue and packed a punch in 
the parlance of super-hero comic book speak: Super Elastic Bubble Plastic. 
Shrink Machine. The Bubble Thing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Wham-O took the fun business seriously. Factory workers puffed out their 
chests when they saw the way the world took to the Hula Hoops and Frisbees that 
they made, former assembly worker June Brisley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere Brisley turned, she saw kids playing with Wham-O toys. One night, 
on a family vacation in Seattle, she marched over to talk to picnickers who 
were throwing glow-in-the-dark Frisbees that looked like flying moons. "I made 
this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so proud," said Brisley, a 66-year-old San Dimas resident who 
arranges Wham-O reunions twice a year. "We packed Hula Hoops, three dozen to a 
box, red, pink, yellow, packing, packing, packing . . . making a whole bunch of 
toys, making kids happy." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the kind of place that Knerr and Melin built; everyone called them 
"Rich and Spud." No fancy high-powered ad agencies or focus groups -- Wham-O 
tested toys on the children of employees and filmed commercials in Knerr or 
Melin's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The two partners hated to sit behind a desk. In the office, they put money on 
who could throw a Super Ball -- a Wham-O plastic ball with legendary bounce -- 
into a wastebasket in a certain number of bounces. They took breaks outside, 
shooting darts into the wood side of a liquor store or picking Frisbee targets. 
Someone picked a target -- a car door, for instance -- and then the other 
person picked a farther target until they ended up blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss it all the time," said Melin, who still throws his Frisbee over the 
ocean with reverse spin so that it arches right back into the hands of its 
maker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if Spud and I had to say what we contributed, it was fun," said 
Knerr, whose wife still cannot get him out of a toy store. "But I think this 
country gave us more than we gave it. It gave us the opportunity to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 And they did it with style, in a place where employees felt loose enough to 
sneak up on the two partners one day and douse them with Silly String. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really humming, I'm telling you," said Carmelita Mata, 79, a former 
assembly line worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier, the plant manager, knows every square inch of the Wham-O buildings, 
where managers used to watch for bad batches of glue, where sealing machines 
hot-stamped Frisbees with Wham-O's candy-cane red-and-white logo, where a 
railroad spur allowed trains to whisk away products directly from assembly 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon, Frazier headed for the company's makeshift archive, a 
cinder-block tomb of sorts for forgotten toys, ghosts of Wham-O's past. The 
archive is the old warehouse tool crib. 
</P>
<P>
 From a rusty tool shelf, Frazier picked up a box of the Super Balloon -- an 
inflatable 10-foot-long skinny balloon -- and unfolded the product carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these are just old, old, old, old, old, old," he muttered. 
</P>
<P>
 But old habits die hard -- Frisbees and Hula Hoops are still going strong, 
although Kransco will not release sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Knerr nor Melin talks about the old days much; each is likely to 
change the subject when asked. Knerr has no plans to see Hollywood's version of 
the Hula Hoop story. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a farce," he shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 He speaks briskly about the Wham-O days and asks a reporter who interviews 
him: "This won't take long, will it?" Sure, he misses the place but, he says 
with a chuckle: "I don't think I want to go back to work again." 
</P>
<P>
 Melin is more the raconteur, given to long-winded stories. He saw "The 
Hudsucker Proxy" and liked it, although he thought actor Tim Robbins needed a 
little work on his hip action. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They're making a story that isn't true, and it may hurt other entrepreneurs," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He tends to downplay Wham-O's mark on the world, calling it "just a little 
company." But he owns up that he taught four of his dogs to catch Frisbees in 
flight. And at 5 feet, 10 inches and 145 pounds, he can still keep a Hula Hoop 
going. 
</P>
<P>
 Melin doesn't play favorites, but the truth be told, he has a soft spot for 
Frisbee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll always be around," he said confidently. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, how that Frisbee took off. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could just a piece of plastic like that do so good? If we were on a 
desert island, that's the best thing you could have. Especially if the breeze 
is going good. You can throw it over the ocean, and it'll come right back to 
you, if you throw it just right." WHAM-O'S WORLD Frisbees 
</P>
<P>
 * Ivy League students started experimenting with flying discs in the 1920s, 
when they tossed around pie tins from the Frisbie Baking Co. of Bridgeport, 
Conn., though that's not where the toy got its name. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fred Morrison, son of the inventor of the automobile sealed beam headlight, 
combined his interest in flight and a new post-World War II substance called 
plastic to form the flying disc. 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1968, the Navy spent nearly $400,000 to test Frisbee discs as a vehicle 
for keeping flares aloft, but the idea never took off. 
</P>
<P>
 Hula Hoops 
</P>
<P>
 * Within four months of the Hula Hoop's introduction in 1958, more than 20 
million were sold. 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1958, the Hula Hoop retailed for less than $3; now, it sells for about 
$4. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the plastic tubing for all Hula Hoops were placed end to end, the tube 
would circle the Equator more than five times. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Wham-O Products 
</P>
<P>
 * Girls who wrapped themselves in Silly String found out that it did not come 
out of their hair as easily as the directions said. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the early 1960s, Norman Stingley, a chemical engineer, accidentally 
created a plastic product that bounced uncontrollably. Wham-O bought the 
product and created the Super Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ones You Never Heard Of 
</P>
<P>
 * In the 1960s, during Cold War fever, Wham-O sold a $119 do-it-yourself bomb 
shelter. It bombed. 
</P>
<P>
 * When the movie "Jaws" came out in 1975, Wham-O rode the wave of popularity 
and created plastic great white shark teeth. A few sold before they sank out of 
sight.

SCOTT HARRIS: NUDE 'SHOWER SHOWS' GO DOWN THE DRAIN; ONLY COMMISSIONER DAVID 
HONDA WAS COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO ABSTAIN AND CALL THE ISSUE 'ABSURD' AND 
'ANTI-BUSINESS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Perhaps you've heard the odd news about the Odd Ball Cabaret, the North Hills 
strip joint that has been forced to shut down its "shower shows." The city's 
Disabled Access Appeals Commission, it seems, has ruled that the Odd Ball's 
shower is in essence a stage, and by law must be accessible not only to 
able-bodied nude dancers but also those who require wheelchairs. (Not that the 
Odd Ball employs any.) 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Blitstein, general manager of the rival Bob's Classy Lady, was upset when 
he read the story. What galled Blitstein wasn't the specter of overzealous 
government interference in the adult entertainment industry, but the fact that 
Bob's Classy Lady wasn't getting its due. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the home of the original shower show," boasts Blitstein, a dapper 
fellow with a small ponytail. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does Bob's Classy Lady claim to have originated this dance medium, 
but its shower is still open for business. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right: The outrage here isn't meddlesome authorities. It's a case of 
selective enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly why city inspectors have looked favorably upon Bob's Classy Lady while 
cracking down on the Odd Ball is an intriguing question. It's even more 
intriguing if you compare the two showers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Odd Ball's forbidden shower looks not unlike one you may have in your 
home. To enter, a dancer must step over a ledge a few inches high. Patrons walk 
around a corner for a private view of the shower dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob's shower, however, is on a perch about five feet above the floor that can 
be reached only by walking up a few steps. If anything, Bob's shower poses more 
difficulty for people in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Blitstein isn't worried that the city will come and shut down Bob's famous 
shower shows. "They can't. We've got permits," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 So what makes Bob's shower kosher? The best that Blitstein can figure is that 
an inspector judged it to be a prop, not a stage. The difference, he figures, 
is that Bob's shower is nominally portable while the Odd Ball's is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it seems safe to assume that members of the Disabled Access Appeals 
Commission have never visited Bob's Classy Lady, at least officially. The 
five-member panel voted 4 to 0 in its disapproval of the Odd Ball's shower. 
Only Commissioner David Honda was courageous enough to abstain and call the 
issue "absurd" and "anti-business." That he couldn't bring himself to vote no 
doesn't speak well for the great American tradition of dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's ruling, ridiculous though it was, was accepted by the Odd 
Ball with equanimity. Carl Salvati, the Odd Ball's manager, says the shower 
shutdown has no appreciable effect on business. Rather than fight City Hall, 
the Odd Ball was either going to modify the fixture or remove it. 
</P>
<P>
 But the other day, Salvati received a call out of the blue from Americans with 
Disabilities Act National Inc., a Fresno-based nonprofit public-benefit agency 
that helps businesses comply with the 1990 law that broadens access for the 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Beth Gil, the agency's vice president, suggested that the city had 
misinterpreted the law. Both clubs would have to make modifications, she 
suggested, only if they employed dancers in wheelchairs and if those dancers 
requested access to the showers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Shigeta, chief of the disabled access division of the city's Department of 
Building and Safety, suggested that Gil may be confusing codes pertaining to 
workstations with those pertaining to performance stages. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than anything, Shigeta wanted to say that it's unfair for the media 
to have exploited the shower dispute to its own ends while ignoring the 
important work of the Disabled Access Appeals Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 This may be so. Then again, it's up to such commissions to make exceptions 
where exceptions make sense. People in wheelchairs play basketball and tennis 
and do marathons. But with more than 30 years in adult entertainment business 
between them, Salvati and Blitstein say they've yet to audition a prospective 
nude dancer who uses a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 This being Los Angeles, my hunch is that may soon change. My other hunch is 
that somebody may well file a complaint, and Bob's Classy Lady will get a visit 
from the disabilities police. 
</P>
<P>
 Shutting down the shower would deny dancers the opportunity to earn a few 
extra bucks from guys who not only like to watch nude women take showers but 
also like to decorate them with Barbasol. ("Please," says a sign by the shower, 
"Do Not Spray Cream Above the Neck.") 
</P>
<P>
 The bigger loss would be sentimental. Truth is, the shower doesn't get much 
use these days. The novelty seems to have worn off. But Neil Blitstein still 
likes to boast that Bob's Classy Lady was the first. 
</P>
<P>
 He seems so proud, you might wonder if it was his idea. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't. It was his mom's.

NINTH INNING A PAIN FOR DODGERS, WORRELL; BASEBALL: CLOSER INJURES SIDE, THEN 
EXPOS WIN ON SPEHR'S HIT OFF GROSS, 5-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The score was tied, 4-4, the bases were loaded and there was one out in the 
bottom of the ninth Wednesday when Dodger closer Todd Worrell started feeling 
pain on his left side, but he kept pitching. On a full count to the Montreal 
Expos' Lou Frazier, Worrell threw a fastball that was fouled off and left him 
clutching his side. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger trainer Charlie Strasser ran to the mound, then watched Worrell throw a 
warm-up pitch, which sailed to the right and all the way to the backstop. 
Worrell walked off the mound and into the trainer's room, where the preliminary 
determination was that he suffered a strained rib-cage muscle. The seriousness 
of the injury will be better determined today. 
</P>
<P>
 With Worrell gone, Manager Tom Lasorda had no relievers left. He had used 
everyone but Roger McDowell, who was so sick with a stomach virus that he could 
barely stand up. 
</P>
<P>
 So Kevin Gross, who had at least played catch during batting practice, ran to 
the mound and took over the 3-2 count to Frazier. Gross struck him out, but Tim 
Spehr hit a single off the wall that gave the Expos a 5-4 victory at Olympic 
Stadium.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was like jumping out of an airplane and wondering if the parachute would 
open," Gross said. "They told me that if they needed somebody, it would be me. 
But when he pulled his rib, I said, 'Oh no.' It was a rush to be out there, it 
was like being in a World Series with the game on the line. I'm disappointed I 
gave the hit up, but to make that first pitch and strike out that guy was 
great." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Broderick, the Expos' team physician, told Lasorda that he was not sure 
about the severity of Worrell's injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sons of guns are hard to clear up when they are bad," said Broderick, who 
added that a bad sprain could keep a player out up to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not the condition the Dodgers wanted to be in at the start of a 
four-game series against the Giants beginning tonight in San Francisco. They 
will arrive with a 2-4 record on their trip and probably without their closer, 
who, along with Darren Dreifort, had been the only consistent pitcher in the 
bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell, who spent most of last season sidelined because of several injuries, 
had a 2-1 record with two saves and a 1.74 earned-run average in nine 
appearances before Wednesday's game. Now he can't even twist his upper body to 
the left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometime rib-cage injuries don't heal fast, but I have never had one," said 
Worrell, who took the loss. "How long or how short it will be they won't know 
until they pinpoint what I've got for sure.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's fair to compare what happens in one year with what 
happened in the past. You can't anticipate injuries. So I will just pray for a 
miracle and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell's injury came long after starter Tom Candiotti had left the game, and 
he wasn't happy about his departure, either. He gave up two runs in 4 2/3 
innings, then was replaced by Gary Wayne, the first of six relievers, after the 
Expos scored their second run to tie the score.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to come out, but it's kind of hard to argue about it when the 
coach comes out twice in one inning," Candiotti said. "I don't know why they 
took me out." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching coach Ron Perranoski said Candiotti, whose knuckleball has been 
affected because of a cracked fingernail, wasn't throwing many knuckleballs and 
Lasorda thought it was best to take him out.  
</P>
<P>
 But the parade of relievers could not contain the Expos. And against starter 
Kirk Rueter, who left the game after five innings because of a groin strain 
suffered legging out a single, and four relievers, the Dodgers managed only 
five hits.  
</P>
<P>
 Even Dreifort was not exempt. With the Dodgers ahead, 3-2, in the seventh, the 
Expos scored two runs against Dreifort and Omar Daal to take a 4-3 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza, who was taking the day off, had a pinch-hit double leading off 
the eighth. Jose Offerman's two-out single tied the score, and he went to third 
on Moises Alou's error. Raul Mondesi's grounder to pitcher John Wetteland hit 
Wetteland's foot, but it bounced up and Wetteland threw out Mondesi to end the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Gott held the Expos in the eighth and Mel Rojas (2-0) retired the Dodgers 
in order in the ninth. Then against Worrell, who started the ninth inning, 
Marquis Grissom legged out a chopper to Tim Wallach and moved to third on a 
single to right by Randy Milligan. Worrell walked Alou to load the bases.  
</P>
<P>
 Worrell struck out Wil Cordero before he ran the count to 3 and 2 to Frazier 
and stopped pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I thought it was his arm," Lasorda said. "But when he took the 
practice pitch and I saw the ball go the way it did, it scared the hell out of 
me."

BARKLEY SCORES 56 POINTS AS SUNS SWEEP WARRIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Barkley scored a career-high 56 points in an inspired performance 
Wednesday night, leading the Phoenix Suns to a 140-133 victory over the Golden 
State Warriors and a sweep of their first-round NBA playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley's 38 first-half points set an NBA playoff record and he finished the 
three-game series with 112 points. In the deciding game, he made 23 of 31 
shots, had 14 rebounds and made seven of nine free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 His total tied for the third-best in playoff history behind Michael Jordan's 
63 in 1986 and Elgin Baylor's 61 in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring the Suns' first 12 points, he ran by Warrior Coach Don Nelson 
and asked him: "You gonna double me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson and the Warriors chose not to, and Barkley went on to score 27 points 
in the quarter, two shy of Sleepy Floyd's playoff record, despite his aching 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I was making a lot of shots tonight," he said. "They kind of 
forced the issue by not doubling me. I hope it's not the last time I see single 
coverage. I kind of like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nelson: "Nobody thought he was going to make all his shots. He had one of 
the most spectacular games I ever witnessed, as a player and as a coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley, who has said this season will be his last, didn't miss a shot in the 
first quarter and didn't slow down. His previous career high was 44 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't luck," said Golden State's Chris Webber, who scored 16 points. "He 
was taking shots we wanted him to take. We wanted him to take three-pointers. 
It was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 The league's two top-scoring teams combined for 147 first-half points -- 
Phoenix led, 74-73 -- and kept running and gunning in the second half. Each 
team had passed the 100-point mark with two minutes to play in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good workout," Barkley said afterward. "It was three tough games. 
The first one was rough, the second one was rough and the third one was the 
roughest of them all." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing entering the final period, 107-106, Phoenix built its lead to 125-117 
with 7:35 to play when Barkley converted a three-point play and notched his 
50th point. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State cut the lead to 131-129 on a basket by Latrell Sprewell, who had 
27 points, with 2:07 left, but couldn't get any closer. The Suns missed only 
three of 19 shots in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns will play the winner of the Houston-Portland series in the second 
round. Houston leads the series, 2-1, with Game 4 Friday night at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of getting a few days rest for his back was Barkley's incentive 
to end the series as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really bad right now, but thank God I've got a couple of days to rest," 
he said. "But I'm going to play regardless." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Barkley, this year's first-round playoff series was much easier for 
Phoenix, which had to scrap back from an 0-2 deficit against the Lakers last 
season before advancing to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Mullin had 30 points for the Warriors, who were swept in a playoff 
series for the first time since 1967-68, when the Lakers won four in a row in 
the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Majerle had 24 points for the Suns and Kevin Johnson, who scored 56 points 
in the first two games, scored 18 and had 12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams came out running hard and shooting well, but the first half 
belonged to Barkley, who made his first 11 shots, including three 
three-pointers. He also made both of his free throws.

ANGELS PUT YANKEES AWAY IN 13TH, 7-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whitey Herzog was sitting in front of his television set Wednesday night, 
realizing he was responsible for this intriguing matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 He traded starting pitcher Jim Abbott to the New York Yankees, creating a 
furor heard 'round Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 He provided Angel starting pitcher Joe Magrane his extravagant two-year 
contract, creating a furor heard 'round baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, sitting in his living room 1,900 miles away in St. Louis, Mo., he was 
recognizing the irony of the Angels' 7-6, 13-inning victory over the Yankees in 
front of 24,312 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Damion Easley hit a one-out single past a drawn-in infield for the game-winner 
that ended at 12:04 a.m. Thursday. Bob Patterson (1-1) pitched three shutout 
innings for the victory, and Donn Pall was the loser. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning rally was set up when Jorge Fabregas singled to right. Harold 
Reynolds and Gary DiSarcina followed with singles, loading the bases for 
Easley. He singled to left, and was mobbed by his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory snapped the Angels' six-game losing streak, and prevented their 
worst start at home since 1980. Despite their 10-18 record, the Angels are 2 
1/2 games out of first place in the American League West, the division being 
called the Fab Faux Pas. 
</P>
<P>
 Center fielder Chad Curtis prevented the Angels from disaster in the top of 
the 13th when he made a spectacular over-the-shoulder catch on Gerald Williams' 
fly ball. Paul O'Neill followed with a single to center, but Curtis threw out 
Don Mattingly trying to score from second, ending the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees, after blowing a 5-2 lead for Abbott in the seventh inning, took a 
6-5 lead in the 10th inning when Angel reliever John Dopson threw a wild pitch 
past catcher Fabregas. Mike Stanley ran in from third, and although Fabregas' 
throw reached Dopson in time, plate umpire Mike Reilly ruled Dopson missed the 
tag. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels tied the game in the bottom of the 10th when Chili Davis hit a 
one-out double into the right-center field gap, scoring Tim Salmon from first 
base. It was Davis' 24th RBI of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the late-inning festivities, the featured event of this night was the 
matchup of Abbott vs. Magrane, brought to you by the White Rat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess they're bringing that up a lot tonight, huh?" Herzog said. "But you 
know something, if I had to do it all over again, I'm not sure I would have 
changed anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to keep Abbott as much as anyone, and maybe the deal didn't work out 
like we hoped, but I still think I was right in not giving him what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you know something, I still think Magrane will be a solid No. 3 starter. 
When I saw him last year, I told our people, 'Damn, if we can get a third 
starter for our ballclub for $1.5 million, why not take a shot? Where are you 
going to find a pitcher who does what he does?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane, who underwent arthroscopic elbow surgery before spring training 
began, was impressive in his season debut. He yielded four hits and two earned 
runs in five innings, walking three batters with two strikeouts. If not for 
Danny Tartabull's two-out, two-run homer in the first inning, Magrane could 
have left the game after 85 pitches with a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, neither he nor Abbott received a decision. Abbott left after six 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the process of getting our pitching staff together," Angel Manager 
Buck Rodgers said, "and Joe Magrane is the first piece of the puzzle to come 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to lose as much as anyone else, but we knew coming out of spring 
training we had some problems, and we compounded it with (Mark) Langston 
getting hurt and (Chuck) Finley struggling. And I hate to say this, but we may 
struggle for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think once we get things going, we've got a chance to go .500 for a 
while. And that may be good enough in this division." 
</P>
<P>
 The feat might be much easier, of course, if Herzog never had traded Abbott. 
It already is perceived as one of greatest blunders in Angel history, 
particularly considering what they received in exchange. First baseman J.T. 
Snow and starting pitcher Russ Springer have been demoted to triple-A 
Vancouver, and reliever Jerry Nielsen is toiling in double-A Midland.

NBA PLAYOFFS; MORRIS TAKES DEEP BREATHS, NETS STAY ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Morris made two free throws with 1.5 seconds to play in overtime, giving 
the New Jersey Nets a 93-92 victory over the New York Knicks on Wednesday night 
and keeping the Nets alive in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks lead the series, 2-1, with the winner to meet the Chicago Bulls in 
an Eastern Conference semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris' free throws came after the Knicks rallied from a 16-point deficit in 
the second half. The Nets scored only nine points in the fourth quarter on 
two-of-16 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first shot was a definite must make," Morris said of the tying free 
throw. "I took a deep breath, relaxed and it felt good when it left my hand. 
Then they called time out to try to cool me.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to go into a second overtime because anything could happen. I 
went to the line, took another deep breath, relaxed and the ball caught the rim 
and went in." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, who scored only eight points and hadn't taken a free throw before his 
decisive shots, was a reluctant hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lot of pressure," he said. "If it happens again, I'll take it, but 
I'm not looking to be in that situation. I haven't ever been in that situation 
before, not even in high school. You're either the hero or the goat." 
</P>
<P>
 John Starks' three-point basket gave the Knicks a 90-89 lead with 1:04 to play 
in overtime, but reserve forward Armon Gilliam gave the lead back to the Nets 
with a dunk at the 43-second mark. Patrick Ewing's baseline jumper once again 
gave the Knicks a one-point lead, but Charles Oakley couldn't stop Morris' 
baseline drive, forcing him to foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Coleman, who made only 32% of his shots in the first two games of the 
series, finished with 25 points and 17 rebounds for the Nets. Guard Kenny 
Anderson had 17 points and 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing led the Knicks with 27 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a nice comeback, but we were a step slow early on," Knick Coach Pat 
Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get going until midway through the third quarter. We just have to 
go to work for Friday. The rest of this series is going to be a war." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who missed five of six shots in the first two quarters, scored nine 
points in the first 7:13 of the third as the Nets took their largest lead, 
70-54, with 4:07 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 A 7-0 run pulled the Knicks to within nine, but New Jersey took a 74-63 lead 
into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman did most of his damage in the first half with 19 points on eight-of-11 
shooting, leading the Nets to a 53-42 lead.

MORNING BRIEFING: RILEY PINS KNICK PLAYOFF HOPES ON TRULY BAMBOOZLING THEORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some philosophy from New York Knick Coach Pat Riley on his team's goal to win 
the NBA championship:  
</P>
<P>
 "You know how it works with the old Chinese bamboo tree. You plant the seed 
and it doesn't grow above ground for 10 years because it's laying on all its 
roots.  
</P>
<P>
 "Then, all of a sudden it grows 100 feet in the next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Hmm, the old bamboo theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What active coach has won the most NCAA championships in a single 
sport? 
</P>
<P>
 Return of the rabbit: Don Baylor, manager of the Colorado Rockies, has his own 
theory on the juiced ball controversy in the major leagues. Baylor says the 
game balls are similar to ones used when he played in the Texas League and 
International League in the late 1960s and early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're rabbit balls," he said. "I think they might have outlawed those 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 A new high: Mike Cofer, former San Francisco 49er kicker, after his first 
major stock car race at Stockton:  
</P>
<P>
 "Winning (the NASCAR Southwest Tour race) was a bigger high than kicking any 
field goal in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 Perspective: Buzzie Bavasi, retired Angel executive, told Gordon Edes of the 
Ft. Lauderdale (Fla.) Sun-Sentinel about the time an Angel player made the 
final out of an inning at third trying to take an extra base. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a terrible mistake," Bavasi said. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend beside him replied: "It wasn't as bad as the one I made." 
</P>
<P>
 The friend was Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: The USC-UCLA track and field meet, which will be held Saturday at Drake 
Stadium and include Washington and Brigham Young, has been a streaky series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans won the first 33 meets and the Bruins have won the last 15. USC 
leads in the overall series, 38-22. 
</P>
<P>
 Close decision: Michael Moorer, the new heavyweight champion, also excelled in 
football at Monessen (Pa.) High School. In 1986, he kicked the winning extra 
point to beat archrival Charleroi High and was also an outstanding linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 News flash: A KFWB report Wednesday, detailing the likelihood that Bruce 
McNall's ownership of the Kings will end in the next few days, said the new 
owners would be "Jeffrey Sudikoff and Joseph Cotten." 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Cotten died Feb. 6. The new owners, should the deal take place, will be 
Sudikoff and Joseph Cohen.  
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere to go: Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle writes that a 
player for the Rancho Cucamonga team in the California League might be doomed 
to be a minor leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
 His name? Homer Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 No charge: Sign in a Chicago gas station: "Cubs Bumper-stickers Removed Here.' 
</P>

 Trivia answer: Al Scates, UCLA men's volleyball coach, with 14.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; CANUCKS' BURE, MCLEAN PUT STARS IN A BAD SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pavel Bure scored two goals and Kirk McLean stopped 39 shots for his second 
shutout of the playoffs Wednesday night as the Vancouver Canucks defeated the 
Dallas Stars, 3-0, at Dallas to take a 2-0 lead in a Western Conference 
semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory before a booing sellout crowd of 16,914 in Reunion Arena sends the 
Canucks back home for the next three games of the best-of-seven series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our confidence has grown since we came back from being down, 3-1, to 
Calgary," assistant coach Stan Smyl said. "We lacked confidence all year. But 
we have it now." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a grueling seven-game series against the Flames, Vancouver has 
outskated and outhit the Stars, who had an eight-day rest after sweeping the 
St. Louis Blues. 
</P>
<P>
 McLean, 0-2 against the Stars during the regular season, made 16 saves in the 
first period as Vancouver spoiled three power plays. He kicked out four 
consecutive shots during one bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are going very well for me, but good play happens because of the guys 
around me," McLean said. "We still know that Dallas can come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Bure, who has six goals in his last nine playoff games, scored his second goal 
with only 21 seconds to play in the second period. He picked up a loose puck, 
faked out Derian Hatcher and wristed a forehand past goalie Andy Moog. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bure was inspired by the Stars' physical attention toward him," Canuck Coach 
Pat Quinn said. "The hits on him early really got him into the game. You look 
for Bure to score. In the other series, he was just creating attention, but 
here he is scoring on his own. . . . He's tougher than he's given credit for. 
Everybody wonders about their (Russian players') courage, but nobody should 
question his." 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 5, San Jose 1 -- Mark Osborne scored a key shorthanded goal in the 
second period, helping the Maple Leafs romp at Toronto to even the Western 
Conference semifinal series at 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Dmitri Mironov, Mike Gartner, Doug Gilmour and Wendel Clark also scored for 
the Maple Leafs, who had three power-play goals after failing to convert on 
five manpower advantages during a 3-2 loss in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto outshot San Jose, 13-3, in the first period. Mironov put the Maple 
Leafs ahead on the power play at 8:06 with a shot from the top of the left 
circle that beat goaltender Arturs Irbe. 
</P>
<P>
 Gartner made it 2-0 at 9:31 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne scored a shorthanded goal at 13:29 after Gilmour intercepted a pass in 
San Jose's zone to create a two-on-one.

 If they are playing "Call to the Post" when the baggage arrives at the airport 
carousel, this must be Derby week. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got the same feeling a quarterback probably has before the Super Bowl," 
said Gary Stevens, who will ride Brocco on Saturday. "I'm excited, but I don't 
want to get too caught up in all the hype. You can think about it too much." . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens said he was humbled on his first Derby Day in 1985 before riding Tanks 
Prospect to a seventh-place finish. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I envisioned a limousine picking me up and leaving me off at the front gate," 
he said. "Instead, I was in a car that got caught in a huge traffic jam. I 
walked the last mile and a half, carrying my bag." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Louisville Courier-Journal, the wettest Kentucky Derby was in 
1918, when an inch of rain fell, and the driest was "during Prohibition." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 You can't fool the locals. Three days before the Derby, mint julep sales were 
dismal at Churchill Downs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Favorite jockey cliche this week: "My horse is full of himself." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how filly Lakeway would do if she ran Saturday instead of Friday in the 
Kentucky Oaks, trainer Gary Jones said, "She'd have a chance, but would you 
rather be 3-2 or 13-1?" . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A local antique shop is asking $200 for a Derby souvenir glass autographed by 
Pat Day, who won in 1992 aboard Lil E. Tee. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Lukas says the Triple Crown format should be changed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He suggests shortening the Derby distance from 1 1/4 miles to 1 1/8, giving 
the horses three weeks off instead of two before the Preakness and shortening 
the Belmont Stakes from 1 1/2 miles to 1 1/4. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The fields would be more competitive, fillies would have a better chance, and 
you might get more Triple Crown winners," said Lukas, who will saddle Tabasco 
Cat on Saturday. "The traditionalists might complain, but they're the same 
people who thought the three-point shot would ruin basketball." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing wrong with Lukas' plan is that it's too logical. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Calumet Farm, which was bought for $17 million at a foreclosure auction in 
1992 by horse breeder Henryk de Kwiatkowski, is making a comeback. It is home 
to 173 horses four years after going into bankruptcy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the final two tracts of another famous Lexington farm that has 
experienced hard times, Spendthrift, will be sold at auction. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Kandaly is a longshot, but owner Ronnie Lamarque is sparing no expense 
publicizing his horse. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There is a "Go, Kandaly, Go" billboard not far from the track, and Wednesday 
night Lamarque treated the media and friends to 2,000 pounds of Louisiana 
crayfish. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The same cab ride that usually costs $10 will cost $21 on Oaks Day and $26 on 
Derby Day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Best place outside Louisville to watch the Derby will be Hollywood Park, where 
wagering also will be offered on five other stakes from Churchill Downs and 
nine live races. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Favorite Holy Bull's color is that of a shark. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Charlie Whittingham, 81, wears a 72-year-old tattoo of Man 'O War on 
his right arm. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham has won the Derby twice -- with Ferdinand in 1986 and Sunday 
Silence in 1989 -- but Man 'O War didn't run in the race. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The horse some still consider the greatest of all time was eligible in 1920, 
but owner Samuel Riddle thought the race was too taxing and too early in the 
year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago fan Randy Winick, the trainer of Brocco, wore a Dodger jacket and shed 
his Cub cap Wednesday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cubs are embarrassing me," he explained. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Winick, who was a trainer for 35 years and often dominated the Florida 
circuit, couldn't be more proud of his son. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Randy is a much better trainer than I was," Arnold said. "He's extremely 
conscientious and he loves what he's doing. Brocco doesn't remind me of any of 
my horses. He reminds me of the very special ones." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Winick's other 3-year-old, Duca, was a $360,000 purchase. Brocco cost 
$215,000. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Kentucky Derby Museum makes a trip to Churchill Downs worthwhile, even on 
days when there is no racing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Cauthen, whose election to the Racing Hall of Fame was announced 
Wednesday, has lost his British accent after riding in Europe from 1979-92. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing you dream about after you sign up for your jockey's license 
is winning the Kentucky Derby," said Kent Desormeaux, who will ride Soul Of The 
Matter. "It would be precious."

PITCH MIGHT HAVE BROKEN BONDS' RIGHT ARM; BASEBALL: SAN FRANCISCO STAR IS HIT 
BY METS' HILLMAN, AND GIANTS AREN'T HAPPY ABOUT IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Newsday

<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Francisco Giants left Shea Stadium on Wednesday concerned and upset 
about a pitch from New York's Eric Hillman that left Barry Bonds' right arm in 
a sling. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds, generally considered the best player in baseball, might have suffered a 
broken arm when he was hit by a pitch just above the elbow in the third 
inning.He left in the fourth for X-rays that were inconclusive, and will 
undergo a bone scan today in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers face the Giants in the first game of a four-game series tonight at 
Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds had hit a two-run homer in the first inning and came up in the third 
after Robby Thompson's homer gave the Giants a 3-1 lead. Hillman drilled Bonds 
with a 1-and-1 pitch and was warned by second base umpire Paul Runge, with 
plate umpire Tom Hallion also at the mound. Met Manager Dallas Green went out 
to question the warning. 
</P>
<P>
 But Giant Manager Dusty Baker was unhappy about the pitch, as well as what it 
might mean for his club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like it. Nobody likes it," Baker said, after the Giants' 7-4 loss. 
"It looked kind of obvious, especially after Barry hit a home run, Robby hit a 
home run and Barry's up next." 
</P>
<P>
 Hillman, who had trouble with command in four spotty innings, said: "I wasn't 
trying to hit him. Here's a guy making $7 million a year, so I've got to 
establish the inside of the plate." 
</P>
<P>
 On his way to the team bus for a flight home, Bonds talked briefly with Bobby 
Bonilla, his former teammate and close friend. Asked about Bonds' mood, Bonilla 
said: "Anytime you leave a baseball game with your arm in a sling, you're not 
going to be happy."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CUBS ARE GOATS NO LONGER AFTER REDS FALL, 5-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
 A goat, Ernie Banks and a meeting finally helped the Cubs win at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs stopped their club-record home losing streak at 12 games, defeating 
the Cincinnati Reds, 5-2, on Wednesday for their first victory of the season at 
Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'One game doesn't make a season,' but I say, 'One win a life may 
have saved,' " said Cub Manager Tom Trebelhorn. "I never went through anything 
like this. I'm glad it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs, who broke a 92-year-old club record Tuesday, held a team meeting 
before Wednesday's game, then went out and won at Wrigley Field for the first 
time since last Sept. 22, when they beat the St. Louis Cardinals, 11-9. 
Chicago's streak ended two short of the National League record set by the 
Boston Braves in 1911. 
</P>
<P>
 "We handled it like men," first baseman Mark Grace said. "We didn't blame 
anybody but ourselves. There was no front-office bashing. We didn't take the 
cowardly way out. It feels like we're in first place. It's a huge win, a 
wonderful feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Banks, a Hall of Famer who might be the most popular former Cub, paraded a 
goat around the field before the game in a radio station's effort to break a 
49-year-old curse. Banishment of a saloonkeeper's goat from Wrigley Field 
during the 1945 World Series prompted the animal's owner to put a famous curse 
on the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Trachsel, the Cub starting pitcher, thought the stunt was bush league. 
</P>
<P>
 "It distracted me while I was warming up in the bullpen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grace, meanwhile, helped organize a pregame meeting in an effort to stop the 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about being enthusiastic and to hustle, and trying to get back to 
basics -- things to give us a boost," Ryne Sandberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trebelhorn juggled his lineup again, returning Sandberg to the No. 2 spot, 
starting Eddie Zambrano in right field, moving Sammy Sosa from right to center 
and benching center fielder Karl Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sosa led off the bottom of the first with a home run and Zambrano also 
homered. 
</P>
<P>
 "That first at-bat set the tone," said catcher Eddie Taubensee of the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 Trachsel (3-2) gave up two runs and four hits in seven innings, struck out two 
and walked three. Randy Myers, the Cubs' fourth pitcher, struck out the side in 
the ninth for his fourth save in five chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Browning (3-1) helped Chicago by giving up four runs and seven hits in 3 
2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 6, Colorado 5 -- Bernard Gilkey hit a two-run homer in the ninth 
inning against Darren Holmes to lift the Cardinals at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals trailed, 5-1, entering the eighth, but scored three times 
against a faltering Rockies bullpen, then went ahead in the ninth when Todd 
Zeile doubled against Holmes (0-3) and Gilkey followed with his second home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 3, Florida 0 -- Steve Avery pitched eight shutout innings at Atlanta 
to help the Braves end their worst losing streak in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Avery (2-1) gave up four hits in eight innings as the Braves ended a four-game 
losing streak and won for only the third time in 12 games. The last time 
Atlanta had dropped nine of 11 was April 13-24, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Avery struck out eight and walked one in ending the Marlins' three-game 
winning streak. Greg McMichael gave up two hits in the ninth but picked up his 
sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 7, Pittsburgh 4 -- Craig Biggio of the Astros hit a go-ahead triple in 
the eighth inning and a two-run single in the ninth at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Servais drove in a pair of runs as Darryl Kile (3-1) withstood his own 
wildness to beat Pittsburgh for the third consecutive time in the last two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Kile shook off a two-run Pittsburgh first to pitch five-hit ball over seven 
innings as the Astros swept the two-game series.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ALVAREZ BEATS INDIANS TO RUN STREAK TO 13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wilson Alvarez won his 13th consecutive decision spanning two seasons and 
improved to 6-0 this year, pitching a six-hitter as the Chicago White Sox 
defeated the Cleveland Indians, 6-1, on Wednesday night at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez is two shy of LaMarr Hoyt's club-record 15 consecutive victories in 
the regular season, set from July 1983 to April 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez's streak does not include his victory in last year's American League 
playoffs, when he won against the Toronto Blue Jays at Toronto in his only 
postseason start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think about the wins," Alvarez said. "I just want to win for my team. 
I want to go to the playoffs again. That's my dream, I want to be in the World 
Series." 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 4, Oakland 3 -- Lee Smith blew a save chance for the first time this 
season, but the Orioles bounced back to win in Oakland on Mike Devereaux's 
sacrifice fly in the 10th inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith relieved in the ninth after the Orioles had taken a 3-2 lead, and 
entered with a 0.00 ERA and 12 saves in 12 appearances. Pinch-hitter Troy Neel, 
however, tied it with a home run with one out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles, who went ahead in the ninth on Chris Sabo's solo homer with two 
outs off Dennis Eckersley (0-3), won it in the next inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Voigt reached on third baseman Mike Brumley's error, and Edwin Nunez 
relieved Eckersley. After Brady Anderson walked, Voigt went to third on a wild 
pitch by Nunez and scored on Devereaux's fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 4, Seattle 2 -- Danny Darwin gave up four hits in 7 1/3 innings and 
Mike Greenwell and Mo Vaughn homered at Boston to lead the Red Sox to their 
seventh consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox improved baseball's best record to 20-7, their fastest start since 
opening the 1946 season 23-4. But they are 13-2 against American League West 
teams, none of which has a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
 Darwin (5-1) retired the last 13 batters he faced, but the last forced him 
out. Felix Fermin hit a liner off Darwin, who threw to first for the out, then 
knelt in pain and was replaced by Todd Frohwirth. 
</P>
<P>
 Darwin struck out four and walked none. Frohwirth, in his first appearance 
since being called up Tuesday from the minors, picked up his first save. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 6, Toronto 4 -- Felix Jose hit a two-run homer in the 10th inning 
to give the Royals the victory at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 After Gary Gaetti singled with two outs against Darren Hall (0-1), Jose 
followed with a drive to right field for his first home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Brewer (2-0) pitched two perfect innings for the victory. Jeff 
Montgomery picked up his second save. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals tied the score at 4-4 in the eighth when Gaetti led off with a 
double and scored on a one-out single by pinch-hitter Hubie Brooks against Tony 
Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 8, Milwaukee 7 -- Shane Mack's two-out triple scored Kirby Puckett 
with the winning run in the ninth inning at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 7-7, and two outs in the ninth, Puckett singled against 
Graeme Lloyd (1-2). Mack then ripped a liner down the right-field line that 
deflected off first baseman John Jaha's glove and rolled into the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Right fielder Turner Ward quickly retrieved the ball and relayed it to second 
baseman Alex Diaz, whose throw to the plate just missed getting Puckett. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Hamilton went four for five for the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 14, Texas 7 -- Lou Whitaker, back in the lineup after sitting out two 
games because of a sore left foot, hit a grand slam and a three-run homer for 
the Tigers at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker's three-run homer highlighted Detroit's six-run third inning, and he 
added his third career grand slam in the eighth to set a career high with seven 
runs batted in.

WITH VASEY'S HELP, FULLERTON WALKS ALL OVER NORTHRIDGE, 13-1; COLLEGE BASEBALL: 
WILDNESS GRIPS MATADOR RIGHT-HANDER, WHO THROWS A WILD PITCH, ISSUES FOUR BASES 
ON BALLS AND COMMITS AN ERROR IN 1 2/3 INNINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It wasn't so much the hitters that Cal State Northridge right-hander Brian 
Vasey faced that killed him as much as the ones he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 At least in an official, funky, statistical sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasey, who started Wednesday night's game with Cal State Fullerton, was eaten 
alive by a handful of hitters who didn't record at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Their impact, however, was very real as the Titans routed Northridge, 13-1, in 
a nonconference game at Titan Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasey (1-2) lasted only 1 2/3 innings before being chased. In that time, he 
allowed only two hits, but was done in by his own hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 12 batters Vasey officially faced, only four had official at-bats. 
Simply put, Vasey couldn't throw the ball between the backstop poles: He walked 
four batters and threw a wild pitch. He also served up a pair of sacrifice 
flies and a sacrifice bunt and was victimized by two errors, including one of 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Northridge (24-26) escaped the second inning, Fullerton (36-10) 
already had claimed a 7-0 lead on only two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been that bad," Vasey said. "I've been wild before at times, but 
nothing like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasey might have known it wasn't his night in the bottom of the first, when 
Northridge -- which has seen its share of strange things on the field -- again 
was burned by a head-shaker. With All-American outfielder Dante Powell on third 
and one out, Powell bolted for home on a steal attempt. And why not? He ranked 
among the national NCAA Division I leaders with 36 entering the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge catcher Eric Gillespie, who played with Powell at Millikan High in 
Long Beach, jumped out from behind the plate, grabbed Vasey's pitch and slapped 
the tag on Powell in plenty of time. Trouble was, Gillespie was in the batter's 
box when he caught the ball and was called for a catcher's balk. Powell was 
credited with the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the first inning was complete, Fullerton had a 2-0 lead without so much 
as a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't get in the groove," said Vasey, who threw 170 pitches in a game 
against San Diego State last Friday. "I felt like I was ready. Maybe there was 
a little bit of fatigue, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, ranked third nationally by Baseball America, essentially put the 
game away in the second, when Vasey gave up a booming two-run double to 
starting pitcher Mark Kotsay. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Contreras relieved with Kotsay at second and Fullerton holding a 6-0 
lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Kotsay moved to third on a wild pitch and scored when Gillespie fired the ball 
into left field. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton used four pitchers to put the clamps on the Matadors. Left-hander 
Kotsay (2-0), a freshman, pitched two scoreless innings and was credited with 
the victory.  
</P>
<P>
 The foursome held Northridge to seven hits -- three after the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Northridge pitchers walked 11 over eight innings and gave up 14 hits.

PIONEERS WIN IT FOR THEIR COACH; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: SIMI VALLEY RALLIES TO 
DEFEAT THOUSAND OAKS, 4-3, THEN SHOWS ALLEGIANCE TO SCYPHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The members of the Simi Valley High baseball team sat behind second base after 
their 4-3 Marmonte League victory over Thousand Oaks on Wednesday, waving their 
black caps and yelling "Scyph!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was all a tribute to Mike Scyphers, who coached the team until Tuesday, 
when he was removed pending a police investigation into possible financial and 
disciplinary improprieties. Scyphers had quietly slipped beyond the outfield 
fence early in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers watched assistants Russ Stephans and Scott Radinsky lead the Pioneers 
to a come-from-behind victory. Needing to win to stay in the thick of the 
Marmonte League playoff race, Simi Valley did it on Ryan Hankins' RBI single in 
the bottom of the seventh. "This is pretty big," Hankins said. "The next three 
games are for (Scyphers)." 
</P>
<P>
 Most players refused comment on the allegations against Scyphers. After the 
game, however, they all signed a petition saying they wanted Scyphers back. A 
large black No. 2, Scyphers' number, was posted next to the lineup on the back 
wall of the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 The black hats -- the players were symbolically mourning the loss of Scyphers 
-- were courtesy of junior varsity Coach Doug Marion. To get 50 black caps on 
such short notice, Marion had to order them from a company in Ontario. He drove 
halfway there and met a delivery person. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephans said the team will wear the hats for the remainder of the season. 
Stephans added that he is prepared to coach the Pioneers for the final three 
regular-season games and into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to coach the rest of the season," Stephans said. "Our goal is to 
make the playoffs. All I know is we have practice tomorrow and play Camarillo 
on Friday. And we've got next week. I'm going to be here every day and Scott is 
going to be here every day. I'm planning on making out the lineup the rest of 
the year until they tell me different. If they tell me different, I'd love to 
see him come back out." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephans said he didn't know what Scyphers might have done to cause such a 
stir. "I find it hard to believe he's involved in any wrongdoing," Stephans 
said. "He's a great man. He's got a great family. He loves the game of baseball 
and I just can't see him doing anything to jeopardize that." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents circulated a petition during the game in support of Scyphers. At least 
18 parents signed the petition, in which they indicated they had no problems 
with Scyphers' disciplinary tradition known as "The Block," where players bid 
for the right to administer a single paddling to teammates who break rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really disappointed," Stephans said. "It's his whole life. Whether he's 
getting railroaded or they have it out for him I don't know, but if there's $10 
unaccounted for and they hang him out for that, that's brutal." 
</P>
<P>
 Some players wore the Nos. 2 and 30 on parts of their uniforms. No. 30 
belonged to senior pitcher Bill Scheffels, who dropped out of school this week 
rather than face an expulsion hearing for allegedly making a prank bomb threat 
at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Two uniformed Simi Valley police officers were at a portion of the game, but 
they said they were there merely as spectators. "I'm just sick of it," Hankins 
said. "(Scyphers) didn't do anything wrong."

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: AFTER 30 YEARS, CONNIE KALITTA FINALLY NO. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Look who's leading the National Hot Rod Assn. top fuel standings -- Connie 
Kalitta, the old Bounty Hunter from Ypsilanti, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalitta has been racing dragsters, off and on, for more than 30 years, and 
this is the first time he has ever been No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, he was in drag racing before the NHRA became a reality, a throwback 
to the days when kids took their hot-rodders out into the sticks and raced for 
the pink slip. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Kalitta's feat -- after five events of the NHRA season -- more 
remarkable is that he had been out of the sport for more than a year and when 
he returned, he didn't even qualify for the season-opening Winternationals at 
Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the next four races, he won at Gainesville, Fla., and Atlanta and 
reached the semifinals the other two times out. 
</P>
<P>
 His final-round victory at Atlanta, which gave him the lead, was a battle of 
the ages as Kalitta, 56, defeated defending champion Eddie Hill, 58. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalitta's son, Scott, is second in the top fuel standings. Until 1993, when 
Connie dropped out to concentrate on expanding his air cargo business, he had 
been Scott's crew chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, too busy to crew for Scott, he hired 1987 top fuel champion Dick 
LaHaie as Scott's crew chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened last year was a real eye-opener for me," Kalitta said. "The way 
Scott came into his own with Dick doing the tuning told me that I needed to get 
off my ego trip and not try and do the tuning on my own car, either, when I 
decided to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Kalitta hired Tim Richards, one of top fuel's most accomplished crew chiefs, 
to run his team. Richards was twice named crew chief of the year while helping 
Joe Amato win four championships between 1984 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 And Richards' crew includes Kim LaHaie, who was her father's crew chief when 
he won the championship in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "Experience-wise, no one can match our team," Kalitta said. "I hadn't realized 
how much computerization had changed the sport. I had always taken the crap 
shooter's approach. I won some and lost a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richards is more businesslike. He approaches it with the meticulousness of an 
accountant. We've had some luck along the way, but you can't beat our results. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both crew chiefs use qualifying to learn the track so when the eliminations 
start on Sunday, they know how to approach each round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to focus on winning the final round, but they've taught me you need to 
focus on the next round, whether it's the first or the final. Consistency, not 
sudden streaks of brilliance, wins drag races." 
</P>
<P>
 The next round, the Mid-South Nationals, will be at Memphis on May 14-15. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kalittas made drag racing history at Houston when they ran the quickest 
side-by-side race ever -- Scott's 4.748 seconds beating his father's 4.789. 
</P>
<P>
 They met again in the Gatornationals finals at Gainesville where Connie won in 
the first-ever top fuel father-son final. 
</P>
<P>
 When Connie started, racing was his business and flying his hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 The reverse is now true. Kalitta took his winnings from the 1967 Pomona 
Winternationals and several other races to buy a 310 Cessna. 
</P>
<P>
 He still has the Cessna, but his air cargo fleet of 65 aircraft also includes 
Boeing 727s, DC-9s, DC-8s, Boeing 747s, Lear jets, Turbine Beechs and a King 
Air 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Transporting thoroughbred racehorses is one of the company's major projects, 
but Kalitta has also moved whales from Tokyo to Honolulu, reindeer from New 
Zealand to Canada and once carried a 3-foot cube of ice from a glacier in 
Greenland to the United States as part of a geologic study. 
</P>
<P>
 "That had to be the most expensive ice cube in the world," Kalitta said. 
</P>

 Motor Racing Notes

<P>
 STOCK CARS -- Saugus Speedway will hold the first round of the Frontier Toyota 
sportsman championship series with a 75-lap main event Saturday night. . . . 
Also scheduled: Coors street stock series Friday night at Ventura Raceway, 
Winston Racing Series at Cajon Speedway on Saturday night, Kragen series 
Saturday night at Santa Maria Speedway and modifieds Sunday at Kern County 
Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 SPRINT CARS -- Corey Kruseman, a rookie driver from Ventura, had a busy April. 
First, he went to France with Glenn Harris' California Gold troupe of 
three-quarter midget drivers and won four heat races after being fast qualifier 
both nights at the Paris Palais Omnisports. When he returned home, Kruseman, 
23, won a 30-lap Sprint Car Racing Assn. main event on Imperial Raceway's dusty 
three-eights-mile clay oval last Saturday night. He is the first rookie driver 
to win a West Coast non-winged sprint car race since Bobby George won at Ascot 
Park in 1985. It was also the first sprint car victory for car owner Harlan 
Willis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dedicate this win to my dad," Kruseman said in an emotional victory 
ceremony at the El Centro track after holding off veteran Ron Shuman on the 
final lap. His father, Ron Kruseman, died in a TQ midget race on the same track 
10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Kruseman will be the hometown favorite Saturday night when the SCRA takes on 
the quarter-mile oval at Ventura Raceway. Former California Racing Assn. 
champions Shuman, Brad Noffsinger and Mike Kirby are also entered. . . . The 
CRA has apparently folded its tent. Last week's program at Canyon Raceway in 
Arizona was canceled, as is the annual nine-race CRA tour of Midwestern and 
East Coast tracks scheduled this month. 
</P>
<P>
 MOTORCYCLES -- Costa Mesa Speedway will be host of its first Coors Light 
Challenge for speedway bikes on Friday night at the Orange County Fairgrounds. 
Five riders -- Charlie Venegas, Bobby Schwartz, Josh Larsen, Mike Faria and 
Gary Hicks -- will compete in a series of one-lap elimination heats. . . . 
Speedway season openers are scheduled tonight at Glen Helen Park in San 
Bernardino and Saturday night at Speedway USA in Victorville. 
</P>
<P>
 MISCELLANY -- A United States Auto Club western regional double-header of full 
and TQ midgets is scheduled Saturday night at Hanford. . . . National champion 
John Force will be in the field Saturday night when Firebird Raceway in 
Chandler, Ariz., holds its annual Coors 32 Funny Car eliminations. . . . Bill 
Tempero became the American Racing Series' all-time winner when he won 
back-to-back 50-lap races last week at Willow Springs Raceway. He has 15 
victories to 14 for Johnny Unser.

VELAZCO HELPS SYLMAR PUT SQUEEZE ON POLY IN 11TH, 6-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly four hours of baseball, Sylmar High's Carlos Velazco would have 
given his right arm to put an end to the Spartans' East Valley League game 
against Poly on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fact is, he did give his right arm for two innings of middle relief, but the 
Spartans needed something else.And Velazco was there to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 Velazco's squeeze bunt in the 11th inning drove in Tommy Mitchell to give the 
Spartans a 6-5 victory in front of about 250. 
</P>
<P>
 Velazco put an end to the teams' second extra-inning game in three days. 
Sylmar (21-3, 12-0 in league play), The Times' top-ranked team in the area, 
needed eight innings for a 1-0 victory at Poly (17-4, 9-3) on Velazco's 
two-hitter Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 11 innings, I'll do whatever it takes to win," Velazco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar Coach Gary Donatella called for the squeeze because the Spartans were 
having great difficulty against Poly relief pitcher Javier Vasquez, who 
relieved in the second and did not surrender a hit until the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hadn't been making great contact off that guy," Donatella said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vasquez (3-3), who was using a splitter to baffle the Spartans, had 
tremendous control problems early. He walked seven (two intentionally) and hit 
five batters by game's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he allowed just three hits in nine innings and was unhittable for 
the first 6 2/3 innings of his relief appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar parlayed three hits -- including Velazco's solo home run -- and three 
errors into a 3-0 lead in the first inning. Poly tied it, 5-5, in the sixth on 
three hits, three walks and an error. Sylmar starter Mario Cervantes (5-0) was 
pulled in the sixth, but returned in the eighth and allowed just two hits in 
the final four innings.

MOORPARK DOWNS CALABASAS, RUNS UP FLAG, 7-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Not only was Calabasas High trying to halt Moorpark's undefeated run toward a 
Frontier League pennant Wednesday, the Coyotes still had a chance for a 
co-championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas had the right idea by sending left-handed ace Anthony Kaufman 
against Moorpark, which features five left-handed hitters. But Kaufman allowed 
the leadoff man to reach base in four of the first five innings, walked six and 
hit three. He blew two leads and Calabasas fell, 7-6, when Moorpark scored in 
the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say I struggled," Kaufman said. "I was around the plate and 
sometimes the umpire didn't give me (the call). Moorpark had a little luck, and 
they battled." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark (18-3, 10-0 in Frontier play) clinched the league title thanks to 
three errors, eight walks and four hit-batsmen courtesy of Calabasas (14-5, 
6-2). 
</P>
<P>
 The winning run was forced in when Moorpark's Rick Collier was hit on the shin 
by a fastball from Gabe Feldman (1-1). Moorpark's Brian Garrettson (7-0) 
pitched a complete game, walking only two. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a way to get the game-winning RBI," Collier said. "But we won the 
league. Hopefully, we'll win the CIF now." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman lived on the edge for three innings, but Moorpark wouldn't let him off 
the hook in the fourth, even with two out and the bases empty. Craig Weaver 
singled and took second on an error. Pinch hitter Jason Adamson was walked 
intentionally and Kaufman hit Travis Ehrlich with an 0-and-2 pitch to load the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Hall's two-run single gave the Musketeers a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman walked two and hit another in the fifth but right fielder Mitch Tisher 
saved him by robbing Hall of a three-run home run, and Calabasas regained the 
lead with three runs in bottom of the inning. Mike Melucci hit a two-run double 
to make it 3-2 and scored on a single by Sam Rutherford. 
</P>
<P>
 The Musketeers came back with four in the sixth on RBI singles by Collier and 
Adam Rauch, a sacrifice fly by Garrettson and a passed ball that scored Collier 
from third. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas tied it, 6-6, in the bottom of the sixth on a two-out, two-run 
double by Haessig, but gave it away again in the seventh when Feldman walked 
two and an error loaded the bases before Feldman hit Collier with the first 
pitch.

FLYING FINN SALLINEN VAULTS 16-4 3/4

<TEXT>
<P>
 Esa Sallinen of Burroughs High, a senior exchange student from Finland, 
cleared 16 feet 4 3/4 inches in the pole vault in the Foothill League track and 
field finals Wednesday at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of a persistent tail wind, Sallinen cleared 13-0, 14-0, 15-0, 
16-0 and the magical -- for him -- five-meter height (16-4 3/4) on his first 
attempts before missing three times at 16-8. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is unbelievable," Sallinen said. "Five meters has been a big goal of 
mine for a long time. I've been chasing that mark for the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Sallinen, whose previous best was 16-0 1/4, moved to fourth on the all-time 
regional list and to second on this season's state list behind Scott Slover 
(17-0) of San Jose Leland High. 
</P>
<P>
 In other events, Hart's Jason Medearis won the 110-meter high hurdles (14.2 
seconds) and 300 intermediates (37.8), and Canyon's Mike Wenz won the 800 in a 
region-leading time of 1:54.4. JOHN ORTEGA

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Channel Islands High pinch-runner Kenny Long scored the winning run from 
second base in the seventh inning Wednesday to lift the host Raiders to a 4-3 
Marmonte League victory over Camarillo. Long scored when Erik Jue misplayed 
Nacho Godinez's two-strike bunt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders (15-8, 7-4 in league play) remain tied for second place with Simi 
Valley with three league games left. 
</P>
<P>
 Godinez (3-1) earned the victory in relief of starter Rene Sanchez, who had a 
no-hitter through 6 1/3 innings before giving up three runs on an error, a 
single and two doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Olivares was perfect at the plate for Channel Islands with a single, a 
double and a triple. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura 3, Royal 2 -- Charger Kevin Sass hit the decisive two-run home run in 
the sixth inning of the Marmonte League game at Royal (13-8, 6-5). Agoura

<P>
 Newbury Park 10, Westlake 3 -- Jeff Bennett hit a two-run home run to key the 
Panthers' five-run sixth inning that iced the Marmonte League game at Newbury 
Park (17-5, 10-1). Keith Smith (6-2) earned the complete-game victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame 6, St. Bernard 2 -- Jabbar Craigwell hit a two-run homer and Justin 
Bunch had a pair of doubles in four at-bats for visiting Notre Dame (15-5, 9-2) 
in the Mission League game. Senior left-hander Rich Igou (8-2) struck out seven 
and yielded three hits while recording his eighth complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany 9, Loyola 2 -- Kris Yeamen's three-run home run snapped a 1-1 
third-inning tie and sent host Alemany to the Mission League victory.

<P>
 Chaminade 2, Bishop Montgomery 1 -- Gabe Crecion's solo home run with one out 
in the bottom of the eighth carried host Chaminade (14-8, 6-5) to a Mission 
League victory -- the 10th in 13 games and setting a school record for 
victories in Division I play. 
</P>

 Birmingham 4, Monroe 3 -- Brave outfielder David Cohen tripled in the top of 
the eighth inning and scored the winning run on Lionel Villareal's two-out

ANTELOPE VALLEY UNNERVES RIO HONDO, 7-0, CLAIMS FOOTHILL TITLE; COLLEGE 
SOFTBALL: MARAUDERS TAKE SECOND CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP IN A ROW. MEYER WINS 
20TH, STRIKES OUT 14. 
</P>

<P>
 Knowing you can't do worse than at least a tie for first place has a way of 
keeping you from getting nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley College softball team, already assured of no worse than a 
co-championship in the Foothill Conference, took the field Wednesday at Marie 
Kerr Park feeling no pressure and cruised to a 7-0 victory over Rio Hondo to 
claim the title. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second consecutive conference championship for the Marauders (40-9, 
11-1 in conference play), who went into the game with a one-game lead over 
second-place Chaffey. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are playing a (California) state-level of ball," Marauder Coach Gene 
Pagliaro said. "We want to win the regional and the state. This is the first 
step of the three big steps." 
</P>
<P>
 The regionals will be held May 13-14. The Marauders hope to play host to one 
of those and advance to the state tournament May 20-22. 
</P>
<P>
 They might have taken another important step toward that goal with their 
shutout of Rio Hondo (10-15, 4-8) in a game controlled by right-hander Heather 
Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer, a sophomore from Quartz Hill High, improved to 20-5 with a five-hit, 
14-strikeout performance. And she also inflicted some damage with her bat. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out in the first inning and the Marauders leading, 1-0, Meyer 
clobbered a pitch from right-hander Vicky Elias (7-10) over the head of center 
fielder Jessica Treat for a two-run triple. 
</P>
<P>
 She also singled in the fifth and scored on a sacrifice fly by Christina Smith 
that gave Antelope Valley a 6-0 cushion. 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder Tiffany Lanier and second baseman Donna Villa (an RBI triple) 
each had two hits for the Marauders.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: CSUN AWAITS WORD ON NEW SCOREBOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The scoreboard at Matador Field, installed in the early 1970s, is older than 
most of the players on the Cal State Northridge baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, it was a very good scoreboard," said Bob Hiegert, the school's 
athletic director and former baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 By today's standards, it is obsolete. Several area high schools have better 
scoreboards. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes according to plan, the baseball, softball and football facilities 
might soon have new scoreboards. Hiegert said the school is negotiating with 
beverage companies to install advertising on the scoreboards to defray the cost 
of installation and purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake delayed the process, but Hiegert said he hopes to 
have the scoreboards in place by next year. The new scoreboards would feature 
electronic message boards, which could be used to announce any relevant 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Matador Field goes, Hiegert said he hopes to install sunken dugouts 
to improve the field sight lines and to redesign the backstop screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything will help. The baseball team averaged 167 fans at Matador Field 
during its first 20 home games. CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 A Little Extra 
</P>
<P>
 Call Steve Moreno the guttiest little Matador. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno, a walk-on infielder, wasn't expected to play much this season. But now 
that he's in the lineup, he doesn't want to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno had four at-bats last season at Long Beach City College and entered the 
crucial San Diego State series last weekend with a .167 average (three for 18). 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Moreno (5-foot-8, 150 pounds) went four for 11 in the series, reached base 
seven times and scored the winning run in victories on Friday and Saturday. He 
even socked a solo home run Sunday. Moreno said he last homered in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if he's ever hit one out of here in (batting practice)," Coach 
Bill Kernen said. "It shows what you can do if you want to play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge first baseman Andy Shaw is so far ahead of his initial 
rehabilitation projections that he took batting practice with the team 
Wednesday night at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, the Western State Conference player of the year last season at College 
of the Canyons, had knee surgery in the preseason. At the time, it was 
uncertain whether he would be available to play in 1995, much less sooner. The 
knee has responded so well to treatment that Shaw might be allowed to play 
baseball this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be a junior in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Track assistant Tony Veney figures the Matadors have the athletes needed to 
run 3 minutes 7 seconds in the men's 1,600-meter relay. 
</P>
<P>
 A foursome of junior Marshall Evans, senior Troy Collins, freshman Derek 
Favorite and sophomore Chris Brown timed 3:09.94 to place sixth in the 
California-Nevada collegiate championships on Sunday, but that might be the 
final assault on the school record (3:09.81) this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel like we've got a team that can run 3:07 or 3:08," Veney said. 
"But it just hasn't happened yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge was on pace to break the school record after the first two legs of 
Sunday's race -- clocking 1:33.9 at the halfway point -- but the Matadors timed 
1:36.0 over the final two legs, narrowly missing the mark set last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Akiem Brown -- no relation to Chris Brown -- had been the Matadors' 
anchor man for most of the season, but he did not run Sunday because of what 
Veney described as an "irritation" in the upper part of his rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Brown's discomfort apparently resulted from strained muscles, Veney 
and his fellow Northridge coaches decided not to take any chances until Brown 
was examined by a team doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make sure we took all the necessary precautions," Veney said. 
JUNIOR COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 One More Step 
</P>
<P>
 Two more rounds of golf like the ones he had Monday and Kelly Schlender of 
Ventura College could wrap up the season in high style. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlender will be one of 60 players who will compete for the state individual 
title Monday at the Mission Viejo Country Club. He qualified with rounds of 79 
and 71 at the par-72 Santa Ana Country Club this week to win the Southern 
California Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 His scores weren't enough to help Ventura advance to the state tournament. The 
Pirates finished sixth in the team competition, though notice was served that 
Schlender will be among the top contenders for individual honors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should be the logical favorite," Ventura Coach Brian Marshall said. "He's 
definitely in the hunt. His own home course (Wood Ranch in Simi Valley) is 
similar to the Mission Viejo course. They are both long and his style lends 
itself to that kind of course." 
</P>
<P>
 If Schlender wins, he will become the third individual state champion from 
Ventura. Mark Singer won the title in 1985 and Jim Johnson followed suit a year 
later. Singer, who didn't play in 1986, returned to Ventura in 1987 and missed 
winning another state championship by one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who pressed Schlender for the individual regional title was Aki 
Amaya, who graduated from Birmingham High in 1991 and is now the top player at 
Saddleback College in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaya, the Orange Empire Conference player of the year, shot rounds of 77 and 
79 to finish six strokes behind Schlender. But his score helped the Gauchos, 
who were 21-1 in conference play this season, win the regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaya attended San Jose State for two years before enrolling at Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It's rare to see an aluminum bat break in a game, but two within a matter of 
minutes is downright otherworldly. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it happened during a 6-3 victory by Pierce over Bakersfield in a recent 
Western State Conference South Division game. 
</P>
<P>
 Against left-hander Adam West of Pierce in the second inning, Bill Rutherford 
sent an RBI single up the middle. The ball was followed by the top half of the 
bat, which flew past West. 
</P>
<P>
 An inning later, Richard Parra hit a bloop single over first base against 
West, his bat breaking on the swing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You break two bats and you get two hits on them?" asked Pierce Coach Bob 
Lofrano. "That's nuts." Around the Campuses . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * The opposition has stolen 78 bases in 100 attempts against Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 * The cleanup spot in the Northridge lineup has hit a cumulative .300 average 
(57 for 190) over the first 49 games, but has accounted for only 23 runs batted 
in. Six players have hit in the fourth spot. 
</P>
<P>
 * In six games against San Diego State, first baseman Jason Shanahan was 12 
for 27 and drove in eight runs. However, his 15-game hitting streak was snapped 
with an 0-for-4 performance against the Aztecs on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Northridge entered the week with a record of 24-25 and is in danger of 
becoming the first school baseball team to have a losing season since 1988, 
when the Matadors finished 22-23 in their final year under Terry Craven.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: SIEGEL HITS HER STRIDE AS A UNLV WALK-ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nevada Las Vegas catcher Heather Siegel has grown accustomed to beating long 
odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas softball Coach Shan McDonald had never heard of Siegel until the 
former Calabasas High player enrolled at UNLV in the fall of 1992, and McDonald 
didn't give her much hope of making the roster. 
</P>
<P>
 But a year and a half later, Siegel was wearing a Rebel uniform, facing 
Arizona -- the No. 1 team in the country and the defending NCAA champion -- and 
digging into the batter's box at Arizona's Hillenbrand Stadium in front of a 
sellout crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out and runners at first and second in the fifth inning, Siegel 
blasted an inside pitch from Carrie Dolan over the left-center-field fence for 
a three-run home run that propelled the No. 7 Rebels (30-16) to a 7-6 upset of 
the top-ranked Wildcats (50-2). 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first base coach (Lea Ann Jarvis) was screaming, 'Get out of here,' and 
it was over the fence by the time I got to first base," said Siegel, 19, 
describing the highlight of her young career. "They were No. 1 and it was at 
their field, which made it even better." 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding second, Siegel glared at Arizona shortstop Laura Espinoza, who has 
broken the NCAA record with 25 homers this season. Rounding third, she saw an 
Arizona coach kick a bucket across the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was mad," said Siegel, a 5-foot-6 sophomore. "I consider myself a contact 
hitter. I never swing for the fence. I never expected to hit it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel had limited expectations for herself when she first tried out for the 
UNLV team. She became the only walk-on player to make the team in the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew about their program and I wanted to challenge myself," said Siegel, 
who batted .476 on a Calabasas team that finished second in the Frontier League 
in 1992. "When I was younger, I always wanted to play college ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I focused on UCLA, (Cal State) Northridge. . . . I went to UC Santa Barbara 
summer camps, and I watched whatever I could on TV. I never thought I was good 
enough to play at that level." 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel has put that concern to rest. Her .374 batting average is best on the 
team and second in the Big West Conference, which has five teams ranked among 
the top 25. 
</P>
<P>
 She led the conference in batting for several weeks earlier in the season with 
an average near .500 before a knee strain and a one-for-11 slump brought her 
down to earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel bats fourth but has only two home runs. She ranks first on the team in 
doubles (10) and walks (20), second in slugging percentage (.511) and third in 
hits (49) and runs batted in (21).  
</P>
<P>
 She had a 12-game hitting streak this season, third longest in school history. 
As a freshman, Siegel caught only one inning last season and batted .152. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last summer, she ran on her own -- two miles, three days a week -- and 
worked out at a fitness club. She also worked on her patience and pitch 
selection during hitting instruction from former CSUN assistant Andy Kim. And 
she stayed sharp behind the plate while catching UNLV pitcher Amie Stewart on a 
traveling team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came back to school prepared," she said. "My coaches took one look at my 
swing and they didn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis strikes CSUN: In a Western Athletic Conference softball game last 
week, New Mexico's Heather Medearis (Hart) became the first player this season 
to hit a home run off a Cal State Northridge pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis ripped a two-out solo home run off right-hander Amy Windmiller in the 
first inning of a WAC doubleheader. Fourth-ranked Northridge, however, swept 
the Lobos, 5-1 and 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge pitchers had faced 1,144 batters without surrendering a home run 
before Medearis hit hers, her eighth. Medearis leads is batting .379 with 31 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Checking the fax: After going five for nine in a doubleheader at UCLA last 
weekend, Arizona first baseman Amy Chellevold raised her batting average to 
.500. She has 96 hits in 192 at-bats and leads her closest Pacific 10 
Conference pursuer by 44 points. As a leadoff hitter, she has 41 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona second baseman Jenny Dalton (Glendale) and pitcher-designated player 
Nancy Evans (Hoover) rank fifth and ninth among Pac-10 hitters with .426 and 
.358 batting averages. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii pitcher Kym Weil (Hart) is 21-4 with an 0.90 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 In baseball, Long Beach State catcher Casey Snow (Crespi) had surgery on a 
broken middle finger and is out for the season. The freshman had 17 starts and 
was batting .236. . . . Stanford right fielder Brodie Van Wagenen (Crespi) is 
batting .291, .371 over the last 11 games. . . . Cal Poly San Luis Obispo 
pitcher R.J. Simone (Hart) struck out eight Cal State San Bernardino batters in 
eight innings to pick up his team-leading eighth victory last week.

DANCE REVIEW; ROYAL BALLET TURNS TO MADNESS OF 'MAYERLING'; THE BELOVED BRITISH 
COMPANY OPENS ITS WEEK AT THE ORANGE COUNTY PERFORMING ARTS CENTER WITH KENNETH 
MACMILLAN'S NARRATIVE FANTASY ABOUT A CRAZY, MIXED-UP ROYAL SADIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Royal Ballet could have opened its week at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center on Tuesday with "The Sleeping Beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The beloved British company has a lavish, brand-new production of the sweet 
fairy-tale classic in its repertory, staged by Anthony Dowell. Other American 
cities are seeing it on the current tour. 
</P>
<P>
 But local impresarios fear Southern California has seen too much of the 
pristine Princess Aurora. Ergo, in place of the dainty beauty, Dowell and his 
administrative associates brought us a nasty beast: Crown Prince Rudolf of 
Austria-Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilac Fairies are out. "Mayerling" is in. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember "Mayerling"? That's Kenneth MacMillan's convoluted, overpopulated, 
raunchy, athletic, picturesque, often effective, sometimes boring, 
quasi-historical narrative fantasy about a crazy, mixed-up syphilitic royal 
sadist who also happens to be a masochist, murderer, dope fiend, political 
schemer and heroic danseur-ignoble. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilac Fairyland was never like this. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles hosted the American premiere of "Mayerling" back in 1978 at Shrine 
Auditorium (remember Shrine Auditorium?). Stephen Jefferies impressed as the 
glowering monarch-to-be whose partners included such disparate paragons as Lynn 
Seymour, Merle Park and Georgina Parkinson. 
</P>
<P>
 We were struck at the time by the tawdriness of the concept, the brilliance of 
its execution, the long patches of silly busy-work that separate the bona-fide 
climaxes, and the flaccidity of a mock-romantic score pasted together by John 
Lanchbery (he's got a little Liszt . . . ). 
</P>
<P>
 Still, we had to admire the shameless sweep and grandeur of the project. And 
we were awed by a series of pas de deux devised by MacMillan to define and 
differentiate the central relationships -- in turn lyric, dramatic, mechanical, 
casual, passionate, deranged and terminally violent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The current "Mayerling" was first performed in London on the fateful night of 
Oct. 29, 1992. MacMillan collapsed and died backstage during the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the revival serves as a fitting testimonial to a dauntlessly 
theatrical choreographer. Although he often valued bad grammar over good taste, 
he always did it with flair. 
</P>
<P>
 It is ironic to note, incidentally, that MacMillan was completing the dance 
interludes for the new "Carousel" at the time of his death. The disheartening 
result of that final labor can be seen these days at Lincoln Center. In the 
musical, expressive invention gives way to stilted formality. MacMillan's stock 
pas de deux for Julie Jordan (she's a queer one) and her cavalier must have 
poor Agnes de Mille churning in her grave. 
</P>
<P>
 There certainly is nothing so conventional or so vapid in the set pieces of 
"Mayerling." Here, even the apache-dance duets spring from the emotional 
crises, however hokey they may be. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royal Ballet goes through MacMillan's daunting rituals with bravura 
conviction. The company dances -- and poses and gestures -- as if lives were at 
stake. Forget everything you ever heard about stolid English reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Irek Mukhamedov -- who stalked the boards, fired the pistols, 
pressed the morphine syringe and twisted the assorted ballerinas as Rudolf -- 
English reserve was no issue. The man is a former divo of the Bolshoi. 
Understatement was never his thing. Still, he does bring a certain degree of 
repression to his movement vocabulary here, and it only heightens the tension. 
</P>
<P>
 Wild-eyed and long limbed, Mukhamedov broods splendidly and explodes 
magnificently. He bears all physical burdens with forceful equanimity, and few 
challenges in the repertory can offer as many burdens as this. If, ultimately, 
he cannot inspire much sympathy for the destructive prince, don't blame him. 
Blame Gillian Freeman, who wrote the bloody scenario. Blame MacMillan. 
</P>
<P>
 Viviana Durante complements Mukhamedov most poignantly as the 17-year-old Mary 
Vetsera, an innocent obsessed with the ecstasy of destruction. She floats with 
fearless abandon through their torrid encounters, and crumbles with pathos 
worthy of her illustrious but far less fragile predecessor, Lynn Seymour. She 
also makes a stunning virtue of one MacMillan vice: the overuse of 
hyper-extended limbs to signal a soul in torment. 
</P>
<P>
 Genesia Rosato, who had played a young flirt in the original cast, returned on 
this occasion to exude worldly eroticism and bitter frustration as the Countess 
Larisch. She did so, incidentally, as a replacement for Lesley Collier, the 
senior ballerina who suffered a torn calf muscle while dancing "Sleeping 
Beauty" in Texas last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The stellar supporting ensemble -- ensemble is definitely the right noun in 
this case -- included Nicola Tranah as the brittle Empress Elisabeth, Jane Burn 
as the sympathetic Princess Stephanie, Derek Rencher as the stuffy Emperor 
Franz Josef, Fiona Chadwick as the high-class whore, Mitzi Caspar, and 
Johnathan Howells as the blithely entertaining cab-driver, Bratfisch. The Royal 
Ballet still commands artistry in depth. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Georgiadis' literal decors remain attractive and reasonably 
supportive of the inherent dark moods. John B. Read's fluid lighting scheme 
reinforces the cinematic frame of reference. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Wordsworth served Liszt, Lanchbery and the dancers appreciatively in a 
pit exceptionally well-staffed by the Pacific Symphony. It wasn't the 
conductor's fault, of course, that the pastiche resists dramatic development 
and expansion, that the sudden appearance of a solo piano disrupts stylistic 
continuity, and that we never get to hear a bona-fide "Liebestraum." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor can one blame him for the incongruous introduction of a mezzo-soprano to 
impersonate the emperor's "friend" Katherina Schratt (a rather wobbly Beverley 
Mills). Her valedictory Lied may be pretty, but it jolts the senses. 
</P>
<P>
 If these characters could really use their voices, they wouldn't resort to all 
that silent emoting. And we wouldn't have a ballet. 
</P>
<P>

ART REVIEW; GONZALEZ-TORRES EVOKES A POETRY OF INTERACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The gossamer poetry of Felix Gonzalez-Torres' spare and evocative art is 
spoken through a symbolic interaction between artist and audience. At the 
Museum of Contemporary Art, where his gently lovely exhibition, "Traveling," 
opened last week, the activity of looking at art is cast as a ritual exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is small, just eight works made of simple materials -- mirrors, 
clocks, a string of lights, candies wrapped in bright gold foil -- arrayed in 
simple configurations. Often they're set out in pairs, as in two thick stacks 
of rectangular sheets of paper standing on the floor in proximity; two mirrors 
embedded side-by-side in the wall; or two ordinary commercial wall clocks 
ticking in near-unison. 
</P>
<P>
 The repeated pairing keys you to consider connections between things. 
Gonzalez-Torres' art puts community on an artistic platform usually reserved 
for individuality alone. Publicness mingles with privacy, while the boundaries 
between them blur. 
</P>
<P>
 The round wall clocks, "Untitled (Perfect Lovers)," are installed high on the 
wall and they abut. In design terms, abutted shapes are said to be kissing . 
The clocks, set at exactly the same time, steadily tick away, but their second 
hands are not quite in perfect sync. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Were they ever? Or is this couple inexorably going further and further out of 
sync, as time goes by? Or are the two just different in the details within the 
larger commonality of telling the same time? 
</P>
<P>
 In "Untitled (Strange Bird)," a wall-size black-and-white billboard image of a 
cloudy sky is interrupted by the sight of an oddly shaped bird. It's odd, that 
is, until you realize that the bird, seen in silhouette from a great distance, 
is actually two birds, not one, flying freely yet apparently close together. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the billboard in the museum, 20 more are scattered around Los 
Angeles, while the image also will be printed in six suburban newspapers, all 
as part of MOCA's show. The picture's appearance in emphatic public settings 
asks the question: Out in public, are these two birds together? 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez-Torres, who is openly gay, knows as well as anyone the ramifications 
of the question. Identity exists only in relation to the world outside itself, 
not as something autonomous or pure. So, distinctions between public and 
private are tricky. False ones lead to repressive institutions like the closet, 
which is a public concealment of gay identity, and which in turn fuels such 
failed schemes as the dumb U.S. military policy of "Don't ask, don't tell." 
</P>
<P>
 A pair is also the sparest means by which to suggest repetition, and 
repetition is the core of ritual. Gonzalez-Torres' best work has the 
unmistakable heft of public ceremony with all the sense of gravity and moral 
seriousness ceremony conveys, but without pomposity or posturing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most unpretentiously beautiful example is "Untitled (Placebo-Landscape-for 
Roni)," which consists of 1,200 pounds of brightly illuminated foil-wrapped 
candy. Like shimmering golden treasure strewn across the art museum floor from 
which a slight, sickly sweet aroma arises (toffee?), the dazzling eye-candy is 
there for the taking. A visitor is invited to take a single piece from the pile 
and consume the gift later, after leaving the museum, where its taste will 
recall the collective experience to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The pairs in Gonzalez-Torres' art are compounded in "Untitled (Portrait of 
MOCA)," made especially for the show. Like decorative trim on an entablature, 
two rows of words forming a non-sequential time line are painted on encircling 
gallery walls at the juncture with the ceiling. Each event is paired with a 
date -- Great Society 1964, Talkies 1927, MTV 1991, LA 1781 -- and interspersed 
with the names of exhibitions seen at MOCA since its founding. 
</P>
<P>
 The only punctuation marks in the frieze are quotations around the show titles 
-- "Louis I. Kahn," "High and Low," "Helter Skelter" -- which highlight them as 
institutional packages about history. These reverberate against the 
personalized packages of memory, which one has of the rest of the encircling 
list. Both bump up against "Traveling" -- the show this work is in. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez-Torres provocatively explores the busy, crowded intersection between 
public and private, collective and personal. In part, his skill was honed by 
participation with Group Material, a changing 1980s collaborative of artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban-born in 1957, the New York-based artist is also fully of his generation. 
His work is built on public-private intersections derived from traditions of 
Pop, Minimal and Conceptual art. Its emphasis on ritual may owe something to 
the fact that, after 30 years, the Pop-Minimal-Conceptual watershed 
definitively shaped the landscape of contemporary art. It now forms our 
culture's ceremonial circle. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, how does an artist showing in a museum keep from being elevated to 
ceremonial high priest, which would tip the scales by promoting the individual 
over the communal, the personal over the public? MOCA, which organized the show 
in collaboration with the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago and 
the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, where it also is being 
shown, seems to address the dilemma with the accompanying catalogue. But, the 
effort badly misfires. 
</P>
<P>
 Beautifully designed, the 80-page book contains an introduction by the three 
curators, a short bibliography and six essays by six authors, some startlingly 
autobiographical, others focused on specific aspects of Gonzalez-Torres' art. 
One essay (the most interesting) is by an eminence grise of Conceptual art. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no checklist of the show (which changes at each venue), no biography 
of the artist and no overview of his artistic development. Given the art, the 
omissions and inclusions presumably mean to shift focus away from the artist as 
personality, while denying a singular reading of his art. 
</P>
<P>
 The miscarried result, however, is to spotlight institutional clout. Leaving 
scant room for dissent, a tribunal of influential curators bolstered by a 
juggernaut of writers collectively anoints an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 You're left feeling slightly dazed by an onslaught of officialdom, while still 
wanting some rather basic information about Gonzalez-Torres, his work and the 
context within which the eight examples in the galleries have grown. Perhaps 
one ironic measure of this gossamer art's significance is how well it fends off 
your countervailing urge, which is to flee the airless grip of its looming 
institutional frame of reference.

 Pentagon Honors Spielberg: Steven Spielberg has won yet another accolade for 
"Schindler's List," this time a commendation from the U.S. Defense Department. 
During a Washington ceremony in the Pentagon's Hall of Heroes, which is 
dedicated to winners of the prestigious military Medal of Honor, Defense 
Secretary William Perry praised Spielberg for "harnessing the power of motion 
pictures to focus on a time we must never, never forget." Spielberg said that 
he would share the honors, which also marked the 50th anniversary of World War 
II, with the film's heroes -- German industrialist Oskar Schindler, who rescued 
1,200 Jews from concentration camps, and survivors of the Holocaust.

 * Drawing Bad Reviews: Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci's $33-million film 
"Little Buddha" has been mercilessly panned by British movie critics, many of 
whom alluded to the great director's decline since his political films of the 
1970s and his much-lauded 1987 effort, "The Last Emperor," which won nine 
Oscars. Bad word of mouth about the film's excessive length and simplistic 
screenplay caused Bertolucci to lop 15 minutes off just before the London 
premiere, but it apparently didn't assuage the critics. The film stars Bridget 
Fonda and Chris Isaak as the parents of a 9-year-old Seattle boy told by 
Buddhist monks that he may be the reincarnation of a Tibetan lama. Scenes with 
Keanu Reaves, who stars as the Nepalese prince who becomes the Buddha, have 
drawn unintended audience laughter, according to some reports. "Little Buddha" 
has its North American premiere May 20 as part of a Bertolucci tribute at the 
Seattle International Film Festival. POP/ROCK

 Record Exec Faces Gun Charges: Death Row Records CEO Marion (Suge) Knight, who 
manages rap and pop acts including Dr. Dre, Snoop Doggy Dogg and Jodeci, has 
been ordered by a federal magistrate to appear in Las Vegas on May 13 to answer 
charges that he obtained two guns illegally. The FBI alleges that Knight, 29, 
paid $2,500 to another man and his girlfriend, who purchased two Austrian Glock 
40-caliber pistols from a Las Vegas gun shop under a fictitious name. According 
to the indictment, the guns allegedly were later delivered to Knight. Knight's 
attorney, David Kenner, said that the guns were for security guards in Knight's 
business. Knight is free on $100,000-bail pending trial Oct. 1. TELEVISION

 Roseanne Sued: Roseanne Arnold's former manager, Arlyne Rothberg, has filed a 
$20-million defamation lawsuit accusing the comedian of unfairly portraying 
Rothberg as disloyal and unprofessional in Arnold's tell-all book, "My Lives." 
In fact, Rothberg says in her L.A. Superior Court lawsuit, she helped make 
Arnold a star, only to be dumped after the actress' 1990 marriage to Tom 
Arnold. Rothberg's complaint calls the book "a vitriolic effort to 'even the 
score' with many of the individuals who came in contact with Arnold prior to 
her marriage."

 * Court TV Takes on Violence: Cable's Court TV is launching a yearlong, 
$1.5-million project examining violent crime and the judicial system. Called 
"American Violence, American Justice," the programming aims to "go beyond the 
nightly menu of violence that flashes across evening newscasts and place the 
issues surrounding crime and violence in an informative context." The 
initiative will be incorporated throughout Court TV's existing programs and 
will spawn two new weekly shows, "Verdicts and Justice," which premieres today, 
and "The System," which debuts May 29. The network is also establishing a Court 
TV Foundation to support crime fighting and victims groups.

a comedic twist to such news events as President Clinton's State of the Union 
Address and Howard Stern's bid for New York's Libertarian gubernatorial 
nomination, has launched an official news division. Called Comedy Central News 
("CCN"), the division aims to lend a "unique and alternative twist" to coverage 
of world affairs, politics and popular culture. QUICK TAKES

JAZZ REVIEW; MILLER MIXES SNAP TUNES AND SUBTLETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marcus Miller is one of contemporary music's renaissance men. A much 
sought-after producer (by both pop and jazz acts), he also is a powerful 
improviser and an originator of the influential string-snapping style of bass 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the latter Miller persona that was on display at Catalina Bar & Grill 
Tuesday night, and the crowd loved it. Every time Miller charged into one of 
his funky New York snap tunes the overflow audience roared with enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller is too sophisticated an artist to rely on crowd-pleasing virtuosity 
alone. The real musical highlights of his opening set -- pieces such as "The 
King Is Gone," a tribute to his former boss, Miles Davis -- were touched with 
far more subtle timbral and rhythmic colorations. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was well served by most of his players, especially Bernard Wright, who 
mustered an extraordinary array of sounds from his keyboards, and veteran 
drummer Lenny White, still a cutting-edge performer. Among the others, Michael 
Stewart may be the first trumpeter to exhibit major influence (musically and 
visually) from the Miles Davis of the '80s, but he did so with considerable 
creativity. And saxophonist Everett Harp took full advantage of the opportunity 
to perform with an energizing rhythm section. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marcus Miller at Catalina Bar & Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga Blvd, Hollywood (213

CLUB REVIEW; HOLLYWOOD ATHLETIC CLUB'S BLUES OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip is the Southland venue to hear 
and see the blues right now, the Hollywood Athletic Club's "Classic Blues 
Mondays" is the place to go when you have five bucks and a hankering for the 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the House of Blues -- which is currently concentrating on high-profile 
acts -- the artists playing at the Athletic Club are generally local acts and 
even new blues bands trying out their style in the upstairs living room.With 
its candelabra, rich russet paint and green velvet curtains, this plush room 
may seem more appropriate for opera than the blues, but neither the artists nor 
the upscale clientele seem to be complaining.  
</P>
<P>
 In between sets, which usually start at 9:30 p.m. and end at 1 a.m., you'll 
also be treated to homemade blues tapes that are as comfortable as the cushy, 
overstuffed furniture scattered throughout the room. Expect an eclectic 
selection from Howlin' Wolf to vintage Eric Clapton and Dinah Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 1 1/2-year-old "Classic Blues Mondays" is facing stiff 
competition from the House of Blues, the Hollywood Athletic Club offers 
advantages. The $5 cover gets you four free pool tables as well as a handful of 
backgammon sets, and the valet parking moves a lot quicker than it does at the 
House of Blues. * Hollywood Athletic Club, "Classic Blues Mondays," 6525 Sunset 
Blvd., Hollywood, $5 cover, (213) 962-6600. HEIDI SIEGMUND

SCREENING ROOM; 'THE BODHI-DHARMA' CELEBRATES NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bae Yong-Kwun's awesomely beautiful "Why Has the Bodhi-Dharma Left for the 
East?" is at the Nuart for one week. Its title is a riddle, referring to the 
unanswerable question as to why the Indian monk who founded Zen Buddhism left 
home. It tells of an elderly monk guiding his disciple and an orphan boy on the 
path toward enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is a celebration of living close to nature as part of one's spiritual 
quest, and most of its settings are gorgeous, filled with natural grandeur and 
several superb ancient temple compounds.

 Existentialist Riddle: Director Robert Bilheimer's adroit transposition to the 
screen of the San Quentin Drama Workshop's celebrated production of Samuel 
Beckett's "Endgame," will screen Saturdays and Sundays at 11 a.m. through 
Memorial Day at the Monica 4-Plex. 
</P>
<P>
 An existentialist riddle in which a blind man (Rick Cluchey), confined to a 
thronelike wheelchair in a bare dungeon of a room, rails against his fate. He 
is attended by a servant (Bud Thorpe) who cannot sit down, while from time to 
time the man's childlike parents, both wearing old-fashioned night caps, pop 
out of oil drums to add their two-cents' worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensemble performances are remarkable, demonstrating that individuals even 
in the most confined, dead-end predicaments cannot resist striving to make some 
sense of their lives.

 Supernatural Thriller: A first feature effort from writer-director-producer 
Audrey Lewis, "The Gifted" (at the Sunset 5 Saturdays and Sundays at 11 a.m.) 
is admirable and original in its effort to tap African spiritual traditions in 
creating a thriller of the supernatural. Unfortunately, the film is awkward 
rather than thrilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Anthony Williams, in a well-sustained portrayal, stars as a member of an 
African American family who has for millennia possessed supernatural powers; in 
antiquity, Williams' ancestors battled an alien force from the star Sirius; now 
he and his relatives have to do battle all over again. Information: (213)

POP MUSIC REVIEW; BOOKER T BAND: UNTRENDY, PURE SOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reunion of Booker T & the MG's after 17 years really boils down to one 
question: Can a sound built on understatement and tasteful economy thrive with 
a generation bred on excess and accelerated, post-punk tempos? 
</P>
<P>
 Touring with Neil Young last year gave the original Stax Records house band a 
boost and the quartet's hour-plus set of instrumentals on Tuesday at the packed 
House of Blues did nothing to slow the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 There was certainly nothing lacking on the musical end -- new drummer Steve 
Potts (a Memphis veteran of Al Green's mid-'80s gospel groups) supplied a 
strong push to original members Booker T. Jones, guitarist Steve Cropper and 
bassist Donald (Duck) Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
 Booker T & company offered Memphis trance grooves old ("Hip Hug-Her," "Time Is 
Tight") and new ("That's the Way It Should Be" and "Cruisin' " from its 
upcoming Columbia release) at far less than 140 beats per minute. 
</P>
<P>
 So no flash, no front-man, the same economical mindset, several ballads, 
Booker T playing the old-fashioned but ever so soulful Hammond organ . . . in 
short, nothing trendy and nothing but pure music capped by the inevitable 
encore of "Green Onions" that . . . well, you can't argue with groove 
perfection, can you?  
</P>
<P>
 Canadian guitarist Jeff Healey, even with George Thorogood guesting on the 
encores, did little to disprove the notion that he's a blues-rock librarian, 
capable of researching and playing the appropriate licks but without the 
necessary feeling. DON SNOWDEN

HARRY R. BIEDERMAN; LOCKHEED ECONOMIST, FORECASTING EXPERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Robert Biederman, chief economist for Lockheed Corp. for 35 years and 
the founding editor of the Trendlines economic forecasting newsletter, has 
died. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Biederman, who retired in 1987 but continued to serve Lockheed as a 
consultant, died of heart failure in Tarzana on April 28. He had suffered a 
severe stroke in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Often consulted by news media on the global and national economies, Biederman 
served as a key prognosticator of the impact federal defense spending cuts 
would have on California's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at a flat market soon. I mean right away," he told The Times 
in 1986, predicting a loss of at least 10,000 jobs in the state's defense 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 He taught economics at USC and frequently appeared as a guest speaker for 
public affairs and business conferences and television programs. He also wrote 
commentary and book reviews on economic subjects for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Biederman was president of the Los Angeles Chapter of the National Assn. of 
Business Economists and chaired the economists' panel of the Los Angeles 
Chamber of Commerce Business Outlook Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Athens, Ohio, he grew up in St. Louis and was educated at Washington 
University, Shrivenham in England, UCLA, Columbia University and Loyola. During 
World War II, he served in the Army in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his wife, Esther; three children, Danny, Jerry and Debbie; a 
sister, Dorothy Kaufman, and four grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services are scheduled for noon today at Hillside Memorial Cemetery in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial contributions be made to the American 
Diabetes Assn.

JUDGE CHARLES LITWIN; OKD BLUE LINE ROUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Litwin, a retired Los Angeles County Superior Court judge who helped 
clear the route for the Blue Line light-rail system between Los Angeles and 
Long Beach, has died. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
 Litwin died Sunday of pancreatic cancer at his Long Beach home, his son Dave 
Leddel said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, a group of merchants and property owners organized as No Slo Transit 
sued to prevent the Blue Line from traveling along Long Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Litwin denied their request, however, deciding that the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission (now the Metropolitan Transportation Authority) had 
properly considered the economic impact and other environmental factors of 
building a two-mile segment on the busy thoroughfare. His ruling was upheld by 
the 2nd District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Hamilton, Canada, Litwin moved to Los Angeles in 1930 and graduated 
from Los Angeles High School and Southwestern Law School. 
</P>
<P>
 After private law practice, he was named to the Long Beach Municipal Court 
bench in 1966 by then-Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr. Ten years later, Brown's 
son, Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., elevated Litwin to the Los Angeles 
County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Litwin served primarily in the court's Long Beach and Norwalk branches, and 
continued to serve on the Long Beach bench by special appointment after his 
official retirement. He handled civil and criminal cases over his long career, 
and was often praised for his gentle, concerned style and non-authoritarian 
demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 A civic leader in Long Beach, Litwin served as president of the area's Jewish 
Family Service and Jewish Community Federation and was chairman of its 
Community Relations Committee and United Jewish Welfare Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his four sons, Kerry Litwin and Dave, Mike and Ed Leddel; a 
sister, Kay Horowitz, a brother, Leslie Litwin, and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Services are scheduled for noon Friday at Hillside Memorial Park, 6001 
Centinela Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the Jewish Welfare 
Federation, 3801 E. Willow St., Long Beach 90815.

KARL HETTINGER; SURVIVED 1963 'ONION FIELD' ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Karl Hettinger, the troubled survivor of the "Onion Field" attack that claimed 
the life of his police partner 31 years ago, died Wednesday at a hospital in 
Bakersfield after an illness of several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Hettinger, 59, who suffered crushing bouts of depression and left the Los 
Angeles Police Department after the brutal ordeal, made a comeback as a 
politician in recent years, serving as a Kern County supervisor from 1987 until 
his defeat in a bid for reelection in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great police officer and a great man who pulled himself up out of 
having been involved in a great tragedy," former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl 
F. Gates told the Associated Press on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he always felt guilty because he ran," Gates said. "I could never 
understand it. If he had stayed, he'd have been dead." 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Hettinger, his partner, Ian Campbell, and ex-convicts Gregory 
Ulas Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith was chronicled by Joseph Wambaugh in his 
best-selling book and movie, "The Onion Field." 
</P>
<P>
 On the night of March 9, 1963, Hettinger, then 28, and Campbell, 30, stopped 
Powell, 32, and Smith, 29, for making an illegal U-turn in Hollywood. Before 
the officers could react, Powell pulled a gun, pointed it at Campbell and 
ordered Hettinger to surrender his pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to give up my weapon, but my partner had a gun in his back," 
Hettinger told an interviewer in 1985. Campbell "asked me to give it up several 
times. I did it reluctantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Forcing the disarmed officers into a stolen car, Powell and Smith drove north 
to a deserted dirt road in rural Kern County south of Bakersfield, where the 
gunmen marched their hostages into an onion field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Powell then executed Campbell with a pistol shot to the face," Hettinger 
said. "I knew I was next. I turned away and ran down the road. When I looked 
back, they fired at me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Hettinger said a cloud passing in front of the moon probably saved his life, 
giving him a moment of darkness to hide among tumbleweeds piled against a 
fence. He said that when the killers drove off, he set off again, running four 
miles across irrigated fields to a farmhouse, where he phoned for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell was captured about two hours later while driving back to Los Angeles. 
Smith was arrested the next day at a rooming house in Bakersfield. During 
subsequent trials, both men were convicted of murder and sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell remains in prison; Smith, paroled several times, has had several 
subsequent brushes with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, during one of Powell's unsuccessful bids for parole, Hettinger argued 
passionately against his release. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still get uneasy . . . I still can't sleep very well," Hettinger said at 
the time, his voice breaking and his fists clenched. "I can still see their 
faces. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 But the crime and the punishment are only part of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Hettinger's decision to surrender his pistol led to an LAPD directive 
admonishing officers never to surrender their weapons under any circumstances. 
Hettinger began to suffer intense feelings of guilt about his partner's death, 
and eventually was forced from the Police Department after he was caught in a 
series of shopliftings.

COUNTY FIREFIGHTERS EXPECT BIGGER TAX SHARE; FINANCES: UNION OFFICIAL SAYS 
THREE SUPERVISORS NOW SUPPORT GIVING THE DEPARTMENT SOME OF THE PROPOSITION 172 
MONEY.

 A majority of Ventura County supervisors have promised to share more sales tax 
revenue with the County Fire Department, prompting the county firefighters 
union to drop its threat of taking the issue to the voters, the union's top 
official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Maffei, president of the Ventura County Professional Firefighters' Assn., 
said three county supervisors have made commitments in private meetings to 
distribute at least some of the $27 million in extra sales taxes to the Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials have spent months lobbying for a share of the revenue being 
generated by the extension of a half-cent sales tax. The voters extended the 
tax last year by passing Proposition 172, which called for the money to be used 
to improve public safety. But the county supervisors directed virtually all of 
the money to law enforcement and left the Fire Department with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Maffei said Supervisors Susan K. Lacey, Vicky Howard and Maggie Kildee agreed 
that they would give some of the sales tax revenue to the Fire Department 
during budget hearings in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't hold a gun to their heads," Maffei said. "They either do the right 
thing or they don't." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the board infuriated the 433-member Fire Department by promising 
almost all the Proposition 172 funds to law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Fire Chief George Lund announced his resignation a day after he 
walked out in disgust from the supervisors' meeting. A week later, the union 
voted to begin a campaign to take the matter to the voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, supervisors defended their decision, saying they were reluctant 
to give money to the Fire Department until it had streamlined its management. A 
county audit last year criticized the department for having too many managers, 
spending too much on overtime and being lax with sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lacey, Howard and Kildee changed their minds after union officials lobbied 
them in private meetings over the past few weeks, Maffei said. He said the 
union had ordered a public opinion survey regarding the Proposition 172 funds, 
and respondents had overwhelmingly favored giving some of the money to fire 
services. Maffei said he had presented the survey results to the supervisors 
and it helped sway their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 The department will request $2 million from the sales tax revenue, he said. 
Lund had initially asked for $5.5 million to help restore some of the 19 
positions that had been lost to budget cuts over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk said she also met with union officials but told 
them that she is inclined to vote against the request because she believes that 
Proposition 172 funds are earmarked for law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Maffei said Supervisor John K. Flynn refused to return the union's calls. 
Flynn said Wednesday that he considered it a "violation of the public trust" to 
discuss such matters privately and was surprised that his fellow board members 
had done so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those kind of discussions need to take place in the public boardroom at the 
budget hearing," Flynn said. "The Board of Supervisors in the last two years 
has gotten into more trouble doing things behind the scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Kildee said she did not reconsider the firefighters' request simply because of 
a private meeting, but because of progress she has seen in the department's 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I have seen coming out of the fire district is the beginning of the 
strategic plan we had talked about," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said she plans to share Proposition 172 money with the Fire Department 
if initial projections of a $26-million windfall were too low. The supervisors 
in March decided to give $24 million to law enforcement and will decide how to 
allocate the remaining $2 million later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do it if there is something over and above what has been set aside," 
Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, who had also lobbied unsuccessfully in March for $2.6 million 
of the Proposition 172 funds, said Wednesday that they were disappointed to 
hear that excess funds would go the County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo criticized the supervisors for changing 
their minds when the Fire Department has yet to streamline its operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a good time to do that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo City Manager Bill Little said sales tax revenues are generated 
primarily by residents in the cities, not unincorporated areas of the county, 
and should be spent by the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's wrong, and it's unfair," Little said. "But it doesn't surprise 
us. The Fire Department has much more access to them than the cities do." 
</P>
<P>
 Other county department heads set to receive Proposition 172 money said they 
are pleased that the Fire Department would share in the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They deserve it," said Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, whose office will get 
about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fire Department is public safety," Sheriff Larry Carpenter said, "and 
it's an important part of it." Carpenter's department will receive the lion's 
share of the tax revenue, about $17 million, next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Remington, deputy director of the Correction Services Agency, said he 
thought that the initial $26-million figure was too conservative, and does not 
expect county departments to be competing with each other in June over the 
Proposition 172 money. 
</P>
<P>
 County Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon said he estimates that Proposition 
172 funds will top $27 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Maffei said if the supervisors back out on their promises during the June 
budget hearings, the union will force a special election on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get screwed, we'll go for a special election," Maffei said. "I'd rather 
not put an initiative on the ballot. It's a lot of money, time and effort."

CADETS BEGIN TRAINING UNDER FIRE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: FIRST CLASS OF 1994 GETS 
UNDER WAY AT THE VENTURA COUNTY SHERIFF'S ACADEMY. THEY FACE SIX MONTHS OF 
TOUGH TRAINING. 
</P>

<P>
 Barely three days into their training Wednesday, 45 police cadets still flinch 
and blush during weapons drills at Senior Deputy Paul Higgason's grating roar 
of a voice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You should be getting this by now!" Higgason bellows as the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Academy cadets struggle to reholster their new 9-millimeter pistols. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the formation, hard-nosed drill instructors snarling over them, 
two cadets crank out 10 pushups apiece in penance for minor foul-ups with their 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the cadets rush inside at double time to bolt down a 10-minute lunch, 
squeeze in a 5-minute bathroom stop and then hunker over desks for a two-hour 
lecture on crime-report writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they are out of sight, Senior Deputy Jeff Miller shakes his head mildly 
at the cadets' struggle with the simple task of presenting arms for inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phew. . . . They're doing OK. This part's hard because they haven't had 
inspection of arms before," he allowed. "They're about on par with the other 
classes." 
</P>
<P>
 These 42 men and three women, age 19 to 47, are the first class of 1994 -- 
about an average number, said Sgt. Stephen DeCesari, who helps run the Ventura 
County Sheriff's Training Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven cadets came from sheriff's departments in San Luis Obispo and Santa 
Barbara counties, but the rest are training for the coveted jobs they have won 
in the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They face six months of tough physical training, boot camp drills and intense 
classroom studies -- ranging from ethics and law to explosives and high-speed 
driving. They will write reports on every single mistake they make, to hone 
their writing skills and ensure they will not have to learn the same things 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
 And they will be tested repeatedly. Those who flunk five or more of the 37 
exams will be fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hold them to a higher standard," DeCesari said. "We ask them to put their 
personal life on hold for six months." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who graduate in September will be products of one of the highest-ranked 
police academies in California, according to state test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 And when that day comes, the newest Ventura County sheriff's deputies will 
march all their hopes and dreams straight into the Ventura County Jail, where 
they must work indoors for up to three years before any chance of patrol duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Why suffer the hardships of training? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a tremendous profession," Chief Deputy Robert Brooks assures 
the cadets, closing a two-hour lecture on the ethical pitfalls of police work. 
"The public perception of us is very positive, they believe in us, they trust 
us, and it's all because we've maintained that public trust very carefully." 
</P>
<P>
 But with Brooks' warm words still in their ears, the cadets march outside to a 
faceful of corrosive shouting from the drill instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone has left the classroom lights on and the door open. Bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rowland! Get over here!" Senior Deputy John Miller yells at the cadet 
corporal -- the class leader of the moment. All the others will rotate through 
this duty, but right now Michael Rowland must take the heat for his fellow 
cadets' failure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you tell me what's wrong with that classroom?" Miller demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Stiff at attention, Rowland tries to answer while Senior Deputy Higgason 
dresses down the last cadet to leave the room. "I -- I forgot sir," she manages 
before Higgason lays into her again. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Miller delivers the lecture: 
</P>
<P>
 "When you first came up here, we told you, everything is for a reason, " he 
says evenly. "You'll learn that the reason you close the door and switch off 
the light is so you'll not be silhouetted in a doorway, and once that door is 
closed, you'll know you've already checked it and the room is secure!"  
</P>
<P>
 "You start developing your habits now," Miller adds. "You remember the little 
things." Then Miller faces Rowland again, the shiny black brims of their 
uniform caps just inches apart, Miller murmuring intensely at the rigid cadet. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Rowland says he was shocked to face boot camp-style drills again 
several years after a four-year tour with the Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is resolved to graduate, to become a Ventura County deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Academically, I think it's going to be a great deal tougher" than Marine 
training was, says Rowland, 27, of Agoura. "Physically, I find it a little bit 
easier. And the shouting -- that's just about equal." 
</P>
<P>
 Classmate Danielle Delpit says the hard-core training shocked her too, but she 
is determined to become a sworn deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always witnessed crimes in my neighborhood, and I've always wanted to be 
someone who confronted that," says Delpit, 23, of Agoura. After staying near 
the head of a pack of classmates sprinting up and down the street outside the 
academy near the Camarillo Airport, she admits: "I've never been through this. 
It's hard ." 
</P>
<P>
 Hard, as in lessons that require at least two to three hours of studying per 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard, as in two hours per day of calisthenics, and long-distance running. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard, as in no breaks or drinks between sets of pushups and 100-yard sprints. 
</P>
<P>
 At 19, Phillip Shannon is the youngest in the class and today the slowest, as 
he learns when he lags behind in running drills, withering beneath the sun and 
the instructors' yells. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I can do this any more," he says between sprints, hinting he 
might quit and train by himself before trying again. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon followed his older brother through as a sheriff's cadet, filing 
records and working minor traffic accidents. But he was not ready, he says, for 
the physical grind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on, you'll make it," says his oldest classmate, 47-year-old Frank 
Seneris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always wanted to be a cop," says Seneris, a sheriff's corrections 
officer who hopes to move to patrol work. His desire "was intensified after 
watching all the crime rates growing" in Oxnard and nationwide, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Age did not stop him, Seneris says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 47 years old -- whatever I do, I decide for my own," he adds, breathing 
and sweating no harder than the toughest of his classmates. "My hope is to 
qualify and make it through. Hopefully, I'll work as many years as I can -- as 
long as I can physically do it."

SCHOOLS TO DELAY NEW CHOICE POLICY; EDUCATION: OXNARD DISTRICT OFFICIALS 
POSTPONE OPEN ENROLLMENT BECAUSE OF CONCERNS OF RACIAL IMBALANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Concerned about aggravating the racial imbalance among their schools, Oxnard 
Union High School District officials are delaying implementing a new 
state-mandated policy to allow students to attend the school of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
 A state law that took effect this year requires all California school 
districts to establish open enrollment in their districts by Jan. 6, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Ventura County districts have moved quickly to allow school choice, and 
are already accepting applications from parents who want to transfer their 
students to new schools next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard high school district had also planned initially to implement its 
school-choice plan at the beginning of the 1994-95 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Oxnard officials have decided to postpone until January putting the new 
policy into effect. Because most students will not want to transfer in the 
middle of a school year, officials said, the postponement will effectively 
delay the start-up of school choice in the district until the fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said they need more time to decide how to limit transfers 
that would exacerbate the existing racial imbalance among the district's five 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the high schools--Channel Islands, Hueneme, Oxnard and Rio Mesa--are 
predominantly minority. And the fifth, Camarillo High, is mostly white. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials are particularly concerned that white students from Rio Mesa 
High in Camarillo, which is 70% minority, will apply in droves to attend nearby 
Camarillo High, which is 78% white. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an interesting dilemma," Supt. Bill Studt said. "We want to be able to 
provide the choice and let parents decide what school their children will 
attend. On the other hand, when you have one school that is almost entirely 
Anglo and other Anglo students from other campuses flow to that campus, it gets 
out of balance." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Oxnard school officials proposed allowing open enrollment 
to begin in the fall on the condition that transfers between schools did not 
change the racial balance in any one year by more than 5%, by increasing either 
the percentage of minorities or whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Then board members decided that 5% may be too high and asked district staff to 
review whether they should set a lower limit. District officials said they are 
still in the middle of that review. 
</P>
<P>
 State law allows districts to limit transfers under their school-choice 
policies if schools are full or if the enrollment changes would upset existing 
racial balances. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing was done recognizing there are situations where it would 
worsen potential segregation issues," said Susie Lange, state education 
department spokeswoman. "There are schools that want to maintain some semblance 
of a mix and don't want to lose all their white kids." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Oxnard Union High School District is apparently one of the few in 
Ventura County where there is a significant enough racial imbalance among the 
schools to warrant concern that the problem could get worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura and Conejo Valley unified school districts, for example, are both 
launching their school-choice plans next fall. Although officials in both 
districts said they will monitor changes in racial makeup at the schools, they 
are not expecting any significant shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Conejo Assistant Supt. Richard Simpson said, "It's a legitimate 
issue for many districts." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Oxnard high school district, the only way to ensure that Camarillo High 
does not become more lopsidedly white is to have an equal number of minority 
and white students transfer to the school, Assistant Supt. Gary Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would have to make sure that for every Anglo student that moves, there 
would also have to be a minority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials already encourage minority students who live in the Oxnard 
Plain area, where Channel Islands, Hueneme and Oxnard high schools are located, 
to transfer to Camarillo High for the school's magnet programs in Russian and 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 And about 65 students--mostly minorities--take advantage of this transfer 
option each year. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will be a problem persuading more students from the Oxnard Plain to 
transfer to Camarillo High, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district does not provide bus service for students who attend schools 
outside of their areas, so they have to find their own transportation to 
Camarillo High. In addition, officials said, most students prefer to stay at 
schools where they know people. 
</P>
<P>
 At Rio Mesa High, Ruth Smith, president of the school's parent-faculty 
organization, said she doubts there will be a flood of transfer requests to 
Camarillo High when the district launches its school-choice plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard high school district is already "pretty open about transfers within 
the district, especially at schools where there's space available," Smith said. 
"I know a lot of the parents are very happy with Rio Mesa." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rio Mesa junior Ken Seldeen said he knows of at least two students who say 
that their parents want them to transfer to Camarillo High. 
</P>
<P>
 For students in general, Ken said, the choice between schools is simple: "They 
want to go where their friends are." Ethnic Imbalance Ethnic makeup at schools

AROUND THE VALLEY: ONE SKILL POTENTIAL GLADIATORS NEED IS AN ABILITY TO BE 
HUMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They came from as far away as Sacramento to compete for a chance to do battle 
against a Gladiator on the Saturday morning television series "American 
Gladiators." 
</P>
<P>
 The show, an hourlong display of David trying to slay Goliath, seemingly 
ridiculous to some, is for others no different than watching the Dodgers battle 
the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of games with names like Assault, The Joust, Hang Tough and The 
Eliminator, contenders must maneuver past the Gladiators without getting 
knocked down, beaten up or pummeled with things like tennis balls or pugil 
sticks. In The Joust, the contender uses what looks like a giant Q-Tip, 
actually a 7-foot pugil stick, to try to knock the Gladiator off a 
seven-foot-high platform. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday, about 1,000 self-described gym rats and fitness freaks met a 9 
a.m. casting call for the show because "I'm 27 years old, and I'm curious to 
see what I'm capable of doing," or "Money -- heck no, I just want to see if I 
could make it," or "It's something you have to do. It's a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the contenders discovered that athletic prowess wasn't enough. 
They had to be impressive in front of the camera as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The tryouts at CBS Studios in Studio City were part of a nationwide search in 
six cities for contenders for the show. About a thousand would-be competitors 
showed up at each location. Many were called but only 80 will be chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the crowd who gathered for the tryouts was Lorraine Howard, 35, a mother 
of five from Monrovia. She was one of many who failed, on the first try, to 
pass required athletic tests. First there were chin-ups -- 24 in 30 seconds for 
the men and seven in 30 seconds for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard did 6 1/2 in 30 seconds and waited in line for two hours to try again. 
So did many men who grunted and strained their way to 10, 17, even 23 chin-ups 
as the stopwatch struck 30. As they waited, they strategized with those who'd 
made it all the way through on how to beat the bar and the other events. The 
other events: 
</P>
<P>
 * The 40-yard dash, to be run in five seconds or less for men and six seconds 
for the women. "Don't even think about getting eliminated, you can do this!" 
yelled one of the first five contestants to advance to the sprint. When the 
race was over, he'd missed qualifying by 22 hundredths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 * The rope climb, which proved challenging to winners and losers alike. Some 
who reached the top of the 20-foot rope in the allotted 10 seconds (for women, 
a 15-foot rope) descended too fast and suffered rope burns and blisters and 
oozed blood. 
</P>
<P>
 * A test of timed lateral movements wherein competitors ran sideways within an 
eight-foot radius without crossing their legs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Powerball, the finale, which simulated the show event of the same name with 
slight modifications. Resembling one-on-one basketball meets high school 
wrestling, two opponents went head to head in a contest where "the show," not 
the number of points scored was "the thing!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Jukes," quick fake-out movements that can leave one's opponent's butt down on 
the mat after having tripped over his own feet, count heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 For Powerball, contestants donned the protective gear seen on TV -- boxing 
helmets, knee and elbow pads, even mouthpieces. That didn't help a gymnast 
whose knee buckled as she tried to juke her opponent. The nurse on hand applied 
an ice pack, wrapped her knee and arranged for her boyfriend to get her to a 
nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make it," she said, sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
 For the chosen few, a questionnaire and a screen test followed the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Larri Nolan, 26, of Los Angeles, who wants to be a firefighter, finished the 
athletic events but was not called to appear before the camera. He seemed 
unfazed by the rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I did excellent," Nolan said as he walked to his car. "I did it on 
the first try. I don't think I impressed them enough in the Powerball. They've 
got a certain type of look in mind and I guess it wasn't me." 
</P>
<P>
 When the tests of athleticism are over, the race is not necessarily to the 
swift or the strong, but to the swift, the strong and those with the right 
look. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's personality more than how good-looking they are," said an executive with 
the show. "We want people who are representative of a cross-section of 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 Those with the right look were asked how they'd train for their TV appearance 
and who their heroes were. Penciled in were Earvin (Magic) Johnson, Michael 
Jordan, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Zig Ziglar, my brother, my dad and my grandma, 
to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 When Roy Cox, the 27-year-old president of an auto glass company, sat before 
the show's executive in charge of production, he was asked to explain his hero 
choice -- his father. " 'Cause he's a good man. You don't realize it while 
you're growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 The producer then asked Cox, a former semipro football player for the 
Sacramento Steamers and an amateur boxer, why he had tried out. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he was answering a challenge from Laser, a 6-foot-1, 220-pound 
Gladiator who made it to the pros as a football player. Laser had challenged 
all the show's viewers to get off their butts and try out. 
</P>
<P>
 At the producer's prompting, Cox stared into the camera and issued his own 
challenge: "You better watch out, Laser, 'cause I'm coming to get you." 
</P>
<P>
 It's show time, folks! 
</P>
<P>
 All this for a shot at a top payout of $35,000 in cash and prizes or perhaps 
an invitation to become a Gladiator? 
</P>
<P>
 For some, yes. For most though, all they wanted was a chance to prove 
themselves stronger and faster and smarter than the men and women they watch 
with zeal on Saturday mornings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This goes back to dawn of the times," said Cox.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; GETTING THE JUMP ON TB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County officials appear to have learned a lesson from last year's outbreak of 
tuberculosis at La Quinta High School in Westminster, where a dozen students 
were infected. Though school and county employees scrambled to battle the 
outbreak once the dimensions became clear, they got off to a late start, 
allegedly because of a private doctor's delayed diagnosis and inadequate 
treatment of a student who was contagious for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Board of Supervisors approved $1.5 million to hire 33 more 
public health workers to battle the disease. That's a hefty increase over the 
$5 million budgeted for TB each year. However, the necessity of the extra funds 
and personnel was underscored by the need to test hundreds of students at La 
Quinta to see whether they had contracted TB and, if so, whether they had 
active cases. Last month an active case was diagnosed in an Orange Coast 
College student, and a student at a Santa Ana intermediate school was found to 
have symptoms. County officials said private physicians promptly reported the 
two cases, action that all doctors should emulate. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not easy for the county to come up with extra money, but prevention is 
cheaper than treatment. Officials now should press for help from state and 
federal programs to battle TB, which has increased alarmingly in recent years. 
Public health workers also must continue their education programs to ensure 
that those suffering from TB complete their treatment, lest more harm come to 
them and others.

ANGELS, YANKEES TIED UP AT SIX IN 13TH INNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whitey Herzog was sitting in front of his television set Wednesday night, 
realizing he was responsible for this intriguing matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 He traded starting pitcher Jim Abbott to the New York Yankees, creating a 
furor in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the one who provided Angel starting pitcher Joe Magrane his extravagant 
two-year contract, creating a furor in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, sitting in his living room 1,900 miles away in St. Louis, he was 
recognizing the irony of the Angels' game against the Yankees, tied, 6-6, in 
the 13th inning, in front of 24,312 fans at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess they're bringing that up a lot tonight, huh?" Herzog said. "But you 
know something, if I had to do it all over again, I'm not sure I would have 
changed anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to keep Abbott as much as anyone, and maybe the deal didn't work out 
like we hoped, but I still think I was right in not giving him what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you know something, I still think Magrane will be a solid No. 3 starter. 
When I saw him last year, I told our people, 'Damn, if we can get a third 
starter for our ballclub for $1.5 million, why not take a shot? Where are you 
going to find a pitcher who does what he does?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane, who underwent arthroscopic elbow surgery before spring training 
began, was impressive in his season debut. He yielded four hits and two earned 
runs in five innings, walking three batters with two strikeouts. If not for 
Danny Tartabull's two-out, two-run homer in the first inning, Magrane could 
have left the game after 85 pitches with a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, neither he nor Abbott received a decision. Abbott left after six 
innings with a 5-2 lead, but the Angels tied it in the seventh with three runs 
off reliever Jeff Reardon, capped by Tim Salmon's two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the process of getting our pitching staff together," Angel Manager 
Buck Rodgers said, "and Joe Magrane is the first piece of the puzzle to come 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to lose as much as anyone else, but we knew coming out of spring 
training we had some problems, and we compounded it with (Mark) Langston 
getting hurt and (Chuck) Finley struggling. And I hate to say this, but we may 
struggle for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think once we get things going, we've got a chance to go .500 for a 
while. And that may be good enough in this division." 
</P>
<P>
 The feat might be much easier, of course, if Herzog never had traded Abbott. 
It already is perceived as one of greatest blunders in Angel history, 
particularly considering what they received in exchange. First baseman J.T. 
Snow and starting pitcher Russ Springer have been demoted to triple-A 
Vancouver, and reliever Jerry Nielsen is toiling in double-A Midland. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Jim Abbott signed with the Angels," agent Scott Boras said, "I thought 
he'd be here forever. He never wanted to leave, and everyone knows that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't need to say it was a mistake, but I think the performances of the 
athletes in question speak for themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, would you trade those three players today for Jim Abbott?" 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog, who offered Abbott a four-year, $16-million contract, still insists 
that it was senseless to consent to Abbott's request for $17.5 million. He 
could have simply offered a one-year contract, but feared losing him to free 
agency at this season's conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to make that trade," Herzog said. "The only thing I feel bad about is 
that Springer hasn't done it for us. I don't understand that one. I really 
thought Springer would be a good starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew Snow wasn't a base stealer, and he wasn't going to be hitting a ton of 
homers, but I thought he could hit .280 in the big leagues. And Nielsen, he was 
just a throw-in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's crazy, if you had tried to trade Snow at this time last year, you 
probably could have gotten just about anyone in the majors for him. Now, his 
stock has dropped.

HOCKEY / WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS; HEBERT HAS MIRACLE GAME AS U.S. FINALLY BEATS 
RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't quite the "Miracle on Ice." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the United States' 3-1 victory over Russia on Wednesday rekindled 
memories of the 1980 Olympics and one of hockey's most startling upsets. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the first for the United States against the Russians or their 
Soviet predecessors in 14 tries since those Olympics. It propelled the 
Americans into Saturday's semifinals against the winner of today's 
Finland-Austria game. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalie Guy Hebert of the Mighty Ducks stopped 53 of the Russians' 54 shots, 24 
in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been on the winning side too many times," Hebert said. "That's why 
it's special." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Young of the Quebec Nordiques had two goals and an assist, and Craig 
Janney of the St. Louis Blues had a goal and assisted on both of Young's 
against Mikhail Shtalenkov, Hebert's backup at Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other game Wednesday, Sweden beat Italy, 7-2, and will face the winner 
of today's game between Canada and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans also were spurred by what they perceived as a maneuver by the 
Russians to play them. Ahead, 1-0, in the final qualifying round game against 
Canada, Russia changed goalies and lost, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our motivation tonight was that we honestly believed the Russians allowed 
Canada to win by pulling their goalie in the third period," U.S. Coach Ron 
Wilson of the Ducks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Team USA's top scorer, Bill Lindsay, failed an anti-doping test for ephedrine 
after Monday's 7-2 loss to Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay was suspended for the rest of the tournament.

spring training. . . . The Braves have changed the duties of Hall of Famer 
Willie Stargell, who has worked in the organization for eight years. As special 
assistant to Player Personnel Director Chuck LaMar, Stargell will evaluate

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; STRAWBERRY IN AFTER-CARE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry, who spent 28 days in a drug treatment center, was released 
Wednesday, and will not be with the Dodgers while participating in an aftercare 
program, said Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is in an outpatient program that is still under the jurisdiction of Major 
League Baseball, and, though we have some details, there is confidentiality 
under the program he is under," Claire said.  
</P>
<P>
 Claire said he does not know how long Strawberry will be in the program, and 
said the club does not have to make a decision now on Strawberry's position 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program will dictate when he should be playing and what is best for him," 
Claire said. "Until then there isn't a lot we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry, who lives in Woodland Hills with his wife, Charisse and newborn 
son, Jordan Shea, will continue to report to the center in Rancho Mirage as 
part of the outpatient program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The final game of the 1993 season between the Dodgers and San Francisco Giants 
was filled with tension, and no one felt it more than Giant third baseman Matt 
Williams, who took a verbal beating from the Dodger dugout through much of the 
12-1 rout that eliminated the Giants from the National League West title chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the insults, Williams thought Orel Hershiser's were the most obnoxious, 
and after returning to San Francisco, he vowed Hershiser would pay when the 
Dodgers played at Candlestick Park this season. A four-game series begins there 
tonight and Hershiser, who said he didn't yell at Williams, will pitch Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Dave Burba offered this comment Monday: "They (the Dodgers) got me and 
I want revenge. I want to stick it up their . . . one time." 
</P>
<P>
 Giant closer Rod Beck, who had called Hershiser a "punk," on Tuesday said: 
"What I meant was that anybody who goes out on the mound, doesn't get the calls 
and whines about it constantly from the mound, doesn't show me anything. To me, 
that's a punk. He's a great talent and handles himself well, but the more he 
talks, he gets on peoples' nerves." 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser shrugged when he heard Beck's comments. "That's not even worth 
responding to," he said. "I have no problem with Rod Beck and I don't know why 
he has a problem with me. I have never even met the guy. I think I'm going to 
go meet him so he can get to know me." MARYANN HUDSON

COLLEGE BASEBALL / GARY KLEIN; BIG WEST LEADER NEVADA EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary Powers knew the University of Nevada would be competitive when it joined 
the Big West Conference last season, but he didn't expect to be contending for 
a championship this soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Powers, in his 12th season as coach of the Wolf Pack, has his team in first 
place, percentage points ahead of Cal State Fullerton, with six conference 
games remaining. Nevada is 34-8 overall and 11-4 in the Big West after winning 
two of three games at Fullerton last weekend. The Titans are 12-5 in the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolf Pack is ranked sixth by Collegiate Baseball and 11th by Baseball 
America. Nevada plays host to San Jose State this weekend and travels to UC 
Santa Barbara next weekend. Third-ranked Fullerton ends its Big West schedule 
this weekend at New Mexico State. The Titans will also play a makeup game 
against Pacific if it has a bearing on the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to win five out of six to win the championship," Powers said. "So 
far, everyone on this team has contributed. We have good balance; we don't just 
look to one or two guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada boasts the top five batters in the Big West: Neil Garcia at .408, Mark 
Lewis (.388); Justin Drizos (.385); Mike Schroeder (.377) and Jay Johnson 
(.372). 
</P>
<P>
 Having won series against Fullerton and Long Beach State, Nevada seems likely 
to gain its first NCAA tournament appearance regardless of whether it wins the 
Big West title. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played a good schedule and beat Stanford at Stanford, swept Cal, and 
beat (West Coast Conference leader) Santa Clara three straight," Powers said. 
"With what we've done in conference, if that's not good enough to get in, we're 
probably never going to get in." 
</P>

 Trivia time: Which Southland school has produced the most winners of the 
Golden Spikes Award, presented annually since 1978 to the top amateur player in 
the country? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With several experienced sophomores and a talented freshman class, most 
thought Stanford was a year away from winning the Pacific 10 Southern Division 
championship and contending for its third national title. 
</P>
<P>
 But the time appears to be now for the Cardinal, which finished last in the 
Southern Division in 1993. Stanford, ranked 13th, begins a weekend series 
against UCLA in first place with a 17-7 record in conference play. Stanford is 
a half-game ahead of fourth-ranked USC and 10th-ranked Arizona State, both 
18-9. 
</P>
<P>
 USC will complete its conference schedule this weekend at California. Arizona 
State will play Stanford next weekend in the conference finale for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to sweep Cal," USC Coach Mike Gillespie said. "Then it's, 'Go 
Bruins.' We need them to get after Stanford." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford has been led by Nate Olmstead, who is batting .363 with 41 runs 
batted in. Dusty Allen has seven homers and 47 RBI. Dan Reed is 9-3 with a 3.10 
earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 "They better be had this year," Gillespie said of the Cardinal, "because 
they're going to be damn tough to stop next year."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The West Coast Conference race is also coming down to the final weeks with 
17-7 Santa Clara holding a half-game lead over 18-9 Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine will end conference play this weekend at San Diego. Santa Clara is 
at St. Mary's this weekend and finishes with a series at Loyola next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine has been led by sophomore Ruben Gamboa, who is batting .479 with 
three homers and 27 RBI since becoming a starter 19 games ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge's fate in the Western Athletic Conference race will be 
determined next weekend when the Matadors travel to Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge is 12-9 in the WAC after winning two of three from first-place San 
Diego State last weekend. San Diego State (12-6) will play Fresno State this 
weekend and will finish against Sacramento State. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn senior John Powell struck out 15 in a loss to Mississippi last Friday, 
tying the NCAA career record for strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell has 541 strikeouts, matching Derek Tatsuno's total at Hawaii from 
1977-79. He will pitch Friday night against defending national champion 
Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Cal State Fullerton. Tim Wallach in 1979 and Phil Nevin in 
1992. No other Southland school has produced a Golden Spikes winner.

PREP VOLLEYBALL ROUNDUP; NO. 1 EL TORO SWEEPS PAST SAN CLEMENTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 If there were any doubts about El Toro's No. 1 ranking in Orange County boys' 
volleyball, they were erased Wednesday when the Chargers swept third-ranked San 
Clemente in a South Coast League match at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside hitter Ryan Mariano had 17 kills and Chris Jacobson 10 kills and four 
blocks to lead El Toro to a 15-11, 15-9, 15-4 victory. The Chargers clinched 
their first league title since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro (14-1, 9-0 in league) won Game 1 on the strength of Mariano's 10 kills 
and Todd Steinert's steady setting. He finished with 43 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers, top-ranked in the Southern Section Division I poll, scored nine 
of the last 11 points to win Game 2 and opened Game 3 with a 9-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buzzsaw is a good word for it," San Clemente Coach Mike Hurlbut said. "I'm 
disappointed with the poor match we played, especially when the league title 
was at stake." 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente (12-2, 7-2), ranked fifth in Division I, must defeat Dana Hills 
on Friday to claim second place in league. El Toro is the only team to defeat 
the Tritons, including a five-game thriller, April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 In that match, San Clemente won two of the first three games, including a 15-1 
victory in Game 3. Since then, the Chargers have won six consecutive games 
against San Clemente, including a victory in the semifinals of the Tournament 
of Champions at Cal State Northridge on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Corin Bemus had 14 kills and Gabe Gardner added 12 kills and three 
blocks for the Tritons on Wednesday, Phinney Gardner (three kills) and Eric 
Krogh (five kills) were noticeably quiet after playing prominent roles in the 
first match against El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think San Clemente is the best team we've played," El Toro Coach Mike 
Jagd said. "I think they should be No. 2 in the county, and to beat them in 
three . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Jagd hopes it is a preview of coming attractions. With the playoffs beginning 
May 13, the Chargers are peaking at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pacific Coast League: 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia 3, Century 0 -- Dave White had seven kills for 10th-ranked Estancia 
(13-1, 8-1), which won, 15-2, 15-1, 15-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach 3, Costa Mesa 0 -- Dan Styles, Beau Bianchi, and Szilard Kovacs 
each had nine kills for fourth-ranked Laguna Beach (13-1, 9-0), which won, 
15-1, 15-2, 15-1. The Artists play second-place Estancia on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills 3, Laguna Hills 2 -- Junior Chris Congo had 30 kills and Matt 
Grace had 10 blocks for Trabuco Hills (6-8, 5-4), which won, 15-4, 12-15, 9-15, 
15-7, 15-13.

PREP SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; EL DORADO SLIDES PAST CYPRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 El Dorado scored two runs in the seventh inning on one hit and four Cypress 
errors to upset the fifth-ranked Centurions, 2-0, in Empire League softball 
play at Arnold Park in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado (16-6, 6-1) had runners on base in every inning except the third, 
but the Centurions kept them off the scoreboard until the final inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Carmen LoNigro led off the seventh with a line-drive single to center, 
and from there things went downhill for Cypress (13-5, 4-3). Jenny Terrell hit 
a grounder to third, but second baseman Christa Saindon dropped the throw and 
everyone was safe. Both runners advanced on a groundout to second, and then 
Jamie Nebeker's bunt was misplayed, loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions, who turned two double plays in the game, looked as if they 
might get out of another jam when they forced out LoNigro at home. But with the 
bases still loaded, Terrell was caught in a rundown between third and home, and 
scored after running into the catcher to give the Golden Hawks a 1-0 lead. 
Nebeker then scored on an error by Julie Adams, and the Centurions watched 
their championship hopes slip further out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado's Kelli Tom (8-3) pitched a four-hit shutout, striking out five and 
walking none. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kelli pitched beautifully," El Dorado coach Chris Schaner said. "But it was a 
whole team effort. We have worked hard for this." 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado faces league-leading Los Alamitos today. The Golden Hawks finished 
second to No. 2-ranked Los Alamitos in the Fullerton tournament this season and 
lost 2-1 in the teams' first league matchup. MELANIE NEFF

PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP; GOLISANO GETS HAPPY BY SHUTTING OUT TROY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pitcher Ryan Golisano had been in a slump. 
</P>
<P>
 True, he had consecutive victories that kept Fullerton one step ahead of the 
crowd in the Freeway League. But Golisano was not happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't throwing enough strikes," Golisano said. "I was walking too many 
batters and making too many mistakes. They were just bad outings." 
</P>
<P>
 Golisano found satisfaction Wednesday, pitching a three-hitter to beat Troy, 
4-0, at Fullerton, keeping the Indians in first place. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Golisano's first shutout of the season, and a performance that left 
Troy Coach Dane Ilertsen shaking his head in admiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have played all day and not beaten him,," Ilertsen said. "His 
fastball was fast, his slider was sliding and his splitter was splitting. 
Everything did what it was supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Golisano (10-1) struck out only two, but he was nearly unhittable. He retired 
10 of the last 12 batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors (14-7, 7-5) hit only five balls out of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
 Golisano had labored since losing to Sunny Hills three weeks ago. He had won 
but had not looked good doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ryan hadn't been going at hitters," Coach Dolf Hes said. "He needed to be 
more aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 He was. Troy had opportunities early, but Golisano hung tough. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors loaded the bases with two outs in the second, but Rich Richey's 
line drive was snagged by second baseman Steve St. Pierre. In the third, Troy 
had two on with one out, but Golisano got two weak popups to wiggle out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians (17-5, 9-3) provided some offense, but not a lot. Troy's Rick 
Parmenter (5-3) pitched a strong game but made a few mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians got three consecutive hits, including RBI singles by Craig Freeman 
and Ryan Schatz, to take a 2-0 lead in the third. They also got a home run by 
Keith Ginter in the fifth and a run-scoring single by pinch-hitter Matt Sanders 
in the sixth. CHRIS FOSTER

set, 6-4, to give seventh-ranked Canyon a 10 2/3-10 1/3 victory over Villa Park 
in a Century League boys' tennis match Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park (6-4) won all nine sets in singles play, but Canyon (13-5, 6-4)

 Esperanza sweeps top three places -- Chris Berry won his third consecutive 
Empire League title by tying teammate Ryan Donovan, each shooting 79-74 for a 
two-round total of 153 at Western Hills and Yorba Linda Country Club. Both 
qualify for the Southern Section individual championships, May 23, along with 
third-place finisher Scott Lucidi (78-80-158), also of Esperanza, and Los 
Alamitos' Bret Younker (75-84-159), who was fourth.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: MIAMI, CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Florence Avenue is jammed on weekends, a slow crawl west through Bell from the 
card clubs, not quite a cruise thing but pretty close, an inching parade of 
Jeeps, spruced-up Impalas and mini-trucks jacked up higher than Macks, a 
hundred boom-car duels between hip-hop beats and banda . Bell is what happy 
urban Los Angeles looks like on a Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Past the off-brand supermarkets, past the "model studio," past the 
custom-oriented auto-body shops, the 24-hour mariscos joints and the neon taco 
stands as big as ball fields stands the Cuban restaurant Miami. More than 
perhaps any other Cuban restaurant in the Los Angeles area, the place looks and 
feels like the crowded small cafes in the Cuban Calle Ocho neighborhood of 
central Miami, decked out with vintage travel posters, a mammoth cappuccino 
machine, frosted glass and bright brass. Miami is brightly lit and gleaming the 
way a plush, pastel airport lounge might be, if airport lounges smelled of 
garlic and made their customers happy. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot of food around here at Miami, plates heaped high with the fried 
beans-and-rice dish Moros y Cristianos , steamed yuca buried under hillocks of 
chopped garlic, green plantains that have been flattened and sizzled in oil 
until crisp. Tables are littered with empty bottles of the dense fizzy drink 
malta , with half-finished glasses of mango milkshake, with carafes emptied of 
cold, red wine. (Miami has an OK wine list -- cold Marques de Riscal Rioja, for 
some reason, goes splendidly with almost everything on the menu -- but skip the 
sangria, which is essentially cheap red wine doctored with the entire contents 
of a can of fruit cocktail.) All around are platters of avocado-onion salad, of 
rib steaks fried with garlic, of Chinese takeout-style Cuban rice fried with 
bits of pork, ham and egg, and a generous handful of shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
 What we're talking about may be only the second-best Cuban restaurant in Bell 
-- my favorite is still the splendid El Chori, which has probably the best 
Cuban food in the Southland -- but Miami is a fine, reliable place, with cheap 
lunch specials, enclosed parking for your Lexus and an atmosphere genteel 
enough to please a finicky uncle. Almost everything comes with rice and 
extravagantly spiced black beans, with fried green plantains or with blackened, 
caramelized fried sweet plantains, with bread and butter, so it is hard to 
leave hungry here . . . unless you order the camarones al ajillo , which are 
good but include a lot more garlic than shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
 Carne asada , distinctly unrelated to the Mexican dish of that name, involves 
a couple of thick tranchers of pot-roasted beef and a dense, garlicky pan 
gravy; lechon asado , the tenderest roast pork, comes in chunks with salty, 
chewy pigskin still attached, plenty of fat and, if you ask for it, a healthy 
wallop of garlic sauce. Stewed oxtail is soft, intensely flavored, almost 
gelatinous. 
</P>
<P>
 Fried snapper, crunchy-crusted, vaguely scented with garlic and citrus, was a 
bit puzzling, one side moist and fragrant, the other dry and overcooked, but it 
was at least half good. (Fried snapper fillet was utterly ordinary.) Squid 
stewed with onions in its own ink is salty and perfect with rice; apporeado de 
tasajo , dried-beef shreds stewed in a sweetish tomato sauce, may not be the 
best version of this dish -- at its best, tasajo is like the best machaca 
you've ever tasted -- but is probably worth tasting. * Miami Restaurant

oldies hits. In front of the store, kids ride the emerald-green horse or the 
orange-colored Dumbo elephant on a miniature carousel. Just inside the door 
you'll see a churro stand, a video rental boutique with lots of Cantinflas 
movies and dubbed Disney cartoons, and magazine racks packed with 
Spanish-language versions of Elle and Cosmopolitan. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Valu No. 8 is well stocked with standard American products, but somehow it 
still conveys the spirit of a Mexican marketplace. Concessionaires lining the 
store's inside perimeter sell sombreros, Western boots with metal-tipped toes 
and sacos , those Mexican-style men's short suit jackets. Multihued pinatas 
dangle over the vegetable bins, and the meaty aroma of frying carnitas mingles 
with the warm smell of baking Mexican rolls wafting from the hot deli area. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Mexican produce at Top Valu -- jicama, chayotes, plantains and 
mangos -- is getting to be pretty familiar everywhere. But here it's featured 
in mountainous heaps. And occasionally Top Valu No. 8 will have something 
exceptional like a pile of gleaming orange habanero chiles or the hard-to-find 
fresh epazote , an herb essential to west-central and southern Mexican cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 90% of our customers are Hispanic," says the store's manager, Ben 
Hashemi, after I ask him about the imported canned Guatemalan black beans and 
the Mexican Penafiel and Jarrito sodas. "We get these things to make our 
customers feel at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all Top Valu's nine stores, No. 8 is the most likely to make hard-core 
Mexican cooks feel at home. In its Mexican-style full-service butcher 
department you can get carne asada or milanesa (or for that matter any meat you 
want) cut to order; shrink-wrapped meats are still not entirely customary in 
Mexico. The butchers here also make hot and mild chorizo and an intense 
russet-colored carne adobada , marinated in achiote and orange juice. Over in 
the dairy section you can get Mexican-style cheeses in plastic-wrapped 
packages, supermarket-style, but here at the meat counter, the butcher will cut 
cheese to your order, slicing off a slab of queso fresco , aged cotija or 
stringy Oaxaca straight from huge wheels of cheese.  
</P>
<P>
 "Of all our stores this one is closest to the border, so we wanted it to have 
that authentic feel," says John Cordero, Top Valu's grocery director. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the head of the Top Valu chain, Darioush Khaledi, comes from 
Iranian Kurdistan. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I moved here in 1976, I was looking for a business to buy because I 
needed to make a living," Khaledi says. It could have been any kind of 
business, a transmission shop or a gas station. After analyzing many 
possibilities, a small supermarket in Torrance proved the most promising."  
</P>
<P>
 Today the former civil engineer and political prisoner (he was jailed in 
Tehran for his association with Amnesty International and his opposition to the 
Shah's dictatorship) has been called an industry leader in the field of 
independent Latino grocers. He's also been called prophetic for his foresight 
into the untapped potential of the lucrative Latino market, a sector that has 
expanded exponentially over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 And after 17 years, K.V. Mart Co., which Khaledi co-owns with his 
brother-in-law, Parviz Vazin, includes nine supermarkets, four moderate-sized 
warehouse-style stores (with more on the drawing boards) and five shopping 
centers.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Khaledi and Vazin first acquired their store in Torrance they let their 
employees continue to run the business. "I had no idea what I was going to do 
when we first opened and they were making money," Khaledi says. At that time he 
was unfamiliar with grocery industry management protocol. Terms such as "target 
marketing," and "demographics of spending power," so popular with marketing 
experts today, were foreign to him. In fact, English was pretty foreign to him, 
too. "I could barely speak it," he admits.  
</P>
<P>
 But Khaledi began his own brand of back-yard market research -- he simply 
observed the store's clientele. "We had a lot of Spanish-speaking customers but 
almost none of the employees spoke Spanish," he explains. Sensing that he could 
build customer loyalty by catering more directly to this clientele, he began 
hiring bilingual cashiers and asking their advice on what merchandise to stock. 
</P>
<P>
 K.V. Mart's second store in Lennox was even more precisely geared to Hispanic 
customers. The market maintained a full service butcher who could cut meats in 
the Latin American fashion and it stocked plenty of variety meats. Many Central 
American and Mexican customers feel comfortable shopping where they know the 
owner or are familiar with the employees, so Khaledi encouraged his bilingual 
staff to try to remember customers' names. Soon he began to call his markets 
"Friendly Neighborhood Stores" in advertisements.  
</P>
<P>
 He used the same strategies for the rest of the stores in the company's 
expanding empire. Cashiers were also encouraged to relay customer requests to 
the manager, who in turn had the authority to order independently of any 
centralized ordering system. Each Top Valu could then closely tailor specialty 
merchandise to its neighborhood, whatever the population mix. The Long Beach 
branch on Cherry Avenue and the Compton and Lawndale stores, for example, stock 
a section of Southern items, including instant Creole roux and gravy mix, hot 
pickled okra, collard greens and fat back. Shopping List

<P>
 HERBS AND CONDIMENTS 
</P>
<P>
 * Camaron Molido: Along the costal areas of Mexico, fishermen dry shrimp to 
preserve them. These are often used ground, and now they even come in plastic 
shaker-top jars. During Vigilias (Lent), dishes based on dried shrimp replace 
meat and fresh fish. The most famous of these, tortas de camaron , is an 
assault on the senses that demonstrates the complex character of true Mexican 
cooking. The tortas are little deep-fried puffy omelets made with separately 
beaten egg whites and yolks and ground shrimp folded in. The rich mole that 
always sauces them calls for the flesh of several kinds of dried chiles and 
strips of fresh nopales (cactus paddles, which you can find in the produce 
section, whole or in bags, diced and ready to use). 
</P>
<P>
 * Fresh Epazote: As basic as it is to cooking in Mexico, this herb has been 
elusive in California, possibly because some cooks grow the self-propagating 
weed-like plant at home (with a taste slightly different from the epazote grown 
in Mexico). Epazote is now starting to show up in a few restaurants but only 
spottily in markets. Top Valu's Santa Ana store is the first place I've seen it 
on a regular basis in a supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 This sharp-tasting herb -- a cross between thyme and lemon, plus a mysterious 
something else -- is indispensable with fish, and it punches up the flavor of 
crab like nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
 In south and central Mexico, epazote is regarded as necessary in bean dishes, 
and also turns up in salsas and even huevos rancheros . It is rarely used dried 
except for medicinal purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pico de Gallo Seasoning: Aptly named "rooster beak" for its sensory impact, 
pico de gallo seasoning is a blend of several kinds of ground chiles and salt. 
You see jars of it on the counters at the fruit stands on street corners and at 
Mexican swap meets. People sprinkle it over cucumber or green mango slices or 
onto jicama and even oranges. The brand found at Top Valu includes a recipe for 
pico de gallo salad in which the above-mentioned fruits and vegetables are 
tossed with the seasoning and fresh lime juice. 
</P>
<P>
 * Achiote Paste and Powder: Among Mexico's first convenience foods were 
recados , spice pastes that women sold in the marketplaces. The recado based on 
annatto has become the most popular because soaking and crushing the tiny, 
rock-hard annatto seeds that go into it is an arduous task. A 
deep-brick-colored paste of the crushed seeds, garlic and other seasonings is 
pressed into solid 100-gram blocks called pasta de achiote condimentado ( 
achiote for short). 
</P>
<P>
 Achiote paste is most frequently blended with jugo de naranja agria , the 
juice of sour Seville oranges (if these are out of season, a blend of fresh 
orange and lemon juices substitutes fairly well). The marinade is smeared in a 
thick mass over roasts, sides of pork or chickens before the food is wrapped in 
banana leaves. Originally the leafy packets were cooked in an outdoor 
charcoal-heated pit oven, but broiling and barbecuing (with or without the 
banana leaf wrapping) are excellent alternatives.  
</P>
<P>
 Achiote paste is most often found in the Mayan cooking of Yucatan, Guatemala 
or Belize. Cuban cooks prefer their achiote in the form of bijol , powdered 
annatto mixed with cornstarch that comes in a tiny can the size of a 
walnut-half. Its most popular use is in Cuban yellow rice dishes where it takes 
the place of expensive saffron. A pinch of bijol may simply be added to the 
rice cooking liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 * Green Mole: There are hundreds of mole variations; most of them require 
lengthy cooking and complex ingredients. Many moles contain several kinds of 
chiles and crushed nuts and seeds.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm not going to tell you that a pre-made mole can compete with home cooking, 
but in a pinch it can make the same old chicken breasts or cubed pork taste 
pretty terrific. You find green mole packed in jars in the Mexican food aisle. 
Unfortunately, the directions for using it are sketchy. The instructions tell 
you simply to dilute the mole with broth and pour it over meat or chicken. I 
prefer to chop about 1/4 cup white onion per person and saute lightly until 
tender, then add meat chunks or chicken breasts to brown slightly. Next dilute 
the mole to a sauce-like consistency and add to the pan (it will thicken 
slightly, so have extra broth on hand to thin the sauce). Simmer the mole , 
covered, until the meat is tender. Near the end of cooking time, add a handful 
of chopped cilantro. I like to make double portions of this because it can be 
eaten with rice or used in a burrito or a soft taco, and it's even better 
reheated. 
</P>
<P>
 HOT DELI 
</P>
<P>
 * Prepared Dishes: Top Valu's in-house cooks turn out a small selection of 
home-style dishes every day. They may have chile colorado, pork chile verde or 
chilaquiles , sort of Mexican lasagna made from tortillas cooked with tomato 
salsa, then blanketed with cheese. There are also Salvadoran pupusas , savory 
pollos rotizados and sweet tamales for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 * Carnitas: Carnitas, crisp chunks of fried pork, are well-known taco-stand 
fare. Less well known are the pork meats traditionally cooked carnitas-style, 
namely snouts ( trompas ), ears ( orejas ) and buche (part of the intestine). 
Each has its own special texture that devotees prize. I prefer the meaty, 
slightly chewy trompas cut into slivers and eaten with good salsa in a taco. 
</P>
<P>
 * Baked Goods: Baked on the premises are the baseball-mitt-shaped teleras , 
rolls used for tortas , Mexican-style submarine sandwiches. Bolillos, 
Mexican-style French rolls, issue from the same oven. There's also a small, 
uninspired selection of pan dulce .  
</P>
<P>
 DAIRY FOODS 
</P>
<P>
 * Jocoque: Like crema Mexicana , jocoque is a cultured cream. But its 
particular culture gives it the more pronounced flavor of fresh cheese. Jocoque 
, in fact, is very similar to mascarpone but with a saltier taste. Like crema , 
it tops fruit salads, tacos, gorditas or chiles rellenos. One jocoque label 
even suggests putting it on a baked potato. Several brands of jocoque are 
available. My favorite contains no gelatin, vegetable gums or other fillers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Requeson: Basically, this is ricotta, a soft, unripened and only slightly 
drained cheese. When you buy the bulk-packed requeson from the butcher case, it 
is wonderfully creamy and especially nice with berries or sliced ripe mangos. 
Some like requeson with slices of gelled Latin American fruit paste, usually 
guava or quince (found around the corner from the hot deli). If drained until 
quite dry, requeson can be transformed into a scrambled-egg-style dish folded 
into a sauteed mixture of onions, tomatoes and chiles and served with 
tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oaxaca Cheese: This mild, slightly chewy eating cheese is a near relative of 
mozzarella and a close cousin to Middle Eastern string cheese. You'll find huge 
balls of it, looking like balls of yarn, in the butcher's case along with the 
other bulk cheeses; in the cheese department, small Oaxaca cheese balls are 
individually packed in plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 PRODUCE 
</P>
<P>
 * Jamaica: Agua de jamaica , a staple at almost every authentic Mexican food 
stand, is the ruby-red drink made by steeping hibiscus flowers (actually the 
dried flower bud coverings) in water. It's never as good, though, as the more 
intensely flavored drink you can make at home as easily as you brew tea. Look 
for jamaica in bulk near the dried chiles. 
</P>
<P>
 My recipe for agua de jamaica is simply to bring five cups of water to boil, 
then stir in 3/4 cup dried jamaica and remove the mixture from the heat. Cover 
and steep about 10 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of superfine granulated sugar, stirring 
very well. Allow the brew to cool in the pot, stirring occasionally to dissolve 
the sugar. Next strain the brew into glass jars or bottles and chill well. 
Discard the flowers. Serve the agua with plenty of ice. If the infusion is a 
bit strong, add a little extra water. 
</P>
<P>
 CHILES 
</P>
<P>
 Some chiles, like the small green serrano or the medium-sized hot jalapeno, 
are fairly standardized across the country. But selecting certain chiles for a 
particular recipe can be a confusing task even when chiles are labeled. This is 
because poblano chiles, which go by the name of ancho chiles when dried, are 
often mistakenly called fresh pasilla chiles in California and in Michoacan, a 
state from which many Mexicans have emigrated. Chiles anchos may have other 
names, among them pasilla and chile colorado , depending on whom you ask and 
where your chile expert comes from.  
</P>
<P>
 However, when real pasilla chiles are called for in Mexican cookbooks, they 
must be the dried version of chiles chilacas . These true pasillas are easy to 
tell apart from ancho/pasillas because they are long, skinny and wrinkly rather 
than short and stubby. But beware: Pasillas can also be called chiles negros .  
</P>
<P>
 There are good books to help dispel the confusion; in the meantime, this quick 
guide may help: 
</P>
<P>
 * Chiles Poblanos: These fist-size, fresh dark-green chiles are popular for 
chiles rellenos or as rajas , chile slices either cooked in cream with cheese 
or used as a garnish. Poblanos are usually quite mild. They are extremely mild 
if you remove all the seeds and veins (wear latex gloves to do this). They're 
also good for stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anaheim Chiles: Also termed chile verde or chile verde del norte , these are 
long, two-inch wide mild peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chiles Anchos: One of the most widely used peppers in Mexican cooking, these 
wrinkly, wide chiles are a dark, almost black, burgundy color. They look almost 
exactly like the peppers called mulato chiles. Anchos have a fruity, some say 
prune-like taste. You can be sure an ancho is an ancho and not a mulato by 
holding it to the light; the ancho will be more translucent. (Remember, anchos 
are often called pasillas in California.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Chiles Pasillas: Another popular dried chile, often used in combination with 
others, pasillas stand out from other long, thin dried chiles because they are 
the darkest colored and most wrinkly of all. Pasillas have a deep, complex, 
toasty flavor with a tart edge. 
</P>
<P>
 MISCELLANEOUS 
</P>
<P>
 * Cajeta: Sweetened, caramelized milk, cajeta is the Mexican equivalent of 
peanut butter and jelly. Originally it was made without sugar from goat's milk 
and packaged in small wooden cajas (boxes), from which the dessert gets its 
name. Now cow's milk cajeta in jars is more or less standard -- at least in 
urban Mexico. Cooks spread this golden, fudgy substance between layers of cake, 
or they fill crepes with it and sprinkle them with toasted pecans. The most 
baroque cajeta cake I've ever seen was a cake roll filled with ice cream and 
melted chocolate and covered with a cajeta sauce spread over the outside under 
a coating of nuts -- a sort of upgrade of the banana split.  
</P>
<P>
 Cajeta has been borrowed from the dessert pantry for the everyday table. 
People serve a little dollop of it with queso fresco for a quick dessert. They 
drizzle it on waffles or make a quick snack by spreading it on crackers or 
toasted sandwich bread. Like peanut butter, cajeta is also good spooned 
straight from the jar. 
</P>
<P>
 * Horchata: The numerous cereal-based drinks still scarcely known north of the 
Rio Grande are basic to everyday Mexican eating. Champurrado is a hot chocolate 
thickened with corn masa . Atoles are corn- or rice- or barley-based drinks 
that make nourishing breakfasts or between-meal snacks. One of the most 
prevalent grain-based refrescos , horchata, is a chilled, rice- and 
cinnamon-based drink that tastes like rice pudding in a glass. An instant 
version sold in paper envelopes eliminates the need for grinding all that 
soaked rice and makes it easy to prepare one serving at a time. It even makes 
very low-fat milk taste good.

LEGISLATORS TO SUBPOENA NAMES OF SEX OFFENDERS UP FOR PAROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Politicking over crime issues escalated Wednesday when two legislators 
announced plans to subpoena the Wilson Administration, demanding the names of 
sex offenders before they are released from state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections is resisting releasing the names of child 
molesters and rapists, contending that they would be attacked by other inmates 
if details of their crimes become known while they are in prison. A warden said 
prison guards could also be in danger because they would have to protect the 
sex offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a news conference on the Capitol steps, Assemblymen Richard Polanco 
(D-Los Angeles) and Bob Epple (D-Cerritos) said the public's right to know 
about sex offenders and prepare for their release outweighs such security 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be a minimal threat to the sex offenders if the information is 
released. But if these sex offenders return to our communities, the threat they 
pose is beyond measure," Polanco said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly Rules Committee, of which Polanco is a member, will decide today 
whether to issue the subpoena. It would be directed at Department of 
Corrections Director James Gomez and seek the names of sex offenders set for 
release this year, their parole dates, and the localities to which they would 
be released. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Administration defies the subpoena, Epple said, criminal sanctions 
could be imposed. A more likely result would be that the Democrat-controlled 
Legislature could hold up parts of the governor's legislative program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not threaten (criminal prosecution) against any of the directors," 
Epple said. "But I think it would certainly make it a difficult time for 
everybody until, in fact, the executive branch and (the) department were able 
to come to agreement to how they should respond to legitimate requests." 
</P>
<P>
 The planned subpoena comes as Wilson runs for reelection on an anti-crime 
platform, but also as Democrats try to shore up their anti-crime credentials. 
Last month, Treasurer Kathleen Brown, one of Wilson's Democratic challengers, 
attacked the governor over serial rapist Melvin Carter's release. Carter's 
release after a dozen years behind bars was mandated by sentencing laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, meanwhile, is backing a bill by Assemblywoman Barbara Alby (R-Fair 
Oaks) requiring that names and photographs of convicted child molesters be made 
available in libraries after they are released. 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco and Epple are going a step beyond Alby's concept by demanding to know 
the identities of inmates prior to parole. They say it would give the public 
time to pressure the state into keeping the offenders in prison, and serve as a 
warning to the towns where they would be sent. 
</P>
<P>
 J.P. Tremblay, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections, suggested that 
the Democratic legislators are motivated by election-year politics in which 
crime has been a dominant issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (they want) to do this for community safety, support (Alby's bill). We'll 
notify the public when these people get out," Tremblay said. "If (they want) to 
do this for political reasons, to try to stir up the issue and get communities 
involved and get them to raise the political issue, that's the wrong 
motivation." 
</P>
<P>
 Tremblay said the state Public Records Act specifically allows officials to 
refuse the release of names of prisoners for safety reasons, adding: "They're 
basically asking Gomez to break the law." 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections also cites a Penal Code section that says 
details about paroled sex offenders shall remain confidential, but must be 
given to police in cities to which they are released.

OHIO RIVALS BEGIN SENATE CAMPAIGN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Democrat Joel Hyatt and Republican Lt. Gov. Michael DeWine kicked off their 
U.S. Senate campaigns in Ohio's most populous region Wednesday, with Hyatt 
pledging to focus on abortion rights and health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the battle this fall is going to be on the issues on which Mike 
DeWine and I disagree," said Hyatt, who supports abortion rights and 
comprehensive health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will make it a tough campaign, because on virtually every issue of 
importance to Ohio, he and I have a difference of opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 DeWine, who opposes abortion except when medically necessary or in cases of 
rape or incest and favors conservative approaches to health care reform, was 
less willing to forecast the tone of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first day of a six-month campaign. I don't know what we're going to 
see," he said at a news conference. "I can tell you what people want us to talk 
about: They want us to talk about the issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Hyatt, retiring Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum's son-in-law and choice as 
successor, won a narrow primary victory Tuesday.

CLINTON OKS JOB-TRAINING PROGRAM FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton used a futuristic student-made desk Wednesday to sign 
legislation aimed at preparing young people for good jobs if they are not 
college-bound. 
</P>
<P>
 The law is aimed at training the 75% of young Americans who move from school 
to the workplace without pursuing a four-year college degree.It is intended to 
address the growing gap in income between the college-educated and the rest of 
the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Students generally would enroll in the programs in the 11th grade and continue 
in them for one or two years after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must not only create more jobs, we have to make it possible for people who 
work hard and do the right thing" to become members of the middle class, 
Clinton said at the signing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 The law is part of Clinton's overall education program, aimed at "lifetime 
learning" and symbolized by the Goals 2000 measure he signed earlier this year 
in an effort to raise education standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the legislation, the Education Department and the Labor Department will 
distribute $100 million this year to help states, communities, schools, 
employers and labor unions start building a school-to-work network. 
</P>
<P>
 Education Secretary Richard W. Riley and Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said 
they hope Congress will make $300 million available next year and more in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the aluminum and smoke-colored plexiglass desk he used to sign 
the bill will stand as an emblem for the new program. 
</P>
<P>
 It was made by students in the Manufacturing Technology Program in Flint, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 "This desk symbolizes what this is all about," Clinton said, adding that the 
Michigan students were told it had to be inexpensive and easy to move and 
reassemble.

<P>
 Undeterred by the tentative agreement announced this week between the city and 
the Walt Disney Co., opponents of the proposed $3-billion Disneyland Resort say 
they plan to step up their efforts to derail the massive project through 
political pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the group, Anaheim Home Owners Maintaining their 
Environment (HOME), say they are meeting with groups who are opposing Disney's 
tactics in other cities -- such as Orlando, Fla., and the Washington, 
D.C.-Virginia area -- and are readying a petition drive to head off the Anaheim 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics are steadfast in opposing any public financing for a project that is 
being undertaken by one of America's richest corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should pay for it themselves," said Anaheim HOME Vice President Steve 
White, a local real estate broker. "All we are asking is that voters have a say 
in this." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, White and former HOME President Curtis Stricker said the 
group has been collecting names and surveying residents near the project to 
gauge opinions and clear the way for a petition drive. 
</P>
<P>
 He said an initial canvassing of neighborhoods in central Anaheim shows deep 
concern over freeway off-ramps due to the project, as well as the diversion of 
public funds to one of America's richest corporations at a time when the city 
is reeling from financial pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's announcement Monday, that it has reached a tentative agreement with 
Disney on terms for public financing of the project, came as no surprise, White 
said. "The deal has been cut for more than a year," he said, adding that the 
announcement was a mere formality. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anaheim HOME is sure to face off against a privately organized group 
supporting the proposed Disneyland expansion, called Westcot 2000. An Anaheim 
banker who co-chairs the group applauded the news that Anaheim and Disney had 
reached a tentative accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel excellent about it. I think it is one of the nicest things that has 
happened in a long time," said Stan Pawlowski, chairman of Corporate Bank. 
"This is a win-win for Anaheim and Disney combined." 
</P>
<P>
 A voter referendum of the deal is unneeded, he said, because there should be 
faith in the Planning Commission and City Council to represent the public's 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither side, however, has actually seen the details of the pact, which city 
officials said will not become public for another two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Only then will the public find out all the details that are emerging from a 
year of negotiations over the massive project, which would transform central 
Anaheim into a landscaped district centered around an internationally themed 
amusement park called Westcot. Disney plans to build more than 5,000 hotel 
rooms and undertake a complete rejuvenation of the streets surrounding 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When details of the deal are announced, residents will get a better idea of 
how the city will finance millions of dollars in public improvements in direct 
support of the project, such as building parking structures, making street and 
sewer changes and burying unsightly utility lines. 
</P>
<P>
 It will also lay out a timetable for construction, call for a 2% increase in 
the hotel-occupancy tax to help pay for some improvements and ensure that the 
city draws a profit from the endeavor, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Once reviewed by the Planning Commission, the deal must then be considered for 
approval by the City Council, which has been generally supportive of Disney's 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials said they do not expect to make a decision on whether to 
proceed with the project until some time this summer, after the City Council 
considers the plan. The new amusement park would not open until at least 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Disney has generally remained noncommittal. In December, 
however, Chairman Michael D. Eisner sounded pessimistic as he questioned 
whether his company could afford the project and said, "I don't know if there 
is even going to be a Westcot." 
</P>
<P>
 Stock market analysts say that Eisner is known for using the press as a 
negotiating tool. Privately, he may not be as downbeat on Anaheim as he has 
sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has certainly not lost interest in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Hockey's Mighty Ducks had a successful first season at the Anaheim Arena. A 
unique mega-ride themed around the Indiana Jones movies is under construction 
in Disneyland's Adventureland and slated to open next spring. The company also 
recently announced that it will build a vacation resort village on the Newport 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Money is not a sticking point. If Disney wants to build the resort, it still 
has the ability to borrow plenty of money, said Raymond L. Katz, analyst for 
Lehman Bros. brokerage in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Vogel, an analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York, said he believes 
Disney may defer the decision, or try to build the project in stages. 
</P>
<P>
 But Paul Marsh, analyst for NatWest Securities Corp. in New York, said that 
California's troubles have "dampened the positive psychology of investment out 
there" and could make it harder for Disney to justify spending billions on a 
new resort.

THE CONTRAST IS STRIKING; HUSBAND PICKETS, WIFE CROSSES LINE TO HELP FEED 
STUDENTS AT SON'S SCHOOL 
</P>

<P>
 Things are kind of quiet around John and Pat Miller's household these days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Miller, 41, a food delivery driver for the Orange Unified School 
District, spent Wednesday morning on a union picket line outside district 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks away, his wife, Pat, 39, crossed a picket line to help fill food 
service gaps at Handy Elementary School created by striking non-teaching 
employees, like her husband. She helped coordinate and serve hundreds of 
breakfasts and lunches to students at Handy Elementary -- one of the schools on 
her husband's meal delivery route. 
</P>
<P>
 The Miller family has suddenly become a house divided as a strike by hundreds 
of classified employees enters its third day, straining bus, child-care, 
custodial and food services in the district of 26,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very quiet now at home," said the Millers' 8-year-old son Kevin, a 
second-grader at Handy Elementary. "My mom, she helps out at school. And in the 
afternoon, my dad, he goes out on strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Few families are facing the inner turmoil that the Millers are trying to cope 
with, which began Monday when an estimated 400 members of the California School 
Employees Assn., Chapter 67, went out on strike. But with union and district 
officials refusing to back down in their fight over a school board-imposed 
contract, there is no telling when the tension may ease up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I respect what she's doing. She has to do what she has to do," said John 
Miller, a district worker for the past two years. "But when you pay your union 
dues, you've got to back the union." 
</P>
<P>
 For Pat Miller, who works part time as a teacher's assistant at Handy, the 
welfare of the students outweighs all other concerns -- even her husband's 
predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was real mad at me -- he called me a Benedict Arnold," said Pat Miller, 
who was named Volunteer of the Year last year at Handy Elementary. "I feel for 
the working person. I mean, how much are you going to take before you do 
something? 
</P>
<P>
 "But," she added, as she unloaded another tray of burritos from the oven for a 
line of hungry students, "I'm doing what I'm doing for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Miller said he too believes he is acting in the best interest of his 
children, Kevin and 6-year-old Danielle. He said a potentially job-threatening 
clause in the contract forced upon the union by the school board in March 
pushed him to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The clause empowers the district to lay off workers or reduce their hours 
without negotiating. The contract also imposes three furlough days and 
reductions in health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can live with the insurance cutback," said John Miller, who is also a 
Little League coach. "But it's not right that they can lay you off and cut into 
your hours like that." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials defend the contract, saying it is vital in keeping the 
cash-strapped district solvent. By saving about $485,000, the contract helps 
offset a $2.2-million budget shortfall this year, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-day-old strike continues to try the patience of hundreds of district 
parents, now forced to battle through traffic jams in dropping off and picking 
up their children. About 7,000 students in the district are charged $180 per 
month for bus transportation, but during the strike only special education 
students are receiving service. Although it has released no specific details, 
the district has promised that parents will receive credit for days of lost bus 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Also hard hit by the strike have been child-care, custodial and food services. 
Six child-care centers remain closed, and of the 18 open, many are 
short-staffed. And students normally accustomed to hot meals are complaining 
about the cold food they are being served. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Pat Miller and scores of other parent volunteers around the 
district have helped ease the service cutbacks caused by the strike. Around the 
district's 37 schools, parent-volunteers are picking up trash, answering phones 
and helping prepare breakfast and lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts have not gone unappreciated by teachers and administrators, who 
themselves have had to double up on duties since the strike began. 
</P>
<P>
 Handy Elementary Principal Anita Jameson had only enough time to eat a pack of 
animal crackers for lunch Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pat is our be-all and end-all. She's been an enormous help," Jameson said as 
she policed the lunch tables. 
</P>
<P>
 John Miller said that if the strike doesn't end soon, he may have to 
reconsider his decision to stay off the job. He said the walkout is taking a 
heavy toll of the family's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to feed the family," he said.

JUDGE EXCUSES 6 PUPILS FROM CLAS TEST; COURTS: PARENTS WIN RESTRAINING ORDER 
AGAINST PLACENTIA-YORBA LINDA AND TUSTIN DISTRICTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An Orange County judge Wednesday issued a restraining order that temporarily 
prohibits two local school districts from administering the controversial 
California Learning Assessment System test to six students whose parents object 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Richard W. Luesebrink granted the restraining order in a 
lawsuit filed by parents whose children attend schools in the Placentia-Yorba 
Linda and Tustin Unified school districts. The California Department of 
Education also was named in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Both districts already have administered the annual test for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents allege that the test is highly subjective and invades their 
children's privacy by forcing them to analyze their beliefs about family life, 
religion and sex. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS test proponents argue it is a sophisticated exam that measures a child's 
analytical ability and educational level through essays and group discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, the parents cited what they believe are sample questions from 
the confidential CLAS exams. One example asked students to write about an 
incident in which their perception of a family member changed. The parents 
argue in the lawsuit that the question forces children to reveal private 
experiences with their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "The test is a violation of our rights as parents," said Dianne Lounsbury, 43, 
the mother of a fourth-grader in a Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified school. 
Lounsbury said she took her 10-year-old daughter out of school last month to 
keep her from being tested. The other parents also took their children out of 
school to avoid the testing, said attorney John A. Mendoza of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza, who represented Lounsbury and her husband, Steve, along with two 
other families, said the judge's decision was significant because it now allows 
other Orange County parents to seek court action to excuse their children from 
the test. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials from both school districts said Wednesday's court action had 
little meaning or consequence because existing school policy allows any child 
to be exempt from the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already have the 'opt out' option. If parents don't want their kids to 
take the test, all they have to do is notify the school or the district, and 
their child is exempt," said James O. Fleming, superintendent of the 
Placentia-Yorba Linda district. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department of Education officials on Wednesday fought back at critics of 
the exams, filing a legal brief in a Los Angeles suit brought by opponents 
seeking to require parental permission for the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The state education code provides that "no test, questionnaire, survey or 
examination containing any questions about the pupil's personal beliefs or 
practices in sex, family life, morality and religion, or any questions about 
his parents' or guardians' beliefs and practices in sex, family life, morality 
and religion, shall be administered" to anyone in kindergarten through 12th 
grade without written parental permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph R. Symkowick, the state Education Department's general counsel, said: 
"We believe firmly that the CLAS tests do not require (parental) consent. It's 
a reading and writing test, not a Masters-and-Johnson-type survey."  
</P>
<P>
 Judge Robert O'Brien, who has asked to examine copies of this year's tests, 
has scheduled a hearing Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court on whether 
parental permission must be obtained before the tests are given.  
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the Orange County lawsuit is set for May 18, when the families 
will ask for a permanent restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two dozen suits have been filed against school districts around the 
state, in which parents and religious groups complained about the exam. 
Plaintiffs in most cases have received legal help from either the 
Escondido-based U.S. Justice Foundation or the Rutherford Institute of 
Charlottesville, Va.

O.C. TREASURY TURMOIL PUTS OFFICIALS ON ALERT; INVESTING: SANITATION DISTRICT 
CONTENDS IT LOST MONEY AFTER CRITICISM BY EXECUTIVE ROBERT L. CITRON'S 
POLITICAL FOE. THE COUNTY MAY DELAY REFINANCING OF BOND MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the wake of recent political attacks questioning the investment practices 
of Orange County Treasurer Robert L. Citron, county officials are taking 
temporary precautions in how they bring multimillion-dollar government bond 
deals to the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 And one finance official with the Orange County Sanitation District asserted 
Wednesday that the controversy may have already cost the district thousands of 
dollars in the search for new investors for securities issued to pay for part 
of its day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the first indications that nationally publicized criticisms of 
Citron's investment practices by his political opponent may have cost the 
county money and affected officials' critical financial decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Peer Swan, the sanitation district's fiscal policy chairman, said Wednesday 
that the agency lost up to $12,000 last month when it was forced to finance 
about $30.2 million in short-term securities at a higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Swan said, potential investors were not as willing to carry the 
agency's notes because treasurer candidate John M. W. Moorlach had criticized 
Citron's aggressive investment strategy in managing Orange County's 
$7.5-billion investment pool. It is unclear whether that reluctance also could 
have been influenced by rising interest rates.  
</P>
<P>
 Citron invests the money on behalf of the county and more than 180 other 
municipal and government agencies and says his strategies are sound.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a huge dollar amount with us," Swan said. "But it could have been 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sanitation District's securities, known as commercial paper, were being 
backed by the county investment pool. They were eventually purchased by Leahman 
Bros. Officials at the investment firm could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach dismissed the district's contentions that that it lost money as "weak 
political posturing by people who are not paying attention." 
</P>
<P>
 "They are looking for a bogyman, and it's not me," Moorlach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, county Finance Director Eileen Walsh said this week that in the 
wake of the Citron flap the county would likely delay by two weeks the 
refinancing of at least $234 million in bond money designated to pay for 
construction of local streets, sewer and flood control services in Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 It was uncertain whether the county would delay refinancing and the search for 
new bond funds to finance a separate $250 million in improvements for the 
Foothill Ranch and Rancho Santa Margarita areas. There, the bond money would 
pay for roads, library services and a Sheriff's Department substation. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said such delays would hopefully clear the air of criticisms by Moorlach 
and his supporters of Citron's investment policy, allowing the county to seek 
favorable refinance rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The director said the South County delays also were needed to secure property 
appraisals, and she did not think the wait would cost the county additional 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Walsh said the Citron controversy has prompted several calls from 
Wall Street agencies seeking reassurances about the county's financial standing 
with credit rating agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rating agencies are comfortable (with our standing)," Walsh said, "but 
I've never had to have so many conversations with them. (Citron's) stuff is 
clean." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Moorlach has criticized Citron's investment management, which 
relies heavily on using the county pool's U.S. Treasury bills and bonds as 
collateral to borrow short-term at low interest rates and investing the 
borrowed funds in bonds and securities that pay a higher rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy can earn large returns while interest rates remain low and 
stable. But it can fail when interest rates rise, as they have in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Citron has received "collateral calls" that forced the investment 
pool to pay an additional $215 million in collateral because the value of the 
securities he used to borrow money has declined as interest rates have gone up. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials and market analysts familiar with Citron's investments, 
however, had expressed confidence in his management of the county pool during 
his 24 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Criticism of Citron's tactics, most of which have come from his political 
opponents, have been aired by the local media as well as the Wall Street 
Journal and in the financial trade publications Derivative Week and the Bond 
Buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron and Assistant Treasurer Matthew R. Raabe acknowledged that the 
criticisms have continued to foster a climate of uncertainty in Orange County 
among investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do know there is general nervousness out there in the market right now," 
Raabe said. "Unfortunately, the market moves wildly on rumor. The psyche of 
investors has been damaged." 
</P>
<P>
 When the political exchanges reached their height a few weeks ago, Swan said, 
there was potential for even greater damage to the county's financial standing. 
With the quieting of the debate, the uncertainty seems to have lessened in 
recent days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the sanitation district, had no investors chosen to carry the 
district's debt, Swan said officials could have been forced to call on the 
county pool to bail it out because the $30.2 million in securities were fully 
backed by the county pool. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before the securities were purchased, Swan said, investors asked many 
questions and expressed concern about criticisms leveled by Citron's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The $12,000 was not going to kill the sanitation district," Swan said. "That 
wasn't the danger. The danger was in possibly creating a run on the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Criticisms by the Moorlach campaign) are like a guy who runs into a theater 
and yells 'Fire!' " he said. "This is real money we're talking about. It would 
have been real easy to create a stampede." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach, however, said he had no intention of backing down on his criticism 
of Citron's practices and scoffed at the idea that debate from one campaign 
could place Orange County at a disadvantage in the marketplace.

U.S. PROSECUTOR GETS REPRIMAND IN PAYOLA CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department has formally reprimanded a veteran prosecutor for 
failing to disclose critical information in a high-profile Los Angeles payola 
case, according to court documents obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Atty. Gen. Jo Ann Harris, in charge of the criminal division, 
criticized the actions of William S. Lynch, the lead prosecutor in the 
government's case against Joseph Isgro of Glendale, who was the nation's 
largest independent record promoter in the 1980s. Isgro's defense lawyer said 
the Justice Department's action was inadequate and "a whitewash." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge James M. Ideman, who first dismissed charges against Isgro 
in 1990, has said: "This is a case where the government's misconduct was as 
outrageous and egregious as anything that I have seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Ideman dismissed the payola case against Isgro and two other men after 
learning that Lynch, who had been sent from Washington to head the prosecution, 
concealed information that cast serious doubts on the merits of the case. 
Prosecutors are required by law to turn over any material that might exonerate 
a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Justice Department officials formally notified Judge Ideman that 
they had reprimanded Lynch. "As a result of my review, I found that Mr. Lynch 
had failed to produce a document that he should have produced to the defense," 
Harris said in a letter to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, however, emphasized that Lynch did not intentionally violate his 
obligation to disclose the information and said the prosecutor had not realized 
the significance of the document to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch declined comment, as did Ideman, through his secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 In her letter to the judge, Harris said that Atty. Gen. Janet Reno "has 
directed me to give the highest priority to developing uniformly high standards 
relating" to the government's duty to disclose exculpatory information. The 
Isgro case is one of several recent instances in which the actions of 
government attorneys have been harshly criticized by federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
 The document Lynch failed to disclose was a transcript of testimony given by 
Isgro's former tax lawyer, Dennis DiRicco, in an earlier San Francisco case. 
Ideman characterized the testimony as "a complete and detailed denial of any 
wrongdoing . . . by any of the defendants in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge noted that at a later Los Angeles grand jury session, Lynch 
"extracted . . . diametrically opposed testimony" from DiRicco that played a 
key role in obtaining an indictment against Isgro. 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier testimony cast doubts upon DiRicco's credibility, and thus could 
have helped Isgro. But Ideman said the government had attempted to lull the 
defense with "false assurances" that there was no exculpatory material and that 
Lynch "engaged in active misrepresentation to the court regarding the existence 
of such material." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three years later, the Justice Department's Office of Professional 
Responsibility conducted an internal investigation and concluded that Lynch 
"did not intentionally violate" his disclosure requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials concluded that Lynch did not intentionally lie to Ideman concerning 
the transcript of DiRicco's prior testimony. Instead, they found that Lynch was 
"unfamiliar with the substance of the 800-page transcript" and because of this 
did not recognize that it contained material helpful to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 When Assistant Atty. Gen. Harris reviewed the case, she agreed with the 
findings. Nonetheless, she concluded that Lynch should be reprimanded because 
he failed to produce exculpatory evidence "and exposed the United States 
Department of Justice to damaging allegations of professional misconduct." 
</P>
<P>
 A March 24 letter from Harris to Lynch, who has been with the Justice 
Department since 1961, states: "In view of your imminent retirement, 
outstanding career, clear acceptance of responsibility and genuine remorse for 
the mistake you made here, I do not believe further discipline is required." 
</P>
<P>
 Isgro's defense lawyer, Donald M. Re of Los Angeles, criticized the Justice 
Department's action as "a whitewash." 
</P>
<P>
 "They completely ignore specific factual findings made by Judge Ideman 
regarding Lynch's conduct. It is that specific conduct of lying to the judge 
that led to the dismissal of this case," Re said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a court hearing last December, Ideman said Lynch's "misconduct was 
extremely premeditated; it was repeated over and over again over a period of 
weeks and even months." 
</P>
<P>
 The reprimand could be significant because Isgro still faces charges including 
racketeering, mail fraud and undisclosed payola payments to radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1992, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Ideman's 
dismissal of the charges against Isgro, saying recent Supreme Court decisions 
restricted the ability of federal judges to dismiss cases because of 
prosecutorial misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court suggested that Ideman consider sanctioning in lieu of 
dismissing the case. Ideman said at a subsequent hearing that he disagreed with 
the 9th Circuit but was bound to reinstate the charges against Isgro. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in December, Ideman took other action that was almost as severe as 
dismissing the case. He ruled that in a new trial scheduled for later this year 
the government could not present any testimony from DiRicco. Moreover, Ideman 
told prosecutors they could not call any new witnesses, who might fill in 
critical holes created by DiRicco's absence. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has appealed that decision. In a brief filed last week, the 
government refers to the reprimand of Lynch in a footnote. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times was unable to reach the current lead prosecutor in the case, 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Drew Pitt. Neither his conduct nor that of anyone else in 
the Los Angeles U.S. attorney's office has been called into question. 
</P>

GOING ONCE, TWICE: GORMAN IS UP FOR GRABS; PROPERTY: IT'S A CHANCE TO OWN YOUR 
OWN TOWN, BUT SOME MIGHT CALL IT A $13.6-MILLION FIXER-UPPER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As towns go, Gorman isn't much of one. Even some of the locals will admit 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 A block away from a lonely Golden State Freeway off-ramp in the mountains 
about 65 miles north of Los Angeles, the town is anchored at one end by a 
nondescript sheriff's station and at the other -- a quarter-mile away -- by a 
Carl's Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 In between stand a motel, a small restaurant, a convenience store and a few 
shops. And there are the gas stations -- two of them on one side of the 
highway, a third on the other -- always open and willing to sell weary 
Grapevine travelers fuel or maybe a new fan belt. 
</P>
<P>
 "And just think: All of this can be yours for just $13 million," said Glenn 
Henry, smirking as he pointed out the window of his Texaco station at the top 
of Gorman Post Road, the town's main drag. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, $13.6 million, to be exact. And for good measure, the family that's 
trying to sell the town -- lock, stock and barrel -- will throw in about 3,000 
acres of grazing land and peach orchards that sometime around the turn of the 
22nd or 23rd Century could be a bedroom community of Newhall or Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the town is actually kind of cute, and the land itself is just 
beautiful," said Glen Beer, the Century City realtor who stands to make a 
handsome profit if he can find a buyer who literally wants a town to call his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 "This town won't become the next San Fernando Valley overnight," Beer said, 
"but the city is going to get here sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of years before big rigs began thundering up California 99 and its 
successor, the Golden State Freeway, the Gorman area was a resting place and 
hunting ground for Chumash and other Indians traveling through the Tehachapi 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in the 1800s, the town itself was served by the fabled 
Butterfield-Overland stage and was frequently visited by patrolling soldiers 
from nearby Fort Tejon. 
</P>
<P>
 Grocer George Ralphs, one of the founders of what is now the Ralphs chain of 
supermarkets, started buying up land in the area in the 1890s. By the early 
1900s, the Ralphs family owned virtually the entire town as well as thousands 
of surrounding acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with most of George Ralphs' descendants in their 60s and 70s, the family 
has decided to sell the town and the adjacent 2,863-acre ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time has come when most of us begin to realize that there might be other 
options," said Cecilia De Fazio, 61, a Ralphs family member who grew up in 
Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
 Word that the family is trying to sell the town was news to most of the 60 or 
so folks who pump its gas and sling its hash. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly came as a surprise to me," said Bob Lancaster, the only realtor 
based in Gorman. "I sure wish I could've got the listing." 
</P>
<P>
 But now that the locals know their town is up for sale, many of them are 
asking a logical question: Who is going to buy it? 
</P>
<P>
 "Or maybe the question should be, 'Who would want to buy it?' " said Henry, 
the Texaco owner who admits that he's no big fan of Gorman's small-town 
atmosphere. "Whoever buys this place ought to tear everything down and start 
over. It needs a lot of work." 
</P>
<P>
 Realtor Beer said Gorman's business has been hurt by the recession, which has 
cut down on the number of people who visit the area or simply stop for gas. 
More problems could come when a giant truck stop and motel open soon in Lebec, 
just a few miles to the north -- a facility so big that it will employ 250 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be hard, trying to compete with someplace that large," said 
Leslie Shishani, who works the night shift at Gorman's Caravan Motor Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 With such large developments slowly approaching, still other Gormanites worry 
that whoever buys the town might start building homes on the poppy-strewn 
hillsides nearby, or mini-malls and other commercial developments that could 
ruin what realtor Beer calls Gorman's "rustic charm." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to see us get a bunch of fast-food restaurants and stuff that 
causes a lot of traffic," said Fawzi Kayali, who runs the local Chevron station 
and lives a short drive away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived in Bakersfield for three months," he said. "So I know that living in 
a big city is no fun."

ELVIS FEVER; FANS OF THE KING FLOCK TO SEE MEMORABILIA BEING SOLD AT AUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Merchant seaman Elvis Presley McLure gaped at the blue "Good Luck" stage suit, 
circa 1972, Hawaii. Celeb Dick Clark, his beeper-bedecked, note-taking 
assistant in tow, seemed impressed by the .357 Magnum, Model 66 Smith & Wesson 
revolver with customized 14-karat gold TCB logo. Fatburger counterman Tony 
Barbieri was struck by the tree limb from Graceland, which, according to an 
auction catalogue, "mysteriously" fell to the ground during the King's 1977 
funeral. "It's like the Elvis truck stop, the Elvis yard sale," Barbieri said. 
"I mean a tree limb? They're really scrounging." 
</P>
<P>
 May 4, 1994. For some Los Angeles residents, it will be remembered as the 
one-week anniversary of Richard Nixon's funeral. For others, the day before 
Cinco de Mayo. But for the steady stream that flowed into the Butterfield & 
Butterfield auction house on Sunset Boulevard, it will go down in history as 
opening day of the public display of more than 600 Elvis-related treasures and 
trinkets that will be auctioned in Las Vegas next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of personal Elvis memorabilia collected over the years by Elvis 
Presley Museum owner Jimmy Velvet is certainly not the first of its type. With 
the larger-than-life entertainer handing out possessions ranging from cars to 
combs to carbines to his friends, family and minions, previous Southland 
auctions have included Elvis makeup cases, watches, pistols, Panteras, police 
ID cards and love letters. Indeed, two years ago, one Los Angeles TV 
memorabilia collector said he was offered plaque scraped from the King's teeth 
(circa the skinny years) by a Beverly Hills dentist. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the June 18 and 19 auction is being billed as the granddaddy of 
them all (at least to date). Officials of the international auction house, long 
known for selling art treasures but having branched out in recent years to 
celebrity items including Sammy Davis Jr.'s medallions and Liberace's 
candelabra, say the Elvis collection is worth $2 million and $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an American phenomenon, it goes along with the Kennedy thing," said Ben 
Latting, a retired Hollywood bookseller who stopped in out of curiosity after 
having breakfast down the street. "It's part of American culture, shall we say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people line up to see the 'Weeping Women of Picasso,' there'll be lines 
for this," said Latting, an opera buff, as he stood next to Elvis' signed 1973 
American Express card (estimated value $5,000 to $8,000). "This they'll never 
see again."  
</P>
<P>
 Some die-hard Elvis fans played hooky from work to make the 10 a.m. opening 
day kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to be here this morning," said 59-year-old Ventura grandmother Mary 
Cage, who skipped work at her family's swimming pool business. "Elvis had a 
great talent and he exuded sex as far as I'm concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love the Mercedes-Benz limo. I have to think of him taking hold of the 
car handle and opening it and getting into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Others on hand included direct mail merchandisers in search of dollars and 
comedians in search of material. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they opened a Church of Elvis, people would go, believe me," said Tom 
Daniel, 42, president of a firm that hawks Elvis videotapes and audiotapes on 
TV infomercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel said he had come to check for items worth buying for resale. "It's 
always a bull market for Elvis, wherever you go, they're selling Elvis items."  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many in the crowd seemed prepared to part with a hunka, hunka burning 
cash when the auction is held after the five-day Los Angeles display and 
additional previews in San Francisco, New York and London. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm nostalgic and was moved by the boat named after his mother, his bedroom 
set and his credenza. I may bid on that," said Mike Mintz, a Palos Verdes 
cemetery lot salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter and Janice Spitzer of Woodland Hills contemplated backstage passes and 
scarves. "Something in our ballpark," said Peter, who carried their 3-year-old 
granddaughter, Brittany, in his arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the strains of "(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear" and "Love Me Tender" 
in the background, the display rooms exuded the air of a courtly museum as 
Elvis fans leisurely contemplated the King's leather-bound family Bible (Lot 
No. 288, est. $2,000/$3,000), birth record (Lot. No. 158, est. $50,000/$80,000) 
and patriotic red, white and blue karate outfit (Lot No. 311, $2,000/$2,500). 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it, especially the jukebox," said Elvis Presley McLure, who legally 
changed his name seven years ago and sported a tattoo of the thin Elvis on his 
forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few viewers in a hurry was Clark, who refused to comment on Elvis, 
the auction or anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to get to a plane very quickly," Clark's aide said as the pair 
scurried between display cases crammed with guns and nautical neo-style 
personalized sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all those who came to gawk at the collectibles, others came to bury 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people in Los Angeles are interested in kitsch," said house painter 
Jerry Goldbaum, 29. "Our parents' generation collected Louis Quatorze stuff. 
For whatever reason, the self-reverential baby boomer generation is into 
collecting stuff they barely remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldbaum, wearing a leather jacket and a Boston Bruins hockey cap, accompanied 
Barbieri, whom he had met at the Sammy Davis Jr. auction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be back for the Kurt Cobain one too," Barbieri said. "I'm looking for 
something in flannel."

MAYOR ACCUSED OF UNDERMINING OFFER TO POLICE; CONTRACTS: COUNCIL MEMBERS SAY 
RIORDAN FAILED TO HOLD LINE THAT LATEST PROPOSAL WAS CITY'S LAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Three Los Angeles City Council members sharply criticized Mayor Richard 
Riordan on Wednesday, saying he has potentially prolonged contract talks with 
the police union by releasing a statement that suggests the city is flexible in 
its bargaining stance. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said in a prepared statement that he was "looking for a responsible 
counteroffer" from police officers, just a day after the City Council made what 
it called its last, best offer Tuesday to settle a nearly 2-year-old contract 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Three council members who led negotiations with the union said they were 
startled and dismayed by Riordan's statement because they believed he had 
agreed that the city's final proposal was already on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you make your last and final offer, you keep your mouth shut," said City 
Council President John Ferraro. "We didn't (all) keep our mouths shut." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said her "heart sank" when she read the comments. 
"I think it will make things more complicated and more difficult. If the Police 
Protective League thinks (Riordan) has a role on his own, they will try to deal 
with the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides saying he expected a counteroffer, Riordan also stated that he hoped 
the police union would accept the city's "generous offer, or something close to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members took this as another sign of equivocation, but Riordan aides 
denied that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor is not saying anything new," insisted spokesman David Novak. "He is 
not saying there is a new offer. He is just saying . . . we are willing to 
listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Novak added later: "The mayor stands behind the city's offer as the best and 
final contract offer." 
</P>
<P>
 The 7,500-member Police Protective League and city have been locked in a 
bitter contract dispute for nearly two years. During that time, officers have 
marched on City Hall, staged a mass sickout and, finally, posted controversial 
billboards that depicted a woman being carjacked. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council in the last month made its first formal offer of a pay raise. 
On Tuesday, lawmakers refined the proposal to include a 3% pay raise this year 
and next year and a one-time 2% bonus for patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Just hours after the offer was made, however, delegates from the Police 
Department's 18 divisions cast a unanimous vote against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers objected to a proposed delay, from July until October, in 
implementing the raises, saying it would effectively reduce the increases to 
2.25% annually. And officers continue to oppose work rule changes that would 
make it easier for management to reassign detectives and sergeants. 
</P>
<P>
 League President Danny Staggs said he believes that Riordan is "willing to be 
flexible" and that the union is "much better off" negotiating through him than 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe some of the City Council members are just posturing and trying to 
look like fiscal saviors of the city for their own gain," Staggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The police union planned to present Riordan with a counteroffer late Wednesday 
or early today, asking him to forward it to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, Ferraro and Goldberg said, however, that the union 
should not forget that the City Charter gives the council the power to make 
contracts with employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The three council members said Riordan had agreed that the offer should be the 
city's last when they met in a negotiation strategy session last week. 
</P>
<P>
 When the full City Council affirmed the proposal Tuesday and presented it to 
the police union, council members believed Riordan was solidly in line. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riordan's statements Wednesday made the city lawmakers doubt his resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro, a close ally of Riordan, was surprised that the mayor's statement did 
not jibe with the council's tougher position. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor was in the meeting when the agreement was made and he never changed 
it," said Ferraro. "I don't know what this statement is about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you look at the rules, you see that the City Council makes the 
final decisions," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said it is "critical that the council and mayor speak with one 
voice, or else we give the wrong impression." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg said: "The problem with the mayor's statement is it sounds like (the 
contract offer) isn't as far as we are going to go. As long as you raise 
someone's expectations, there is no reason for them to settle." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan predicted Wednesday morning at a meeting in the San Fernando Valley 
that the police contract will be settled soon. Novak said the dispute had done 
nothing to change that prediction.

SUPERVISORS TO VOTE ON HALTING SERVICES AT CITY, STATE BEACHES; SPENDING: 
COUNTY CALLS FOR OTHERS TO SHARE EXPENSES FOR LIFEGUARDS AND MAINTENANCE. 
CRITICS SAY PUBLIC SAFETY WOULD BE JEOPARDIZED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County supervisors are about to decide whether to relinquish 
maintenance and lifeguard operations at dozens of city- and state-owned 
beaches, an action that opponents say could jeopardize public safety and have a 
devastating impact on one of Southern California's most important recreational 
and tourist resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors will decide today whether to discontinue services at 
seven state beaches -- including Malibu and Manhattan -- as early as this month 
and whether to send one-year termination notices to cities including Los 
Angeles, Santa Monica and Hermosa Beach to end operations at some of the most 
popular beaches in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The cash-strapped county insists that the state and cities must significantly 
increase their share of beach-related costs. Many local officials are just as 
adamant in arguing that beaches are used by residents throughout the county and 
are a regional responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the middle are lifeguards and, some say, the people who visit local 
beaches, as 60 million did last year. Of that number, there were more than 
10,000 rescues and only two drownings. Those opposed to the county proposal 
contend that the number of drownings is likely to rise if the county withdraws 
its centralized oversight and local jurisdictions must provide their own 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Many beach supporters say it would be disastrous to return to the days when 
city, county and state lifeguards might patrol the beaches within yards of one 
another in an uncoordinated system that left authorities and residents 
confused. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be an intolerable situation that we can't live with," said Don 
Knabe, chief deputy to Supervisor Deane Dana.  
</P>
<P>
 There is also a concern that neither the state nor cities would be able to 
maintain the same staffing levels among lifeguards and maintenance crews and 
that the quality of experience and expertise might fall. 
</P>
<P>
 State lifeguards, for example, mostly patrol rural beaches and are unused to 
the demands and tensions of an urban population, local officials say. Also, 
unlike state and city lifeguards, all county lifeguards are trained emergency 
medical technicians and are part of the 911 emergency system. 
</P>
<P>
 John Duggan, an administrative analyst with the city of Los Angeles, said city 
officials have not decided what they will do if the county terminates its 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The city contracts with the county to provide services at city-owned Cabrillo 
and Venice beaches as well as the state-owned Dockweiler and Will Rogers 
beaches, at an annual cost of about $8 million. More than half of the costs are 
recouped by the county through beach parking and concession fees. But the 
county contributes about $3.7 million in general funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The county funds about 85% of the $5.2 million it costs to provide services at 
seven state-owned beaches, including Las Tunas, Point Dume, Dan Blocker and 
Malibu and 98% of the $1.4 million it costs to service city-owned Hermosa 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles, other cities and the state have made few offers to reduce the 
county's burden. 
</P>
<P>
 "The City Council has indicated that these are regional facilities that have 
an attraction far beyond Los Angeles and that it is not inappropriate to have 
the county tax base make a contribution," Duggan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other city officials argue that their residents already pay more than their 
share in taxes and other subsidies to support beach services. But county 
officials, faced with a continuing fiscal crisis, say a better arrangement must 
be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should try in every way we can to keep the present system going, but at 
the same time we need to have the cities come to the table with the idea that 
they have to make a greater contribution," Supervisor Ed Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all sides agree that Los Angeles County has developed a level of 
service that has made Southern California beaches among the safest in the 
world. The county's 109 lifeguards patrol 19 beaches, which cover 879 acres 
along 71 miles of coastline from San Pedro to Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county severs its contract with the state, 50 of the lifeguards would 
be laid off, said Jim Boulgarides, secretary of the Los Angeles County 
Lifeguards Assn. The group held a news conference Wednesday afternoon to decry 
the county's possible action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously it is the public who loses the most in this situation," Boulgarides 
said. "I can't say we're going to have hundreds of more people drowning but my 
gut feeling is there are going to be more drownings. Even if you have eight or 
nine drownings a year that's a lot of suffering."

GOP LEADERS TO ASK ROGAN FOES TO QUIT RACE; 43RD DISTRICT: OFFICIALS WILL URGE 
TWO RIVALS OF THE NEW ASSEMBLYMAN TO ABANDON THE JUNE PRIMARY. PETER REPOVICH 
SAYS HE'S IN IT TO STAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Municipal Judge James Rogan, elected to the Assembly only hours earlier in a 
special election, was joined by powerful Republican Party allies Wednesday in 
an attempt to persuade two GOP rivals to drop out of the race for the next 
two-year term for the 43rd District Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources in Los Angeles and Sacramento, GOP Assembly Leader Jim 
Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga will urge Julia Wu and Peter Repovich to bow out of 
the June 7 GOP primary, now that Rogan will be the Republican incumbent on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 But that effort will apparently be wasted on Repovich, a Los Angeles Police 
Department officer who has raised a $300,000 war chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Repovich said Wednesday that he plans to go the distance. "I'm worried about 
this seat going to the Democrats if we Republicans field a candidate like Jim 
Rogan," Repovich said, launching a campaign to paint Rogan as too conservative. 
Wu could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Rogan, who received campaign contributions from wealthy Christian 
conservatives, surprised himself and pundits by winning 53.9% of the vote in a 
seven-candidate race to fill the seat left vacant by the resignation of 
Assemblyman Pat Nolan. Nolan pleaded guilty Feb 18 to one count of political 
racketeering and is now in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Many had expected Tuesday's voting to be indecisive with no candidate getting 
a majority and the replacement process thus requiring yet another election on 
June 28 between the top vote-getters from each party. 
</P>
<P>
 But due in part to a relatively strong Republican turnout in his Glendale 
base, Rogan surprised the handicappers and on Tuesday won the job of filling 
out the remainder of Nolan's term, which expires Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's victory does not end Rogan's political odyssey. On June 7, the 
primary election will be held to fill the new two-year term for the 43rd 
District seat that begins after Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Set to run in that GOP primary against Rogan are Wu, a prominent 
Asian-American activist and a member of the Los Angeles Community College board 
of trustees, and Repovich, a community relations officer in the LAPD's 
Hollywood Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously I'd be delighted if the others agreed to get behind me," Rogan said 
Wednesday. "But right now I'm not focused on that. For the last few weeks I've 
been a full-time campaigner. Now I'm ready to be a full-time legislator." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Rogan's win Tuesday prompted the GOP leadership to begin the process of 
trying to unify the party around its newfound incumbent. "If not Brulte, 
someone else in the leadership will make the calls to Wu and Repovich urging 
them to step down," said Brulte spokesman Phil Perry. "Now that we've got an 
incumbent, the leadership will go all out for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the party spoke about the need for the GOP to rally behind Rogan and 
not engage in a costly and divisive June 7 primary battle at a time when 
Democrats are talking about the possibility of capturing the 43rd District. 
</P>
<P>
 Long a bastion of Republicanism, the political dynamics of the district have 
been altered by Nolan's resignation, changing demographics and the 1990 
reapportionment plan.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Wu was persuaded by Brulte not to run against Nolan, when 
it appeared that the incumbent would seek reelection even as he fought the 
criminal charges that sent him to prison. At that time, Brulte failed to 
persuade Repovich not to enter the race against Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
 Some sources in the GOP said they expected Wu again to defer to the party 
leaders and suspend her campaign. Her campaign manager, Jot Condie, said 
Wednesday that he expected his client to wait a few days to make a decision. 
"Clearly, the (Tuesday poll) results were disappointing," Condie said. Wu got 
only 10.6% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Repovich, meanwhile, was unswerving. Rogan's ties to the "Christian right" and 
to the antiabortion movement may drag the party to defeat in a race against a 
middle-of-the-road Democrat, Repovich argued Wednesday. Repovich is a supporter 
of abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Kall, his spokesperson, said that the 14% voter turnout in Tuesday's 
election was not a good barometer of the sentiments of Republican voters. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, both Wu and Repovich will be on the ballot regardless of the 
success of Brulte's diplomacy. "What we'd be doing is asking them to drop their 
campaigning," said Perry. "We don't have anything to offer them but the 
gratitude of the party and its leadership."  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Adam Schiff, the main Democrat in Tuesday's race, who scored 25.6% 
of the vote and finished second, said Rogan's showing Tuesday and sudden 
incumbency do not faze his game plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's on to November -- we saw this race (the May 3 election) all along as 
just a skirmish," Schiff said. "The big battle will be in November and it will 
be a very different election then." 
</P>
<P>
 In November, for example, the Schiff camp is counting on help from the leaders 
on the Democratic Party's state ticket who are running for governor and U.S. 
senator to get out the vote so that Tuesday's results -- where the Republican 
turnout in Glendale appeared to dominate the returns -- won't be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale has about 40% of the registered voters in the 43rd District, with 
Burbank and the Los Feliz and Silver Lake areas sharing the rest about equally. 
According to Election Day observers, the turnout in Glendale was running 20% 
compared to rates of only about half that in Silver Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbency and the GOP leadership support that comes with it should strengthen 
Rogan's fund-raising abilities, Schiff acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, by having to vote on issues in Sacramento, we'll see some 
of his true colors come out and that could hurt him," Schiff said. Schiff's 
campaign manager, Parke Skelton, has previously indicated that he would like to 
see his client stacked up against an antiabortion conservative Republican in 
the general election. SOUTHLAND ELECTION

CHIEF DEFENDS LAPD AMID CRITICISM OVER REPORTS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: WILLIAMS SAYS 
VALLEY DOCUMENTS THAT SUGGESTED POLICE SHOULD TARGET MINORITY MEN DIDN'T HAVE 
APPROVAL OF MANAGEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Appearing before the Los Angeles City Council, Police Chief Willie Williams 
defended his department Wednesday against a storm of criticism over a series of 
department crime documents, including one that suggests police stop and 
question more black and Latino men. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports, which include statistics on violent crime gathered during the 
past year, sparked criticism in City Hall and elsewhere in recent weeks partly 
because of the Los Angeles Police Department's initial unwillingness to release 
them publicly. Beginning last week, the LAPD has been gradually releasing the 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest furor of all arose over a seven-paragraph section in the crime 
report for the North Hollywood Division, which suggests that police should 
target black and Latino men because demographic information indicates that they 
are responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he was concerned about the passages regarding race but stressed 
that the document that included that recommendation, which was leaked to 
newspapers, was only a draft report and did not have the approval of the LAPD 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 The department does not support a tactic of targeting crime based on race, he 
said, adding that he has been working to change the attitudes among those 
police officers who do believe in such a tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it policy? Absolutely not," he said. "No ifs, ands or buts." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, several council members told Williams that they were disturbed 
that any members of the LAPD leadership would suggest targeting suspects based 
on race. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg called the North Hollywood report a "very scary 
document" and urged the chief to concentrate on changing the perceptions of 
LAPD officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm satisfied that this doesn't represent the views of the Police 
Department," she said in an interview, "but I'm unhappy that this is the 
mentality of whoever was asked to author it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Hernandez agreed. "This tells me that we may have some 
leadership in that division who feel this way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview after the meeting, Williams declined to name the authors of 
the challenged report or to release their rank. He said that as chief he would 
take responsibility for the controversy they created. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft report on crime in North Hollywood includes a section titled 
"Suspect/Victim Demographics." It states that based on demographic information 
and the 1990 census "it becomes apparent that two groups are responsible for a 
larger amount of violent crime than should be expected by their representation 
in the community. These two groups are Black and Hispanic. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The report also says that males "disproportionately participate in violent 
crimes 95% of the time. Females represent the other 5% of the violent crime 
suspects." 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be concluded that, because of the disproportionate share of criminal 
activity being generated by two segments of our population and one sexual 
category, there should be an equivalent increase in the proportional activity 
of law enforcement activity within those two populations," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The section concludes saying "field interview cards" should show police 
stopping and questioning more people within the "above two descent groups and 
the sexual category within the North Hollywood area." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams appeared before the council to discuss the reports at the request of 
Councilwoman Laura Chick, who said she was concerned that the crime reports 
were leaked to the media before council members even knew that such documents 
were being prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a dialogue that we should have had weeks ago," she told Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials initially refused requests by local media to release the 
reports, saying they include sensitive information about deployment tactics and 
crime-fighting strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky echoed the sentiments of several council 
members when he introduced a formal motion, requiring the LAPD to release the 
reports. The motion, which has not been brought before the entire council, 
would allow the department to edit out sensitive information. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unedited versions of the crime reports, one for each of 18 divisions 
throughout the city, were reviewed last Thursday by The Times. Edited versions 
have been gradually released, beginning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports identify dozens of pockets of violent crime in the city and 
recommend an array of suggestions for cleaning up the problem areas. The 
documents also include information on the number of liquor stores and parolees 
in a community to determine if those factors affect the overall crime problem 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The edited final reports do not include the recommendations to stop and 
question minority men.

MONEY-MAKING CONCESSIONS WEIGHED FOR VALLEY PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In search of additional revenues for the cash-strapped Los Angeles Recreation 
and Parks Department, city officials began Wednesday to consider new 
money-making concessions for city parks, including food outlets, golf courses 
and batting cages at San Fernando Valley parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the largest concessions proposed to the Recreation and Parks Commission 
were water slides for the Hansen Dam Recreation Area, a go-cart race track at 
North Hollywood Park and two executive golf courses at the Chatsworth 
Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson and several environmental groups were quick to 
criticize proposed plans for the 1,300-acre Chatsworth Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 At the commission meeting, during which no formal action was taken, the 
reservoir was described as a "very important piece of wildlife habitat" by 
Muriel S. Kotin, San Fernando Valley Audubon Society president. "To develop it 
would be absolutely the wrong thing to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Ireland, president of the Coalition to Save the Sepulveda Basin, agreed. 
"I ask you not to go forward with this," he told the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson, whose district includes the reservoir, said in an interview before 
the meeting that he will fight any development plans because he wants to 
preserve land at the reservoir for hiking and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will never happen while I'm here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson said the reservoir is also a crucial stopping-off point for migrating 
Canada geese. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically one of the last open spaces we have left," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But another Valley councilman, Richard Alarcon, said he is eager to consider 
ideas for concessions in his district, including the water slides and a 
recreational vehicle park for Hansen Dam. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has scheduled five community meetings in his district to allow 
residents to discuss the ideas. The first meeting took place Wednesday in Lake 
View Terrace. The next will be at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Sylmar Recreation 
Center, 13109 Borden Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I'm very excited," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recreation officials stressed that before any of the proposals are adopted, 
public hearings will be held in communities surrounding parks where the 
concessions are proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The concession ideas were drafted by Recreation and Parks Department staff in 
response to a request by commissioners who wanted to find more ways to squeeze 
money out of the parks, department Manager Jackie Tatum said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the department will not move ahead with any of the ideas until the 
commission decides to look more closely at the options. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, this is just an informational item," Tatum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tatum said she could not guess how many concessions may be approved or how 
much money they may generate. But she said current concessions in city parks 
generate about $23 million for the department's $89-million annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commission is just trying to be proactive in funding our department," 
Tatum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan's proposed budget for the next fiscal year calls for a 
cut of $2.8 million in the department's budget and 90 positions over the 
current year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a situation that exists and what we are trying to do is to be 
practical about it," Tatum said. Proposed Concessions In the San Fernando 
Valley, the parks and concessions proposed in the report are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Hansen Dam Recreation Area in Lake View Terrace -- a recreation vehicle 
park, nine-hole miniature golf course and water slide. 
</P>
<P>
 * North Hollywood Park next to the North Hollywood police station -- a go-cart 
race track, video arcade and food concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chatsworth Reservoir -- two nine-hole golf courses, restaurants, a driving 
range, family entertainment center and 18-hole putting course. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also suggests allowing mobile food concessions at Van Nuys-Sherman 
Oaks Park in Sherman Oaks, Valley Plaza Park in North Hollywood, Woodland Hills 
Recreation Center, North Hollywood Park and Northridge Recreation Center.

OFFICIALS HOPE DROP IN SMOG CONTINUES; ENVIRONMENT: COUNTY AIR DISTRICT, TRYING 
TO MEET A FEDERAL DEADLINE, CITES TREND OF FEWER UNHEALTHFUL DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the air pollution season begins in Ventura County this week, authorities 
are hoping the dramatic drop in smoggy days during recent years will continue, 
making clean air attainable by the target year of 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 While unfavorable weather this year could still send ozone levels climbing, 
especially in pollution-prone Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and Ojai, officials 
point to a long-term trend of fewer unhealthful days. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's air pollution levels violated the federal health standard for 
ozone on 122 days in 1974, 45 days in 1984 and only 13 days in 1993, said 
William Mount, deputy air pollution control officer in Ventura County. In 
addition, he said, peak ozone levels dropped by 42% during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trend over the long term is unmistakably down, and clearly that is 
because emissions have been reduced," Mount said. "That's progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the federal Clean Air Act, the county has until 2005 to reduce the 
number of days considered unhealthful to no more than three in a three-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, May through October is considered the period most prone to 
smog, which develops when emissions from cars and industry mix in sunlight to 
produce ozone. Hot, sunny days when winds are light are typically the worst, as 
pollutants are trapped near the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Inland valleys -- such as Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and the Ojai Valley -- 
are most susceptible to high levels of ozone. Coastal areas usually have low 
levels because ocean breezes blow smog inland. 
</P>
<P>
 A nearly invisible gas, ozone damages lungs and aggravates respiratory 
illnesses. The chronically ill and elderly are advised to stay indoors when the 
Ventura County Air Pollution Control District predicts high ozone levels. 
</P>
<P>
 With last month's unusual weather pattern, district meteorologist Kent Field 
said it is impossible to tell what the smog season will bring this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen a lot of low clouds and fog in April, and we usually don't get 
that until mid-May," he said. "So whether it will be a hot summer with a lot of 
ozone or a cool and cloudy one, it's hard to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with reductions in pollution, the county is still designated by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency as a region with a "severe" air-quality 
problem, a category surpassed only by the "extreme" rating assigned to the Los 
Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The severe rating in Ventura County has prompted intervention by the EPA, 
which is drawing up a Federal Implementation Plan with stiff control measures 
to further rid the air of ozone. Unlike the local air district, the EPA can 
regulate emissions from pesticides, cars, commercial trucks, trains, planes and 
boats. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's draft plan contains several proposed pollution control measures 
that industry has attacked as economically devastating. Among them is a 
proposal to require industry to reduce emissions by 25% by 2005, regardless of 
whether the business has already cut emissions by installing modern pollution 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Air Pollution Control District, which will issue its own 
10-year blueprint for smog reduction in November, is working with local 
business and industry groups to determine which local and federal measures they 
could most easily accept. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to build consensus," Mount said. "We're working to come up with 
a combination of federal and local controls to minimize the economic impacts 
and still meet the goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Charney, a lawyer who is president of the Ventura County Economic 
Development Assn., praised district officials for working with industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Air Pollution Control District recognizes that many of the measures 
proposed in the Federal Implementation Plan just won't work here, and that the 
results could be disastrous to the community," he said. "They could also be 
impossible or very difficult for the APCD to enforce." 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA will hold public hearings on its plan in July. The Ventura County 
district is scheduled to issue its draft plan in November. Cleaner Air Air 
pollution in Ventura County has decreased dramatically in recent years, as 
evidenced by the number of days the county's air violated federal health 
standards for ozone. 02,06,19 Number of days Year standard exceeded 1984 45 
1985 44 1986 59 1987 31 1988 55 1989 46 1990 18 1991 33 1992 10 1993 13 Source:

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; GROUP SEEKS TO FIGHT CITY'S SMOKING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of smokers' rights advocates opposed to Camarillo's recently adopted 
smoking ordinance is preparing to distribute petitions seeking to place the new 
law before city voters during November's municipal election. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pat Johnson, owner of Lil' Bit O' Country on Daily Drive and a 
spokeswoman for the group, the petition forms were being finished at a local 
printing company Wednesday.She said they should be ready for the group by 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are ready to go with this," Johnson said. "We feel this is a 
personal-rights issue and that the City Council far overstepped its authority 
in passing this ordinance. We're hoping to start the drive this Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 At its meeting last Wednesday, the council voted 3 to 2 to approve the 
ordinance, which largely bans smoking in restaurants and public places. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo City Clerk Marilyn Thiel said the group must collect at least 2,937 
signatures, or 10% of the city's registered voters to place a referendum on the 
ballot. If the group is successful, the City Council would first have 30 days 
to rescind the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Thiel said the group has until May 27 to collect the required number of 
signatures. Otherwise, the council's ordinance will become law on that date.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; HOMELESS 
ADVOCATES STILL OCCUPYING STRUCTURE

 Homeless advocates, who illegally seized a vacant government-owned duplex in 
Los Angeles and set up a shelter for four homeless people, continued to occupy 
the structure Wednesday, pending negotiations with Housing and Urban 
Development officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the California Homeless Network, who orchestrated the break-in 
Monday, say they plan to stay at the 17th Place duplex until they can reach an 
agreement with government officials to legally take over the structure.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; NAVY TO DEDICATE NEW LABORATORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Navy is scheduled to dedicate a new national laboratory at the Naval 
Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme today that will develop and test 
new technologies to clean up toxic waste sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the U. S. departments of defense and energy and the Navy, the 
facility, to be known as the National Environmental Technology Demonstration 
Test Site, will be the first of its kind in the nation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Rear Adm. David J. Nash, the Seabee base's commanding officer, 
successful technologies developed at the site will be applied to contaminated 
federal lands and then will be made available to private industry for use on 
non-federal lands. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program supports President Clinton's goal to use federal facilities to 
aid the development of innovative cleanup technologies, stimulate high-tech 
environmental job opportunities and speed cleanup of Department of Defense 
facilities," Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the first demonstration at the site will involve special 
biological organisms that will be used to clean tainted soil excavated during 
removal of underground fuel tanks at the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the public are invited to attend the dedication ceremonies, which 
will begin at 2 p.m. Those wishing to attend should enter the base through the

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; VOLUNTEERS SOUGHT TO FIGHT STUBBORN WEED

 The Ventura Audubon Society is organizing a volunteer brigade to clear out one 
of the most virulent weeds taking hold in the Ventura River estuary, the 
bamboo-like Arundo donax. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a particularly pernicious kind of plant," said Bobbe Dorsey, who is 
helping organize the effort."It will sprout from any joint or any part of the 
plant." 
</P>
<P>
 The thick reed, which grows along the riverbed and banks, must be cut low to 
the ground and painted with a herbicide. It must then be checked and repainted 
until it dies. The Audubon Society envisions an ongoing project through the 
summer to control the weed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is very pressed for funds and, of course, this is 
manpower-intensive," Dorsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer effort would augment a push by public and private agencies to 
rid the estuary of non-native plants and replant the natural vegetation. The 
California Coastal Conservancy expects to provide $400,000 for the effort in 
June, with matching funds coming from city and state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers interested in working with the Audubon Society can call Dorsey at 
643-1041. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CHIEF DEPUTY FOR WEST COUNTY NAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County Sheriff Larry Carpenter has promoted a 21-year veteran of the 
department to head its West County police operations at the rank of chief 
deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter appointed Cmdr.Kenneth Kipp, formerly chief of sheriff's deputies 
for the city of Ojai, to be chief deputy in charge of all sheriff's operations 
in the western half of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Kipp, who now runs the County Jail in Ventura, will oversee patrol, 
detectives, the crime lab, search-and-rescue unit and all other police 
operations west of the Conejo Grade, said Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent some time and careful consideration, and there was a number of 
qualified individuals at the command level," who sought the chief deputy job, 
Carpenter said. "Kenny had prepared himself well. He's well-educated, and he's 
got a wealth of experience in the various areas of the department, and he's a 
very proactive individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Kipp, a third-generation Ventura County resident who lives in east Ventura 
with his wife and son, graduated from Cal State Fresno in 1973 with a bachelor 
of science degree in criminology and has earned master's degrees in public 
administration and management. 
</P>
<P>
 He will fill the vacancy left by former Chief Deputy Oscar Fuller, who retired 
in March. MACK REED

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; PLAN TO PRIVATIZE FESTIVAL DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to privatize the California Strawberry Festival by next year was 
stalled this week when members of the committee organizing the annual event 
were not present to address the Oxnard City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would allow the city-funded California Strawberry Festival 
committee, which has organized the event for several years, to form a private 
corporation to administer the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is recommended for approval by James Faulconer, the city's recreation 
and community services director. 
</P>
<P>
 Although scheduled Tuesday on the council's consent agenda, which typically is 
reserved for non-controversial items, festival committee members had sought to 
address the council before the plan is considered. 
</P>
<P>
 The council rescheduled the matter to its May 17 meeting. JEFF McDONALD

BOARD OKS MOVE TO LEADERSHIP BY CLUSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Board of Education unanimously approved a restructuring plan 
that will eliminate layers of the district's central bureaucracy and shift 
decision making to clusters of high schools and their feeder campuses.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, to take effect in July, the district will be divided into 27 
independent clusters, governed by groups of teachers, administrators, parents, 
community members and school staff, and managed by "cluster leaders" appointed 
by the superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 The restructuring effort will cost approximately $7 million, which will come 
from funds now being spent on central and regional administration.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; O.C. CRIME SUMMIT ATTRACTS 250 OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Crime Summit, held Wednesday at Cal State Fullerton, gave 
local law enforcement officials, government leaders, judges and educators an 
opportunity to discuss some creative solutions to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The session drew more than 250 participants, including state Sen. Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, Supervisor Gaddi H. 
Vasquez and several police chiefs and judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the topics discussed: gang suppression techniques in Westminster; the 
concept of community policing used in Santa Ana and Garden Grove; the efforts 
of a county graffiti task force, and some of the Probation Department's 
solutions to juvenile crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kinds of conferences play a big role in helping an idea or a concept 
gain momentum and getting other cities on board," said Garden Grove Police 
Chief Stanley L. Knee, who championed community policing at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Community policing, a concept which places an emphasis on crime prevention 
over arrests and places police officers on neighborhood beats, was also being 
touted by Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters, a nationally recognized 
expert on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's phenomenal the success that we have had," said Walters. "Over 20 years, 
we've evolved, refined our methods and changed the way we do things in our 
community. If you don't include problem solving and crime prevention, then you 
are on an endless treadmill and you can't get off." 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster Police Chief James Cook talked about the sharp decline in gang 
activity since his city launched the gang enforcement program called TARGET, 
which involves teaming local police officers with prosecutors and probation 
officers in an effort to build criminal cases against hardened gang leaders in 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the impact on gang crime has been dramatic," Cook said. "We are 
making the community safer." 
</P>
<P>
 The event's keynote speaker, Orange County Superior Court Judge James P. Gray, 
discussed his proposal for a thorough review of the nation's drug laws. The 
judge repeated his controversial proposal to "decriminalize" the use of heroin, 
cocaine and marijuana, drugs that he suggests should be made available through 
"regulated distribution." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray has come under sharp attack from community leaders since he began 
publicizing his ideas on drug policies in 1992, but he was quick to defend his 
proposals at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It only makes sense for an intelligent society to investigate our options," 
Gray said. "What we've been trying to do is to repeal the economics of supply 
and demand. We've made cocaine the most lucrative crop in the history of man 
because it's been made illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray, who said he does not condone the use of drugs, said the legal 
distribution of some narcotics would take away the profit motive for dealers 
and reduce crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's comments drew little reaction from the audience. But Garden 
Grove's Chief Knee said afterward that the judge "is a frustrated member of the 
judiciary who in his frustration perhaps seeks an easy or quick solution to a 
problem that is very complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you went to the drug store you couldn't buy penicillin over the counter, 
so it seems unrealistic that you could buy heroin off of the shelf like a pack 
of gum," Knee said. "We restrict use of medicines to restrict their abuse."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; 6,000 HEAR KOOP RX ON HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Managed competition. Fee for service. Single-payer. 
</P>
<P>
 The mind-boggling jargon being bandied about in the national health care 
debate is pretty much Greek to 75-year-old Evelyn Navelski. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to get a better understanding of the issues, Navelski and 6,000 other, 
mostly older people turned out for a speech by former Surgeon General C. 
Everett Koop at the American Assn. of Retired Persons convention Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Koop was among a number of panelists to address health care reform during the 
second day of the convention. But after the speech, Navelski, a resident of 
South Laguna Beach, said she felt no more enlightened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all so complicated," she said. "You worry about whether under the new 
plan you'll be able to keep your same doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking before a packed house, Koop blasted the "tyranny" of the current 
health care system and urged Americans to demand that their elected leaders put 
health concerns above politics in the debate over reform.  
</P>
<P>
 "We should demand no less from our Congress, no less from our President. We 
need to stretch our vision of health care reform to match our vision of a 
healthy society," Koop said, eliciting thunderous applause from the crowd of 
people, the vast majority of whom were over 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Koop limited his comments for the most part to the Clinton plan, one of six 
health care proposals under serious consideration by Congress. However, he 
said, older people would fare well under any of the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of all the groups of people, you have the best deal," Koop said. 
</P>
<P>
 Health care reform was a major theme of a day that also included an appearance 
by Fernando Gil-Torres, an assistant secretary for aging with the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Many at the convention said they are satisfied with their insurance benefits 
and don't want anyone tinkering with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have is working. If it's not broken, don't fix it," said Estella 
Hill, a 72-year-old retiree from Pittsburgh, Pa., who recently underwent 
cataract surgery that was entirely covered by her insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to deny insurance to those who don't have it, but for those of 
us who do, they should leave it alone," she said. "I don't buy any of this pie 
in the sky." 
</P>
<P>
 James Smith, 80, a retired businessman from Los Angeles, says he too is 
skeptical of reform plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want them fooling around and I get stuck having to pay for my heart 
pills," said Smith, whose policy pays for his costly medication. 
</P>
<P>
 The AARP leadership strongly supports the theory of health care reform but has 
not endorsed any of the competing proposals offered by federal lawmakers. 
However, the influential lobbying organization for senior citizens has gone on 
record as saying the Clinton plan is the most attractive because it would add 
prescription benefits and long-term care to Medicare coverage. TAMMERLIN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; COLLEGE DISTRICT SUED OVER ADULT CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange Unified School District has filed suit to wrest control of 
adult-education classes from the Rancho Santiago Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed last Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court, is part of a feud 
between the districts over which is best suited to provide the classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit demands that the community college district rescind its decision to 
offer certain adult-education classes beginning in the 1994-95 school year and 
transfer those programs to Orange Unified. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Unified officials allege that the community college is providing 
classes and recouping state dollars without the formal mutual agreement 
required by the state education code. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials of the community college district said Wednesday that Orange 
Unified trustees and school district officials have repeatedly postponed and 
canceled meetings to discuss the mutual agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Vivian Blevins blasted the lawsuit and said Orange Unified 
officials are motivated by financial rather than educational reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 She said transferring the classes to the Orange Unified School District would 
cost taxpayers about $715,000 more because the state reimburses school 
districts at a higher rate than college districts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tom Schrodi, director of instructional services for the Orange district, 
disputed that figure. He said that college district classes actually cost more 
to provide because the college receives money for maintenance and other 
student-related costs that the Orange district does not. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the main reason Orange Unified wants to provide the adult-education 
classes is that the college district does not offer enough classes to 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Blevins said the college would fight the suit. She said community colleges are 
designed to educate adults while school districts are designed to educate 
kindergarten through 12th-grade students. She said the college serves about 
9,000 adult students each semester and receives about $3.5 million from the 
state, Blevins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Orange County Community College District is also named as a 
defendant in the suit. That district was sued by the Anaheim Union High School 
District and the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District. JON NALICK

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CHIEF 
INSISTS ETHNICITY NOT USED IN STOPPING SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Appearing before the Los Angeles City Council, Police Chief Willie L. Williams 
defended his department Wednesday against a storm of criticism over a series of 
crime documents, including one that suggests police stop and question more 
black and Latino men. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports, which include statistics on violent crime gathered during the 
past year, sparked criticism in City Hall and elsewhere in recent weeks partly 
because of the LAPD's initial unwillingness to release them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest furor arose over a seven-paragraph section of the report for 
the North Hollywood Division, which suggests that police should target black 
and Latino men because demographic information indicates they are responsible 
for a disproportionate amount of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he was concerned about the passages regarding race but stressed 
that the document including that recommendation was only a draft report that 
was leaked to the media and did not have the approval of LAPD management. 
</P>
<P>
 The department does not support a tactic of targeting suspects based on 
ethnicity, he said, adding that he has been working to change the attitudes of 
officers who believe in such tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it policy? Absolutely not," he said. "No ifs, ands or buts."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: STUDENTS GET CREATIVE LESSON IN AZTEC HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First-grader Hector Gamiz didn't know the meaning of the intricate designs 
decorating his T-shirt until he met Montezuma, the last Aztec emperor of 
Mexico, on Wednesday at Forest Lawn-Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Montezuma, played by actor Fabian Gregory Cordova, described the foods ancient 
Mexicans ate, the gods they worshiped and the monuments they built as he led 
about 25 Southland school children on a tour of the outdoor Plaza of Mexican 
Heritage at the cemetery.  
</P>
<P>
 The annual tour coincides with the Mexican national holiday of Cinco de Mayo 
celebrated today to commemorate the Battle of Puebla in which ragtag Mexican 
warriors, outnumbered three to one, defeated the French Army on May 5, 1862. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordova, who wore an elaborate feather headdress, a beaded loincloth and a 
gold cape, called Hector, 6, to the front of a group of Toluca Lake School 
students and told the youngster his shirt was a representation of a large stone 
Aztec calendar -- shown in a sculpture at the end of the outdoor plaza.  
</P>
<P>
 The god of the sun is featured in the center of the calendar, Cordova told 
students, and has a tongue shaped like a dagger to show he welcomed human 
sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 After the presentation, Hector, who was born in Mexico City, proudly pointed 
to the inside of the Aztec calendar on his shirt and said, "This is the god of 
the sun and he's mean." 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which also featured a walk through of a museum of Mexican history 
and a film, "Sentinels of Silence," gives students -- many of whom have parents 
or grandparents from Mexico -- a taste of Mexican history, said J. Carol Winn, 
education affairs director at Forest Lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a little bit about Cinco de Mayo," said Thomas Martinez, 6, "but 
nothing about this stuff." Thomas, a first-grader at Toluca Lake School, said 
his father was born in Mexico City and has taken him to visit relatives there. 
</P>
<P>
 Julianna Bentes, a sixth-grader at the Children's Community School in Van 
Nuys, said today's civilizations can learn from ancient Mexican peoples who 
struggled to overcome famine, disease and war. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to learn about other cultures to improve our own -- we can 
learn from their mistakes," Julianna said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,900 Southern California students were scheduled to participate in 
the presentations, which will also be held this morning at the cemetery.

 Ending a sideshow controversy to one of the biggest land disputes in Los 
Angeles County history, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy has named 
parkland once slated for the Canyon Oaks development after a local lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy named 257 hillside acres known as Summit Valley, which until 
recently was proposed for luxury homes and a golf course, after Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Edmund D. Edelman, who engineered a last-minute deal to 
preserve the land as a public park. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy's decision at its regular meeting Monday night to name the 
land Summit Valley Edmund D. Edelman Park was intended as a compromise with 
some local residents who felt the park name should reflect the heritage of the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier proposal to name the park -- plus 405 adjacent acres -- the Edmund 
D. Edelman Wilderness Park was abandoned after catching flak from some Topanga 
residents and Native American advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community people felt it should be named something that relates to what 
it is and the area has been known as Summit Valley," said Jerry Daniel, 
chairman of the conservancy's board of directors.  
</P>
<P>
 Some were still perturbed, however, that a politician's name will be fixed to 
the ancient home of Chumash and Tongva Indians, which local residents have 
fought to save from development for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look to the naming of the park as the crowning glory of a long battle," 
said Jill Swift, a Santa Monica Mountains activist. "Supervisor Edelman came in 
on the tail end of what other people worked for for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, who plans to retire at the end of this term, helped hammer out a deal 
between the conservancy and the developer hours before a hearing on whether to 
approve Canyon Oaks. In the supervisor's hearing room the next morning, 
hundreds of gleeful Topanga residents cheered the surprise announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Petrulas Nissman, chairwoman of Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community, 
said Edelman deserves recognition. But she downplayed the significance of the 
park name. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spend a lot of time picking the names of our children because there is 
importance in a name," she said. "But the important thing here is that we saved 
this land. Now we have to get beyond the name and help create an incredible 
park." 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy will honor Edelman at a naming ceremony at the park Saturday, 
and will hold public hearings later to discuss possible names for the other 405 
acres. KURT PITZER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; JURY TO WEIGH LESSER CHARGE IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury Wednesday acquitted an Oxnard man of murder in connection with the 
Christmas Day stabbing death of his ex-girlfriend's son but has not reached a 
decision on a lesser homicide charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Superior Court jury will continue deliberating the fate of 
32-year-old Jose Jimenez this morning, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors charged Jimenez with murder in the stabbing death of Isaias 
Guerrero Morales, 21, who was knifed last December in the yard of his family's 
Campbell Way home. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris asked the jury to convict Jimenez of 
second-degree murder, saying the victim was killed while trying to escort 
Jimenez off the family's property. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Joseph P. Villasana, told jurors 
during the weeklong trial that the victim was stabbed only after attacking 
Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
 After deliberating for 1 1/2 days, the jury returned the not guilty verdict on 
the second-degree murder charge. But jurors also told Superior Court Judge 
Lawrence Storch that they were deadlocked 10 to 2 on voluntary manslaughter, a 
lesser charge. They did not say if they favored acquittal or conviction on the 
charge. Manslaughter is punishable by up to 11 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch ordered the jurors to continue deliberating, although about half of 
them told the judge that they did not believe a decision could be reached.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: TEACHERS AT 3 COLLEGES ACCEPT SALARY OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teachers at Ventura County's three community colleges have voted to accept a 
salary offer hammered out by negotiators last month after more than a year of 
contract talks, union officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Hoffman, president of the local chapter of the American Federation of 
Teachers, said union members voted overwhelmingly to accept the 1% pay raise 
scheduled to begin July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't unanimous, but it was a 92% yes vote," said Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman criticized trustees during much of this academic school year for what 
she said was the district's failure to bargain in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 The tentative agreement also contains language that would give the district's 
900 or so teachers another pay increase if more funding becomes available from 
the state, Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a settlement that people are ecstatic over," said Hoffman, a 
counselor at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was ratified in recognition that our negotiating team over 13 months did 
the best it could." 
</P>
<P>
 The board of trustees must still approve the agreement, probably next month.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: ASIAN GROUP GETS GRANT FOR PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Fernando Valley group has received a federal grant to fund substance 
abuse prevention and other social programs in the Asian American community. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Center for Substance Abuse Prevention under the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services has approved a $275,000 grant for the Asian and 
Pacific Islander Council of the San Fernando Valley, according to council board 
member Sue Fan. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want us to use this as a community-organizing grant so that we are 
better able to deal with earthquake relief and recovery," Fan said, explaining 
that the center is concerned about a possible increase in drug abuse and other 
social problems such as domestic violence in the aftermath of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to drug abuse prevention, the council will use the grant to fund 
youth, senior and information referral programs. Each of the projects will be 
carried out by consortiums of community groups that have already submitted 
program proposals. The council will announce the winners of the contracts next 
week, Fan said.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the information program, the consortium will try to develop a network of 
all Asian American groups in the Valley by organizing forums, distributing 
contact sheets and hiring staff that will communicate regularly with the 
groups.  
</P>
<P>
 The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention invited the council to apply for the 
grant at the recommendation of an Asian American organization in Los Angeles, 
the East-West Partnership, the community leader said.  
</P>
<P>
 The council is a coalition of community organizations, social service 
providers and individuals working to promote the social, cultural and civic 
interests of the Valley's Asian community. It was established in 1991 with seed 
money from United Way. KAY HWANGBO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YOUNG TUTORS GIVE STORIES EXTRA APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Six-year-old Cassiana Johnson grimaced when the princess kissed the frog and 
turned him into a prince in the fairy tale "The Frog Prince." 
</P>
<P>
 "Not me," declared the kindergartner in disgust. "I wouldn't want to kiss any 
toad." 
</P>
<P>
 The story looked so real because the princess, dressed in a pink satin gown 
with a gold tiara atop her blond hair, was telling the story herself. And the 
green, slimy frog was hunched on a table nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all make-believe and the frog was a toy, but as Eva Arrington's 
classroom at W.R. Nelson Elementary School became a fantasy land Tuesday, 
students saw, touched and listened to their favorite storybook characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrington's fifth-grade students dressed up as Cinderella, Snow White, Peter 
Pan, Robin Hood, Pinocchio and other characters, reading stories to 
kindergarten students as part of the school's peer tutoring program. 
</P>
<P>
 Started in September, the reading program pairs a fifth-grader with a 
kindergarten student. Together, they read stories for at least 30 minutes each 
week. Tuesday, Arrington and her fifth-graders decided to dress up to make the 
stories more fun and realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave them a chance to share something," Arrington said. "It made them feel 
important because they are doing something to help other students. It was great 
for their self-image. Their self-esteem was really high." 
</P>
<P>
 Through the reading program, Arrington said, kindergartners and fifth-graders 
learn to appreciate classical literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrington herself was dressed as Laura Ingalls, who wrote "Little House on the 
Prairie." 
</P>
<P>
 Amber O'Donnell, 11, who faced the prospect of kissing the frog, said she felt 
as if she had stepped out of the pages of the "The Frog Prince" in the pink 
satin gown that her grandmother made. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost real, like you feel and see these characters," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Cohn, 10, who dressed as Peter Pan, said he enjoys reading to a younger 
student because it helps him become a better reader and allows how him to show 
"how really good I can read." 
</P>
<P>
 "You get the feeling that the kid likes it, and it makes you feel happy," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amanda Hall, 11, dressed as Cinderella, said her kindergarten partner, Kenny 
Falconer, looks up to her like a big sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like being a role model," said Hall, who now considers herself a young 
adult and reads mainly young adult novels. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaida Torres, a fifth-grader, said dressing as Snow White on Tuesday to read 
to her young charge had a practical effect: He listened better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes," she said, "he can't sit still." BERT ELJERA

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CINCO DE MAYO; 
REMEMBERING MEXICO'S VICTORY OVER THE FRENCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This week marks the 132nd anniversary of Cinco de Mayo, which commemorates the 
Battle of Puebla, in which a ragtag group of Mexican fighters soundly defeated 
the French army on May 5, 1862. The defeat was a minor setback for the French, 
who had occupied the country a few months before, but the victory served as a 
rallying point for those wanting Mexico's freedom. The holiday caught on with 
many people in the United States-where it is sometimes confused with Mexican 
Independence Day, which falls on Sept. 16-and is celebrated more vigorously 
herethan in many areas in Mexico. Its popularity grew in part because the 
holiday was embraced by Chicano activists during the 1960s as a symbol of their 
civil rights struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 An Unlikely Ruling Couple 
</P>
<P>
 Emperor Maximilian 
</P>
<P>
 Maximilian headed the country for three years as part of a scheme by France's 
Napoleon III. The younger brother of Emperor Francis Joseph I of Austria, 
Maximilian attained the rank of rear admiral at age 22. After the French army 
occupied Mexico, he accepted the offer to become emperor, falsely believing the 
Mexican people had voted him their king. He angered the Catholic Church by 
refusing to restore vast church holdings confiscated by President Benito 
Juarez. He used his own inheritance, however, to cover daily expenses for the 
country since the Mexican treasury was depleted. After the French withdrew, he 
was court-martialed and executed. 
</P>
<P>
 Empress Carlota 
</P>
<P>
 Originally known as Princess Charlotte, she was the daughter of King Leopold I 
of the Belgians, and married Maximilian in 1857 when she was 17. She remolded 
the lavish Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City and established won's charitable 
organizations. When the United States began to demand the withdrawal of French 
troops, she sought aid from Napoleon III and the Pope. She was unsuccessful. 
She was in Europe when her husband was executed and suffered a mental 
breakdown. She lived in seclusion near Brussels until her death at age 86 on 
Jan. 19, 1927. In her old age she told her nurses that her husband was "the 
Sovereign of the Universe." 
</P>
<P>
 The French Occupation Key moments during France's brief rule in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 July, 1861-Facing great economic troubles, Mexican President Benito Pablo 
Juarez suspends payment on all foreign debts for two years. January, 
1862-England, Spain and France land troops in Veracruz. Britain and Spain 
withdraw their troops three months later after they realize Napoleon III wants 
to conquer Mexico and rule through a puppet government. May 5, 1862-Mexican 
forces defeat French army at Battle of Publa. May, 1864-Napoleon III installs 
Archduke Maximilian of Austria and his wife, Carlota, as emperor and empress of 
Mexico. June, 1863-With a bigger army, troops of Napoleon III capture Mexico 
City. March, 1867- Beaten down by continued resistance, pressure from the 
United States and criticism at home in France, Napoleon III withdraws his 
troops. May, 1867-Emperor Maximilian is captured and later executed. Juarez is 
restored as president of Mexico. Battle of Puebla 
</P>
<P>
 Five months after landing in Mexico, the French army advanced upon Puebla, 
situated about 50 miles southeast of Mexico City. The French Gen. Laurencez 
thought it would be an easy victory so he took no precautions and sent his men 
into the center of the Mexican fortifications. The Mexicans, commanded by Gen. 
Ignacio Zaragoza, were armed mostly with outdated guns. Even so, the 6,000 
French soldiers were soundly defeated by 2,000 Mexicans, who hid behind tall 
cactus plants. The French lost more than 1,000 men. Today, Cinco de Mayo is a 
Mexican national holiday and marked each year with a military parade in Mexico 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican Independence Day 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of Sept. 16, 1810, Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla called his 
parishioners to Mass in a small Dolores church. But instead of giving a 
religious sermon, he asked them to revolt against nearly three centuries of 
Spanish colonial rule. His Grito de Dolores, or shout to arms, became one of 
the most famous speeches in Mexican history. The shout is repeated during 
Mexican Independence Day celebrations. Although it took 11 years to defeat 
Spain, he date is considered the day that a independent Mexico was created.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; MOSQUITO SEASON AND ITS DANGERS ARRIVE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Those late April showers may be bringing a sharp increase in mosquitoes 
throughout Orange County, and expected rains this week could make things even 
worse, Vector Control District officials are warning. 
</P>
<P>
 Large amounts of standing water have been left by the rains, creating a 
perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
 With high numbers of mosquitoes come increased potential for disease. The 
western encephalitis mosquito, carrier of a serious infection by the same name, 
is one of 21 species of mosquitoes found in Orange County. All require standing 
water for development. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say residents can help by inspecting their yards for containers, 
such as garbage cans and barbecues, that may have collected water. And as 
summer approaches, officials urge careful lawn and garden irrigation.  
</P>
<P>
 Mosquito-eating fish also are available for free from the district for use in 
ornamental ponds and other permanent water sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "One female fish will consume about seven times her weight in mosquito 
larvae," said B. Fred Beams, assistant manager of the Vector Control District. 
At this time of the year, when mosquito eggs hatch more quickly than in winter, 
officials depend on the public to help eliminate them on private property, 
Beams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district conducts mosquito surveillance and control on public areas in the 
county, such as flood control channels, catch basins and marshes. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about mosquito prevention and control measures, including 
the fish, call the district at 1-800-734-2421.ANNA CEKOLA

<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't just cash they wanted when two gunmen robbed an Encino video store 
as employees were closing up shop Wednesday. The thieves also took $4,000 worth 
of electronic video game systems, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt in the 3:30 a.m. incident, in which thieves took 16 Sega 
Genesis and 12 Super Nintendo video game systems, in addition to stealing 
$2,000 in cash from the store's safe, said Los Angeles Police Detective Ken 
DeBie. 
</P>
<P>
 A night manager and an employee of a Blockbuster Video store in the 17600 
block of Ventura Boulevard were locking up the business and about to activate 
the alarm system when two gunmen forced them back into the store and demanded 
to know where the safe was kept and where the video game systems were stored, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects, in their mid-20s, tied the workers before fleeing with the cash 
and merchandise, DeBie said. The employees untied each other and called 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the workers told police that the employees stayed after the store 
closed at midnight to finish office work. 
</P>
<P>
 Police do not have any suspects or a description of their vehicle. CHAU LAM

 A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has ruled that he will give operators of 
the Sunshine Canyon landfill the green light next week to begin a planned 
expansion of the dump north of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But a neighboring homeowners coalition that has fought the expansion plan for 
years has already filed a new lawsuit against the project and has promised to 
appeal the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ruling issued last week, Judge Robert H. O'Brien said a court order 
halting the expansion will be lifted May 14. The project has been on hold for 
three years while a protracted legal battle over the dump has been fought. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles and the North Valley Coalition have filed a lawsuit 
and other legal challenges to halt the expansion proposed by Browning-Ferris 
Industries and approved by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit and most of the other challenges have been resolved, with 
Browning-Ferris and the county forced to address many environmental concerns 
raised by the city and the homeowners group. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his latest decision, O'Brien ruled against the final two challenges to 
the project and said he will lift his order that halts the project. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosemary Woodlock, an attorney representing the homeowners coalition, said 
she has filed a new lawsuit and plans to file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the new issues that her group will raise, she said, is a belief that 
the proposed expansion may be located over an earthquake fault. Federal law 
prohibits operation of a landfill over an active fault. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council is scheduled to meet Friday to consider what 
further legal action to take in its fight against the project. HUGO MARTIN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; SCHOOL BOARD LOOKS AT STUDENT TESTING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pleasant Valley School District Board of Education tonight will consider a 
resolution to urge the state to amend parts of its new California Learning 
Assessment System tests.  
</P>
<P>
 The resolution asks the state not to hold the district legally liable for 
questions relating to students' beliefs about sex, family life, morality and 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the resolution asks state education officials to improve public 
and media communication regarding the goals of the new tests.  
</P>
<P>
 Board member Dolores (Val) Rains said she believes the test is basically 
effective but needs some adjustments. California school districts first 
administered the tests this year. They replaced the California Assessment 
Program tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to listen to parents' concerns about the tests," Rains said. "But I 
don't think we have to throw the baby out with the bathwater here." 
</P>
<P>
 The school board will meet at Camarillo City Hall, 601 Carmen Drive, at 7 p.m.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; CITY BANS FOR-PROFIT AUTO WORK AT HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to dozens of complaints received by the Police Department each year 
about people illegally fixing cars for profit at their homes, the City Council 
on Tuesday adopted an ordinance declaring such work a "public nuisance." 
</P>
<P>
 The city already prohibits commercial activities at a residence, unless it is 
legally permitted and designated a "home occupation."But residents doing auto 
repair work for profit have until now not been violating any specific 
ordinances, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 60 people annually call the police to report neighbors who operate 
"mini-auto repair shops," citing noise, odor and visual blight, said Jinny 
Barton, the city's senior code enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecution of home-occupation violations has previously been difficult, so 
the new ordinance will make it easier to successfully crack down on those who 
run repair businesses from their home garages, Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; STUDENTS GET A NEW VIEW OF EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The ocean proved to be a great classroom this week for 66 sixth-graders from a 
gang-ridden Anaheim neighborhood who came here to learn more about Mother 
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 High on a craggy bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, the students from 
Francis Scott Key Elementary School filed out of a school bus at San Clemente 
State Park on Tuesday and looked in awe at the panorama of blue below them.  
</P>
<P>
 A welcoming committee of five dolphins bobbed in the waters, bringing gasps of 
delight from the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe we saw dolphins," said Emma Gallo, 11. "This is lots better 
than school." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was school -- without desks, construction paper or cafeterias. For 
three days, the 66 children from a rough Anaheim neighborhood are camping out 
and learning about the ocean environment from teachers and San Clemente State 
Park rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these kids have never been to the beach before," said Jim Caros, a 
Key teacher who organized the trip. "I'm hoping the kids will see how the rest 
of the world lives." 
</P>
<P>
 For the third year, the school will benefit from a state parks program that 
encourages schools to educate their children at the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't beat it," said Rich Gililland, park spokesman. "This is an 
experience these children will probably remember for the rest of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Through binoculars, children see seals and pelicans lounging on rocks. They 
watch squids and sharks dissected by their instructors and take hikes through 
the heavy vegetation growing in the ravines near the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a swarm of sand crabs, the students hit the beach shortly before noon on 
Tuesday and wasted no time plunging into the ocean and digging holes in the 
sand -- "all the usual things kids do at the beach," Caros said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the initial excitement burned off, students settled into organized 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 They made sand whales, although some of the crumbly sculptures looked more 
like misshapen clams. After ocean art class, teachers dissected a squid, 
accompanied by groans, moans and giggles from the children. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a far cry from the Ponderosa Park area where most of the children live, a 
place where "we have gangs, you know," said Jesse Hernandez, 12. "Sometimes the 
guns fire all through the night, and it's hard to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Caros, who teaches one of four sixth-grade classes at the school, said their 
neighborhood is so rough, many parents don't let their children play outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived at the beach all my life," he said. "I wanted to show them what a 
wonderful place this is and maybe encourage some of them to become ecologists 
or bring their parents down to the beach more often." 
</P>
<P>
 A few children said this was their first visit, while a few others said they 
thought they had been to the beach a few times. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether it was their first or 15th excursion, "we love it here, there are 
no parents," Mai Nghien said with an impish grin. "We don't have to sit in the 
classroom reading books." FRANK MESSINA

<P>
 A 43-year-old Simi Valley man died after he made a left turn in front of an 
oncoming car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorne Gardner was pronounced dead of multiple injuries at Simi Valley 
Hospital at 9:55 p.m. Tuesday, about an hour after the accident, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Gardner was turning left onto Stow Street from Los Angeles Avenue 
when he was struck by a car driven by Tina Cammarello, who was traveling east 
on Los Angeles Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Cammarello, 39, of Simi Valley had some back pain but declined to be 
hospitalized, police said. Her passenger, Roland Tinoco, 40, of Woodland Hills, 
also had back pain and declined immediate treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they do not know how fast the two vehicles were traveling when 
they collided. The speed limit on Los Angeles Avenue is 45 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators will check the vehicles to see if either was malfunctioning, and 
the Ventura County coroner's office is running tests to see if Gardner was 
intoxicated or impaired at the time of the accident, Simi Valley Police Sgt. 
Jeff Malgren said. PEGGY Y. LEE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SCHILLO PRESSES FOR FIRE SERVICES REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frustrated by delays in one of his pet projects, Thousand Oaks City Councilman 
Frank Schillo has asked county officials to hurry a report analyzing how much 
each city pays for fire protection and how much service that money buys. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Fire Protection District analysts promised last fall to draft the 
report in an effort to determine whether costs and benefits are spread fairly 
among the six member cities. 
</P>
<P>
 But since then, officials have been distracted by raging wildfires, the 
destructive earthquake and the surprise resignation of county Fire Chief George 
Lund. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiscal Analyst Abbe Cohen said she hopes to complete the reports within three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The district receives about $11 million in property-tax revenues from Thousand 
Oaks, and spends about $10.2 million on the city, according to a county report 
issued last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay has forced the city's consultant, Bob Braitman, to put off his 
analysis of Thousand Oaks' fire protection needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Braitman was hired last July to evaluate whether the city would be best off 
sticking with the county district or forming an independent fire department. 
The City Council authorized him to provide up to $10,000 worth of consulting 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Braitman has been paid $3,153 for nearly 25 hours of work plus 
expenses, including telephone calls, faxes, copy costs and a copy of the county 
directory, according to Steve Elam, the city's deputy finance director. All 
those hours were billed last September, October and December. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Braitman said, he's been waiting for the county report.  
</P>
<P>
 Tired of the delays, Schillo urged officials to speed up their analysis, as he 
suspects Thousand Oaks residents are paying too much for fire protection 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there's been a fire and a quake, yet we need to have some idea when 
they will be done with that report," Schillo said. STEPHANIE SIMON

 Two robbers shot into a Thousand Oaks restaurant early Wednesday as they tried 
unsuccessfully to rob it, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt in the attempted robbery of El Torito Restaurant at 449 N. 
Moorpark Road, Ventura County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 A janitor and his two brothers left the restaurant and were accosted by two 
men with handguns about 12:45 a.m. Wednesday, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair forced the three back to the building and tried to get them to open 
the restaurant door by calling to the manager, but the manager became 
suspicious and refused to let them in, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men then broke a window and fired a shot into the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 They fled on foot and no arrests have been made, deputies said. PEGGY Y. LEE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; 2 GROUPS SEEK RECALL OF 3 ON CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Corona del Mar homeowner associations are launching efforts to recall 
three City Council members who have supported an unpopular plan to build 
tollbooths along Newport Coast Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents from the Harbor View Hills Homeowners Assn. and the Spyglass Hill 
Community Assn. are upset that council members John C. Cox Jr., Janice A. Debay 
and Mayor Clarence J. Turner are apparently undermining their efforts to remove 
several tollbooths from the west end of the future San Joaquin Hills 
Transportation Corridor, where it will overlap Newport Coast Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents are worried that the tollbooths will encourage thousands of 
motorists to bypass the tollway by traveling down residential thoroughfares and 
onto West Coast Highway through Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will devastate our community. We will become a freeway and we don't want 
that," said Claire Schwan, president of the Spyglass Hill Community Assn., 
whose group agreed Tuesday night to begin the recall effort against the three 
council members. "We are trying to keep the area beautiful and lovely, and 
nobody is listening to us."  
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) has prodded the state attorney 
general's office into preparing an opinion on whether it is legal for the San 
Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency to impose tolls on what is now a 
free public road. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a council majority voted earlier this year to send a letter to 
the attorney general indicating that local residents were not adequately 
informed of the tollbooth placement and asking the state to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 But Turner, Cox and Debay -- who were in the minority on that vote -- then 
wrote a letter to the attorney general contradicting the council majority's 
position. For that reason, residents are now eager to vote them out of office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that it is time for our City Council members to stand behind the 
citizens here," said Yvonne Houssels, president of the Harbor View Hills 
Community Assn. and an organizer of the recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Debay acknowledged Wednesday that she is concerned about the recall campaign, 
but she also said that the effort "is not meaningful" and only serves to 
"divide the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner and Cox could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Houssels acknowledged that her group is unsure of how to mount a recall effort 
and does not know if it can get the measure placed on either the June or 
November ballot. The group is still studying strategies for the campaign and 
has not yet begun to collect the necessary signatures to get the recall measure 
on the city ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The tollway agency has maintained that the tollbooths are necessary to 
generate revenue to help pay back the project's bondholders. Agency officials 
also assert that the controversial tollbooths on Newport Coast Drive were 
included in the $1.1-billion project's environmental report and that the public 
was adequately notified of the plan. BOB ELSTON

SINGER IS CLEARED OF DRUG CHARGES; COURTS: NO COUNTS WILL BE FILED AGAINST 
COURTNEY LOVE. SHE HAD BEEN ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF NARCOTICS POSSESSION AFTER 
SHE BECAME ILL FROM PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION AT A BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL.

<P>
 Drug charges will not be filed against singer Courtney Love, who was arrested 
in Beverly Hills on April 7 -- one day before her rock star husband Kurt Cobain 
was found dead in Seattle of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am delighted that this nightmare is over and I have been cleared of all the 
charges," said Love in a statement released by her attorney, Barry Tarlow. "I 
can now get back to concentrating on putting my life together and mourning the 
loss of my husband. Hopefully, people will give me the time now to care for my 
daughter, Francis Bean, and to grieve." 
</P>
<P>
 The 28-year-old singer, recuperating Wednesday at an undisclosed location with 
her daughter, had been scheduled to be arraigned today in Beverly Hills 
Municipal Court on charges of possession of a controlled substance, possession 
of drug paraphernalia and possession of stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 Love was arrested after being rushed to Century City Hospital at the 
insistence of police, who suspected she had a heroin overdose at the Peninsula 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrived with paramedics after hotel security officials called 911 
following a call from Love to the front desk complaining about an allergic 
reaction to a prescription drug -- not a heroin overdose as initially was 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Hart said an emergency room doctor and a police drug 
recognition expert determined April 7 that Love was not under the influence of 
a narcotic. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart said there was insufficient evidence to show unlawful possession of the 
seven hypodermic syringes found in Love's room because the singer provided 
prescriptions valid at the time of her arrest permitting ownership of them. The 
syringes were prescribed for injecting Buprenex, a pain medication the singer 
had been taking since January for back problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The property initially described as stolen was a prescription pad left in her 
hotel room by a psychiatrist treating the singer. No illegal drugs were found 
in the room, the prosecutor said. Sources close to the musician said the packet 
of white powder confiscated by police turned out to be zibhuti ash -- a Hindu 
recovery talisman given to Love by friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the irresponsible loose cannons in the media who printed false and 
distorted versions of events when Courtney Love was first arrested learn 
something from this," said Tarlow, a prominent criminal attorney. "In this 
country, because someone is arrested or accused does not mean they committed 
the crime."

ARGUMENTS ON EVIDENCE DELAY GATES' TESTIMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An attorney defending former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates against 
Rodney G. King's lawsuit for punitive damages said Wednesday that the 
Christopher Commission report on the Police Department is biased against his 
client. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Don Vincent, also representing 14 other current and 
former officers, argued that the report should not be used to determine whether 
Gates was personally accountable for the conduct of his officers during King's 
1991 beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent argued that many of the witnesses interviewed by the Christopher 
Commission were critics of Gates whose accusations were accepted without 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't cross-examined, and the Christopher Commission took their 
comments and put them in there," Vincent told U.S. District Judge John G. 
Davies outside the presence of the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent's remarks came during a tedious, point-by-point review of the 
commission report to determine what parts of it may be admitted as evidence 
against Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal haggling postponed Gates' long-awaited testimony in the trial. 
Gates, who took the stand for only 20 minutes Tuesday, is expected to return to 
the stand today in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies made it clear that much, but not all, of the Christopher Commission 
report would be excluded as hearsay in the trial, now in its second phase. Late 
last month, the same jury awarded King $3.8 million in compensatory damages 
from the city because of the injuries he suffered in the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 King's attorneys are attempting to use the report to allege that Gates knew, 
or should have known, of departmental practices of excessive force and racism 
that contributed to the attack on King. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent's criticisms of the commission's report -- which became the basis of 
reform within the Police Department after Gates' resignation -- later drew a 
stern counterattack from Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who 
served on the ad hoc committee to implement the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not his job to try to discredit the Christopher Commission report," 
Ridley-Thomas said of the assistant city attorney. "The Christopher Commission 
report serves as a blueprint for the city of Los Angeles. No city attorney, as 
far as I'm concerned, is operating within what I consider to be the appropriate 
bounds of that office by contradicting (such) a broadly embraced set of 
recommendations and policies." 
</P>
<P>
 The courtroom debate over the report was interrupted only by brief testimony 
from Jerry Mulford, a former LAPD training officer, who had flown in from 
Washington state to show jurors how police are taught to handle felony 
suspects. Testifying on Gates' behalf, Mulford demonstrated how suspects are 
placed in a prone position to minimize the danger to officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulford also attempted to define some of the guidelines governing whether an 
officer may strike a suspect who is on the ground.

COUNCIL PUTS CONSOLIDATION PLAN ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to consolidate several city departments into two new super-agencies -- 
part of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's budget proposal -- was put on hold 
Wednesday by a City Council committee that said Riordan pushed the proposals 
too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's Budget and Finance Committee asked for more study of the two 
plans, and committee Chairman Zev Yaroslavsky said the consolidations should be 
considered apart from Riordan's $4.3-billion budget.Several city lawmakers said 
the consolidations may still go ahead but that too many details must be ironed 
out to approve them by the June 1 budget deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Under one proposal, Riordan would consolidate into a new Citywide Development 
Agency the current Community Redevelopment Agency, Housing Department and parts 
of the Community Development Department. The second plan would place half a 
dozen small city agencies in a new Community Services Department.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said the plan for a centralized economic agency 
had been making its way through the council, when Riordan preempted the 
proposal with his own plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said the Riordan plan did not resolve the complicated question 
of mingling civil service employees with other workers.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; COUNCIL TOUGHENS BAN ON PUSHCARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ice cream vendors and other peddlers in Burbank who defy the city's year-old 
ban on pushcarts can lose their carts under a change to the ordinance approved 
by the City Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It did not have a lot of teeth in it and it was hard to enforce," Burbank 
Mayor Bill Wiggins said of the pushcart ban.The council voted 4 to 0, with 
George Battey absent, to allow police and code enforcement officials to seize 
carts from vendors who have repeatedly ignored the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to formally adopt the measure next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have either complied with the ban or thumbed their noses at us," said 
license and code supervisor Terre Hirsch. Most vendors have complied with the 
ban, but a handful have returned to Burbank. Sometimes they do not have 
identification or give different names each time they are warned or cited. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the ban went into effect in March, 1993, the city has issued 25 warnings 
to vendors. Hirsch said six vendors have been warned twice, and five have 
received citations. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we've had pretty good compliance with it," Hirsch said. 
</P>
<P>
 By giving the city the power to seize the pushcarts, the vendors who defiantly 
sell their wares risk losing the carts and will be forced to pay impound fees 
of $25 to $50 to get them back. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorized ice cream trucks are still allowed in Burbank as long as they do not 
stay in one spot more than 15 minutes. The ordinance also allows for special 
permits to be issued for pushcarts in downtown Burbank. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; GUARDIAN ANGEL PROPOSES PATROL FOR BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 64-year-old Guardian Angel wants to establish a foot patrol to chase away 
the prostitutes and drug dealers who have permeated Sepulveda Boulevard for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, said G.C. "Brodie" Broderson, is to ease some of the burden on 
motels and other businesses on the boulevard that were recently ordered by the 
city to hire security to rid their premises of prostitutes. In exchange, the 
Angels want a rent-free headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Broderson's efforts have not met with much success. Although he 
attended a meeting of the motels last month, none have given the Angels 
permission to patrol their properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Broderson believes the motel owners are afraid of angering people who do not 
want the Angels patrolling the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be an awful lot of problems," Broderson, a retired 
photographer from Mission Hills, said of the boulevard. "I do know that we can 
alleviate the problems by being there all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Identified mostly by their red berets, the Guardian Angels is a nonprofit 
group founded in 1979 by Curtiss Sliwa of New York. Since its inception, the 
organization has grown to more than 7,000 members worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary focus, Broderson said, is providing a visual presence to deter 
criminals, although group members have made citizen's arrests, without the use 
of weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Broderson joined 10 years ago after watching the Angels on television, but has 
found it difficult to recruit members in the Valley. The organization runs 
entirely on donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Broderson wants to implement nightly patrols on Sepulveda Boulevard with at 
least a dozen Angels. Their mission would be to discourage customers of drug 
dealers and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone wants to buy crack and pulls up along the sidewalk, we walk up 
to them and shout, in a high-pitched voice, 'Are you here to buy some crack?' 
In a lot of cases, we can nag these people down." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. James McMurray of Van Nuys Division said he would welcome the patrols, 
as long as the Angels limit their dealings to driving away prostitutes, their 
customers and drug buyers. Confrontations with drug dealers or other felons 
would be dangerous, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already have citizen groups out on the streets with video cameras and 
picket signs," said McMurray. "All we need is a few months respite to keep (the 
criminals) out of Sepulveda Boulevard, and if the Guardian Angels can do that, 
they're welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Flip Smith, president of the Sepulveda Boulevard Business Watch, said he 
supports McMurray's opinion with some reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe this vigilante group can walk up and down the street and keep these 
prostitutes moving along," Smith said. "But I don't want Sepulveda Boulevard 
looking like a war zone. I don't want it looking like Beirut with those little 
hats they've got on." 
</P>
<P>
 Broderson said he is willing to work with the community to have Angels on 
Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't like to just barge in and say, 'OK, we're going to clean up your 
neighborhood,' " said Broderson. "If we're not asked to come in, we don't come 
in." JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY OKS 7% ANNUAL RAISES FOR 
MANAGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' 83 mid-level managers will receive annual merit-based raises of 
up to 7% and expanded life insurance benefits under a new contract approved 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year contract also merges vacation and sick time into a single 
category, known as annual leave.Employees with up to four years of continuous 
service will receive 18 10-hour days off each year, and managers with more than 
a decade of service will enjoy at least 24 days of annual leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "For what's happening in the economy right now, it's a pretty good package," 
said Roy Myers, vice president of the Thousand Oaks Management Assn. union. 
</P>
<P>
 During eight months of sometimes-bitter negotiations, a group of 27 senior 
managers broke away from the union and formed their own bargaining team. That 
group has yet to sign a contract, but member Greg Eckman said they were 
treating negotiations as "informal discussions with the city manager" rather 
than confrontational debates. 
</P>
<P>
 As the city's human resources manager, Eckman helped negotiate the contract 
with the Thousand Oaks Management Assn. He said he was "pleased and relieved" 
to receive final City Council approval of the contract on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Granting the merit raises, annual leave and insurance benefits to all 83 
managers represented by the union will cost the city about $210,000 a year, 
Eckman said. That amount could fluctuate depending on the merit raises, which 
managers said should average about 5% a year. STEPHANIE SIMON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; DEERFIELD AVENUE MAY BE SPRUCED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a city that takes pride in meticulous urban planning, Deerfield Avenue is 
something of an embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The street carries about 3,000 cars a day through a sharp 90-degree turn that 
some residents have likened to an amusement park ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine city officials agree that the road presents problems, and they've spent 
the last few years adding stop signs, erecting a traffic island and installing 
yellow traffic cones in an effort to make the turn more manageable. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's efforts have not impressed some residents, who last month 
unsuccessfully sought to have the road closed -- at least for a trial period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The street isn't getting better, it's getting worse," said Elizabeth Mead, 
one of several Deerfield Avenue residents who worries that a speeding car or 
truck might lose control on the curve and crash into a house. "Something more 
has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members have expressed sympathy for the residents and their 
concerns. But they are unwilling to close the major east-west route, especially 
as construction continues on nearby Culver Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the city may eventually spend more than $100,000 to beautify the 
existing traffic island. 
</P>
<P>
 Deerfield Avenue is not the only street in Irvine with a 90-degree turn. But 
most other streets with sharp curves are found in cul-de-sacs and are not used 
by commuter traffic, residents say. Deerfield, in contrast, connects two major 
roads: Harvard Avenue and Culver Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Arya Rohani, the city's manager of transportation services, said the street's 
odd shape results from its being built in two segments. The two sections were 
connected as housing tracts sprouted around them. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Deerfield carries about 3,000 cars a day, Rohani said the road is far 
from what officials would consider "at capacity." 
</P>
<P>
 But that does little to comfort jittery residents, who say the sharp turn 
frequently causes drivers to slam on their brakes and hit the traffic median. 
They noted one case several years ago when a driver lost control around the 
turn, sending the car through a driveway and into a back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents have also criticized the way the city has dealt with the 
problem. In addition to installing the median and stop signs, workers have 
posted large yellow signs warning drivers of the sharp turn and placed bright 
orange posts and reflectors in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "That neon yellow is such an eyesore," said Mead, echoing the feelings of 
other residents. "We have to paint our homes a certain color or be cited by the 
homeowners association. Then we have this on the street. It's a real blight on 
the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members say the city may remove a few of the signs. They may consider 
improving the look of the center traffic median, replacing some of the orange 
cones with landscaping and flowers. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; PETITIONS COULD FORCE HEADLANDS PLAN VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group seeking to overturn the City Council's recent approval of a 
$500-million resort plan for the Headlands submitted two petitions to the city 
clerk Wednesday that could force a citywide vote on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Each petition contained about 3,800 signatures, more than the required 1,912 
needed to bring the resort plan back to the council for another decision, said 
Robert Wilberg, a spokesman for the group that circulated them during the past 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 If the petitions are declared valid by the county registrar of voters, the 
council members would be forced to either rescind their vote or put the matter 
up to a vote, City Clerk Sharon L. Waits said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilberg said the group found residents very receptive to the prospect of a 
vote on the plan, which allows the landowners to build a 400-room hotel, 
150,000 square feet of commercial space and 370 homes on the 121-acre Headlands 
property near Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pleasantly surprised at the numbers we did gather," said Wilberg, a 
candidate for City Council in next month's election. "Some people thought it 
was a done deal and we had to convince them it wasn't. But a lot of people were 
very supportive of what we're trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilberg said the two petitions "basically said the same thing," that the plan 
should be the basis of a local vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The group beat the deadline for the petitions by one day, Waits said. To 
qualify as valid, petitions must be signed by 1,912 registered voters, which 
represents 10% of all the registered voters in Dana Point, Waits said. 
</P>
<P>
 Waits said she would do a quick check of the petitions and then pass them on 
to the registrar of voters, which will have 30 days to validate them. If they 
are declared valid, the City Council would have to make a decision at its next 
meeting, Waits said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1940s, the Headlands property has been owned by the M.H. Sherman Co. 
and Chandis Securities Co. Chandis Securities, which oversees the financial 
holdings of the Chandler family, is a major stockholder in Times Mirror Co., 
which publishes The Times. LEN HALL

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; ELECTRONIC FORUM TO BE FINE-TUNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "Electronic Towne Hall," a phone-in forum in which Burbank residents could 
berate or applaud their City Council from the comfort of their living rooms, is 
being fine-tuned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to say that I'm building on what George Battey did," said Bill 
Wiggins, who replaced Battey this week as Burbank's mayor.The mayor's post is 
rotated among the council members each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Battey tried to promote the city and bring residents closer to government by 
using television, which was already being used to cover City Council meetings. 
He started a weekly television call-in show called "Ask the Mayor," airing 
Wednesday evenings. In February, the council started the Electronic Towne Hall, 
a monthly forum in which callers can phone the council chambers and make 
comments or ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping we could get calls from those who couldn't come down to the 
council meetings," Wiggins said, explaining that some people would rather not 
have to wait until 10 or 11 p.m., or even after midnight, to address the 
council about a problem. But the forum, which usually gets nine to 14 calls 
during a 45-minute session, had been slipping into just another version of "Ask 
the Mayor." 
</P>
<P>
 Wiggins, saying he wanted to do more, is having the town hall meeting changed. 
Instead of just waiting for calls to come in on random subjects, the council 
would have city officials report on an issue and have viewers call in with 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
 The new format was set at Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiggins is also revamping Battey's "Ask the Mayor," program to spotlight 
different city departments. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; OFFICERS ON BIKES TO PATROL BUSINESS AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police officers on bikes will patrol the city's busy downtown shopping 
district during longer summer days to ensure that crime does not creep into the 
popular nightspots as it has in Pasadena and Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second year for the bicycle patrol, which is staffed by 10 
officers who work in Glendale schools as directors for the Drug Alcohol 
Resistance Education program, as school resource officers and at the district's 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers will alternate day and early evening shifts when patrols begin in 
early June in the city's downtown area, the Montrose shopping center and 
several city parks, said Capt. Ron DePompa. 
</P>
<P>
 The patrols will end shortly before school begins in early September. 
</P>
<P>
 The program -- designed to promote interaction among the officers, shop owners 
and patrons -- was highly successful in its first year, DePompa said. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort is part of a larger community-based policing program scheduled to 
begin later this year -- if money is appropriated for the program by the City 
Council in its 1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept calls for officers to get to know people along their beats and to 
become more proactive in solving neighborhood crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Local brokers applauded bicycle patrols as a partial solution to concerns that 
as Glendale becomes a popular destination to shop, eat and go to the theater, 
criminals may travel to the city to prey on well-heeled patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 "As market forces make the downtown area more successful, crime will follow -- 
we need to get security taken care of now," said Bill Boyd, a broker with CB 
Commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Bike patrols, popularized in beach cities and subsequently put in place in 
Studio City and Burbank, were formed in Glendale to prevent criminals from 
entering burgeoning downtown and retail districts, said Mayor Eileen Givens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to anticipate crime rather than react to it," Givens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bicycle officers will concentrate on Glendale's central business district, 
which includes the newly renovated Alex Theatre and many well-patronized 
restaurants, shops and the Mann theaters in the Exchange complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Bicycle officers will complement foot patrols staffed by reserve officers that 
are already in place along the popular commercial strip on Friday and Saturday 
evenings. JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; RETRIAL DELAYED IN CASE OF BOY'S DEATH

<P>
 A trial scheduled to begin Wednesday for Debra Suzanne Cummings, a former PTA 
president accused of murdering a 9-month-old boy under her care, was delayed 
until June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings, 36, faces a retrial in the June 15, 1990, death of Kevin Young, who 
died after suffering severe head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors believe Cummings attacked the child, but Cummings says the child 
had an accident in her Reseda home that exacerbated an earlier injury. 
</P>
<P>
 A mistrial was declared in Cummings' first trial. In July, 1992, a Superior 
Court jury deadlocked 7 to 5 in favor of acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin died three months after a 14-month-old boy died while in Cummings' care. 
Prosecutors also charged her in the death of Matthew Cooley, but a judge 
dismissed charges, largely because there was no evidence of foul play. An 
autopsy determined that Matthew died from some type of seizure. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys said Wednesday's trial date was delayed because the courtroom where 
the case is assigned is now busy with a lengthy drunk driving murder trial.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; WORKER REJECTS SUIT DESPITE HEARING LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In these litigious times, where workers' compensation claims and high-stakes 
personal injury lawsuits are sometimes more brutal than the injuries 
themselves, 61-year-old William Van Aalst is an anomaly. 
</P>
<P>
 A 15-year employee of the city of San Fernando, Van Aalst suffered severe 
hearing loss after driving a rumbling diesel street sweeper from 4 a.m. to noon 
for five years. Instead of filing a workers' compensation claim or seeking to 
sue over his injuries, the Glendale native had one request of the San Fernando 
City Council: help him buy a hearing aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejecting an initial proposal to have Van Aalst pay back the city at the rate 
of $20 a month, the council voted two weeks ago to pay for the $1,590 device in 
full. For Van Aalst, that's the end of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't always be sue-happy," he said. "Suing people is not always the 
correct way to take care of things. Sooner or later it gets back to you. You're 
going to have to pay the bills." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Aalst still works for the city, now as a back-flow technician, making sure 
water users comply with federal and state laws that prohibit water from flowing 
back into the water delivery system. He switched jobs about 1 1/2 years ago, 
when the city hired a private company to sweep the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Lissik, personnel director for the city, said that without the 
hearing aid Van Aalst would not have been able to keep his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Aalst, who lives with his wife, Lily, in Sylmar, said he has no desire to 
seek restitution or even assign blame for his hearing loss. He said he is not 
even fully convinced that his street-sweeping job caused the injury to his 
hearing.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was a personal matter and I'm happy with the outcome," he said. "I have 
no intention of going any further than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Doude Wysbeek, who spoke against the initial proposal to have Van 
Aalst pay the city back, said the purchase of the hearing aid was a good 
investment in an employee who has been loyal to the city for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I would have done that for any long-term employee," Doude said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; BOLSA CHICA REGIONAL PARK PLAN APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After lengthy debate, the City Council has approved the county's plans for the 
first phase of a long-proposed Bolsa Chica Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The 106-acre park would be county-owned and maintained open space on the 
southeast edge of the state's Bolsa Chica wetlands reserve. Since some of the 
acreage is within Huntington Beach's boundaries, the city's approval was needed 
for the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Planning Commission rejected the county's plans, 4-2, on March 1. But 
the City Council at its Monday night meeting overturned the Planning Commission 
action, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The council majority insisted on some changes in the wording of the county's 
plans. The amendments and lengthy debate so irritated Councilmen Earle 
Robitaille and Jim Silva that they voted against the overall proposal in 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not against the park," said Silva, after the meeting. "I voted against 
(the amended plan) because I don't think you try to change five years of 
planning work while sitting here at a council meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 Robitaille similarly said he voted against the park plan because of the 
amendments inserted by the council majority. "I'm not sure what's in there (the 
park plan) now," Robitaille said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman David Sullivan said he voted against the plan because he thinks 
more protection is needed for an existing ravine in the proposed park. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson, Councilwoman Grace Winchell and Councilmen 
Ralph Bauer and Victor Leipzig voted in favor of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's park proposal divided environmental groups. Representatives of 
the Sierra Club spoke Monday night against the plan. They urged the City 
Council to keep the land as natural open space, not a park. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Monroe, one of the Sierra Club speakers, called the proposed county park 
a "wrong action for the future of the environment." Representatives of the 
Bolsa Chica Land Trust also spoke against the proposed park. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the Amigos de Bolsa Chica, an environmental group that has been a 
strong advocate about protecting the wetlands, endorsed the park plan. "This is 
an excellent park to serve as a buffer to the Bolsa Chica (wetlands)," said 
Terry Dolton, former president of the Amigos de Bolsa Chica. 
</P>
<P>
 The park would be a long, narrow strip of land that connects the city's 
existing Central Park to oceanfront mesas at Pacific Coast Highway. Supporters 
of the park said it would allow hikers to view much of the beauty of the Bolsa 
Chica wetlands area.BILL BILLITER

CRITICS SAY CONFLICTS CERTAIN IN SIMPSON'S TOURISM JOB; GOVERNMENT: ANAHEIM 
COUNCILMAN COUNTERS THAT HE TOLD HOTEL-MOTEL GROUP THAT THE CITY COMES FIRST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Several community leaders expressed concern Wednesday that Councilman Bob D. 
Simpson's new job as executive director of a recently formed hotel and motel 
association could pose so many conflicts that he would become an ineffectual 
lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Hughes, executive director of the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce, said he 
believes Simpson's position with the association "would preclude him from 
voting on tourism issues. I can't imagine that it wouldn't be a conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 "This job is going to take him out of the picture on more than a few things," 
agreed Shirley Grindle, an activist who has helped win political ethics reforms 
in the county. "I think he should resign. . . . I don't think he could serve 
both." 
</P>
<P>
 William R. Mitchell, chairman of Orange County Common Cause, also said he 
thought Simpson's new job was improper for an active councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would seem apparent that his new position is based in large part because 
of his position on the City Council," Mitchell said. "In order to alleviate any 
concerns the public may have, he should abstain from all votes affecting 
tourism that come before the council." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, who accepted the $36,000 part-time position last week, said he 
believes his new position will present few if any conflicts with public 
business and promised that he would confer with the city attorney about what 
issues he can and can't vote on. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Simpson said he told the 40 members of the Anaheim Area 
Hotel/Motel Assn. that his first obligation was to the city council. He said 
Wednesday he would consider resigning from the group if too many conflicts 
arose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to abdicate my time on the council," said Simpson, whose term 
expires in November. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Jack L. White said in an interview that he saw no legal problem in 
Simpson's taking the job. Conflicts would only occur if a vote directly 
benefits an association member either financially or materially, White said, or 
if he votes on an issue on which the association has a stated position. 
</P>
<P>
 One issue that could eventually pose a conflict is an increase in the hotel 
bed tax.  
</P>
<P>
 An increase in the tax is part of the financial framework for the proposed 
$3-billion Disneyland Resort, and many local motels could be expected to oppose 
such a tax hike. In addition, the Disneyland Hotel is a member of Simpson's 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth P. Wong, senior vice president of Walt Disney Co.'s development 
division, said he wasn't overly concerned about Simpson's new job. "It's really 
for (the city) to work out," he said. But Stan Pawlowski, co-chairman of 
Westcot 2000, a pro-Disneyland Resort group, said he would be troubled if 
Simpson couldn't vote on the resort project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd certainly hate to lose his vote," Pawlowski said. "If some reason it came 
to a 2-2 vote, we would be in one heck of a shape." To date, all the votes on 
the Disney project have been unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong, however, was optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is that Bob is going to work for a very important industry in 
Anaheim," Wong said. "He has been strong voice for the growth of tourism. I 
consider him a leading thinker."

SCHOOLTEACHER FACES CHARGES OF HAVING SEX WITH TEEN-AGE BOY; COURTS: THE L.A. 
SCHOOL DISTRICT REMOVES THE NORTH HOLLYWOOD FROM THE CLASSROOM. SHE MAY HAVE 
MET THE BOY WHEN HE WAS HER STUDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An elementary schoolteacher from North Hollywood was charged Wednesday with 
eight felony counts of having sex with a teen-age boy she may have met while he 
was one of her students. 
</P>
<P>
 Penelope Kay Boyd, a teacher at 96th Street School in South-Central Los 
Angeles, is accused of having sex with the boy, who is now 16, from November, 
1992, until her arrest last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Los Angeles Unified School District have taken Boyd out of 
the classroom and assigned her to work in an office away from children, said 
Shel Erlich, communications officer for the school district. Once charges are 
filed, teachers are most commonly placed on unpaid leave, he said, noting that 
the district has not yet taken this action against Boyd, who has taught in the 
district for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities declined to discuss details of the criminal case or where the 
sexual activity occurred, saying they wanted to protect the identity of the 
alleged victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors did reveal that at least one of Boyd's relatives brought 
suspicions of illegal sexual activity to the attention of police. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Carole Chizever charged Boyd with six counts of unlawful 
sex with a minor and two counts of oral copulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd was charged under a section of the California Penal Code that was amended 
by the Legislature last year to include males under the age of 18. Previously, 
prosecutors could file charges under the statute outlawing sex with minors only 
in cases in which the victims were female. The language of the revised law no 
longer specifies gender. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy told investigators that he did not want to have sex with Boyd, 
Chizever said. Without elaborating, the prosecutor said the teacher used 
"mental coercion" on the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went on intermittently" through a 1 1/2-year period, Chizever said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd, 47, may have been one of the boy's elementary schoolteachers, but 
prosecutors have yet to confirm the connection. Authorities so far have not 
found any other victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd surrendered to police last week and was released after posting $50,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 She is scheduled to appear in Van Nuys Municipal Court for arraignment May 18. 
Prosecutors said they will ask a judge at that time to double Boyd's bail to 
$100,000.

AGAINST ADVICE, DAUGHTER TAKES STAND IN MOM'S MURDER TRIAL; COURT: NICOLE 
SAMUELS MOROIANU IS CALLED AN UNINDICTED CO-CONSPIRATOR IN ALLEGED PLOTS THAT 
SNUFFED LIVES OF STEPFATHER AND FORMER FIANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aware of the risks and against the advice of her lawyer, Nicole Samuels 
Moroianu took the witness stand Wednesday in Van Nuys Superior Court and began 
testifying on behalf of her mother, who stands accused of orchestrating two 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Moroianu herself is up to her neck in a twisted tale of two 
murders allegedly motivated by the greed of her mother, Mary Ellen Samuels. 
</P>
<P>
 Moroianu, the mother of a small son, is an unindicted co-conspirator in 
alleged murder-for-hire plots that snuffed the lives of her stepfather and her 
former fiance, prosecutor Jan Maurizi said. Moroianu previously has refused to 
testify, invoking her constitutional right against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 But during a brief hearing Wednesday, Moroianu, 24, said she was ready to tell 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her sole motivating factor in this case is that she wants to do anything she 
can to help her mom," said Moroianu's attorney, Alex Kessel. "It was my advice 
that she not testify. But for the mother-daughter relationship, she probably 
would have adhered to my advice." 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels, 45, received about $500,000 in insurance and real estate proceeds 
after her husband, motion picture camera operator Robert Samuels, was slain. 
She is accused of hiring out the slaying of the original hit man, cocaine 
dealer Robert Bernstein, 27, when he threatened to cooperate with police. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecution witnesses, including many of Moroianu's high school friends, have 
testified that she asked them to help her find a gun so she and her mother 
could kill Samuels, the stepfather who Nicole claimed had molested her. They 
said she helped her mother seek out a hit man among her circle of friends. And 
they said she was engaged to two men at the same time, including Bernstein, the 
alleged hit man. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, Moroianu faces scathing cross-examination and probing 
questions about her drug use and personal life. At most, prosecutors have 
warned, she could face perjury or murder-conspiracy charges in connection with 
the December, 1988, shotgun slaying of Samuels and the June, 1989, beating and 
strangulation of Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Moroianu said outside the courtroom that she is motivated by a force 
more powerful than fear -- a daughter's love for her mother, who faces the 
death penalty if convicted of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love her and I'm always going to be there for her," she said. "Always." 
</P>
<P>
 Moroianu said her mother did nothing wrong. She said she is testifying to 
dispute "lies" former friends told about them during prosecution testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are just a bunch of liars who used her," Moroianu said. "I guess my 
mom's a glutton for punishment. I was young. Friends come and go when you're 
that age. But my mom's friends . . ." she stopped in mid-sentence and just 
shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
 She admitted being engaged to Bernstein, but said she was never "serious" 
about him. "It was just a fluke, an immature thing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Questioned by her mother's attorney, Phil Nameth, Moroianu testified for just 
under an hour Wednesday, beginning to describe the complex web of relationships 
spun around the bizarre death plots. She admitted her own daily cocaine habit, 
beginning when she was 16. She said Bernstein kept her supplied but never 
charged her for the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Her testimony resumes today.

MODIFICATION OF FLOOD BASIN PLANS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK and STEPHANIE SIMON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to protect a wetland area in Thousand Oaks, state and federal 
regulators today will ask the county to consider modifying plans for a flood 
control basin that may threaten a sensitive habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 The county originally intended to remove ground water from the basin by 
continuously pumping it into a storm drain for up to five years without 
studying the impact on the neighboring wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and government officials on the local, state and federal 
levels have expressed concern that the pumping could drain the wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 And they have criticized the county's willingness to move ahead with the 
project without any environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, officials from the Ventura County Flood Control District have 
agreed to study the impacts of the basin on surrounding areas, but said they 
would do so only when construction of the basin is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having an (environmental impact report) after the fact, rather than before 
the fact, is just ludicrous," Mayor Elois Zeanah said during a heated Thousand 
Oaks City Council meeting Tuesday. "It looks like a disaster out there. A lot 
of questions are unanswered." 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing from county officials Tuesday, the City Council voted to draft a 
letter to county supervisors listing its concerns with the project. 
</P>
<P>
 And today, state Fish and Game officials, along with regulators from two 
federal agencies, will meet with county flood control deputies to discuss the 
future of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The basin, which is a 30-foot-deep crater that extends to the border of 
property owned by developer Nedjatollah Cohan, has long been a project under 
consideration by the county, county Public Works Director Art Goulet said at 
the City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 When negotiations with Cohan fell through, he said, engineers began scouting 
other sites, including the present location. 
</P>
<P>
 The project finally received approval late in the fall, after the County Board 
of Supervisors agreed that the threat of flooding was greatly increased by the 
Green Meadow fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the project is to catch debris from the hillsides that could 
clog flood channels. Once the growth has returned to fire-scarred hills, the 
ditch will be converted to a water detention basin, which would slow the flow 
of flood water during a major storm. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, county officials said, is a preventive measure that could protect 
hundreds of homes from being damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the county approved the project as an emergency measure, the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency agreed to provide 75% of the $878,453 needed to 
construct it. And the emergency nature of the project allowed the county to 
begin work without the normal environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the past two weeks, flood control division engineer Ed Gunen said 
pressure from state and federal agencies forced the county to install three 
monitoring wells that will determine if water being pumped from the basin is 
flowing into the wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 He said monitoring will begin in three weeks, once construction of the basin 
is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the monitoring reveal that water is being diverted from the wetland, 
the county will be forced to look for alternatives to pumping the ground water, 
said Ken Wilson, a Fish and Game environmental specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the Flood Control District, Wilson said alternatives could 
include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Not excavating the debris basin below the level of the ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ceasing the pumping of water from the basin entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pumping water during the rainy season only, and returning pumped water to 
recharge wells instead of pumping it into a storm drain. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunen said that the most likely solution would be to pump water only during 
the rainy season, and that the county has already planned to cease pumping in 
the summer. But to halt pumping entirely would diminish the effectiveness of 
the basin, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And county officials said Tuesday that halting excavation to wait for 
monitoring is not feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't turn a contract on and off like a spigot," Assistant County Counsel 
Daniel Murphy said at the council meeting. "If you did, you would incur 
tremendous liability" because the contractor could sue for breech of contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisorial candidate Trudi K. Loh offered up one tongue-in-cheek 
recommendation for dealing with the liability: "I suggest it come out of the 
supervisors' salaries, since they made the incorrect decision" when they voted 
to allow the project. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members Judy Lazar and Alex Fiore defended the supervisors' 
decision, noting that the declaration of emergency came shortly after the Green 
Meadow fire ravaged Newbury Park's hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 "In good faith, the Board of Supervisors did move to protect the residents of 
the Newbury Park area," Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the intentions, Mary Weisbrock, president of the environmental group 
Save Open Space, said she believed that construction should halt immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project is having a significant impact on the environment under the ruse 
that we have an emergency situation here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goulet said the emergency will persist for up to five years, until the 
fire-scarred hillsides recover and enough vegetation grows to anchor the dirt 
and prevent avalanches. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would feel rather foolish if you stopped work today and had a major 
gully-washer tomorrow," he said. "Watersheds don't heal in the course of one 
growing season. My board has told me we do have an imminent threat." 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials, who froze funds for the project when the environmental 
questions arose, said they will use today's meeting to better gauge the 
possible threats that arise from pumping the basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Goulet said he is confident that FEMA will eventually release the money.

RV PARK OPPONENTS VOW TO APPEAL CASE TO COASTAL COMMISSION; PORT HUENEME: THE 
CITY COUNCIL APPROVES THE PROJECT AT BEACHFRONT SITE. IF NECESSARY, RESIDENTS 
PLAN LEGAL ACTION IN ATTEMPT TO BLOCK THE PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Opponents of a proposed beachfront recreational resort in Port Hueneme say 
they will take their case to the California Coastal Commission now that the 
City Council has approved the proposal after a stormy meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 at a special meeting late Tuesday to approve the 
project despite protests from environmentalists and residents, who said it 
would harm a nearby wetland habitat and ruin their views of the ocean. 
Councilwoman Toni Young opposed the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's environmental impact report said that the recreational vehicle 
resort would cause minimal harm to its surrounding natural habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we will have any problems having it approved" by the Coastal 
Commission, Mayor Orvene Carpenter said.  
</P>
<P>
 But some residents of the Surfside III Condominium, a property adjacent to the 
proposed site, said they will continue efforts to stop the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will go in with our attorney and consultants and ask the Coastal 
Commission to deny the application to build the RV park," said Tom Brigham, 
president of the Surfside III Condominium Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Coastal Commission has already expressed reservations about the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have reviewed the most recent environmental report and there are still 
some issues that are unresolved," said Christopher Price, a Coastal Commission 
program analyst. "Once the city submits the proposal, we will be analyzing 
those issues for consistency with coastal act policies." 
</P>
<P>
 Price said that some concerns involve questions about the project's effect on 
the natural habitat of the coastal area and the use of coastal land. State laws 
give priority for coastal land use to operations that require the use of 
beachfront property. 
</P>
<P>
 "Highest priority (is given to) projects that cannot be located somewhere 
else, like boat rentals versus other types of developments that can be located 
somewhere else, such as a restaurant," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has proposed building the 144-space RV resort on a 10-acre beachfront 
site at the end of Ocean View Drive at Port Hueneme Beach Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Surfside III Condominium Homeowners Assn. and the Sierra Club 
said they will file a federal lawsuit against the city if the Coastal 
Commission approves the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Coastal Commission approves this project, this federal lawsuit will be 
the first of many suits we will bring," said Tom Brigham, president of the 
Surfside III Condominium Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit will be funded by the Sierra Club's national defense fund, Brigham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has maintained that the RV resort is the most feasible means for Port 
Hueneme to raise revenue without increasing taxes or assessments, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the homeowners of the 375 condominiums adjacent to the proposed 
site argue that the city is violating their property rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Some homeowners contend that when they purchased their properties in the 
1970s, the city promised them that Port Hueneme Beach would remain a park. But 
city officials have said they made no such assurances. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview after Tuesday's meeting, Councilwoman Young said she also 
expected that the area would remain undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I voted against (the resort) because the Coastal Commission originally said 
that the beach part should be open space and I think it should remain that 
way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Port Hueneme officials said the city has the legal right to amend 
city laws and zoning governing the use of coastal land, with approval from the 
state Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city's action to amend its zoning is by no means illegal," said Tom Figg, 
the city's director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
 Figg also disputed claims that the proposed RV resort would disturb the 
habitat of the California least tern, an endangered shorebird that nests on 
Ormond Beach, just south of the proposed site. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday marked the second time the council has voted to approve an 
environmental report for the project since it was first conceived in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1992, under pressure from the state Coastal Commission and the U.S. 
Fish & Wildlife Service, who questioned the project's environmental impact, the 
council sent the original environmental impact report back for revision. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission will review the city's application within 90 days of 
receiving it and will also hold a public hearing, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme Mayor Carpenter said the city expects the Coastal Commission 
hearing in August or September.

DEATH OF BOY HIT BY TRUCK CALLED ACCIDENT; INVESTIGATION: SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT 
SAYS NEITHER BUS DRIVER WHO DROPPED HIM OFF NOR TRUCK DRIVER IS TO BLAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The death of a Laguna Niguel boy struck by a pickup truck after he got off a 
school bus was "a tragic accident" that did not involve criminal conduct, an 
investigation by the Orange County Sheriff's Department concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the bus driver nor the truck driver was responsible for the death of 
7-year-old Thomas E. Lanni, according to the Sheriff's Department Major 
Accident Reconstruction Team. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas was hit on April 22 while crossing Aliso Niguel in front of the stopped 
school bus. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus's warning lights were not flashing to warn drivers that schoolchildren 
were disembarking. School bus drivers, however, are required to engage the 
flashing signals only if they know that children leaving the bus need to cross 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Thomas' bus driver did not know that at least three other children who 
got off at that stop had to cross Aliso Niguel to get home, he was not at fault 
for not turning on the lights, the report said.  
</P>
<P>
 State law allows vehicles on both sides of the street to pass a stopped school 
bus if the flashing lights are not in use, and the pickup truck was traveling 
within the posted speed limit of 30 m.p.h., according to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary cause of the accident was Thomas running or walking into the 
street in front of the school bus," according to the investigation.  
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office will review the investigation to determine if 
the bus driver violated the state vehicle code by failing to escort Thomas and 
at least three other children across the street, according to Sheriff's Lt. Dan 
Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 "The death of Thomas Lanni is a tragic accident that will never leave those 
involved," Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lanni family and their attorneys, who have filed a $10-million claim 
against the Capistrano Unified School District, sharply criticized the 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school district does drop off kids at stops currently without using 
flashing lights where the kids are crossing the street," said Roland J. 
Amundsen, one of the family's attorneys. "We know that. How could the bus 
driver not have that knowledge? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was an accident waiting to happen," Amundsen said, "and it still 
is, because they continue to make stops without using their flashing lights. 
All they have to do is flip a switch and all traffic stops. . . . Even if there 
weren't any kids crossing the street. Kids are kids, they could run out into 
the street." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, released after a review of the sheriff's probe, the school 
district said the findings "correctly reflect that the school district and the 
bus driver had no knowledge prior to the accident of any children crossing the 
street where the accident occurred.

BYSTANDERS RESCUE 2 AS HOUSE GOES UP IN FLAMES; FIRES: THE SCREAMING AND BADLY 
BURNED VICTIMS ARE CARRIED OUT OF THE DWELLING BY A ROOFER AND A NEIGHBOR. THE 
BLAZE STARTED IN A MATTRESS.

<P>
 Two quick-thinking bystanders Wednesday rescued two people who were badly 
burned when a smoldering mattress ignited a house fire, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure blaze, which broke out about 10 a.m. in the 19100 block of 
Community Street, erupted when fresh air provided oxygen to set the smoldering 
material aflame, said Michael Little, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys roofer Tim Agee was atop a home across the street from the fire and 
Franz Glubiak, a retired Rocketdyne worker who lives in the neighborhood, was 
standing outside his home when they heard screams for help and saw the smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were standing in the street about 50 yards away when we heard someone 
screaming, 'Help, fire!' and we saw the smoke," Glubiak said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran over there and the roofer came down and we saw the man and woman lying 
in the house and they were on fire." 
</P>
<P>
 As about 15 bystanders watched, Glubiak and Agee rushed into the house. They 
first pulled out a 37-year-old paraplegic man who was lying on the mattress as 
it burned. Then they went back in and aided a woman who had been carrying the 
mattress. She was badly burned around her head and neck, Agee said. The 
rescuers used their hands to put out the flames on both victims' bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who had also been carrying the mattress was able to escape from the 
house. A young boy inside the house escaped unharmed, Agee and Glubiak said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the rescue, Glubiak and Agee hooked up two garden hoses and extinguished 
the blaze before fire crews showed up about four minutes after receiving the 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials did not identify any of the fire victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Glubiak, 64, a former rescue worker in the coal mines of Belgium, said he is 
all too familiar with the scenario and acted from instinct when he heard the 
screams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew right away what I had to do," he said. "Get the people out and get the 
fire out." 
</P>
<P>
 Agee, 29, said he couldn't stand outside the home and do nothing while he 
listened to screams for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one else would go near the fire, but people were screaming and burning to 
death," Agee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got them just in time, because the hallway went up in flames just a second 
or two after that," Agee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The disabled victim was transported to Northridge Hospital Medical Center 
where he was treated for second- and third-degree burns to over 90% of his 
body, Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 The female victim also was taken to the Northridge hospital, where she was 
treated for second- and third-degree burns over 40% of her body, Little said. 
The man who got out of the house was treated for burns on 20% of his body at 
the West Hills Regional Medical Center, Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 firefighters worked less than 15 minutes to finish extinguishing the 
blaze, Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the fire is under investigation.

WOMAN TESTIFIES EX-BOYFRIEND KIDNAPED, RAPED, TORTURED HER FOR 3 DAYS; CRIME: 
THE 23-YEAR-OLD KOREAN TESTIFIES SHE WAS VICIOUSLY BEATEN; DEFENSE CALLS IT A 
DOMESTIC FIGHT. SUPERMARKET PATRONS HELD THE MAN FOR POLICE. 
</P>

<P>
 In a barely audible voice and with sometimes gruesome detail, a 23-year-old 
woman testified Wednesday to being kidnaped, raped and tortured for three days 
in April by her onetime boyfriend.  
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Robert Swasey is expected to decide today whether to hold the 
suspect, 19-year-old Michael Lim of Woodland Hills, over for trial. He is being 
charged with three counts of rape and one count each of kidnaping for the 
purpose of sexual conduct, torture and spousal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, speaking through an interpreter at the preliminary hearing, 
described a 1 1/2-year relationship that began in Seoul, South Korea, and ended 
last month in an apparent jealous rage. Her testimony did not make clear why 
Lim was jealous. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Harland Braun said that the charges filed against Lim were 
more serious than his actions merited, and that prosecutors were not taking 
into account cultural differences. Lim is an American citizen but was raised in 
South Korea. The woman is Korean. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have is a boyfriend/girlfriend fight," Braun said. "The penalty is 
so disproportionate to what their culture would do. In Korea, they would 
probably settle this between the families." 
</P>
<P>
 Police and prosecutors say the crime was unusually heinous. 
</P>
<P>
 Photos of the victim taken in the hospital show severe trauma, prosecutors 
said, with most of the skin missing from her buttocks and the backs of her 
thighs, as well as injuries to her feet, hands, face and head. 
</P>
<P>
 Other photos show two bent metal rods that police say were straight until Lim 
started beating the woman with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a question by Deputy Dist. Atty. Carole Chizever, the victim 
said, "The pipe became bent, so he came out with another pipe." Then she began 
crying after testifying without tears for more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suspect's father, Robert Lim, who flew to Los Angeles after 
receiving a call from his jailed son, the suspect and the victim began dating 
in Korea. Michael, he said, came to the United States about five months ago and 
was attending Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim said she arrived March 10 to go to school also, and Lim picked her 
up at the airport. One week later, she said, she received her first beating at 
the hands of the tall, handsome Lim after he didn't believe her story detailing 
what she did with girlfriends on a Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after that, she testified, Lim took her to his apartment, closed the 
windows and blinds and began beating her. 
</P>
<P>
 "After he hit me, he asked me to do the dishes," she said, and when she failed 
to finish washing them in a set 10-minute time limit, he beat her again. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, with most of her head covered by a black scarf, said Lim then cut 
off her hair with a paring knife and held the knife to her throat. 
</P>
<P>
 Lim was arrested April 3, the last day of the alleged three-day incident, 
after being held by patrons of a Vons supermarket who said they saw him beating 
the woman at the store. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary hearing is set to resume today at 9 a.m.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TEACHERS AT 2 SCHOOLS TO GRADE STUDENTS ON 
THEIR CLAS TEST ANSWERS; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS SAY THE MARKS WILL ALLOW 
IMMEDIATE ASSESSMENT OF PUPILS' PROGRESS. THERE WILL BE NO PENALTY FOR THOSE 
NOT TAKING THE CONTROVERSIAL EXAM. 
</P>

<P>
 Teachers at two Santa Clarita Valley schools plan to apply part of the 
controversial California Learning Assessment System test toward students' 
English grades, but there will be no penalty for students not taking the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at William S. Hart High School and Castaic Middle School said that a 
great deal of time is spent teaching students skills used during the five-day 
test, and that the grades will allow immediate assessment of their progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the students should have something to show for all the work they've 
done this week," said Alison Hunsaker, the sole eighth-grade teacher at Castaic 
Middle School whose students are taking the CLAS test this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials at three other Santa Clarita Valley school districts, which 
include only elementary schools, said they do not plan to grade students on the 
CLAS test. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure it's an appropriate use of this test, or any test, to make it a 
part of the ongoing, everyday assessment of a child," said Robert Nolet, 
superintendent of the Sulphur Springs Union School District. "Teachers have 
lots of other tools that are probably more meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saugus Union School District may incorporate problem-solving questions 
based on the CLAS test into traditional evaluation exams, allowing parents to 
see the questions and voice any objections, Supt. Troy Bramlett said. Grading 
would probably be based on how well a student could back up his or her opinion 
with research and logic, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that is part of what society is asking children to demonstrate, then our 
teachers better prepare our students for that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart is the only school within the six-campus William S. Hart Union High 
School District grading students taking the CLAS test, and Castaic Middle 
School is the only campus in the three-school Castaic Union School District 
doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the CLAS test -- given to fourth-, fifth-, eighth- and 10th-grade 
students -- contains essay questions challenging authority and traditional 
family values. State education officials are keeping the questions and 
students' answers on the test confidential so that the same test can be used in 
future years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunsaker said her students' grades on a 45-minute portion of the essay exam 
will not be influenced by the opinions they express. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to use the same criteria that I use for any student essay in class 
-- whether they followed the instructions given in the prompt and how clearly 
they convey their message," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart High School, where students are also taking the test this week, has been 
planning since March to grade 10th-grade students on both the essay and reading 
comprehension portions of the CLAS test, said Gary Wexler, curriculum director 
for the Hart district. 
</P>
<P>
 He said district officials believe that the state Department of Education 
approved the school's plans, but the decision will be verified in light of the 
recent controversy about the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the state Department of Education says, 'Whoa. With all the commotion 
going on, please hold on and don't do it,' than we wouldn't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susie Lang, spokeswoman for the education department, said she is uncertain if 
schools are allowed to grade students on the reading comprehension portion of 
the test. She said grading the written essays is permissible. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth-grade teachers may make copies of the test for grading, but teachers 
with CLAS students at other grade levels are only allowed to study the 
completed exams and make notes -- keeping the questions and answers 
confidential -- before sending them to the state, officials said. Hunsaker said 
her copies will be shredded after they are reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at both schools said the graded portion of the CLAS test will 
represent the same portion of each student's overall grade as other major exams 
-- about 50 out of 300 total points at Castaic Middle School, for example. 
Students exempted from the CLAS test by their parents will be allowed to take a 
substitute exam next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the 160 eighth-grade students at Castaic Middle School have been 
exempted from the exam, and parents of two students who did take the test have 
requested that their children's answers not be graded, Principal Beverly 
Silsbee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart High officials estimate that fewer than 20 of the more than 500 
10th-grade students have been exempted from the test.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ALL-DAY FORUM PLANNED ABOUT SANTA CLARA RIVER; 
ENVIRONMENT: FEDERAL AND COUNTY OFFICIALS AND ACTIVISTS WILL PARTICIPATE 
SATURDAY IN WHAT ORGANIZERS DESCRIBE AS A PUBLIC EDUCATION EVENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As private companies and public agencies make plans for the Santa Clara River, 
an environmental group hopes that an informed public will help keep the 
100-mile-long waterway from harm. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, the Friends of the Santa Clara River have planned an all-day 
forum about the river and its future beginning at 8:30 a.m. Saturday at the 
Ranch House Inn, 27413 Tourney Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and county officials familiar with river issues and activists 
concerned about the river are scheduled to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a public education event, mainly," said Ron Bottorff, chairman of the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum is co-sponsored by the Santa Clarita Organization for Planning the 
Environment and the Ventura Audubon Society. About 70 people are expected to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled speakers include Cat Brown of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service; 
Dave Smith, federal Environmental Protection Agency; Jim Danza, Friends of the 
Los Angeles River; Larry Rose, Ventura County Agricultural Land Trust; Lynne 
Plambeck, Newhall County Water District; and Don Davis, Ventura Audubon 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clara River flows from Acton to the Pacific Ocean near Oxnard, 
crossing through the Santa Clarita Valley, where the forum is being held. This 
program comes at a time when increasing attention is being paid to the river by 
dozens of public agencies and a developer that owns land along several miles of 
its banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Coastal Conservancy, with support from 25 other agencies 
ranging from cities along the waterway to state and federal wildlife groups, is 
now working on an enhancement and management plan for the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Phase 1 of the plan, defining the path of the river and listing its historical 
changes, has been completed. Phase 2, which will address the plan's management, 
will get under way this year, Bottorff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's off the ground, but the really nitty-gritty work is still ahead," 
Bottorff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Newhall Land and Farming Co. recently released its management 
ideas for 15 miles of the river. Newhall's plan outlines 49 changes to the 
waterway -- bridges, levees, bank controls -- over the next 15 to 20 years and 
is up for approval by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the interest stirred by the Newhall Land permit process is probably 
going to raise some more things to talk about," Bottorff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for preserving the river's natural soft bottom and adding 
materials to riverbank sections where erosion occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10% of the 1,300 acres of river land addressed by the document would be 
somehow modified, with a net addition of five acres of riverbed. The work 
regulates the river's path without narrowing the banks and covering them with 
concrete.

School District school board post, which opened in March with the resignation 
of newly elected board member Peter Warren. They have opted to fill the seat 
via appointment to avoid the cost of a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hart district governs Santa Clarita's three high schools and three junior 
high schools, with one more of each scheduled to open this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates are George Aliano, a police officer; Adrienne Asarch, a 
teacher; Robert Crockett, an attorney; Bruce Fox, a police officer; Bill 
Manetta, president of the Santa Clarita Water Co.; Ronnie Silver, a newspaper 
columnist; James Temple, a computer lab technician for College of the Canyons, 
and Art Wilde, a telecommunications manager for AT&T. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox was a trustee for the Castaic Union School District, but stepped down in 
December after moving.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilde served on the Sulphur Springs Union School District board. He didn't 
plan to run for reelection in November, but mounted a last-minute, unsuccessful 
write-in campaign after seeing who the other candidates were. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren, 36, resigned in March, 105 days after he was elected to the post. He 
was elected to the second of three open seats and was the only candidate to 
support the defeated school voucher initiative.  
</P>
<P>
 Warren, a civil engineer, told fellow trustees that he was going to work for a 
year as a consultant to a development company in Canada.

A LIFE STORY WOVEN OF TRUTH AND FICTION; ONCE UPON A TIME BY JOHN BARTH ; 
LITTLE BROWN $23.95, 398 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES BOOK CRITIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It must be an uneasy thing for a fiction writer to attempt a memoir. Suddenly, 
the same life on which imaginary cattle have been grazing is stampeded by 
ravenous fact-bent goats who will leave no clod untrampled nor grass blade 
unchewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Unease masters John Barth's talky hybrid, "Once Upon a Time." An 
autobiographical story is gingerly conducted through its verbal fireworks but 
it is given no peace and not much scope. Like a penitent switching from 
confessional to confessional lest any one particular priest get a fix on him, 
Barth keeps shifting narrative modes from real to fictional to hyper-real to 
metafictional. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the Barth who gets reviewed: the author of 11 books, starting with 
"The Floating Opera" and running through "The Sotweed Factor," "Giles Goatboy" 
and "The Last Voyage of Somebody the Sailor." He is a retired Johns Hopkins 
professor, a literary lecturer long in demand around the United States and 
abroad, and a graybeard living a long and happy second marriage on the 
Chesapeake Bay shore and cruising overnight on a well-appointed sloop. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the Barth who, with his wife, takes a realistic but fictional sail. 
After some argument -- how splendidly he portrays the pains and strengths of a 
long marriage -- he insists upon pressing on, despite an approaching hurricane. 
They are blown all around the bay -- a splendid amateur's ordeal -- and shelter 
in a marshy labyrinth of canals. Putt-putting through the canals by dinghy to 
find a way out, he gets lost -- again, splendidly. 
</P>
<P>
 The lostness turns emblematic, like Dante's; and, like the middle-aged Dante, 
Barth comes upon two guides with whom he will explore, debate, fantasize and 
turn inside-out the story and meaning of his life and art. One is his twin 
sister, Jill; the other an imaginary, preachy, irritable "counter-self" named 
Jay Wordsworth Scribner. (At other times he is called Schreiber, which is 
German for writer ; and Scribner, of course, comes from scrivener .)  
</P>
<P>
 Every step of the way is a battle between what is told and the author's 
commentary on how he is telling it. He tells, he conducts -- and he tells us 
how he is conducting. There is a play on narrative time so elaborate that I 
lost its thread; something about the author simultaneously speaking at the 
start of the book and the finish, several years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Threads are essential to labyrinths, but so is wanting to get through them; if 
the wanting flags, losing the thread matters less. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, Barth has a story to tell and much of what he tells is provocative. 
But as one of the earliest of our postmodernists -- his first novel was 
published in 1956 -- he had a young man's quarrel with straight narration, and 
today he has the veteran's loyalty to his old war. You write and you write of 
yourself writing, and of the possibility of writing differently. 
</P>
<P>
 When it works -- how well it worked with "The Floating Opera" -- it gives a 
complex and haunting resonance to the narrative; overtones on a mute string. 
But in a number of Barth's later works, and for much of this one, it is a 
mechanical contrivance that all too often draws attention toward the speaker's 
effort and away from his speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The sections about his childhood in Tidewater, Md., his gentle, incompetent 
parents, his early explorations of jazz, are interesting but distracted. He 
doesn't give himself to them; he is too busy inflecting them. He tells us 
something about his first marriage, which eroded gradually over 20 years, but 
his reticence is such that we are spared not merely indiscretions but any sense 
whatever of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a brief, beautifully rendered account of falling in love with the 
former student who became his second wife, and reticence settles in again. We 
don't require the memorialist's details; we do require his commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 There are flashes of Barth's prestidigitator ingenuity; and why quarrel with 
the hat if a rabbit does indeed come out of it? Too often none does. The 
author's quarrelsome dialogues with Scribner, his counter-self, hardly differ 
from someone talking to himself, in fact, and at great length. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand there is a memorable running account of the pain, phobias 
and manias that attend the writer's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Barth writes a bravura passage about his fountain pens; an even better one 
about the 40-year-old college binder in which all his first drafts have been 
written. His struggle to get "The Floating Opera" published -- six publishers 
rejected it and at one point his agent, a kindly Alabamian who loved to hunt, 
offered to send 600 pounds of frozen moose to keep him and his family going -- 
is a memorable mix of comedy and agony. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the glimpses of real things, surviving Barth's insistence on spinning 
them, that give this book its value. Postmodernist devices don't suit a memoir. 
The past, after all, is a shadow; it needs constructing, not the reverse.

 The Movie: "That's Entertainment! III." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: The stars of MGM musicals of the late '30s through the late '50s 
introduce footage and outtakes from the films (including "Till the Clouds Roll 
By," pictured above). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designers: Adrian, Walter Plunkett, Helen Rose and Irene. All 
except Plunkett were full-time studio employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Before there was black-spandex attitude, as seen on MTV, there was 
style. Sure, there were duds aplenty, but when the studio costume departments 
were in full swing, the sewing machines churned out some real showstoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hit: Don't miss such scene-stealers as Carmen Miranda in "Nancy Goes to Rio," 
who wears a headdress of paper cocktail umbrellas, courtesy of Rose. But the 
less-is-more approach proves timeless. Rose and Plunkett show a great 
understanding of throwaway chic in dressing Cyd Charisse for a dance number in 
"It's Always Fair Weather." Picture a straight skirt, just below the knees, a 
turtleneck sweater, belt and pumps. Gene Kelly wears the equivalent in such 
films as "Summer Stock," in which he leaps through the sky in rolled-up 
trousers, jersey top, two-tone penny loafers and white socks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trend Watch: Tuxedos and tails span the heyday of musicals. Eleanor Powell 
leads the way in a swank tail suit and top hat in "Broadway Melody of 1938," 
followed by Fred Astaire in a tail suit in "Ziegfeld Follies" (1946), and Judy 
Garland in her signature tuxedo jacket and tights in an "Easter Parade" outtake 
(1948) and in "Summer Stock" (1950). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miss: The unsupervised wardrobes of the movie's contemporary narrators 
underscore how desperately some stars require fashion direction. Seeing Ann 
Miller and Esther Williams in luncheon suits and trousers makes one crave Liza 
Minnelli, a vision in Halston and Elsa Peretti jewelry, in the original "That's 
Entertainment!"

O.C. JAZZ REVIEW; BENNETT FLIES 'EM TO THE MOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He's the current darling of the MTV set, seen crooning recently in the company 
of k.d. lang, Elvis Costello, Dinosaur Jr.'s J. Mascis and members of the Red 
Hot Chili Peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tony Bennett's heart is still with the generation that's followed his 
career for its entire 45-year run. And theirs are still with him, as was 
apparent during his appearance with Rosemary Clooney on Tuesday at the Anaheim 
Convention Center in front of 6,000 members of the American Assn. of Retired 
Persons. 
</P>
<P>
 That Bennett, 67, has such cross-generational appeal should come as no 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 He pushes the "great American songbook," the music of the '30s, '40s and '50s 
from such respected composers as Cole Porter, the Gershwins, Irving Berlin and 
Jerome Kern that can speak across the years. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's Bennett's enthusiasm for the material, and the sheer strength with 
which he presents it, that makes him a national musical treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 With two oversized video screens on either side of the stage, Bennett was 
introduced by Clooney as a friend who "never compromised" and "has no peer."  
</P>
<P>
 Cupping the microphone in both hands close to his heart, Bennett swung into 
"Old Devil Moon," trailing teasingly behind the beat, then delivering an 
impressively long-held tone while the 16-piece orchestra swirled through its 
closing. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer's tone might not be as pure as it once was. But its attractive 
qualities -- a woody timbre and clean, often vibrato-less delivery -- are 
beautifully intact. And Bennett's phrasing has never been better, as he moved 
in and around the rhythms with the greatest of ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Often when beginning tunes, he was interrupted by applause that greeted the 
first line of familiar lyrics. Yet he managed to fit in every word without a 
missed beat after waiting for it to subside. 
</P>
<P>
 He continued with songs that drew "ahs" and some singing from the crowd as 
each one's identity became apparent: "It Had to Be You," "Just in Time," "Fly 
Me to the Moon." But he also did newer numbers, such as Charles DeForest's 
"When Do the Bells Ring for Me," that fit easily into the popular American 
canon. 
</P>
<P>
 All were delivered with the passion that has made Bennett famous, and the big 
endings that have become his trademark. He was especially moving through a 
ballad-paced version of "Autumn Leaves." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett showed his skill at jazz rhythms during a trio of Duke Ellington tunes 
that featured the members of his excellent touring trio: pianist and musical 
director Ralph Sharon, bassist Doug Richeson and drummer Clayton Cameron, who 
put on a dramatic technical display with a single snare drum and a pair of 
brushes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a scene reminiscent of arena rock concerts (as well as the big-band swing 
era), a crush of fans crowded in front of the stage as Bennett drew his set to 
a close. With cries of "Tony! Tony!" echoing from autograph seekers, the 
vocalist signed what programs he could while continuing his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The opening appearance by Clooney was more satisfying for its nostalgic value 
than its musical attributes. Though Clooney's voice has gone south since her 
heyday, she, like Bennett, doesn't let it keep her from delivering with 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Appropriately, she opened with "Sentimental Journey," then progressed through 
"They're Either Too Young or Too Old," "I'll Be Seeing You" "Hey There" (from 
"The Pajama Game"), and "How Are Things in Glocca Morra?" before doing her 
bygone hit "Come On-a My House." 
</P>
<P>
 As with Bennett, Clooney's greatest strength is her phrasing. She has an 
assured, jazzy way with a lyric and knows how to place a word just so for 
maximum effect. Her voice was at its best during "Our Love Is Here to Stay," 
when her tone regained some of its attractive, youthful clarity. 
</P>
<P>
 Clooney's most entertaining moments came between numbers as the 65-year-old 
singer chatted easily with the crowd about her grandchildren ("Grandparents and 
their grandchildren get along so well because they have a common enemy"), life 
next door to Ira Gershwin and how she's often asked to do songs popularized by 
other singers of her generation ("I get a lot of requests for (the Patti Page 
hit) 'How Much Is That Doggie in the Window' "). 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, whose between-song banter often seemed contrived, could take a lesson 
from her. 
</P>
<P>
 If the MTV generation is looking for icons to embrace in addition to Bennett, 
it would do well to look to Clooney, a survivor who has maintained her dignity 
despite a number of well-publicized problems. 
</P>
<P>
 One can't help but wish that Kurt Cobain could have found a way out of his 
despair by reading Clooney's autobiography and seeing the determination with 
which she's faced her career and life.

 BIENVENIDOS: Today is Cinco de Mayo, a day Mexican-Americans celebrate their 
heritage and commemorate a key date in Mexican history. (A5) . . . About 20% of 
Orange County residents told the U.S. Census in 1990 they were of Mexican 
heritage, and the number seems to be growing. However, Orange County, which was 
the No. 3 U.S. destination for Mexican immigrants in 1992, fell to No. 6 in 
1993, immigration officials say. Why the drop? The recession, says Chapman 
University economist Esmael Adibi: "There aren't as many jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 CONSULAR ART: Santa Ana, the county seat and the heart of the Mexican-American 
community here, is also home to the local Mexican Consulate, one of nine such 
government offices in California representing Mexican citizens and their 
interests. . . . It is observing Cinco de Mayo by exhibiting the works of 22 
contemporary artists from the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon. "We want people to 
know our art, our culture and the diversity of Mexican expression," says 
Mexican Consul Felipe Soria. 
</P>
<P>
 EL REY: El Vez, the "Mexican Elvis" who will perform today at Cal State 
Fullerton (F2), says he's got lots of material to choose from. "I don't feel 
restricted in any way," says Robert Lopez, who is El Vez. "There's so much in 
the Elvis catalogue. . . . Then you take the whole Mexican idea." Lopez is one 
of dozens of musicians performing throughout the county in celebration of Cinco 
de Mayo. "It's a California product," he says of his act, "with mixing and 
melding and blending the way Californians do." 
</P>
<P>
 BUSY: Besides El Vez, there's a host of celebrations scheduled today and on 
through the weekend. (OC Live!) On the calendar: a street festival in Santa Ana 
and a dance festival at UCI today. Saturday, there's a fiesta in San Clemente 
and another in San Juan Capistrano. . . . "It's an emphasis on youth," says San 
Juan Capistrano's Maricella Moreno, talking about the festival at the library 
near the mission. Mexican Heritage

 UNO IN CHINA: Numero Uno is living up to its name. The Van Nuys-based chain 
has set up shop in the city of Shenzhen, claiming to be the first American 
pizzeria to open an outlet in mainland China's Free Trade Zone. . . . The 
Chinese Uno, however, won't be exactly the same. "The pizzas are substantially 
smaller," company President Ron Gelet said. "The Chinese don't have the same 
appetite as we do." 
</P>
<P>
 POPULAR DOGS: The phones at the West Valley Animal Shelter never stopped 
ringing Wednesday, and no wonder. In all, hundreds called in hopes of adopting 
the homeless yellow Labrador retriever and her 11 pups featured in Wednesday's 
Times. . . . The lucky winner was radio talk-show host Dr. Laura Schlessinger 
and her family, who will keep the mother and one puppy, and give the rest away. 
"It's Mother's Day, and I'm mushy," she said. 
</P>

 FITTING IN: Girl Scouts, besides serving humanity, have a right to look good 
too. Why should they have to wear outfits that fell out of fashion years ago? 
So, starting this month, the girls (ages 8 to 11) are donning new duds, above, 
sporting a more stylish jade instead of Kelly green. . . . "It's what kids 
would wear these days," a San Fernando Valley Girl Scout Council official said. 
</P>

 ANGEL IN WAITING: G. C. (Brodie) Broderson, 64, isn't ready to give up the 
fight against crime. Broderson, a Guardian Angel, wants to set up a foot patrol 
on Sepulveda Boulevard in Van Nuys to chase away prostitutes and drug dealers 
(B3). . . . So far, however, no motels have given the Angels permission to 
patrol their properties. 
</P>
<P>
 PUNISHMENT: The practice of swatting a player, called "the block," may be 
outlawed, but that doesn't stop Granada Hills High baseball Coach Darryl Stroh 
from wishing that he could turn back the clock. He called it a "wonderful way 
of encouraging attitude adjustment." . . . Meanwhile, Simi Valley High Coach 
Mike Scyphers remains under investigation for using the method (C1). Michael

 CINCO DE MAYO: Oxnard College holds a series of events today to commemorate 
the Mexican victory over occupying French forces at the battle of Puebla on May 
5, 1882. . . . Although widely celebrated in the United States, Cinco de Mayo 
is actually a minor holiday in Mexico. There, the big day is Sept. 16, the 
anniversary of the call to independence from Spain. Armando Lopez, an Oxnard 
business consultant, said Mexican leaders are often surprised at the emphasis 
on May 5. "I've had a number of them ask me, 'What's the big deal?' "

 PARTY UNITY: Simi Valley Councilwoman Sandi Webb is not your typical fan of 
radio shock jock Howard Stern. But she's supporting Stern's bid for governor of 
New York. He's running as a member of Webb's Libertarian Party. . . . Stern's 
dicey comments have attracted a national audience and many complaints to the 
feds. Webb appreciates Stern's fight for free speech. "The fact that he is 
outspoken on the air is fine with me," she said. She has heard Stern's show 
only a few times. "My husband listens to it all of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 BIRD-DOGGING: Chris Faanes is hardly your typical bird-watcher. The 
42-year-old Ventura resident spends most of his free time and disposable income 
jetting across America in pursuit of one bird or another (Ventura County Life, 
Page 8). . . . The trained ornithologist's weekends are filled with close 
encounters of the compulsive kind. According to his tallies, he has spotted 
1,627 out of the 1,850 species in North America. Faanes recognizes his 
compulsion: "Pretty bad, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 HARD BALL: Simi Valley High baseball coach Mike Scyphers came out swinging 
Wednesday, dismissing as "ludicrous" suggestions that he improperly rented out 
the school's baseball field to an adult baseball organization (C1). . . . 
Meanwhile, parents rallied behind Scyphers at Wednesday's game against Thousand 
Oaks. They angrily denounced the suspension of the successful coach while 
police officers probe what they call possible financial improprieties.

 The explosion occurred after midnight as Hindus set off firecrackers during a 
religious procession. One of them landed in the warehouse in Chikhalthane

JIM MURRAY: FOR KING, A HEAVY PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are certain verities we live by. Who controls the Dardanelles controls 
Asia Minor. Who controls the high ground controls the battlefield. Who controls 
the oceans rules the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Sport has its equivalents. And one of them is that whoever would control 
boxing must control the heavyweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a notion that makes Don King gnash his teeth. You might say, it makes 
his hair stand on end. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout history, the great promoters -- whom King would emulate -- have 
more or less owned the heavyweight title. Tex Rickard needed Jack Dempsey. Mike 
Jacobs had Joe Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all very well to make do with the occasional lightweight champion or 
middleweight titleholder, but the heavyweight is top of the line. He is the 
glamour figure of his sport. He reels in the millions, sets the tone of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight game is in the doldrums right now. Reason: It has no heavyweight 
champion worthy of the name. The titleholders are a colorless, almost 
anonymous, pseudo-champion lot. They cannot walk into a room and have heads 
turn the way a Louis or Dempsey or Muhammad Ali could. A heavyweight champion 
is ordinarily the most recognizable sports figure on the planet. But these guys 
have to carry calling cards. You should win a lottery if you can pick Michael 
Moorer or Lennox Lewis out of a crowd of cab drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no secret the real champion is in the Indiana state pen. Mike Tyson could 
stop traffic on any street corner in America, maybe the world. Ali could draw a 
crowd in Patagonia. Lennox Lewis would have to produce identification to buy a 
dinner in his hometown, whereas Ali never even needed a passport. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoter King sees himself as straining to keep boxing alive in this 
interregnum. He has had to make do with the next-best thing to a heavyweight 
champion -- a lightweight and featherweight brawler who had never been beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Cesar Chavez was a tough, relentless little warrior who made his fight 
like a guy chopping a tree. There wasn't much scientific about Chavez, but he 
was as exciting as a tropical storm. He was loved in Mexico, admired in the 
United States and feared by guys who had to fight him anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 He won titles in the backwaters of the boxing realm, the makeshift 
championships with the belittling adjectives in their titles. Years ago, the 
fight game used to have "junior" lightweights and "junior" welterweights before 
the denigrating character of these labels hit home. The only regular title that 
had a hyphenated designation in the old days was the "light" heavyweight 
championship, and the sport found out early how even this minor qualification 
cheapened the championship. No one ever knew or cared who the light-heavyweight 
champion was. He deferred to the unqualified heavyweight champion in purses, 
fame, drawing power and worldwide charisma. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight game learned from this to the extent it realized labeling was 
important. Thereafter the junior-lightweight champion gave way to the 
super-featherweight champion and the junior-welterweight became the 
super-lightweight. Madison Avenue came to the fight game. 
</P>
<P>
 King began to lose his sub-heavyweight meal ticket when, for the first time in 
90 fights, Chavez didn't win in San Antonio last September. True, he didn't 
lose, either. He got an undeserved draw against Pernell Whitaker, a boxer so 
light-hitting his nickname is "Sweet Pea." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in January, they brought in little-known Frankie Randall, a boxer so 
lightly rated he dropped out of the game altogether for two years. Randall was 
believed to be that all-purpose foil of the fight game, "strictly an opponent." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the "opponent" thrashed Chavez. Chavez not only lost the fight, he was 
unceremoniously dumped on his backside with a left-right combination in the 
11th round. No one else had ever floored Chavez. By the end of the fight, 
Chavez's face looked like a pizza with everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Don King, so to speak, was leveraged out. Without Chavez, he had no hole 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, a little thing like having no legitimate champion cannot be 
expected to discourage Don King. He thrives on illusion. His idol, to give you 
an idea, is P.T. Barnum. Lots of people in this world look up to saints or 
statesmen or war heroes; King's role model is the man who said there was a 
sucker born every minute and who made the world think there were headless 
ladies, wolf boys, mind readers and talking horses. 
</P>
<P>
 So, King is not a man to take the count on one knee. Accordingly, he proposes 
to take up the slack in our pugilistic entertainment by putting on a card he 
calls "Revenge!" What it is, of course, is just a bunch of sequels. Remakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez-Randall II is one of the four title fights (super-lightweight) on the 
King card at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall is a personable enough nobody whose interesting characteristic to this 
chronicler is that he can't see without glasses. A blood brother. He has 
astigmatism, which means he might rap out at the TOZ (or LPED) line on the eye 
chart. 
</P>
<P>
 It also means he might have to fight Chavez by ear. Nearsightedness would seem 
to be a fatal drawback in a fighter going up against Chavez because if there's 
one thing you might want, it is to be able to see perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, of course, faulty vision might explain Randall's victory in 
the first fight. To see Chavez coming at you with murder in his heart is to 
fear him. If Randall had to fight him by Braille, it would be a little less 
terrifying. 
</P>
<P>
 King's card holds out promise for vengeance for Terry Norris against Simon 
Brown, James Leija against Azumah Nelson and Julian Jackson against Gerald 
McClellan, but the reversal King will be looking for will be Chavez against 
Randall. 
</P>
<P>
 For the real fight fan, probably any one of King's four fights will be better 
than, say, a Riddick Bowe-Moorer fight. Or the Evander Holyfield-Moorer fight. 
But real revenge for King will be getting the heavyweight title back. It's the 
one championship that doesn't need "super" in its title. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I promote like Mike Todd! P.T. Barnum! I keep the show going!" trumpets 
King. "Look at the historic fitness of these fights! An all-time dream card! 
It's high time we put boxing into the 21st Century!" 
</P>
<P>
 And what of a return, a revenge by Tyson? "It will be nice to have a 
heavyweight champ who doesn't have to fight a contender who's a) over 40; b) a 
drunk; c) overweight; or d) a drug addict!" shouts King. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnum couldn't have said it better.

MCNALL TO SELL CFL'S ARGONAUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 King owner Bruce McNall's sports empire continues to shrink with an agreement 
to sell the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League to Toronto-based 
The Sports Network for about $4.5 million (U.S.), sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale, expected to be announced today in Toronto, has been in the works for 
weeks, but was delayed by the March death of comic actor John Candy, one of 
McNall's partners in the team. TSN is the Canadian equivalent of ESPN and is a 
subsidiary of Labatt's Breweries, whose sports investments include the Toronto 
Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall has been shopping the team around for about one year. The franchise has 
been a major liability for McNall, posting significant losses since he bought 
the team in 1991 with partners Candy and Wayne Gretzky from Beverly Hills 
sports investor Harry Ornest. 
</P>
<P>
 "As time passed, the difficulties of running a business 3,000 miles away took 
its toll on the ownership group," McNall said in confirming the sale. "We would 
have liked to dedicate more time to the development of the CFL in Toronto, but 
after an exhilarating, yet exhausting first year, the realization of full 
hands-on ownership became more complex with everyone's schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 One source familiar with the team's finances estimated the overall loss on the 
Argonauts will eventually range from $10 million to $15 million. A spokesman 
for McNall declined comment on the prospective sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale comes as McNall is trying to sell a 72% stake in the Kings for $60 
million to telecommunications executive Jeffrey P. Sudikoff and entertainment 
executive Joseph M. Cohen as part of a plan in which McNall is trying to shed a 
$92-million debt to Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources also said that proceeds from the Argonauts sale are expected to go to 
Ornest and Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
 In other McNall developments Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Efforts continue to placate angered creditors, who could derail the Kings 
sale by trying to force McNall's operations into involuntary bankruptcy 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three lenders are known to have complained about changes in the Kings 
sale made over the weekend that would cut the amount of cash that would flow to 
McNall creditors. Sources identified the three creditors as the French bank 
Credit Lyonnais, Dutch-owned European American Bank and IBJ Schroder Bank & 
Trust, a unit of the Industrial Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A federal grand jury looking into whether McNall has falsified loan 
documents has been seated and is beginning to hear testimony, sources said. In 
addition, they said, the FBI has been interviewing executives surrounding 
McNall. Lawyers for McNall have confirmed the investigation, but add that they 
believe no action will be taken when it concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only a skeleton crew remains at McNall's business operations in Century 
City. A lawyer for real estate firm JMB, which owns the building where McNall 
kept his offices and which is suing a McNall-affiliated company for back rent, 
confirmed that the offices will be vacated voluntarily soon and that it is 
already being shown to prospective tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Argonauts were a high profile investment in 1991 when McNall bought the 
team from Ornest, who is vice chairman of Hollywood Park. The team won Canada's 
Grey Cup championship in the first year the McNall group owned the club. Its 
biggest deal was signing Notre Dame's Rocket Ismail to a four-year, $18 million 
contract, the majority of which was a personal services contract with McNall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ismail, who now plays for the Raiders, claims he is still owed the final two 
years of that contract of about $9 million. McNall has disputed the claim, 
saying that Ismail did not live up to the requirements of the contract that he 
promote both the team and the league.

LYNAM QUITS 76ER POST TO COACH, REVIVE BULLETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Lynam will return to the sideline after two years in the front office. 
</P>
<P>
 He takes over for Wes Unseld as coach of the Washington Bullets after two 
seasons as general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers. It's his third stint as 
an NBA head coach, having previously led the Clippers and Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
 He inherits a Washington team that went 24-58 last season and has not made the 
playoffs in six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed coaching. There's no doubt in my mind," Lynam said when he was 
introduced Wednesday. "As a general manager, you're not as involved with the 
players and your involvement in the immediate competition is a step removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that I went to the games and said every night, 'I wish I was down 
there on the sideline.' But I had been coaching all my life, and I saw this as 
a terrific opportunity for me and this franchise." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington General Manager John Nash held the same post with the 76ers when 
Lynam coached them from 1988-92. They are close friends and, after Unseld 
resigned, Nash immediately pursued Lynam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've watched him instruct, motivate and get the most out of his players," 
Nash said. "He's going to have a terrific run here in Washington. I'm convinced 
of that. I would stack Jim Lynam's coaching ability against anyone else in the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullets have been rebuilding for several years, and Lynam said there is 
still plenty of work to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynam, 52, didn't have much to work with when he took over for Matt Guokas as 
Philadelphia's coach in the middle of the 1987-88 season. The 76ers went 16-23 
the rest of that year, but Philadelphia made the playoffs three consecutive 
times after that and also captured an Atlantic Division title. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynam hopes to do something similar with the youthful Bullets, who could 
certainly use some direction after last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've been identified as being a pretty good motivator of players," 
Lynam said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynam, who had a coaching record of 246-264 with the Clippers and 76ers, might 
have trouble getting the Bullets into the playoffs next season. But owner Abe 
Pollin is convinced the team is headed in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want another ring and I'm not going to quit until I get another ring," 
Pollin said, referring to the franchise's last NBA title in 1978. "I think Jim 
is one of the guys who can help bring us that ring."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; BOY, 15, THREW BALL FROM UPPER DECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities have discovered the perpetrators of the incident Sunday in which 
Angel reliever Joe Grahe was hit in the neck by a baseball thrown from the 
upper deck at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Mills, president of the Oceanside America Little League, said Wednesday 
that a 15-year-old boy from his league threw the baseball. The boy was provoked 
by five of his friends, Mills said, who dared him to throw the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of Little League is developing character," Mills said. "Obviously, some 
people have this to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no arrests, but the six boys involved have been instructed to write 
formal letters of apologies to Grahe, the Angel organization and General 
Manager Bill Bavasi. 
</P>
<P>
 Grahe was pleased authorities have identified the culprits. He does not want 
to press charges but still is disturbed by their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being 15 years old isn't an excuse," Grahe said. "I knew the difference 
between right and wrong." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Angel starter Mark Langston's simulated game has been pushed up to Saturday, 
and if everything goes well, Manager Buck Rodgers said Langston could start 
Wednesday against the Texas Rangers. If not, he likely would start the 
following weekend against the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston, who has been on the disabled list since undergoing arthroscopic 
elbow surgery April 12, is expected to replace Phil Leftwich (0-4, 6.82 
earned-run average) in the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 John Farrell continues to pitch impressively at triple-A Vancouver, completing 
his third game of the season Tuesday, but the Angels will delay his arrival 
unless starter Mark Leiter struggles. Farrell leads the Pacific Coast League in 
complete games, strikeouts (30), and innings pitched (44). 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Just how much advice is Chuck Finley getting these days to solve his woes? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pumping gas the other day and a guy came up to me to tell me what I'm 
doing wrong," said Finley, who is winless in six starts. "I felt like saying, 
'Hey, I don't tell you how to put your lug nuts on.' " BOB NIGHTENGALE

SHUMARD STEPS DOWN AT FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Shumard's turbulent, three-year tenure as Cal State Fullerton athletic 
director came to an end Wednesday, when he announced his resignation, effective 
May 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably never being able to turn the corner with the program was my biggest 
disappointment," Shumard said. "Maybe new leadership will accelerate the 
healing." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard's three years were marked by unrest among student-athletes over cuts 
in the program -- including the termination of football -- and two 
controversial cases stemming from an ill-fated attempt to drop women's 
volleyball in January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Huffman, the volleyball coach at the time, was the big winner in both. 
First, he successfully fought in the courts the following March to have the 
program restored. Then, after he was subsequently fired, he successfully proved 
in a wrongful termination suit that his contract was not renewed in 
retaliation, and he won a $1.35-million judgment plus substantial court costs 
against the school last February. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury said Shumard and Jack Bedell, another university official, had fired 
Huffman with "callous disregard" to Huffman's First Amendment rights and that 
Shumard had acted with "fraud, malice and oppression." Shumard was ordered to 
pay $3,000 in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard, 43, said "the outcome of that trial was painful to me, and what 
bothered me most was that there were 12 people in Orange County who believe I 
was that person." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard said he felt he had been supported by the university after the verdict 
-- which is under appeal -- and that he felt no pressure to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he was hired in August, 1991, Shumard had been an assistant athletic 
director at USC for three years. With the Dodgers from 1975-88, he had been 
director of community services and special events and had worked in the public 
relations department. 
</P>
<P>
 School President Milton Gordon issued a statement saying the school would name 
an acting director and begin a search for a permanent one as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Bill Shumard considers new interests, I know the Titan family joins me in 
wishing him well," Gordon said.

CROLL, CAUTHEN ELECTED TO HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Jimmy Croll, jockey Steve Cauthen and champion sprinter Ta Wee, all 
with connections to Kentucky Derby favorite Holy Bull, have been elected to the 
Racing Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Polling of 100 turf writers was announced Wednesday at Churchill Downs. Others 
elected were Arts And Letters, horse of the year in 1969; Eight Thirty, a top 
handicap horse in the early 1940s, and Flatterer, the champion steeplechase 
horse from 1984-1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Croll trains Holy Bull, Cauthen was the regular rider of Great Above, the sire 
of the colt, and Ta Wee was Great Above's dam. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his pedigree, which consists mostly of sprinters, Holy Bull is 
considered vulnerable in Saturday's Derby, a 1 1/4-mile race. Cauthen said he 
was leaning toward picking Strodes Creek to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great Above was a high-priced claiming horse who got good," Cauthen said. 
"But he was strictly a sprinter." 
</P>
<P>
 Cauthen was 18 when he rode Affirmed to victories in the 1978 Kentucky Derby, 
Preakness and Belmont, sweeping the Triple Crown. The next year he went to 
England, where he won the Epsom Derby with Slip Anchor and Reference Point. He 
also won the French Derby, the Irish Derby and the Italian Derby. Cauthen 
retired in 1992 and is now associate vice president of Turfway Park in 
Florence, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference at Churchill Downs, Croll, 74, was emotional after the 
announcement.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the Hall of Fame honor made his week, Croll said: "It's a good 
start." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Holy Bull, other important horses trained by Croll include Mr. 
Prospector, Bet Twice and Housebuster. 
</P>
<P>
 Arts And Letters finished second to Majestic Prince in the Kentucky Derby and 
Preakness, then won the Belmont, the Travers and the Jockey Club Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Ta Wee was a filly who frequently beat males, one of those occasions being the 
Fall Highweight Handicap at Belmont Park under 140 pounds in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hall of Fame inductions are scheduled for Aug. 8 in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.

SOMMER PICKED OVER KELLER FOR U.S. TEAM; SOCCER: WORLD CUP INVITATION DENIED TO 
ONE OF THE TOP ENGLISH FIRST DIVISION GOALKEEPERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 One day after being knocked almost unconscious by an opposing striker in 
London, American goalkeeper Juergen Sommer was rendered equally dizzy by a 
transatlantic phone call from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The call, made Wednesday by a U.S. Soccer Federation official, told Sommer, 
25, that he had been chosen to play for the U.S. team in this summer's World 
Cup tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 It stunned Sommer; or it least it would have had he been home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife, Susie, took the call," Sommer said late Wednesday night. "I was at a 
team dinner, but I could see when I got home that she had good news. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big relief to finally know it's official. I've known for some time 
that I was under consideration, that I was one of four or five goalkeepers they 
were looking at. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to know for sure that I've been chosen." 
</P>
<P>
 What was good news for Sommer, however, was bad news for Kasey Keller, the 
other leading candidate to join Tony Meola and Brad Friedel on the U.S. World 
Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller, like Sommer, plays in the English First Division. But their teams have 
headed in opposite directions in the season now ending. With only a couple of 
games remaining, Keller's Millwall is in a race for a playoff spot and possible 
promotion to the Premier League. 
</P>
<P>
 Sommer's Luton Town, meanwhile, narrowly avoided relegation to the Second 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Sommer was chosen for the U.S. team, not Keller, who was the United 
States' No. 2 goalkeeper behind Meola in the 1990 World Cup in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller, from Olympia, Wash., declined comment Wednesday, but his wife 
described him as "obviously very disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll say something on Friday," Kristen Keller said. "He wants a day to think 
about it. It's not something he really had any control over. It wasn't his 
choice to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Keller, 24, has played only once for the U.S. national team since Bora 
Milutinovic took over as coach three years ago. He has preferred to concentrate 
on his professional career in England and has done well there. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Premier League clubs have expressed interest in signing him, and he 
has been highly praised by the English soccer media. 
</P>
<P>
 But he hurt his cause by becoming embroiled in a squabble with the federation 
over which brand of goalkeeping gloves he would wear when the United States 
played Scotland in Denver two years ago. He has not been chosen for the team 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possible contributing factor was Keller's comments about deserving a 
spot on the team based on his performance as a starter in the English First 
Division. This did not sit well in Mission Viejo, the U.S. team's training 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 Sommer, meanwhile, kept a lower profile while still playing exceptionally well 
for struggling Luton. He helped the club reach the semifinals of the Football 
Assn. Cup, its best achievement in years, and with the victory Tuesday, the 
club has escaped relegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sommer, who was born in New York, won an NCAA championship at Indiana 
University, where he compiled a 58-8-6 record after coming in as a walk-on 
freshman in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a former professional goalkeeper in Germany, Sommer said his 
experience playing in England has been invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me a while to adjust to the strength and pace of the game over here," 
he said. "But I've learned a lot about angles and reading the game and taking 
crosses." 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic has not said which of the three goalkeepers will be his World Cup 
starter.

DERIVATIVES STUDY PROPOSES TIGHTER RULES; INVESTMENTS: SOURCES SAY GAO REPORT 
DUE OUT IN TWO WEEKS WILL RECOMMEND EXPANDING THE SEC'S ROLE IN THE BOOMING 
MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A much-awaited study on the controversial derivatives business proposes 
significantly tighter regulation of the booming market, with an eye to 
minimizing the potential of a financial catastrophe, sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by the General Accounting Office, in the works for several months, 
has been much feared by Wall Street banks and securities firms. 
</P>
<P>
 They have privately voiced concerns that the study by the GAO, the 
investigative arm of Congress, would lead to excessive regulation of 
derivatives. That, in turn, would drive the lucrative business offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 A draft copy of the GAO report, according to people familiar with its 
contents, recommends broad expansion of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission's role in the market. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives are intricate financial contracts designed to limit a 
corporation's risk from losses due to sharp fluctuations in the financial 
markets, particularly in interest rates and foreign currencies. They can also 
be used to speculate on market swings. 
</P>
<P>
 The instruments are a major concern for regulators and members of Congress, 
particularly given that a large corporation such as Procter & Gamble last month 
reported a $102-million accounting charge following a major loss from a 
derivatives deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft report's recommendations could be changed before its scheduled May 
18 release, sources said. But they said they doubt the report's overall 
direction will change. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft report proposes that the SEC develop new regulations to ensure 
derivatives customers -- known in the market as "end users" -- understand the 
risks they take in such deals. The customers would have to meet the same risk 
management requirements imposed on derivatives dealers, major Wall Street 
titans such as Bankers Trust New York and J.P. Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 This recommendation, one source said, was surprising because it represents 
"government intrusion into corporate financial management." That recommendation 
could set the disturbing precedent of the SEC placing boundaries on the types 
of financial risks corporations could take, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also recommends expansion of the SEC's powers to oversee 
now-unregulated derivatives dealers in private transactions, known as the 
over-the-counter market.

BIOTECHNOLOGY WINS ROUND IN FIGHT ON DRUG PRICE CONTROLS; MEDICINE: FEDERAL 
COST REVIEW PANEL MAY BE DROPPED FROM HEALTH CARE PLAN. RESEARCH INVESTMENT IS 
SEEN AS ENDANGERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The biotechnology industry has achieved an important step in fighting proposed 
federal drug price controls that it contends would cripple research on 
"breakthrough" drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting with industry leaders from California and other states, President 
Clinton's top health policy adviser indicated that the Administration will not 
oppose in Congress the industry's efforts to keep drug price restrictions out 
of federal health care reform legislation, industry leaders said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The statements, from White House adviser Ira Magaziner and other 
administration officials, was "the most encouraging news we've heard in a long 
time," said Lisa Conte, chief executive of Shaman Pharmaceuticals, a South San 
Francisco biotechnology firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The biotechnology industry has been lobbying hard to persuade the Clinton 
Administration to drop two proposals from its health care bill that would 
broaden government powers to oversee drug prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry has warned that such proposals could cripple investment in the 
capital-hungry industry, forcing biotech firms to abandon research into drugs 
to fight cancer, AIDS and other illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Conte said Magaziner, in a meeting Monday, "made it clear that this is a 
battle that needed to be fought" with Congress, while indicating that the 
Administration would be willing to drop the drug price provisions if they 
became a sticking point in the health care debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton proposals at issue include a government advisory council that 
would review breakthrough drugs and rule on the "reasonableness" of their 
prices. Another would allow the secretary of Health and Human Services to 
exclude new prescription drugs from the Medicare program should their prices be 
deemed excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is critical to California's biotechnology companies -- concentrated 
in the Bay Area and San Diego County -- which account for 40% of the industry's 
95,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee, wrote Rep. Lynn Schenk (D-San Diego) that he would back her 
efforts to scrap the advisory council -- a move that encouraged the 
biotechnology industry. 
</P>
<P>
 David Beier, vice president of government affairs for San Francisco-based 
Genentech, said the meeting with Magaziner touched on a number of issues 
besides reforming the medical care system, among them exports, intellectual 
property protection and research and development tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
 Others at the meeting were Kirk Raab, chairman of Genentech, and Gordon 
Binder, chief executive of Thousand Oaks-based Amgen. 
</P>
<P>
 "All along, the Administration has said it wanted to encourage innovation yet 
contain costs, and they came up with one way of doing that," Beier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The essential message they were giving the group is that Congress is 
revisiting that issue, and if they came up with another way of (containing 
costs), then that's fine with them," he said.

TURBULENT TIMES MANAGING THE ECONOMY / ONE COMPANY'S VIEW; MAIN STREET TRIES TO 
COPE; WALL STREET NUMBERS DON'T WASH WITH FAUCET MAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Wall Street, the economy is a numbers game. When the Federal Reserve Board 
raised interest rates this year, bond prices fell. When the nation's economic 
indicators showed moderate growth last week, stock prices dropped due to 
renewed inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Los Angeles businesswoman Barbara Nyden Rodstein, the numbers tell 
little about the gritty work that happens on Main Street: paying bills, meeting 
payrolls, finding new markets, firing or hiring workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what the government is telling us, that all the (national) indicators 
are wonderful," says Rodstein, a plumbing manufacturer. But in many ways, they 
"have nothing to do with anything." 
</P>
<P>
 In Rodstein's world, costs are rising faster than the national average, and 
she is laying off workers, not hiring them. She cannot raise prices very much, 
and rising interest rates are hurting. She is changing her product mix and 
increasingly looking abroad for new sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodstein owns Harden Industries, which makes and markets plumbing fixtures for 
homes and businesses. At one time, she was known as the "faucet queen to the 
stars" when the firm specialized in high-end products. 
</P>
<P>
 In a day, her workers make about 1,000 sets of faucets and handles. Those are 
the numbers, she says, that mean the most. 
</P>
<P>
 Harden Industries was founded 12 years ago by Rodstein and her husband, 
Harvey. Rodstein says she got the idea of going into the designer faucet 
business when she saw that no one else was doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 It just made sense, she said: "Brass was selling at 35 cents a pound, and that 
translated . . . into a $350 product." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, Rodstein took over management of the business when her husband fell 
ill with cancer. He died four years later. 
</P>
<P>
 As a woman business owner, Rodstein represents one of the fastest-growing 
segments of the Southern California business community. It is a tough, 
demanding role for which she appears well suited. A product of a harsh 
working-class neighborhood in Chicago, Rodstein says she learned "to make more 
out of less, because we always had less." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Rodstein has cultivated customers that include celebrities such as 
Tom Selleck, Elizabeth Taylor, Barbra Streisand and Donald Trump. But the 
business itself is hardly glamorous.  
</P>
<P>
 One of about 1,300 similarly sized companies in greater Los Angeles, Harden 
sits in an industrial section east of the Harbor Freeway near Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 At Rodstein's South Main Street factory, workers labor at lathes or drill 
presses, shaping raw brass material into thousands of forms. In a curtained 
booth, a welder assembles a "waterfall" faucet -- a wide-mouthed fixture -- 
from sheets of brass. 
</P>
<P>
 In another room lined with shelves of molds for ceramic fixtures, a worker 
sprays a viscous glaze on a faucet handle before it is placed into a nearby 
kiln to be cured overnight at 1,800 degrees. And toward the front of the shop, 
workers lower racks of brass plumbing into vats of blue liquid to be 
electroplated with copper. 
</P>
<P>
 So how does life inside this factory mirror what's happening on the national 
level? Not all that clearly, according to Rodstein: 
</P>
<P>
 * Nationally, employment is rising -- by 456,000 jobs in February, the largest 
jump since October, 1987. Even in California, there were 5,800 more jobs and 
the unemployment rate fell to 8.6% from 9%. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rodstein has been laying off workers as domestic markets shrink and the 
company shifts production overseas.  
</P>
<P>
 At the peak of business two years ago, she employed about 355 people in Los 
Angeles. Today, that number has fallen to 215, and by July it will fall again 
to about 100 as Harden moves more production to its plant in Asia.  
</P>
<P>
 * Rodstein's costs have been rising faster than government indicators suggest. 
Last month, the government reported that producer prices went up 0.2% in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she is unable to provide precise figures, Rodstein says her costs 
have risen faster than the wholesale price index, especially for insurance, 
health care, regulatory fees, raw brass and freight. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising costs are one reason Harden is revising its product line, eliminating 
items that cost too much to make and forging ahead in new markets such as more 
moderately priced do-it-yourself plumbing, which makes up about 30% of the 
company's business. 
</P>
<P>
 Harden did raise prices an average of 10% in April, but the increase only 
begins to cover the cost increases of the past several years, Rodstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 * One major cost factor is interest rates, and Harden's experience mirrors 
that of the rest of the nation. The Fed has raised short-term rates 
three-quarters of a percentage point since February, and last month several 
banks raised their prime rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's action is intended to tighten credit markets and head off 
inflationary pressures. But there are no such pressures at Harden, and rising 
rates will simply make it more expensive for Rodstein to obtain short-term 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Harden has had to shorten delivery times of products so it is not carrying its 
interest payments on credit for too long. Before, there was as much as six 
months between taking an order and delivering product to get payment. Now, it's 
more like 60 to 90 days, Rodstein says. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the company is adjusting production processes to shorten lead 
times, eliminating products that take too long to make and relying more on 
suppliers who will deliver raw materials quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 * In normal times, Harden looks forward to increased revenue as home sales 
improve, and that part of the California economy is looking increasingly 
healthy. For example, sales of existing homes in California were more than 31% 
higher in March than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing boom of the 1980s fueled much of Harden's growth in sales to about 
$25 million. But now, Rodstein says, her own experience suggests that the 
residential market "has remained finite." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, much of her new sales are overseas. "We're looking to sell more 
product outside the United States next year," she said. "That's where we think 
we'll save our souls: increasing our exports to Canada and mainland China."

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: AS DERIVATIVES DEBACLES ADD UP, IT'S TIME TO ASK: 
HEDGE OR RISK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Between Kidder Peabody's shocking $350-million loss in phantom bond trades and 
Procter & Gamble's embarrassing $157-million pretax rinsing courtesy of a 
failed "hedge," cynical investors might be forgiven for wanting to go short on 
the future of futures, options and other such financial derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Public advocates -- perennially fearful that derivatives might fuel a 
financial meltdown -- clamor for increased regulatory oversight, while the 
Securities and Exchange Commission pores over public filings to see if 
companies adequately describe their exposure with these instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being seen as dynamic, innovative tools to better manage risk, 
derivatives are portrayed as far too complex, too volatile, too risky -- and 
the people who trade them too greedy -- to be a cost-effective instrument for 
conservative financiers. Just as after the 1987 stock market crash, derivatives 
today are being demonized as deadly viruses of speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction by the derivatives world to this rising portfolio of debacles is 
hardly a self-consciously mumbled "There but for the grace of God go I." 
Instead, there is an angry contempt for the way their global, 
multibillion-dollar marketplace is now being defined by aberrant behaviors. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things blacken the entire market," says one derivatives specialist at 
an international investment bank, "when in reality, this is really one of the 
best and most open markets in the world today." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Kidder Peabody's Nietzsche-reading government bond trader 
Joseph Jett, derivatives traders are simply "incredulous" that a scam half the 
size of the firm's capital base didn't trigger a sophisticated management 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were not odd-lot trades," a former Salomon Bros. managing director says 
of Jett's alleged $900-million-plus market manipulations. "I cannot understand 
how this goes on for more than a year without someone asking this guy into 
their office to walk the trades through and explain how he's managing to trade 
so successfully for so long. It's just not comprehensible." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Procter & Gamble, was the global consumer products giant really trying 
to use derivatives to better hedge its currency and interest rate exposures in 
its multinational markets? Or was the maker of Ivory and Tide as interested in 
profitably speculating in derivatives as investing in detergents? (The company 
itself claims its money-losing swaps went against its investment policy.) 
</P>
<P>
 The instruments "were so insanely geared that they had to be taking a bet," 
says Susan Webber, a management consultant who advises derivatives firms. Other 
derivatives players agree: "It's very difficult to design a straightforward 
hedge that performs so poorly," says one Goldman Sachs derivatives designer. 
"We're not that clever and we're not that stupid. What P&G bought wasn't just a 
hedge." 
</P>
<P>
 The real issue surrounding derivatives today isn't their sophistication and 
complexity; it's the openness and honesty of the institutions that trade them. 
The truth is that it's easy to lie with derivatives. So some people do. 
Complexity isn't a reason; it's an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Derivatives are so fungible and versatile that you can take a variety of 
derivatives and make something that is very convoluted but that also does what 
you want," acknowledges a former Bankers Trust derivatives specialist now at a 
global investment bank. "If your intention is to disguise and deceive, you can 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, it's not uncommon for aggressive global corporations and their 
equally aggressive corporate treasurers trying to hedge their operations in 
Europe to want to "capture some of the upside" if the deutsche mark should go 
down against the dollar. At what point does sweetening a hedge turn it into 
outright speculation? Because the tax treatment of corporate hedging and 
corporate financial speculation is substantially different, the answer to that 
question is worth millions of dollars. Sometimes hundreds of millions. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, suppose the company has built into its business plan that German interest 
rates will rise but that the Japanese yen and the dollar will hold strong. Is 
the hedge designed around these assumptions an example of financial 
speculation? Or a responsible effort to hedge the organization against its 
legitimate business expectations? 
</P>
<P>
 These questions are almost impossible to answer. But what makes this situation 
intolerably worse -- and what leads to such unpleasant surprises as 
multimillion-dollar write-downs by such seemingly well-managed firms as Gibson 
Greetings and Procter & Gamble -- is the fact that these companies are not 
required to disclose their hedging strategies to the public markets. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, investors have no real way of knowing whether a $500-million 
basket of currency options and futures held by a Fortune 500 company represents 
a prudent hedge or a speculative bet. 
</P>
<P>
 "More needs to be done in the area of disclosure and accounting," says SEC 
Commissioner J. Carter Beese. "Significant interpretive guidance will be 
forthcoming from the SEC. Shareholders have the right to know what their 
exposures are before they wake up and read it in their newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest risk derivatives bring to the marketplace is not their complexity 
or volatility; it's the shadowy way in which they can be used by companies that 
would rather not tell the marketplace the truth about their investment 
intentions. The antiseptic for that infection is not more regulation; it's 
better and fuller disclosure.

 Former GM Executive Agrees to Pay Fine: Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua will 
pay $40,000 in return for an official end to a perjury probe, prosecutors 
said.Lopez, who now works at Volkswagen, allegedly betrayed General Motors 
Corp. secrets to the German auto maker. The deal does not affect the industrial 
espionage investigation in Germany and the United States against Lopez, who 
defected from GM to Volkswagen a year ago. But during several months of legal 
hearings in the case, it is the first time Lopez has been penalized. The 
Hamburg prosecutor's office said it informed him the perjury investigation 
would be abandoned if he donated the money to a children's charity.

SENATE APPROVES CREDIT BILL TO BOOST CONSUMER RIGHTS; CONGRESS: BURDEN OF PROOF 
IN DISPUTES WOULD SHIFT TO REPORTING BUREAUS. MANY OF THE PROVISIONS ALREADY 
EXIST IN CALIFORNIA.

<P>
 Americans who have been denied a loan, a job or the chance to buy a home 
because of inaccurate credit reports would get new power to correct the record 
under legislation passed by the Senate on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, approved 87 to 10, marks the first major overhaul of the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act of 1970, which was designed in an era when the credit bureaus 
operated with handwritten file cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill contains many protections that Californians already have under 
existing state law, but it would potentially lower the cost of obtaining a copy 
of a credit report. It also strengthens protections when employers request 
credit reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill and similar legislation cleared by the House Banking Committee would 
shift the burden of proof in disputes from the consumer to the credit bureau. 
After receiving a complaint, bureaus would be required to either verify the 
disputed information within 30 days or delete it. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, businesses that supply information to credit bureaus would 
also be obligated to investigate disputed information and would be subject to 
civil suits for failing to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 One provision gives consumers the right to obtain their credit report once a 
year for $3, rather than as much as $25 currently charged in some states and $8 
charged under California law. Another requires credit bureaus to establish 
toll-free telephone lines to take complaints, a requirement already in effect 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, like California's law, would also restrict credit reports to users 
who can cite a legitimate use, such as a lender, employer or insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers could obtain credit reports only after notifying employees or 
prospective employees and would have to give them five days to respond to 
unfavorable information. In California, credit bureaus must send an employee or 
prospective employee a copy of his or her credit report when an employer 
requests one, but the five-day response time is not stipulated. 
</P>
<P>
 Another provision seeks to rein in abuses among "credit repair" organizations 
that promise -- usually for a high fee -- to fix consumers' credit records. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would allow credit bureaus to use credit records to compile 
direct-marketing mailing lists. However, consumers would have the right to keep 
their names off such lists by calling or writing the bureaus. California 
consumers can do this already. The bill would also allow affiliated companies 
to share credit reports, unless a consumer denies permission.

 Cigna HealthCare Names New President: Cigna HealthCare of California, the

a unit of Bloomfield, Conn.-based Cigna HealthCare Inc., said Wagar will be 
responsible for all medical, sales and marketing activities. A company 
spokesman said Wagar's title, market manager, reflects the parent company's

UTILITIES HAVEN'T MET MINORITY GOALS, COALITION SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six years after agreeing to award more contracts to minority-owned firms, most 
of California's major utilities have failed to meet the minimum purchasing 
goals established by state regulators, according to a coalition of minority and 
consumer groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two major utilities -- Southern California Edison and Pacific Bell -- out 
of seven awarded at least 15% of their contracts for supplies and services to 
minority businesses in 1993, as called for by the California Public Utilities 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that there is limited commitment by the utilities' CEOs" to boost 
business with minority firms, said Robert L. Gnaizda, a lawyer for the 
Greenlining Coalition, a collection of minority and civil rights groups that 
released its annual analysis of the minority contracts Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the goals established by the PUC in 1988 are voluntary and the 
utilities face no penalties for missing the targets, according to agency 
officials. The PUC, which will release its own analysis of the 1993 figures by 
September, also asked the utilities to award at least 5% of contracts to 
women-owned firms by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the firms -- such as AT&T, Pacific Gas & Electric, GTE California and 
Southern California Gas -- exceeded the combined target for women- and 
minority-owned businesses but failed to meet the 15% goal for minority firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have plans in place to improve those numbers," said Diane Schwilling, a 
spokeswoman for AT&T, which she said intends to boost the dollar amount of 
contracts to women- and minority-owned firms by 10% annually. In 1993, 11.6% of 
AT&T's California contracts went to minority businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 When broken down by minority or ethnic group, the utilities met with different 
results. San Diego Gas & Electric, for example, awarded 6.9% of its contracts 
to Latino businesses in 1993, while 4.4% went to African Americans and only 
2.2% to Asian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the firms took exception with the Greenlining Coalition's analysis, 
which excluded Native American-owned firms to which the utilities said they 
gave contracts. Gnaizda said the coalition did not include the Native American 
figures because it was concerned that many of those firms had misstated their 
minority ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 "That brings into question his approach here," said Barbara Cook, minority and 
small-business manager for Southern California Gas. Cook said the company 
showed increases in procurement from firms owned by Native Americans, Asian 
Americans and African Americans in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the seven major utilities have boosted minority contracts from about 
$100 million in 1988 to $700 million last year, Gnaizda said. Despite the 
dramatic increase, he said, the growth has been too slow and enforcement by the 
PUC too lax. 
</P>
<P>
 To boost the companies' performance, the Greenlining Coalition has asked the 
PUC to tie executive compensation to the achievement of the minority 
contracting goals. In addition, the coalition wants the PUC to require 
companies to award 30% of all contracts to minority-owned firms by 1999. The 
PUC said it is studying the proposals.

FDA GETS STRICT WITH 'HEALTHY' DEFINITION; FOOD: THE NEW RULES ARE SEEN AS A 
VICTORY FOR CONSUMER GROUPS THAT HAD PUSHED FOR STANDARDS IN NUTRITION 
LABELING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government Wednesday issued a definition for "healthy" foods that will 
almost certainly force manufacturers to either change the names or ingredients 
of many products. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said foods labeled "healthy" must be low 
in fat, saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium. The agency said a "healthy" food 
must also contain at least 10% of the recommended daily value of either Vitamin 
A, Vitamin C, iron, calcium, protein or fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules are stricter for frozen dinners, which must contain 10% of three 
nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules are a victory for consumer organizations that had pushed for 
inclusion of vitamins, iron and other nutrients. The FDA last year proposed 
rules that would have defined "healthy" as a low-fat, low-sodium, 
low-cholesterol food. Under that narrow definition, consumer organizations 
argued, a jelly bean could be considered healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the rules were issued, though, some consumer organizations said they 
would like revisions lowering fat to two grams per serving from three grams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Food technology has really progressed to where that is possible," said Bonnie 
Liebman, nutrition director at the Washington-based Center for Science in the 
Public Interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Producers of so-called healthy foods could not be reached for comment 
Wednesday. But a random review of labels suggests that they face some 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas L. Lipton Inc.'s Healthy Sensation salad dressing, for example, 
contains no protein or vitamins, according to the label on its Ranch flavor 
dressing. Kraft General Foods' Budget Light and Healthy Beef Pot Roast dinner 
is over the low-sodium limit of 480 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
 F. Edward Scarbrough, director of the FDA's food labeling office, said 
previously that some of Conagra's Healthy Choice products would probably 
require reformulation.  
</P>
<P>
 In an interview earlier this week, food industry executives said lowering 
sodium poses the biggest challenge because it helps boost the flavor of 
prepared foods. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Lagrois, product manager for Tyson's Healthy Portion frozen dinner line, 
said sodium in most dinners exceeds 480 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's just a matter of 100 milligrams of sodium, I think we could easily 
reformulate," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The rules take effect for new products Monday. Existing products will have at 
least a year to meet the requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Other FDA food label reforms take effect Sunday. They require manufacturers of 
processed foods to use uniform nutritional labels containing information on 
fat, sodium, protein and other nutrients and to meet strict definitions for 11 
descriptive terms, such as "fat-free" and "low-sodium."

LDDS MAKES $2-BILLION OFFER FOR WILLIAMS CO. PHONE UNIT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Williams Cos. said Wednesday that LDDS Communications Inc., the nation's 
fourth-largest long-distance carrier, has offered to buy its telephone 
subsidiary for $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, which operates natural gas pipelines as well as a digital 
telecommunications network, said LDDS' unsolicited bid of cash, stock or both 
for the WilTel unit includes the assumption of the company's debt. 
</P>
<P>
 After the news was announced, Williams' stock closed $3.25 higher at $28.75 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. LDDS shares were up 25 cents at $23.75 in Nasdaq 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said LDDS, based in Jackson, Miss., is already a large customer of 
WilTel and is negotiating a new long-term contract for lines it leases from the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 The offers were contained in a letter LDDS filed Tuesday with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Bailey, president and chief executive officer of Williams, said in a 
statement that Williams is "comfortable continuing to own, operate and invest 
in WilTel." 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that Williams is considering the LDDS offer.

CALIFORNIA STILL A WALLFLOWER AT NATIONAL RECOVERY DANCE; ECONOMY: THE FED'S 
'BEIGE BOOK' REPORT SHOWS SOLID GROWTH IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. 
</P>

<P>
 The U.S. economy is growing solidly in most of the nation except California, 
the Federal Reserve System reported Wednesday, as the government reported a 
surge in March factory business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's "beige book" report on activity across the country underlined a 
pickup in the economy in the spring after two months of exceptionally severe 
winter weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "Solid economic growth is reported in most parts of the country," according to 
the summary prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, which 
includes comment from all 12 district banks. It was a much stronger assessment 
of the economy's vigor than the last summary in March, which reported only 
moderate expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "In California, conditions remain weak, although some positive signs are 
starting to emerge," the Fed said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Residential markets are starting to show signs of life" in the nation's most 
populous state. The report noted that in addition to home building and lending 
for housing construction, tourism in California is picking up. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, price increases were restrained by competition, the Fed said, an 
encouraging sign that inflation was under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more evidence the economy is on a brisk growth path and that so far the 
inflation genie is being kept in the bottle," said economist Robert Dederick of 
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the Commerce Department said factory orders shot up 1.1% in March 
to a seasonally adjusted $274.7 billion -- more than double Wall Street 
economists' expectations of a 0.5% increase. Orders fell 0.3% in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like a pickup after a rough winter," said economist Cynthia Latta of 
DRI/McGraw Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is running along pretty strongly, and I wouldn't really look for any 
weak spots until summer, when we may see some slowdown in housing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed survey, whose reporting period runs through April and is more current 
than the Commerce Department report, pointed out that manufacturing companies 
continue to do booming business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Production of autos, vehicle parts, steel and building materials is near 
capacity," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite signs that some industries were reaching production limits, which 
could drive prices higher, the Clinton Administration professed no concern 
about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Robert Reich, speaking to reporters at the White House, said: 
"There is no inflation on the horizon at all. Incomes are growing, but they are 
not growing in any ways that would signal inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and other industrial countries were busily intervening in 
world currency markets Wednesday to prop up the sagging dollar. Economists say 
the cheaper dollar increases the risk of inflation by pushing up prices of 
imports. Factory Orders

SOUTHWEST CREATES RESERVATION SYSTEM AFTER RIVALS GIVE IT THE BOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Southwest Airlines Co., the nation's most profitable carrier, launched its own 
computer reservation system Wednesday to combat a move by rival carriers to 
curb travel agent access to the Dallas-based airline. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest, known for no-frills service, has kept costs low partly by refusing 
to pay fees to major computer reservation systems for displaying its schedule 
and fares. 
</P>
<P>
 But three of the four largest such systems, owned by the nation's biggest 
airlines, are seeking to make it harder for travel agents to find information 
on Southwest and other rivals unless the owners are paid fees for tickets 
issued. The standard fee is $2.50 per round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest pays half that rate to Sabre, the nation's largest computer 
reservation system, but only to show fares and schedules, not other data such 
as possible connections with other carriers. Sabre, owned by American Airlines' 
parent, AMR Corp., is not participating in the action by the three other 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest, which contends its costs would skyrocket if it fully participated 
in the industry's major systems, fired back by installing a personal computer 
system for travel agents who sell at least 15 Southwest tickets a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The system, called Southwest Airlines Travel, includes a toll-free telephone 
line with access to Southwest ticket agents, a modem and a ticket printer. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline is also speeding up delivery to travel agents who order fewer than 
15 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest published a full-page letter by Chairman Herbert Kelleher in some 
newspapers, including The Times, justifying its move. 
</P>
<P>
 "A primary key to Southwest's success has been our ability to fight the 
inevitable pressure to increase costs, thus allowing us to keep fares low," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided more than 20 years ago that paying fees to all of the computer 
reservations systems owned by our competitors would undermine our commitment to 
low costs and low fares," he said.

 Sales Rise at Chrysler, Ford: The Big Three auto makers combined to report an 
April sales gain of about 3.5% despite a drop in car sales at General Motors 
Corp. Chrysler Corp. said the month was its best April ever, with overall sales 
up 10% from 1993.Ford Motor Co. vehicle sales were 5.8% higher than a year ago. 
But GM said its car sales fell 4.3% for the month while light truck sales grew 
4.9% from a year earlier for a combined decrease of 0.9%. GM's decline in car 
sales can be attributed in part to shortages of some models.

DOLLAR JUMPS AS U.S. INTERVENES; STOCKS EASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Massive dollar purchases by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other 
world central banks halted the buck's steep decline Wednesday, which also 
helped the bond market stabilize. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, prices were mixed in relatively slow trading, as some 
investors took to the sidelines. The Dow Jones industrials fell 16.66 points to 
3,697.75. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar was the day's big financial story, as the Clinton Administration 
signaled for the second time in a week that it would defend the currency's 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed, acting on behalf of the Treasury Department, bought dollars with 
other currencies in a strong show of support for the greenback. 
</P>
<P>
 Also buying dollars with the Fed were 15 other world central banks. In total, 
analysts estimated, the central banks bought $3 billion to $5 billion, much or 
most of that with German marks. 
</P>
<P>
 At least for the time being, the intervention worked: The dollar surged to 
1.654 marks in New York, up from 1.637 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also jumped to 101.85 Japanese yen from 101.05 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists have been flabbergasted this year by the dollar's weakness, because 
the strength of the U.S. economy and the recent rise in U.S. interest rates 
normally would be expected to boost the dollar's value. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's sudden decision to defend the dollar stems in part from 
fears of higher inflation, because a weak dollar raises import prices in the 
United States. A weak dollar also makes foreigners less willing to invest here. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, there is a widespread feeling that a rapid decline in the dollar, as 
with any other financial asset, would be dangerous for the global financial 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two things are in the interest of all (industrialized) nations," said John 
Williams, chief economist at Bankers Trust. "One is stability in foreign 
exchange markets and the second is the case that a stronger dollar is 
appropriate to slow the U.S. economy and help spur other economies." 
</P>
<P>
 A stronger dollar could lower prices of goods imported into the United States, 
helping European and Japanese manufacturers while making it harder for U.S. 
manufacturers to raise prices. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, where the dollar's weakness had raised concerns about an 
outflow of foreign capital from U.S. bonds, yields stabilized Wednesday. The 
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond slipped to 7.33% from 7.34% on Tuesday, 
after challenging the 7.40% level at midday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs, said the bond market's 
rather unenthusiastic response signaled a judgment that "the intervention will 
not be sustained or not work." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds were also helped by news of weaker-than-expected April car sales, which 
hinted at slower economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 In other bond market news, the Treasury said it will sell $29 billion of 
government securities next week.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, on Wall Street, blue chip stocks eased after three days of gains. 
Losers outnumbered winners by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Smaller stocks fared better: The Nasdaq composite index inched up 0.93 point to 
740.30. 
</P>
<P>
 Some traders said investors were beginning to focus on the possibility that 
higher interest rates and a strong dollar will significantly slow the economy 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Many industrial issues closed lower, led by auto makers. Ford lost 1 to 60, 
GM fell 5/8 to 56 3/4 and Chrysler was off 1/8 to 47. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other industrials, Air Products & Chemicals dropped 1 5/8 to 41 1/4, 
Varity fell 7/8 to 38, Monsanto slid 1 to 81 1/2 and Phelps Dodge sank 3/4 to 
56 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * In another health care takeover, Allied Clinical Labs surged 5 3/8 to 22 5/8 
on a takeover offer from National Health Laboratories, which ended off 1/8 to 
11 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, First Interstate Bancorp rose 1 3/4 to 82 3/4 after 
its chairman said the bank expects to exceed recently revised 1994 earnings 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, brokerage Jefferies Group leaped 2 7/8 to 43 7/8. It sold 3.7 million 
shares of its Investment Technology Group division to investors in a new stock 
offering. The stock, offered at 13, jumped to close at 16 1/4 in Nasdaq 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Hong Kong stocks finished near their lows for the year, with the 
Hang Seng index plunging 309.69 points to 8,369.44. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the FTSE-100 index fell 29.5 points to 3,070.5 while Frankfurt's 
DAX index eased 3.27 points to 2,249.02. Mexico City's Bolsa index was off 4.11 
points at 2,235.12.

FINAL OK SAID TO BE NEAR ON SAUDI JET BUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The national airline of Saudi Arabia has decided to buy 46 Boeing jetliners 
and 15 McDonnell Douglas MD-11 jets under its previously announced plan to 
purchase $6 billion of U.S.-made aircraft, sources in the Saudi capital of 
Riyadh said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is now subject to approval by Saudi Arabia's Cabinet, headed by 
King Fahd. Neither St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas nor Seattle-based Boeing 
would comment on the reports. Both cited their policies of having customers 
announce new orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing is expected to get the bulk of the contract, but the orders for the 
MD-11, which cost about $100 million each, would still give a major lift to the 
McDonnell Douglas aircraft division in Long Beach, where 11,000 people build 
the 300-seat, three-engine jumbo jet. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the MD-11s, the national carrier Saudia wants five of Boeing's 747s, 
29 of its smaller 737s and 12 of the newly developed 777s, according to the 
sources, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, when the Saudis unveiled their plan to buy only American-made 
planes, McDonnell Douglas said the contract would probably not require the 
company to hire more workers. But it said the deal would help maintain current 
employment until the commercial aircraft industry emerges from its slump. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas, a distant third in the industry behind market leader Boeing 
and Airbus Industrie of Europe, desperately needs new orders to survive the 
industry's slowdown. The tentative Saudi award would be worth at least $1.5 
billion to the company. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas ended 1993 with two fewer new orders than when the year 
began because of cancellations, and it landed a new order for only a single 
airplane in the first three months of 1994. However, it still has a backlog of 
about 200 airplanes, which should keep its production line active through most 
of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing and McDonnell Douglas executives have been negotiating with the Saudis 
since March 20, after President Clinton personally helped persuade the kingdom 
to replenish its fleet with U.S.-built aircraft instead of buying some planes 
from Airbus as well. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas' stock closed Wednesday at $116 a share, down 50 cents, 
while Boeing slipped 25 cents to $44.50, both in New York Stock Exchange 
trading.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; TRAVEL POLICIES ARE ALL OVER THE 
MAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Business travel policies vary widely among companies. Where one company flies 
its employees first-class and puts them up in luxury hotels with generous meal 
allowances, another puts them up in budget inns and makes them absorb some of 
their own meal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the Internal Revenue Service cutting back on the deduction employees 
can take for any non-reimbursed business meals and entertainment expenses, many 
workers are wondering how their companies stack up in the travel reimbursement 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they can know. The Bureau of National Affairs, a Washington-based research 
group, recently surveyed 617 companies in a cross-section of industries to find 
out what their travel reimbursement practices are. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the companies polled, 65% are small (fewer than 1,000 employees) and 35% 
have more than 1,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those surveyed, 85% impose some kind of restraint on spending for business 
travel. The restraints range from requiring people to use certain airlines or 
hotels to putting spending caps on meal allowances. In general, companies said 
they encourage employees to use "reasonable judgment" when planning their trips 
and to try to find the least expensive, but practical, way of getting to where 
they are going. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a rundown of various reimbursement practices. 
</P>
<P>
 AUTOMOBILES: While 99% of the respondents said they pay employees who use 
their cars for business, mileage reimbursement rates varied from 16 cents a 
mile to 39 cents a mile. The median rate reported was 28 cents, the same amount 
the IRS allows for business use of a car. 
</P>
<P>
 The median rate is up from 26 cents a mile two years ago. Only 7% of the 
companies said they pay more than 28 cents a mile, and only 9% pay less than 23 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with the IRS allowance increasing to 29 cents for 1994, more than 
half the respondents said they planned to increase their reimbursements to keep 
pace with the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 For employees who use their cars to get to the airport, 92% of the companies 
said they pay airport parking expenses, and only 6% of those place restrictions 
on the reimbursement amounts. Of those that do have restrictions, for example, 
a few said they pay only for cars parked in long-term or remote lots. Others 
require employees to use a taxi or limousine if it would be less expensive than 
parking for a long trip. 
</P>
<P>
 MEALS: More than three-quarters (77%) of the companies said they pay the 
actual cost of their employees' meals when they are out of town on business and 
that they set no limits on what they pay. However, 22% do specify limits for 
reasonable meal costs. Health care facilities, educational and government 
institutions were more likely to restrict meal reimbursements than were 
manufacturing companies or service firms. 
</P>
<P>
 For those companies that put spending caps on meals, about three-quarters said 
meals should cost no more than $25 to $35 per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few companies (about 9%) specified maximums for individual meals, such 
as breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies also figure different allowances for different travel 
destinations. The amount paid for traveling within the company's home state, 
for example, might be lower than for travel outside it. 
</P>
<P>
 LODGING: Only 10% of the companies surveyed have caps on how much their 
employees can spend on lodging. For those, the median cap is $67.50 per day. 
And in more than half those cases, it varies by travel destinations. None of 
the survey respondents said they planned to increase their travel allowance 
maximums for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 AIR FARES: Sixty percent of companies require employees to fly coach rather 
than first-class, although half those with this restriction also said it could 
be lifted in certain cases, such as when there are no coach reservations 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban on first-class travel was also lifted by 22% of companies for 
international flights or flights more than four hours long. Some companies also 
lift the ban if employees are traveling with clients. Otherwise, employees who 
want to fly first-class have to use their own frequent-flier awards to get the 
upgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 In some companies, however, even that is not allowed. Thirty percent of the 
companies said their coach-only rule applies at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 When making travel arrangements, only 4% of the respondents require employees 
to use designated travel agencies, although half said they expect employees to 
purchase the least expensive ticket possible. 
</P>
<P>
 And about a quarter of them encourage companies to use company cars instead of 
flying, whenever practical. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, about 13% said they would encourage weekend stays if it saved the 
company money on air fares. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of companies (60%) still allow employees to use frequent-flier 
mileage earned on company travel for their personal trips. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25% have no policy regarding personal use of travel awards. Only 9% 
reclaim the miles for use by the company for future business trips. Employer 
Expectations 
</P>
<P>
 Percent of institutions and businesses that place each standard restriction on 
business travelers. Exceptions to such rules are normally made when they are 
burdensome or impractical. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of coach class accomodations: 60% Purchase lowest-cost tickets: 45 Use 
automobile instead of air or rail transportation: 26 Travel must include 
weekend stay: 13 Schedule departures during non-peak periods: 12 Use 
alternative mode of transportation to air travel: 8

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; TO VIETNAMESE VENDORS, 'OPEN MARKET' MEANS JUST THAT; 
ASIA: PEDDLERS PREFER TO EKE OUT A LIVING ON THE STREETS. POLICE SWEEPS AND 
NEW, COVERED FACILITIES FAIL TO UNCLOG THE CITIES.

 Le Huu Dung is a freewheeling capitalist. With a basket of vegetables balanced 
on the front of his bicycle, he serves customers easily but can still pedal 
clear of trouble at the first sign of police. 
</P>
<P>
 "They try to chase us away, but then we come back," the eager 18-year-old 
said, adding proudly, "They never catch me." 
</P>
<P>
 Dung is one of an army of illegal sidewalk vendors who have taken communist 
Vietnam's open-market economic reforms quite literally. 
</P>
<P>
 They have transformed the walkways of the capital -- barren of diversion 
before the economic opening took off in the late 1980s -- into a movable feast 
that often stalls traffic and drives authorities to distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the U.S. economic embargo has been lifted, a plethora of new and 
enticing goods could find their way into this emerging market. 
</P>
<P>
 Turn almost any corner in Hanoi and you'll find women with baskets of fruit 
and vegetables lining the streets, makeshift restaurants with pots of boiling 
chicken arrayed across the pavement, and small stands offering everything from 
cigarettes to drinks to magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the vendors in the impromptu markets -- known as "frog markets" 
because they hop around -- have migrated from the countryside in recent years 
as Vietnam's new economic policies have spurred business growth and sparked 
dreams of quick money. 
</P>
<P>
 They have had to dodge fresh state crackdowns on unlicensed peddlers and 
resist efforts to herd them into one of the state-sponsored covered markets 
recently built in Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 A government official said police regularly sweep through many of the markets 
to disperse the vendors and levy fines, but they lack the personnel to do it 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as we leave, they come back out again," he said. "The penalties for a 
violation are not big enough to stop them." 
</P>
<P>
 An unlicensed vendor can be fined the equivalent of $2, a considerable sum for 
an individual whose daily earnings may amount to about 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's worth the risk, many vendors say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are country folk. This is what we do," said Dung, who sells produce grown 
on his family's farm outside the city. "Before I sold vegetables, I sold rice." 
</P>
<P>
 Le Thi Thoa, 63, has sold watermelons and papayas from the same street corner 
for 10 years. She said there are more peddlers now and that the police are more 
strict with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really don't want vendors on the sidewalks anymore," Thoa said as she 
sliced a watermelon for a customer. "But the police sympathize with me, because 
I am old. They agreed I could just sit here. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they come through, I have to leave for a while, but then I can come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say they have cracked down on unlicensed vendors in part because 
the crowds they attract are contributing to Hanoi's traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon is not limited to Hanoi. State television recently aired a 
report from the port city of Haiphong, showing trucks inching their way through 
crowds thronging a makeshift market. 
</P>
<P>
 And official newspapers reported recently that Ho Chi Minh City officials were 
planning to enforce fines on pavement vendors and on those who rent sidewalk 
spots to them, in a campaign to "restore order." 
</P>
<P>
 They also announced plans to build covered markets designed to lure peddlers 
off the streets, a policy that has been tried in Hanoi with little success. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has spent nearly $3 million in the last two years to build four 
covered markets and to upgrade 20 permanent makeshift markets, only to have 
them remain half empty. The vendors prefer the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 clothing merchants at Hanoi's new Hom market went on strike last 
summer to protest having paid up to $5,000 for 10-year leases in the covered 
market while other vendors could still hawk their goods on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they offered us the space here, they said they would ban all the vendors 
down on the street," said one of the merchants. "But they're still there. We 
could make more money if we were out on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The merchants marched on the National Assembly to demand action, but they 
dropped their strike after two months. Now they sit without customers as crowds 
fill the streets just outside.

 Developing Nations Received 37% of Foreign Investment in 1993: Emerging 
economies, particularly in the dynamic regions of Asia and Latin America, took 
a record amount of all foreign direct investment last year, the United Nations 
reported.The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development said direct investment in 
developing countries -- mainly from transnational corporations into local 
affiliates -- rose to $70 billion last year from $50 billion, or 31% of total 
foreign direct investment, in 1992. Asia was the largest recipient region for 
direct investment. Flows to Latin America and the Caribbean have increased 
since the late 1980s, according to the report, but Africa's share has fallen.

 Germany Clears Final Obstacle to Privatization of Lufthansa: The government 
paved the way for the full privatization of national airline Deutsche Lufthansa 
after agreeing to help the carrier meet its pension liabilities. The problem of 
how pensions will be paid when Lufthansa is no longer part of the public sector 
had been the main obstacle to the government's plan to sell its 51.42% stake. 
Lufthansa, a money loser for the past three years, said privatization will 
enable it to return to profit and help it in the cutthroat struggle against 
rival airlines.

 Mexico's Unemployment at 3.8% in January: The nation's jobless rate was up 0.4 
percentage point from the year-ago period, according to a report from the 
government-owned Instituto Nacional de Estadistica Geografia e Informatica, or 
Inegi. Inegi said 55% of the country's population age 12 or older was 
economically active in January. It also said 32% of Mexico's working population 
received a daily income of one to two times the country's minimum wage of 
$4.30.

CHEW ON THIS: POPCORN SALES DECLINE A LITTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First Americans heard about the high fat content in movie theater popcorn. 
This week we ate less of it. And soon many theaters will be making the salty 
snack differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales at the nation's cinemas dropped an average of about 10% after release of 
a report conducted by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, according 
to exhibition officials. 
</P>
<P>
 For theater operators who depend on concessions for the largest chunk of their 
incomes, the report and drop in popcorn sales were hard to swallow. But the bad 
news appears to be only temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies representing about 25% of the nation's theaters say they have 
switched to the lower-saturated-fat canola oil, to hydrogenated canola 
shortening, or are offering air-popped corn. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a perceptible decline in popcorn sales," acknowledged Barrie Loeks, 
co-chairman of Sony Theaters, which operates at 175 locations in 15 states. 
"The message we're getting from our customers is they want the low fat. The 
drop gave us enough cause for concern that we've made the change to canola 
oil." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet not all popcorn sales were off. A number of exhibitors said the decline 
was highest in the urban centers and art houses and not even noticeable where 
action and broad comedy movies were playing. Said one, "You could see no 
difference at theaters where the futuristic-prison breakout story 'No Escape' 
was playing, but there was a drop at the romantic film 'Four Weddings and a 
Funeral.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some theatergoers seemed totally unfazed when queried about the issue. 
Musician Sage Guyton of Los Angeles was at the Cineplex Odeon Fairfax, where 
corn is popped in coconut oil. "If you like it, then I say do it," Guyton said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same theater, student Catherine Howard said she would not be deterred. 
"I'm going to buy popcorn because it's the movies!" 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Cornelison, who works at Mann Theaters in Valencia, recounted how a 
woman approached the concession counter and declared: "I'm outraged that you 
put all that fat in your popcorn when you don't have to" -- and then ordered a 
large popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the results of the nutrition survey were announced, about 70% of the 
nation's theaters popped their corn using higher-in-saturated-fat coconut oil, 
which produces the familiar, good smelling aroma Americans have been used to 
for decades when they enter the lobby of a movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
 With this week's modifications, closer to 50% use coconut oil, with the other 
half using a version of canola oil or air-popped corn. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because of changes by the nation's biggest theater chains: Denver-based 
United Artists Theater Circuit, the largest with 2,300 theaters across the 
country, will continue using coconut oil but will also sell air-popped corn. 
The other two, Kansas City-based AMC Theaters and New York-based Sony Theaters, 
formerly known as Loews, will switch from coconut oil to canola oil. They are 
joined by a number of smaller chains, including Orange County-based Edwards 
Cinemas, which has already converted to canola oil. 
</P>
<P>
 James Edwards Sr., head of the Edwards circuit, said his theaters use less oil 
when they cook with canola, which he claims results in better-tasting popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next week, Edwards Newport theater and a new 12-plex in La Verne will 
conduct taste tests where customers can sample coconut oil versus canola oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards, 87, and the dean of Southern California's exhibitors, said that as 
soon as he learned of the fat contents, he decided to change. "We're all 
interested in our health," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was the same for Philip Singleton, the chief operating officer of AMC 
theaters, who runs 30 to 50 miles each week. "I had no idea I was putting all 
that fat into my body. The study prompted us to look at this as a social 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Jayne Hurley of the Center for Science in the Public Interest said she has 
been overwhelmed by the response to the study. "People are talking about it. 
And we're thrilled that the nation's theater operators are taking these steps 
so quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of exhibitors from around the country are discussing the issue today 
at a board meeting of the National Assn. of Theater Owners in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 But the story doesn't end there. Optimistic commodities market traders are 
buying up canola futures, traded on the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange. According 
to Rochelle Atlas Maize, a commodities broker at Smith Barney Shearson in 
Beverly Hills, the price of canola futures has risen "substantially" since 
April 25 -- the day the center issued its report.

THAT 'NUTTY' EDDIE MURPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER, TIMES MOVIE EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody can out-nerd Jerry Lewis, Eddie Murphy figured, so he came up with his 
own take on the remake of Lewis' 1963 classic, "The Nutty Professor," which 
Imagine Films will produce for Universal Pictures later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the original slapstick comedy, which Lewis wrote, directed and produced as 
well as starred in, the actor played a goofy, bucktoothed professor who 
transforms into a swaggering lady killer named Buddy Love after gulping down a 
magic potion. The remake, which will be Murphy's first film after "Beverly 
Hills Cop III," being released May 25, will feature Murphy as Sherman Clump 
(the last name reflecting his lumbering physical presence) as a 400-pound 
chemistry professor, who, as producer and Imagine co-chairman Brian Grazer puts 
it, becomes a "heightened version of Elvis," when he drinks a potion that makes 
him thin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our movie is about obesity," said Murphy in a phone interview from his New 
Jersey home, where he lives with his wife, Nicole, their 4-year-old daughter, 
Bria, and 1 1/2-year-old son, Miles. "America is obsessed with weight -- you 
have to look a certain way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy says he plans to begin production on the film in September, after a 
six-week tour this summer in Japan with his band, Psychedelic Soul. He says he 
hopes John Landis, his collaborator on "Beverly Hills Cop III" and his past 
hits "Coming to America" and "Trading Places," will direct him in the comedy 
remake. Landis is very much interested in directing, says Grazer (who will 
produce with rap impresario Russell Simmons), but no deal has yet been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Landis and Murphy reportedly butted heads on "Coming to America," but they 
patched up differences before their latest "Cop" outing for Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had one problem on 'Beverly Hills Cop III' -- I'm a man now," says 
the 33-year-old Murphy, who first worked with Landis on 1983's "Trading 
Places." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry watchers are undoubtedly curious to see whether this movie or "Cop 
III" will help boost Murphy's sagging popularity on the big screen. Grazer, who 
produced Murphy's 1992 comedy, "Boomerang," is convinced "The Nutty Professor" 
"will allow audiences to rediscover his comic talent." The producer suggests 
"the only way to do that is have him play a character that is vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy stressed that his version is not a strict remake, but combines elements 
of the original with parts of the classic Jekyll & Hyde and Cyrano de Bergerac 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The Nutty Professor' is the skeleton of the script," Murphy said, "and we 
stripped down the story to its bare bones and built it up to this whole 
different thing." Where Lewis' portrayal was a caricature of a goofy guy, 
Murphy said, his character will, he hopes, be someone moviegoers can feel 
compassion for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to get the audience pulled in," says Murphy, stressing that while 
"there will be fat jokes at every turn, our movie is not a (put-down) of fat 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the screenplay -- the work of Murphy, Barry Blaustein and David 
Sheffield -- will examine "how being obese is like having any other kind of 
handicap." It addresses how obese people look at themselves and are treated by 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy describes the newly suave Buddy Love as "the opposite of the kind, 
gentle, lovable Sherman Clump." One of the ingredients Clump adds to his secret 
potion is testosterone. "The more he adds, the bigger and bigger macho 
(expletive) he becomes." 
</P>
<P>
 Grazer suggests there's another side to Buddy Love. "He's a wish-fulfillment 
character who gets even with people who are insensitive and make fun of 
Sherman." However, the producer notes, "When Sherman comes back as Buddy Love 
-- the slickest cat in town -- he exercises his power, then becomes sort of 
abrasive and you wish he'd go back to being Clump, a decent guy." 
</P>
<P>
 The producer believes that audiences will respond positively to Murphy playing 
a vulnerable role as the 400-pound Clump because "it strips away Eddie's 
coolness for a while and is a role that allows him not to be in control or 
powerful in the beginning."  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the two split-personality roles, Murphy will also play as many 
as five other characters, as he did in "Coming to America." The other intended 
characters are a white Richard Simmons-type aerobics teacher, a mean-spirited 
stand-up comic who makes fun of Sherman, a salesman in a big and tall shop, and 
either Sherman's mom or dad, or both.  
</P>
<P>
 Murphy says the number of characters he ends up playing will depend on the 
movie's final budget, which sources said is expected to be no less than $40 
million. Sources said Murphy, who reportedly received $15 million for "Cop 
III," (this is his fee for all sequels) will collect $12 million for this film. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said the most attractive element of the movie is "being able to lose 
myself -- I'm never Eddie Murphy." By contrast, he said, his "Beverly Hills 
Cop" character, the fast-talking Axel Foley, "is the closest you'll get to me 
-- that's Eddie." 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, Murphy said he was approached about playing the nutty professor, 
but "couldn't see myself doing it." It wasn't until he came up with his own 
take on the character that he decided to pursue the role; when he found out 
that Grazer had the rights, he called immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Grazer had already decided he wanted to make the film after Russell Simmons 
had suggested he do a remake of it with a black lead. Simmons had taken Grazer 
to a New York nightclub where "The Nutty Professor" was one of the classic 
movies being shown, which convinced the producer there was strong crossover 
potential since there was a cult following for the film among hip club-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grazer then went in pursuit of the rights, which were owned by Jerry Lewis, to 
whom the copyright had reverted from Paramount, 10 years after the original 
film was released. He then discovered Lewis had been negotiating with Disney, 
reportedly to do a "Nutty Professor" sequel himself. No deal materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 The producer approached Universal, where Imagine has a long-term 
financing/distribution deal, and persuaded the studio to acquire the rights, 
which it did within 24 hours. Three days later, Murphy called Grazer and said 
he wanted to do the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractually, Lewis -- who is shooting a movie in London and was unavailable 
for comment -- is guaranteed a supporting role in the movie and an executive 
producer credit. Murphy assures that while the remake will differ from the 
original, "it's like an homage to Jerry and how brilliant he was." 
</P>
<P>
 As for his own career trajectory, Murphy acknowledges that his first few 
movies "started out in the freak zone." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was lucky," he said. "I was in the right place at the right time. But I'm 
an artist. If a movie makes 10 cents or $300 million, it has nothing to do with 
my choice of films." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said he views himself as a multifaceted performer with equal ambitions 
in music and stand-up comedy (he has released two comedy albums and will 
release his fourth musical album in September). After "The Nutty Professor," he 
plans next January to star in Paramount's "Vampire in Brooklyn," to be directed 
by Wes Craven, then "go back to the clubs and start working on my stand-up 
because in two years I want to do stand-up and music."

PERICK TO CHANGE TITLES AT L.A. CHAMBER ORCHESTRA; MUSIC: HE WILL RELINQUISH 
THE TITLE OF MUSIC DIRECTOR AND BECOME THE MUSICAL AND ARTISTIC ADVISER FOR THE 
FINANCIALLY TROUBLED GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christof Perick, music director of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra since 
October, 1992, will relinquish the title of music director at the end of the 
season and become the orchestra's musical and artistic adviser, Perick 
confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Perick and orchestra executive director Erich Vollmer said that Perick's title 
change results from the fact that the financially troubled orchestra is paring 
down the number of concerts it will present in the 1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Perick will conduct only four weeks of LACO concerts, Perick said he no 
longer feels the job warrants the title "music director." Vollmer declined to 
discuss whether Perick's salary would decrease. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perick's new title becomes effective after this weekend's Chamber Orchestra 
concerts, which end the 1993-94 season. He will not be replaced and will 
continue to assist in making programming decisions and selecting guest artists. 
Both Perick and Vollmer said the change does not represent a resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no plans to begin a search for a music director," Vollmer said. "He's 
not resigning to take any other position. He has no intentions to disassociate 
himself from the orchestra. He just felt that, personally, it was a decision he 
had to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Perick, who also holds two posts in Germany as music director of the State 
Opera of Hanover and the State Orchestra of Niedersachsen, said that his job 
under the new title will remain essentially the same, but will be downsized as 
the orchestra cuts down its performing commitments and trims its operating 
budget from $2.3 million to $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "My problem is, I started working with this orchestra on a different basis; it 
was a full season of concerts, as well as a recording and tours," Perick said. 
"For four programs, you don't really need a music director. There is no reason 
for me, with all of my international commitments, to be music director. . . . 
It is just a title. 
</P>
<P>
 "The orchestra has the same problems everybody has. At the same time, I am 
dealing with financial cuts in Germany. They have the same problems, only with 
a difference -- they are government supported, but they have no more money, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vollmer said the orchestra carries a $1-million debt, but has raised $408,000 
from corporate and foundation donations in the past four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Perick said that he will direct four weeks of full-orchestra concerts in the 
upcoming season, with the orchestra's former music director, Iona Brown, 
guest-conducting two weeks of Baroque music concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Vollmer said that the orchestra will continue to work with the Los Angeles 
Music Center Opera and is beginning an outreach series of neighborhood 
concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really business as usual -- just less business," Vollmer said.

BROOKS STILL IN COUNTRY AWARDS SPOTLIGHT; POP MUSIC: WHILE IN NASHVILLE FOR THE 
BIRTH OF HIS SECOND CHILD, HE IS NAMED THE ENTERTAINER OF THE YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Garth Brooks casts a long shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Even from 2,000 miles away in Nashville, the country star's unerring nose for 
the spotlight was undiminished during Tuesday's Academy of Country Music Awards 
show at the Universal Amphitheatre, where he upstaged Alan Jackson, the 
evening's other key winner, at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only has Brooks been staring out at grocery shoppers from the cover of TV 
Guide for the past week, with an announcement of another sort-of 
semi-retirement inside, but he was also named entertainer of the year at the 
end of Tuesday's ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth straight victory in that top category for Brooks, but this 
time the odds favored Jackson, who had earlier capped his strongest year by 
taking the trophies for best single and best album. 
</P>
<P>
 If that wasn't enough, Brooks and his wife Sandy managed to have their second 
baby in Nashville while the show proceeded here. The nation was informed of 
August Anna's arrival by executive producer Dick Clark on the live telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone out there want to top that? 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the ongoing Brooks dramatics (he's appearing on "Entertainment Tonight" 
today to clarify the "King of Country's Farewell" headline in TV Guide), the 
29th annual edition of the ACM Awards -- co-hosted by Jackson and Reba McEntire 
-- was marked by predictable choices and a couple of overdue honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the former: Vince Gill as male vocalist, Brooks & Dunn for vocal duet 
and the popular Jackson for single (the warmly nostalgic "Chattahoochee") and 
album ("A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'Bout Love)"). The male and female new 
artist awards went to the commercially dominant nominees, John Michael 
Montgomery and Faith Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners were Little Texas for best vocal group, the Gibson/Miller Band's 
for best new vocal group, and "I Love the Way You Love Me" for best song (for 
singer Montgomery and writers Victoria Shaw and Chuck Cannon). The video for 
"We Shall be Free" won awards for Brooks and producer and co-director Tim 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 John Anderson's career achievement award provided the evening's warmest 
segment -- and judging by the crowd of other musicians who gathered around to 
congratulate him as he made his way to the press area backstage, it was clearly 
the most popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, whose rich, earthy vocal style has been a major influence on today's 
generation of country singers, acknowledged the influence of Charley Pride (who 
was presented with the Pioneer Award), Buck Owens, Merle Haggard and George 
Jones, and he told the media that he'd like to serve the same role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do hope that through it all we inspire some other young ones to pack up 
their guitars and head for country," the bearded singer said.  
</P>
<P>
 Much more so than in other fields of music, country artists regard these 
awards as true measures of accomplishment, so Wynonna Judd's female vocalist 
honor -- the singer's first major award since she began her solo career 2 1/2 
years ago -- sparked the event's liveliest moments backstage, courtesy of her 
mother, Naomi Judd. 
</P>
<P>
 After accepting the trophy for her daughter, who is confined to a bed with a 
back injury, the feisty Naomi -- whose retirement due to chronic hepatitis 
ended her long musical partnership with Wynonna -- reflected on the earlier 
snubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been comin' to these shows and she hasn't won a single thing," Naomi 
said. "She kept askin' me, 'What's wrong, why haven't I won anything?' 'Cause I 
keep tellin' her that she's the best singer not only in this genre but possibly 
in any genre right now. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I think Wynonna Judd is out there in no man's land. I think that she is so 
stinkin' good that people don't know quite what to make of her . . . I'm being 
objective. I think Wynonna Judd, simply put, has more soul than a moccasin 
factory. . . . There are a lot of great singers, but Wynonna needs to be in 
there and be recognized too." 
</P>
<P>
 Look for Naomi to score big on Mother's Day.

THE FRENCH HAD A NAME FOR IT: FILM NOIR; MOVIES: 'DARKNESS, DESPAIR, DECEIT AND 
ICE IN THE VEINS' ARE ON DISPLAY IN A UCLA SERIES SHOWCASING LITTLE-SEEN GALLIC 
GEMS. 
</P>

<P>
 Though the title may be questionable, the films definitely are not. "French 
Film Noir," the tasty but misnamed UCLA Film and Television Archive series 
opening tonight at Melnitz Theater, offers a rare chance to see some 
exceptional work by directors whose underappreciated films are almost never 
available for American viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 And given that an accurate title, something like "Terrific Films by Directors 
You've Barely Heard of," doesn't exactly have the marquee value of "French Film 
Noir," we can forgive the fact that some of these can be considered dark, 
fatalistic noirs only by the broadest definition of that admittedly elastic 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 And though the noir genre is as intrinsically American as the Western, it's 
indisputable that the French, who after all first recognized and named it, have 
a certain genius for what the program notes call "darkness, despair, deceit and 
basic ice in the veins." Even the most humanistic of French directors, Jean 
Renoir, could walk down that road, as he did in "La Chienne" (screening 
Tuesday). 
</P>
<P>
 Renoir's first sound film and, dating from 1931, the oldest in the series, "La 
Chienne" stars the great Michel Simon as a mercilessly henpecked clerk who 
falls hopelessly in love with a duplicitous prostitute, aggravating her 
ruthless pimp. Remade as "Scarlet Street" by Fritz Lang and Edward G. Robinson, 
"La Chienne" is enlarged by Simon's delicate performance as the archetypal 
timid soul, one of the most memorable fools in love ever put on film. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Renoir is well-known, the four directors who give this series most of 
its excitement are not as celebrated in this country. Between them, 
Henri-Georges Clouzot (whose "L'Assassin Habite au 21" plays with "La 
Chienne"), Jacques Becker, Jean-Pierre Melville and Georges Franju have five 
films in the eight-film series, and each is as entertaining as it is largely 
unseen. 
</P>
<P>
 Clouzot's masterful "The Raven" opens the series tonight, playing with 
Bertrand Blier's absurdist 1979 "Buffet Froid." Characterized by French critic 
Georges Sadoul as a filmmaker known for "pessimism and the taste for neurotic 
passions," Clouzot is sometimes called France's answer to Alfred Hitchcock, a 
Gallic master of suspense most remembered for the classics "The Wages of Fear" 
and "Les Diaboliques." 
</P>
<P>
 Only his second film, the deliciously misanthropic 1943 "Raven" is 
breathtaking in its scabrous portrayal of the depths of human nature. A small 
French town is flooded by anonymous letters, signed "The Raven," which 
spitefully spread discord and bring on what one character calls "a whirlwind of 
hate and calumny." And the worst of it is, almost everyone in town is a 
potential suspect for this awful deed. 
</P>
<P>
 Made during the German occupation and advertised in the rest of Europe as "a 
typical small French town," "The Raven" was promptly denounced by the 
Resistance as detrimental to national morale. After Liberation, the film was 
banned for a time, the death penalty was suggested for its key personnel and, 
despite support by the likes of Jean-Paul Sartre, Clouzot was unable to direct 
again for four years. It's that nasty a piece of business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Closest to American film noirs are the gangster films of Becker and Melville. 
And the Saturday-night double bill of the former's "Touchez Pas au Grisbi" and 
the latter's "Le Doulos" is the most satisfying program of the series. 
</P>
<P>
 A former assistant to Jean Renoir, who was one of the few traditional French 
directors the iconoclastic New Wave filmmakers admired, Becker's Simone 
Signoret-starring masterpiece "Casque D'Or" is so well-loved in France that 
they put it on a stamp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grisbi," an underworld slang word meaning loot , follows a world-weary 
gangster (its the only kind they have in France) as he tries to balance the 
demands of loyalty to his pals with his interest in millions of dollars of 
stolen gold. Played with peerless sang froid by French superstar Jean Gabin, 
who can make Robert Mitchum seem expressive, "Grisbi" deals with a 
near-mythical French world of chic cabarets and elaborate wrought-iron 
elevators. It also stars a young, dark-haired Jeanne Moreau, whose scenes with 
Gabin have a fine passing-the-torch quality to them. 
</P>
<P>
 If Becker was a filmmaker the New Wave favored, Melville, whose one-man 
operation served as a kind of role model, was so well-liked he appeared as a 
celebrated director in Godard's "Breathless." An admirer of all things American 
(his last name is not his own), Melville is best known for "Bob Le Flambeur" 
and a trio of mythological gangster films starting with "Le Doulos," and 
followed by "Le Deuxieme Souffle" and the knockout "Le Samourai." 
</P>
<P>
 Starring Jean-Paul Belmondo in hat, trench coat and a cloud of cigarette 
smoke, "Doulous" is a tale of greed and revenge crawling with double and 
triple-crosses and assorted hard guys. Told in Melville's trademark cool, 
laconic manner, it is stylish and fatalistic in a way even the classic American 
noirs would have trouble matching. 
</P>
<P>
 Georges Franju's marvelous "Judex" (showing Sunday with Jean Gremillon's 
"L'Estrange Monsieur Victor") belongs to another tradition entirely. A tribute 
to and, in fact, a remake of Louis Feuillade's inventive 1914 super-hero serial 
by a director whose credo was "what pleases is what is terrible, gentle and 
poetic," "Judex" is surreal, romantic and sweetly disturbing. Like many of the 
other films in this captivating series, it will make you wonder how you've 
survived so long without it. 
</P>
<P>

SHUMARD QUITS POST AT FULLERTON; TITANS: ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, WHO HAD A 
CONTROVERSIAL THREE-YEAR TENURE, SAYS IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Shumard's turbulent, three-year tenure as Cal State Fullerton athletic 
director came to an end Wednesday, when he announced his resignation, effective 
May 31, indicating he felt it was time for a change of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably never being able to turn the corner with the program was my biggest 
disappointment," Shumard said. "Maybe new leadership will accelerate the 
healing." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard's three years were marked by unrest among student-athletes over cuts 
in the program -- including the termination of football -- and two 
controversial court cases stemming from an ill-fated attempt to drop women's 
volleyball in January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Huffman, the volleyball coach at the time, was the big winner in both. 
First, he fought successfully to have the program restored in the courts the 
following March. Then, after he was subsequently fired, he successfully proved 
in a wrongful-termination suit that his contract was not renewed in 
retaliation, and he won a $1.35-million judgment plus substantial court costs 
against the school last February. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury said Shumard and Jack Bedell, another university official, had fired 
Huffman with "callous disregard" to Huffman's First Amendment rights and that 
Shumard had acted with "fraud, malice and oppression." Shumard was ordered to 
pay $3,000 in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard, 43, said that "the outcome of that trial was painful to me, and what 
bothered me most was that there were 12 people in Orange County who believed 
that I was that person." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard said he sensed he had been supported by university officials after the 
verdict -- which is under appeal -- and that he felt no pressure to resign. "I 
didn't make any decision autonomously, but I'm ultimately responsible for any 
decision in the athletic department that is made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jared Huffman, brother of the volleyball coach and one of two attorneys who 
represented him in both suits, expressed doubts that the case was not a major 
factor in the resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't help but think there's a connection," he said. "It's pretty obvious 
this case highlighted some extremely poor decision-making by him and some other 
people who should share the blame." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Huffman also said he wasn't surprised Shumard resigned. "I'm maybe a 
little surprised that he did it this early," Huffman said. "But I didn't think 
he would be back for this next season. I'd have been surprised if he had been." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman said the resignation would be beneficial to the athletic program. "It 
obviously wasn't working, and he's going to be happier when he gets out, and 
Fullerton's going to be happier when he gets out." Before he was hired in 
August, 1991, Shumard had been an assistant athletic director at USC for three 
years. With the Dodgers from 1975-88, he had been director of community 
services and special events and had worked in the public relations department. 
</P>
<P>
 He was manager of the athletic news bureau at Cal State Los Angeles from 
1973-75 and sports information director at Long Beach State in 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard said he has no definite job plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some opportunities that have arisen," he said, declining to be 
specific. "I feel confident that in the next 45 days I'll know something about 
my professional future. We're going to have to look at things very closely, but 
I'm not going to make any rash moves. . . . My first goal is to keep my family 
in the area. I'm not ready to leave unless we have to." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard said he had been considering resigning for "about six months" and that 
he felt no pressure from a recent yearly review. 
</P>
<P>
 University President Milton A. Gordon issued a statement saying the school 
would name an acting director and begin a search for a permanent one as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Bill Shumard considers new interests, I know the Titan family joins me in 
wishing him well," he said. A university spokesman said Gordon would have no 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 One person mentioned immediately as a possible acting director is associate 
athletic director Maryalyce Jeremiah, a former Titan women's basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard informed the athletic department staff of his decision at a 
late-afternoon meeting. "I told them that this was easily the richest 
experience of my life, but not necessarily the best because of the good and the 
bad about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard also said one of his greatest difficulties was dealing with myriad 
financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is always a concern because of the scrutiny you're under and the fact 
that the athletic department has long had a program that it couldn't afford," 
Shumard said. "We have lost something like $750,000 in state funding since I 
came here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The financial burdens have been tremendous. I inherited a house of cards and 
it seems like I was always the bearer of bad news financially for the 
university, but I'm glad we did that. I think I gained a lot of credibility on 
this campus. But I believe financially there are better times ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard said he had to cut down the program "to one we could afford." But 
those cuts brought internal problems and repeated controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 With limited funds available for wrestling after Dan Lewis left as coach, 
Shumard said he told wrestlers that their scholarships were being reduced for 
the 1992-93 school year. But he failed to notify them in writing, a minor NCAA 
infraction that Shumard reported to the NCAA. The wrestlers have protested that 
reduction in funds, and as recently as this week there were placards around the 
campus critical of the athletic department's handling of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard and the athletic department also have come under fire from a group of 
15 football players who protested an athletic department edict that they would 
have to work 10 hours a week for the university to continue receiving part of 
their scholarships when the program was suspended. Flyers critical of Shumard 
on that issue also were posted on bulletin boards in the hall near his office 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The football players took the case to the State Board of Control and it was 
rejected, Shumard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were very tough decisions I had to make on volleyball, the wrestlers 
and the football players," he said. "I think the Huffman case escalated the 
football and wrestling situations. Even though I'm comfortable with our 
positions in both of those, if I allow new leadership to take over it might 
help the healing process." 
</P>
<P>
 Immediate reaction to Shumard's resignation from some current Titan coaches 
was mostly one of surprise.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked," baseball Coach Augie Garrido said. "I didn't see it coming at 
all. I sat there with my chin on the floor when he announced it to us. I had a 
business-like relationship with him. He always dealt with me straight up. I 
respected the difficulty of his position." 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball Coach Brad Holland said he "enjoyed working for Shumard. . . . I'm 
going to miss him very much." Soccer Coach Al Mistri shook his head and said: 
"All this turmoil is such a sad thing. It seems like we always have to keep 
starting all over." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard said he has "battled hard not to be bitter and resentful" toward his 
critics. "I don't harbor grudges and I think I'll be a better person because of 
that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the harshest of those critics, Jared Huffman said: "I don't want to 
wish ill on anyone, but the bottom line is Mr. Shumard shouldn't be pitied at a 
time like this because he brought these problems on himself. I wish him well. I 
hope he learns from his mistakes, and that things go well for him in the 
future."

MIKE PENNER: FROM THE BEGINNING, SHUMARD WAS A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Shumard can never say he wasn't warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, he sat in a booth at Julie's restaurant across the street 
from USC, days after accepting the suicide mission of athletic director at Cal 
State Fullerton, joking about how the men's group at his parish had offered to 
pray for him. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a good one, he said. Funny stuff. So the list of headaches awaiting 
him could wallpaper Titan Gym inside and out. Shumard shrugged. Those headaches 
were not unique to Fullerton, Shumard insisted. Every college athletic program 
in the country, he said, faced the same kind of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so naive, wasn't I?" Shumard said Wednesday night, hours after 
tendering his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Iced tea at Julie's is a long ways away from the avalanche of litigation, 
either pending or already lost, piled up outside Shumard's door -- a million 
miles removed from the signs presently posted outside Titan Gym, signs that 
shout with indignation: 
</P>
<P>
 GUILTY!  
</P>
<P>
 Shumard Found Guilty of:  
</P>
<P>
 -- Fraud  
</P>
<P>
 -- Malice  
</P>
<P>
 -- Oppression  
</P>
<P>
 -- Football Players Violated . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Athletic Administration Must Be Stopped!  
</P>
<P>
 The athletic director's office at Cal State Fullerton has always been a meat 
grinder, chewing up many other bright-eyed and ambitious men who went before 
Shumard. But never before has it been vacated like this -- with angry 
plaintiffs circling the building, dissension echoing through the halls and the 
incumbent announcing he's stepping aside in order to "let the healing process 
escalate." 
</P>
<P>
 Previous athletic administrations at Fullerton were judged by wins and losses 
-- either on the field or on the ledger. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard's was the first to be judged in the courtroom -- and the record that 
escorted him out the door was 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Huffman 2, Bill Shumard 0. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman was the women's volleyball coach who sued Fullerton twice after 
Shumard scuttled his program in 1992. Huffman sued to restore his program and 
he sued over his own "wrongful termination." He swept Fullerton, leaving a 
landmark gender-equity legal decision in his wake while ringing up nearly $1.5 
million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 L'affaire Huffman was the critical error of the Shumard tenure, ultimately the 
crushing blow. Shumard came to Fullerton as a neophyte athletic director. Was 
his an error of inexperience? Or was he a victim of bad advice? Shumard decided 
to cut women's volleyball after consulting a study, coordinated by Maryalyce 
Jeremiah, now an associate athletic director, suggested such a move was on firm 
legal footing. 
</P>
<P>
 The study's findings pointed Shumard in the wrong direction, as Jared Huffman, 
Huffman's brother and attorney, reiterated Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope (Shumard's) resignation doesn't deflect responsibility and 
accountability away from the other people who participated in these decisions . 
. . " Jared Huffman said. "In my opinion, (Jeremiah) should be announcing her 
resignation along with Shumard." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard refused to assign blame, however, saying only that the volleyball 
lawsuit was "certainly a test case, one that was very untested. Everybody went 
to school on us. If it hadn't been us, I'm sure some other school would have 
gotten it pretty soon." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Fullerton, Cal State Shoestring, that took the hit. Already 
swimming in red ink, the athletic department could hardly withstand the 
broadside, let alone the new lawsuits being threatened by Fullerton wrestlers 
and former football players alleging unpaid scholarship monies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The volleyball thing opened the floodgates," Shumard said. "It's very trendy 
to sue everybody these days . . . If you don't get your way you sue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The athletic council advises that we're in good shape in those two 
situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard managed a tired laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we're 0-1 in that kind of advice." 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness, Shumard presided over more than courtroom preparations during his 
three years at Fullerton. He oversaw the cancellation of the budget-draining 
Division I-A football program, a difficult but necessary decision. He fired 
John Sneed as men's basketball coach and replaced him with Brad Holland, 
another move than benefited the school's overall athletic landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 But as much as he sought to upgrade the basketball program -- "our only real 
revenue generator" -- Shumard banged his head against obstacles that preceded 
him. Rickety Titan Gym remains, in his words, "the most antiquated facility in 
the Big West" and Holland's annual budget of less than $400,000 still 
represents a third of what Nevada Las Vegas and New Mexico State spend on 
hoops. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard's successor inherits that dilemma and so many others. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night he became the latest to vacate the seat, Shumard was asked if 
there was anyone out there truly capable of handling the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go to church every Sunday to pray to Him," Shumard quipped, "but I think 
He's got other responsibilities at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 A few seconds pass. Then, a second thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I shouldn't put it like that," Shumard said. "I shouldn't say that it's 
going to take a super human.

 "Hey, I failed. I didn't make it. I'm stepping down. I'm sure there's somebody

 The question is: Who would ever want it?

 "When I got the job," Shumard said, "I was told I was the unanimous choice out

 "No one told me that the other four pulled out."

ROY'S ILLNESS TURNS OUT TO BE PAIN FOR EX-DUCK TUGNUTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Be careful what you wish for. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Tugnutt dreamed of playing time. Then Patrick Roy got appendicitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt had gone from alternating in goal for the Mighty Ducks with Guy Hebert 
to backing up Roy in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 That's like backing up the Maytag repairman. There's very little work 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Roy was hospitalized before Game 3 of the Canadiens' first-round 
playoff series against Boston, the job fell suddenly on Tugnutt's startled 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's like the Prime Minister up here," said Tugnutt, who was traded to 
Montreal for Stephan Lebeau on Feb. 20. "Everybody was joking about it. They 
all said, 'You've got the toughest job in the world today.' " 
</P>
<P>
 By his own admission, Tugnutt wasn't exactly ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually I go in thinking I'm going to win. But this time it was, 'Just don't 
lose it for the team.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He did, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston took a 2-1 series lead, and even though Roy got out of his hospital bed 
and put on the pads for the final four games, the defending Stanley Cup 
champions were eliminated in the first round, 4-3. Roy, rather remarkably, 
gutted out four games before undergoing an appendectomy after the series 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really disappointed I didn't get to show people I could do better," 
Tugnutt said. "I wanted a chance to redeem myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told the day before (Game 4), 'You're going to play tomorrow.' I was 
really excited to show I could play better, but I got to the rink for the 
morning skate and the first thing I see is Patrick has everything set up the 
way he does before he plays." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Ducks, Tugnutt played in 28 games and was 10-15-1 with a 3.16 
goals-against average. He was in goal the first time the expansion team won, a 
4-3 victory over Edmonton on Oct. 13. He was the star of the team's November 
turnaround when the Ducks were 4-0 on a Western Canada trip, stopping 120 of 
124 shots in three games. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the Ducks decided they'd do away with the alternating goalie system 
and go with Hebert, Tugnutt found himself sitting idle in Montreal. That's what 
happens when you play behind Roy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was an outsider. I felt I wasn't contributing," Tugnutt said. "I wanted to 
be a part of the team, but when you don't contribute, you don't feel like 
you're helping the team. You really feel like the odd man out. I got to know 
the guys well, but I played almost 30 games in Anaheim, then started maybe six 
the final two months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough, because Patrick wants to play almost every game. We all want to 
play every game, but he deserves to." 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt might be the only player in NHL history who was disappointed to go 
from an expansion team to the Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved it out there (in Anaheim)," he said from the lakeside home in 
Buckhorn, Ontario, where he and his wife, Lisa, and their new baby, Jacob, will 
spend the summer. "It was by far my best year, but the finish was 
disappointing. Every other time I've been traded, I was happy when I left. Not 
this time." 
</P>
<P>
 He did get to enjoy a jab at the Ducks' expense when he returned to Anaheim on 
March 2, and beat them, 5-2. And he got in another jab after he saw Hebert's 
ESPN sports fantasy commercial and called up his buddy just to laugh into the 
answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Montreal's season ended, it was in disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tugnutt got the call for Game 3, he says he'd hardly played in three 
weeks. He was 2-3-1 with a 3.16 GAA with the Canadiens. What was more, he says, 
he hadn't been eating well because he'd felt ill. 
</P>
<P>
 But you have to be ready when the call comes, and Tugnutt wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't play my best," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Montreal reporters and fans -- usually at the ready when someone falters 
-- actually seemed to feel empathy for the player who had to try to fill Roy's 
skates. Tugnutt made the good tactical decision of facing the criticism 
head-on. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of players I know, after off nights, go run and hide and don't face the 
press," Tugnutt said. "I did that once in the past and it got me in trouble. 
Usually if you go out and face the music, they appreciate what you have to say. 
Some people even wrote good things. They said, 'Understand, it's not easy to 
replace this guy, not in the heat of a battle with your rivals.' A couple even 
said, 'He'll do better next time.' I had some telegrams and faxes wishing me 
good luck after that." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't get another chance, though, and even Roy faltered in Game 7, losing, 
5-3. The Canadiens won't win their 25th Stanley Cup this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really disappointing, because we really had a lot of injuries and were 
really beat up, yet you could see there was a lot of heart," Tugnutt said. 
"Mike Keane, Lyle Odelein, Kirk Muller, those guys were all playing with 
injuries they wouldn't have played with if it hadn't been the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fans were great the whole series, but once we lost they did not take too 
kindly to that. They're still doing talk shows, with the players, the coaches, 
the GM. 'What's the problem? What's the matter?' They only expect one thing, 
the Stanley Cup, and we fell well short of that."

LANDETA STAYS A RAM; KELLY MULLS OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams re-signed punter Sean Landeta on Wednesday and expect to sign 
free-agent wide receiver Greg McMurtry in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 The team retained Landeta by exercising its right of first refusal, matching 
an offer by the Detroit Lions.McMurtry, who played at New England last season, 
is expected to sign by the end of the week, said Jay Zygmunt, the team's senior 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also are expecting a decision from free-agent linebacker Joe Kelly, 
who's deciding between one-year offers from the Rams and Washington Redskins. 
Kelly was the Raiders' second-leading tackler last season with 103, but the 
team waived him two weeks ago because of salary cap reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Free-agent quarterback Chris Chandler worked out for Ram coaches Wednesday, 
but no contract agreement has been reached. Chandler, formerly with the 
Cardinals, previously visited Rams Park on March 7, the same day the Rams 
signed Chris Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rams are now searching for a veteran backup for Miller, and this week 
brought in free-agents Chandler and Jack Trudeau, formerly of Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Former New Orleans cornerback Toi Cook also worked out for the Rams on 
Wednesday. MIKE REILLEY

A DESIGNATED HITTER SPARKS GRANADA HILLS; HIGHLANDER HOPES RIDE ON DISIMONE'S 
SPIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How hard does Mike DiSimone hit a volleyball? 
</P>
<P>
 Let us count the ways: 
</P>
<P>
 * Hard enough that Granada Hills High substitutes joyously ran onto the court 
during an early-season match to celebrate a particularly emphatic DiSimone 
spike. The Highlanders were assessed a sideout penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hard enough that DiSimone ended a tournament game by spiking the ball off 
the head of an opposing blocker and having the ball carom off the gymnasium 
ceiling and out of bounds. The ball ricocheted to the floor, where the blocker 
lay cradling his head in his arms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hard enough to earn DiSimone All-City honors, a spot on a Pacific Palisades 
club team and a scholarship to San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 * And hard enough to make Granada Hills the top City Section team in the area 
for the past two seasons and to lead the Highlanders to a City Section 4-A 
Division quarterfinal match against visiting Venice today at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he's on, he's the most dominating hitter I've ever coached," Granada 
Hills Coach Tom Harp said. "He makes spikes that you (normally) don't see at 
this level." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the 6-foot-5 senior with the 38-inch vertical leap could point to his 
volleyball resume and puff out his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the school's career leader with 585 kills, and is 39 away from breaking 
the school single-season record of 285, set in 1991 by Danny Asaoka. He 
averages 5.3 kills per game and is the team captain. 
</P>
<P>
 But for someone with much to crow about, DiSimone demurs. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked whether he is the Highlanders' go-to player, he hesitates. It is 
obvious to anyone watching a Granada Hills match that DiSimone is the main man. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, that's the kind of question where you say, 'Yeah I'm the big 
hitter,' but people read it and say, 'This guy's a (jerk),' " he said. "I 
wouldn't want to say that, because that's the whole cocky part of the whole 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Cockiness comes with a price, in his mind. Last season, it cost his team a 
shot at the City championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders were the top-seeded team in the City playoffs in '93 but were 
upset in the semifinals by Roosevelt, a team they defeated handily earlier in 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, the problem was everyone told us we were going to do so well, and 
that's why we ended up losing," he said. "We were looking ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as DiSimone leads this year's team into the playoffs, he allows himself 
to look ahead -- but only to see the pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything leads in the direction for us to get cocky," he said. "We're 
seeded third, so every game will be at home, the final will be right down the 
street (at Cal State Northridge), and every team we've played already. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we don't get wrapped up in all that because if we do, that's going to 
be a problem for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders have had surprisingly few problems this year, considering 
DiSimone and setter Victor Chang were the only two returning varsity players. 
</P>
<P>
 But the newcomers from the junior varsity, such as Earnest Yun, Dan Elbert, 
Mark Muir and Ryan Kamins, have performed well and spurred Granada Hills to a 
13-1 record and the Northwest Valley Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "All those guys played (on the junior varsity) last year, and JV compared to 
varsity is just a joke -- it's all free balls or whatever," DiSimone said. "But 
these guys have really stepped up their level, learned a lot and played well." 
</P>
<P>
 Learning quickly comes naturally for DiSimone. He didn't start playing 
volleyball until he was a ninth-grader at Holmes Junior High in Northridge, but 
rapidly picked up the sport and started at middle blocker for Granada Hills as 
a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 His junior year, he moved to outside hitter and played for the South Seas 
Volleyball Club team, run by Taft Coach Doug Magorien. 
</P>
<P>
 His performance for Granada Hills that year, while pock-marked with 
inconsistency, was dominating in stretches, and he began to attract college 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his senior season, he left Magorien's South Seas program and joined 
Palisades Reebok, hoping to increase his exposure. Magorien said such moves are 
not unusual for club players but he was hurt by DiSimone's switch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was definitely a little disappointed," Magorien said. "I stuck with him and 
put a lot of time into him, and my club had to pay the price a little bit. But 
I like Mike, he's a really nice kid." 
</P>
<P>
 And this Valley guy really loves the beach. DiSimone is a surfer who looks the 
part, growing out his curly hair and throwing his longboard in the back of his 
powder-blue 1971 Volkswagen bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put all my money into gas," he said. "I go to the beach whenever I can." 
</P>
<P>
 He had to go three times a week in the fall for club team practice at 
Palisades High, which would have been fine except for the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes an hour and a half to get there, and 50 minutes to get home," he 
said. "You can think of a lot of negative things when you drive an hour and a 
half in traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic won't be a problem when he goes to San Diego State, which he chose 
over UCLA, Cal State Northridge and UC Irvine. San Diego State was the only 
school to offer DiSimone a scholarship, and DiSimone liked its location -- 
close to the ocean and far from home -- and the chance to play as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The change will be great," he said. "It's just the college experience, living 
away from home in the dorms. It's much more of an experience than if I was just 
living at home and playing locally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus, from here it's 40 minutes to the beach and in the summer it's 110 
degrees and dry and hot. In San Diego, it's 10 minutes from the beach and it's 
the same weather the whole year-round. Everything about it fits my life style." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he made his college decision, the only uncertainty in DiSimone's 
volleyball life is whether he can lead Granada Hills to the City title.

EL CAMINO REAL COACHES MAIO AND STAM RESIGN; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: THEY BROUGHT 
RESPECTABILITY TO THE PROGRAM IN THEIR SIX SEASONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Co-coaches Mike Maio and Ralph Stam stepped down Wednesday after six seasons 
at the helm of the El Camino Real High football team, citing what has become a 
common theme among area City Section coaches: The demands of the position 
became too great and it's time for an infusion of new blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair will be replaced by Terry Fisher and Bob Ganssle, who coached the 
school's frosh-soph team. Both are longtime teachers and coaches at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Stam, 62, is retiring from teaching at the end of the school year. Maio, 
chairman of the school's physical education department as well as coach of the 
baseball team, said he was spreading himself too thin. Maio, 54, will remain as 
baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think it's time for someone else," said Maio, who has been coaching in 
the high school ranks since 1961. "It's too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Maio's resignation marked the second time in as many weeks that a high-profile 
City coach of two major sports called it quits in football. Granada Hills 
football co-Coach Darryl Stroh -- who also coaches baseball -- announced he 
will step down in football after the 1994 season. Tom Harp, co-coach with 
Stroh, also is uncertain whether he will return in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher coaches the school's wrestling team and Ganssle coached junior varsity 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conquistadores were 7-3-1 last fall under Maio and Stam, who compiled a 
six-year mark of 30-34-1. While the record might seem unimpressive, it should 
be noted that El Camino Real was one of the state's most downtrodden teams when 
the pair took over. Stam was a varsity assistant and Maio moved up from the B 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the 1988 season, the pair's first as varsity co-coaches, El Camino 
Real hadn't won in 23 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, anybody would like to have a great record and we would have liked 
to have won a few more games," Maio said. "The team was competitive and we can 
feel good about that." 
</P>
<P>
 The football team's high-water mark came in 1989, when the Conquistadores 
shocked second-seeded Granada Hills in the 4-A Division playoffs and reached 
the semifinals before losing to Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
 Maio and Stam were only the second and third coaches in the school's 25-year 
history. The pair took over for Skip Giancanelli, who coached the 
Conquistadores for the previous 19 seasons -- from the day the school opened 
its doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Maio led the Conquistadores to the City 4-A baseball title last season, the 
first championship in school history. The team was ranked third in the state 
and has become one of the region's most consistent winners. Maio was selected 
The Times' Valley baseball coach of the year in 1993.

MAGRANE STARTS SEASON WITH A SOLID OUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The big left-hander jogged to the mound Wednesday night, applause ringing in 
his ears. The 24,312 fans in Anaheim Stadium had waited a long time to welcome 
him back. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be a story about Jim Abbott, but it's not. 
</P>
<P>
 The left-hander in question was Joe Magrane, who made his first major league 
start this season after undergoing elbow surgery Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott's ovation was lengthy, building as he jogged in from the visitor's 
bullpen. Magrane received shorter, quieter cheers on his trip to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 It shaped up as an intriguing matchup, but neither lasted past the seventh 
inning and late-game events overshadowed each pitcher's performance as the game 
headed into the 12th inning when this edition of The Times went to press. 
</P>
<P>
 But Magrane earned a victory of sorts, going five solid innings, giving up 
four hits and two runs with two strikeouts and three walks. He wasn't 
outstanding, but he wasn't horrible either. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane toiled in the minors after surgery, largely ineffective in four starts 
in the Angel farm system. In his last start, Saturday for triple-A Vancouver, 
he gave up four hits and three runs in three innings of a 13-0 loss to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate for pitching help with Mark Langston on the disabled list after 
elbow surgery and Chuck Finley off to his worst start in his career, the Angels 
need all the assistance they can get from Magrane. Their rotation was thin last 
season and that's why they signed Magrane, who had been released by the St. 
Louis Cardinals, as a free agent last Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 His first Angel start was memorable only for his struggles. He lasted only 3 
2/3 innings against the Milwaukee Brewers, giving up five hits and six runs 
with two strikeouts, four walks and two wild pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane finished the season strong, winning three consecutive starts, but his 
February surgery cast doubts about his future. 
</P>
<P>
 When Scott Lewis relieved Magrane to start the sixth Wednesday, the score was 
tied, 2-2, but Manager Buck Rodgers didn't want to push Magrane any further. 
Eighty-five pitches over the course of five innings seemed to be plenty. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane fared better than any Angel starter on this home stand and that 
certainly was a plus for Rodgers, who hasn't gotten a victory from a starter 
other than Brian Anderson or Mark Leiter since April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bottom line was that the Angels weren't down, 8-0, 6-0 or 4-0, after 
only a few innings as they have been recently. After scoring twice in the third 
inning, they were tied. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane kept the Yankees quiet after the third, retiring Mike Stanley, former 
Angel Luis Polonia and Mike Gallego in order in the fourth. He allowed only a 
one-out walk to Wade Boggs in the fifth, leaving the Angels with a chance to 
win.

AUTO SALES REVVING UP; CONSUMERS: O.C. DEALERS FIND HOT MODELS IN SHORT SUPPLY 
AND REPORT AN INCREASE IN SPECIAL ORDERS FOR CARS THAT MEET BUYERS' 
SPECIFICATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Dee Ferkula couldn't believe it. For years she had heard how car dealers are 
hurting. Almost desperate to make a deal. But it wasn't a buyer's market that 
Ferkula found when she walked into her local Jeep dealer's showroom seven weeks 
ago to buy a new Cherokee. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of falling all over himself to put her -- "Right now! Today!" -- into 
one of several dozen models on the lot, the salesman told her she would have to 
wait to get the one she wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems there is a shortage of the popular sports utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jeep dealers aren't the only ones trying to cope with such popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Orange County auto dealers have not yet reported long waiting lists, 
raffles or other signs of a spectacular recovery after four years of recession, 
most are posting sales increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealers with especially hot models say they are doing something they have not 
done much of in years: writing up so-called retail orders for factory 
production of cars for customers who want a particular color or equipment 
combinations that just cannot be found in area showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these spot shortages involve domestic brands, which have gained 
popularity in the past year. New models from Detroit are making their way into 
showrooms accompanied by news reports of increasing quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like a Honda dealer," quipped Huntington Jeep-Eagle co-owner Rick 
Evans, referring to the popularity and quick sales pace of the big Japanese 
auto maker's products in the United States during the 1980s. "We're not used to 
this. But I guess if you hang on long enough, your time will come." 
</P>
<P>
 The hottest models include top-of-the-line Ford Explorers, Mustangs with 
Ford's super-premium sound system, any Chevrolet Suburban or full-size K-5 
Blazer, six-speed Camaro convertibles, and Jeep Cherokees and Grand Cherokees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The demand far exceeds the supply" for several of Chevrolet's full-size 
trucks and for the redesigned Suburban, said Jeff MacPherson, general manager 
of MacPherson Chevrolet in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chevrolet downsized its production because it had an oversupply several years 
ago," he said, "and that's not something they can increase overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many Chevrolet dealers wish they could: Perri Selman, spokeswoman for Selman 
Chevrolet in Orange, said the dealership delivers 15 to 20 Suburbans a month 
and that most are sold in advance -- ordered by customers who are willing to 
wait up to 12 weeks to get the color and equipment combination of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a batch in last month and only six weren't pre-sold," she said. "But 
all six of them were gone within two days. I've only got one out on the lot 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the shortage in California is that Chevrolet -- like several 
other domestic and foreign car makers -- supplies dealers on a so-called "turn 
and earn" basis: cars are allotted based on the dealership's recent sales 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Because California's economy has suffered for four years, many dealers in the 
state are losing allotments to dealerships in the Midwest and East, where 
economic recovery began more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Gray, owner of Orange Coast Jeep-Eagle -- where Ferkula bought her car -- 
said the distance from California to Detroit also contributes to shortages: it 
takes 15 days for Gray's Costa Mesa dealership to receive a shipment of cars 
once it "earns" them by selling out its previous shipment. A Jeep dealer in 
Detroit or Kansas City, in contrast, can turn around a shipment in three or 
four days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a bubble in a hose," Gray said. "We get a shipment and have a good 
supply, then there's nothing in the hose and we run out before we can get more 
in the next bubble." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Gray -- like an increasing number of Southern California dealers 
-- has watched his file of retail orders swell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to average one or two at a time," he said. "Now I've got about 35." It 
takes Chrysler Corp., which owns Jeep, about six weeks to fill such orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it when they told me how long it would be," said Ferkula, 
a senior loan officer with a community bank in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The car salesman spent two weeks trying to locate and trade with another 
dealership that had a Jeep that met her specifications, Ferkula said, "but he 
couldn't and finally I just gave them a deposit and they ordered it from the 
factory." 
</P>
<P>
 She expects to receive her black, V-6 Grand Cherokee with factory-tinted 
windows and an overhead console sometime next week. That's nine weeks from the 
day in early March when she first walked on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ford buyers are in better shape because Ford Motor Co. started recovering 
before its competitors did from Detroit's doldrums and has cranked up 
production of its most popular models in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the factory still consistently fails to meet Southern California dealers' 
needs for certain Explorer and Mustang models, said Theodore Robins Jr., 
president of Theodore Robins Ford in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ted Jones Ford in Buena Park, for example, general sales manager Gordon 
Brittsan said that while Ford is offering a $3,600 discount from the list price 
for specially equipped two-door Explorer Sport models, it does not make them 
fast enough to promptly replace what dealers are selling, so they are in short 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Brittsan has told his sales staff not to sell the two-door, 
five-speed Explorer Sport for anything less than the already-discounted, 
manufacturer-suggested retail price -- the price usually cited in advertising 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Nabel, sales manager at Campbell Ford in Garden Grove, said he usually 
has about two dozen special orders in the pipeline these days. In 1990, 
salesmen there discouraged customers from ordering, claiming that they had 
everything Ford made, in just about every conceivable configuration, in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 At General Motors' resurgent Buick division, dealers are reporting spot 
shortages of several models. Buick shut down several plants for four months 
last year to provide extra production space for Chevrolet's redesigned Lumina. 
Now Buick dealers have a hard time finding Park Avenues and Regals, said Don 
Partch, manager of Nabers Cadillac-Buick in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 And Irvine-based Mazda Motors of America thought that its dealers would sell 
only 800 of the company's new Japanese-built Millenia luxury car in March, the 
first month it was on sale. Instead, Mazda dealers moved 1,900 of the sedans -- 
priced from $25,000 to $35,000 -- in March and 800 more in April. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the so-called day supply is down by 33%: Typically, manufacturers 
like to have at least a 90-day supply of a particular model on hand throughout 
the nation. But if Mazda quit making Millenias today, dealers would run out in 
less than 60 days, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans at Huntington Jeep-Eagle said he likes to keep a 100-day supply of Jeeps 
on hand -- that's about 300 of them. But in the past few months, he said, his 
stock has dwindled to a 24-day supply. "We had 83 on the lot Tuesday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the Jeep shortage is that the company, decided last year to 
allow Chrysler-Plymouth dealers to add Jeeps to their lots as a second product 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 "That added more than 500 dealers," Evans said. "Even if each of them only 
took 10 cars a month, that's a lot less Jeeps for the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he cannot keep enough cars in stock to have something for everyone. So 
he has ordered special bulletin boards that will be installed in his showroom 
later this week. The sales manager will list all the unsold cars that are on 
order, detailing color and equipment combinations and estimated arrival dates. 
Customers who cannot find a car on the lot can use the board to pick out the 
car they want and reserve it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the early 1990s, when Southern California showrooms were overflowing 
with unsold cars, dealers who run out of one of today's hot models cannot even 
help customers by trading with a fellow dealer who has one. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody wants a Suburban and we don't have one, chances are nobody else 
will either," Selman said.

DISNEY CRUISES INTO NEW VENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mickey and Donald are taking to the sea in the Walt Disney Co.'s latest 
venture: building and operating a line of vacation cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney will build two vessels that will offer island-hopping vacations and 
on-board children's activities featuring Disney characters, the company 
confirmed this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney said months ago that it was considering such a move. But a formal 
announcement on Tuesday was coupled with news that it hired Crystal Cruises 
President Arthur Rodney to oversee development and operation of the new 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Operating our own cruise line will allow us to bring a new dimension of 
entertainment to our guests," said Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chairman. "We 
are creating a distinctive Disney product, with recognized Disney quality and 
service, in this popular and growing vacation segment." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney plans to make both of its ships large enough to carry 2,400 passengers. 
The first is expected to be launched by 1998.

AIRLINES CLEAR WAY FOR SOUTHWEST, CUT JOHN WAYNE SERVICE; TRANSPORTATION: 
AMERICAN'S ELIMINATION OF FLIGHTS TO SACRAMENTO AND OTHER CITIES PROMPTS 
COMPLAINTS -- BUT NOT FROM THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 American Airlines and American Eagle, already feeling the pressure of 
competing with low-cost Southwest Airlines for Orange County travel dollars, 
will cut service from John Wayne Airport, dropping 14 flights to such 
destinations as San Francisco, Sacramento, Tucson and Las Vegas over the next 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
 American Airlines cited profitability as the reason for pulling out of its two 
daily Sacramento flights on June 16. American Eagle will cancel all five of its 
San Francisco flights by May 30 and eliminate three flights to Tucson and four 
flights to Las Vegas by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest Airlines, which also operates discount carrier Morris Air Service at 
John Wayne, will begin offering one-way fares as low as $49 to Oakland and San 
Jose from Orange County on May 26. 
</P>
<P>
 American said although it has slashed fares as low as $49 on its San Jose 
route to compete with Southwest's planned fares, it may eventually cancel those 
flights as well.  
</P>
<P>
 "When Southwest enters a marketplace like Orange County and decides to 
compete, it does cause a decision for us," said Al Becker, spokesman for 
American Airlines in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, Orange County-Sacramento was a marginal market. We believe the 
aircraft and crews could be used better elsewhere. We're going to have to make 
a decision about San Jose, because we just can't make money at their fares."  
</P>
<P>
 Southwest will be offering seven round-trips daily to Oakland and San Jose, in 
addition to the two daily round trips to Salt Lake City it operates through 
Morris Air. Service to Sacramento is not planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point there are no plans to fly to Sacramento, but we do believe 
there is more room for growth and expansion in California," said Ed Stewart, 
spokesman for Dallas-based Southwest.  
</P>
<P>
 The American cuts will leave America West as the only airline serving 
Sacramento from John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time American said it would end Sacramento flights from 
John Wayne. In July, 1989, the company said it would cancel them because they 
were its least profitable. However, within weeks American decided to reinstate 
the nonstop flights between the county and the state capital after criticism 
from legislators, including state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 The latest American cutbacks may prompt more travelers to use Ontario Airport 
in San Bernardino County or discourage people from flying to the state capital, 
because the cheapest fares at John Wayne require reservations a week in advance 
and a Saturday-night stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business people or others who might consider going up to Sacramento to 
testify on a piece of legislation won't because the costs are becoming too 
prohibitive. And now it will be tougher with only one carrier," said Pete 
Calagna, a transportation issues expert for Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport 
Beach), who often travels from John Wayne to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "It discourages Orange County residents from participating in the political 
process," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 At John Wayne, several passengers flying to Sacramento Wednesday said they 
were disappointed to hear that American was abandoning the route. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Balassa, a commercial credit executive from Phoenix who often travels 
from Orange County to Sacramento, said he had just driven about 45 miles to 
John Wayne from Ontario after he was unable to get on an overcrowded Southwest 
flight to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I have to pay $38 more, but I get into Sacramento two hours earlier. 
Time is money in my business," he said. "But I'm sorry to hear there will only 
be one carrier here. That means prices will go up." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Purcilly, an administrative assistant with Assemblyman Ross Johnson 
(R-Fullerton), said the announcement would not affect their operations, because 
most of Johnson's staff already fly out of Ontario Airport to get the cheaper 
Southwest Airlines fares.  
</P>
<P>
 Travel agents also seemed untroubled by the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "These cutbacks really won't impact our business at all," said Lee Phillips, 
manager of Panorama Travel Corp. in Orange. "There are still several America 
West daily flights to Sacramento; it's a well-covered city. You just don't need 
several flights going to the same place." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at John Wayne Airport said the reduction in routes is not a signal 
of more cuts to come, pointing to new flights announced by American, such as a 
nonstop flight from Orange County to Kennedy International in New York City 
beginning June 1. American will also start service to Palm Springs in June.

FIRM AGREES TO BUY FOUNTAIN VALLEY HOSPITAL; HEALTH CARE: TENNESSEE-BASED ORNDA 
HEALTHCORP SEEKS TO ENLARGE ITS REGIONAL BASE. IT OWNS 16 FACILITIES IN 
SOUTHLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to enlarge a regional hospital chain in Orange County, a 
Tennessee-based hospital operator has agreed to buy the 413-bed Fountain Valley 
Regional Hospital and Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 OrNda HealthCorp in Nashville agreed to buy the hospital Monday night from the 
Fountain Valley Medical Development Co., a 102-member partnership that owns it, 
said Thomas Ways, chief executive of the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Howard Levine, 44, administrator of an OrNda-owned hospital in 
Orange, was appointed this week to head OrNda's network of hospitals in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine said OrNda's purchase of the Fountain Valley hospital has not yet been 
approved by OrNda's board of directors. It is also subject to other regulatory 
approvals.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposed purchase is part of an overall plan to create a network of 
hospitals in Southern California. OrNda already has 16 hospitals in Southern 
California and is looking to expand its network further. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we will have a greater market share in Orange County than any other 
company," Levine said. "In anticipation of health-care reform, this will give 
patients access to an alliance of low-cost, high-quality care." 
</P>
<P>
 Ways said the deal was attractive to the partnership, which has owned the 
hospital since its opening in 1971, because the hospital will be able to become 
part of that network and its patients will gain access to additional medical 
resources of other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a continuation of the steps toward consolidation taking place across 
the nation in the hospital industries," Ways said.  
</P>
<P>
 Publicly held OrNda completed a merger April 18 with Summit Health Ltd. and 
American Healthcare Management Inc., making itself into a $1.5-billion company 
with 46 hospitals in the nation. OrNda owns Chapman General in Orange, Doctor's 
Hospital of Santa Ana, Santa Ana Hospital Medical Center and Coastal 
Communities Hospital in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger makes OrNda a force in Southern California, but by no means is it a 
dominant player, said David Langness, spokesman for the Hospital Council of 
Southern California, a Los Angeles group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is creating alliances and networks with an eye toward being a major 
player when health-care reform takes effect," he said. "Usually the individual 
hospitals are not affected in their operations if the buyers are smart."

 El Pollo Loco -- apparently speedier than fast-food competitors who pretend to 
run for the border -- has actually crossed over into Mexico -- for its ads. The 
Irvine-based company has filmed its newest TV commercials at Rosarito Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Scenes of busy Mexican streets dominate the 30-second spots, as chefs prepare 
food in an open-air restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads, which began airing Sunday, promote the chain's new tacos al carbon 
and "make it abundantly clear that we're very, very different from Taco Bell, 
Del Taco, KFC or anyone else," said Louis Franson, the company's marketing 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads, in English, were created by Irvine agency dGWB, under the direction 
of Mandi Dossin, vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 El Pollo Loco also plans to launch a Spanish-language campaign later this 
month, which emphasizes family dining, authenticity and value. The ads are 
being produced by Casanova Pendrill Publicidad in Irvine, under the direction 
of Peggy Goff, vice president.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: CASH-POOR GATEWAY SELLING SOME OF ITS ASSETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gateway Communications Inc., a maker of computer network products, said 
Wednesday that it will sell some of its businesses to Virginia-based Microdyne 
Corp. for $2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Microdyne Corp., a competitor based in Alexandria, Va., will buy certain 
network adapter products, which allow for smoother data communication between 
computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of the assets gives Gateway access to much-needed cash. The company 
tried to attract Conrac Technology, an electronics firm in La Puente, as a 
majority investor but that deal fell through last month. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of investors threatened to take control of Gateway's board of 
directors in a proxy fight, but Gateway and the investors group reached an 
agreement last week that would give the group several seats on the Gateway 
board.

 CommerceBancorp: The holding company for CommerceBank reported a net loss of 
$957,000, or 40 cents per share, for its first quarter ending March 31. That 
loss, largely due to its 1990 acquisitions of two banks, compares to a net loss 
of $920,000, or 39 cents per share, for the same period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-performing loans increased during the quarter to $9.96 million, from $7 
million, and loan loss reserves as a percentage of total outstanding loans 
increased slightly from 5.66% to to 5.99%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach company's first-quarter loss is largely attributable to a 
$427,000 partial write-down from the 1990 acquisition of California City 
Bancorp and California City Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's leverage capital ratio continues to be below the 6.5% required by 
law. Its ratio was 2.14%, which makes it undercapitalized according to federal 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators have approved the bank's plan to increase its capital, which 
includes a possible stock offering.

 US Facilities Corp.: The target of a hostile takeover attempt said Wednesday 
that it has hired Wall Street investment banker Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc. to 
advise it on financial matters relating to the proposed merger or forced sale 
of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity National Financial Inc. in Irvine on Tuesday began to solicit annual 
meeting votes from US Facilities shareholders for a resolution forcing 
directors to put the Costa Mesa medical business, property and casualty insurer 
up for sale.The meeting is set for May 25. 
</P>
<P>
 George Kadonada, chairman of US Facilities, also sent shareholders a letter on 
Tuesday, asking them to sign over their votes to management instead, or at 
least to wait until directors make a recommendation after an as-yet unscheduled 
meeting in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity, the nation's fifth-largest title insurer, had offered $79 million, 
or $15 a share, last week to buy US Facilities. The offer technically expired 
last Friday, but the company would make the same offer if shareholders agree to 
put the company on the block, according to William P. Foley II, Fidelity's 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of US Facilities stock fell 25 cents a share to close Wednesday at 
$13.625 a share on the Nasdaq market system. Fidelity stock closed at $17.25 a 
share, down 12.5 cents a share on the New York Stock Exchange.

CURRENTS: BY DESIGN; THE FABRICS THAT MADE L.A. SWOON WITH DELIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moans and squeals of delight echoed through the halls of the Pacific Design 
Center, but what might have been the soundtrack from an X-rated movie was only 
interior designers vocalizing over new fabrics from Jakob Schlaepfer for 
Creation Baumann. The Swiss company recently unveiled its first $1,000-per-yard 
decorating fabric. That's correct, three zeros. Cha-ching, cha-ching, 
cha-ching. 
</P>
<P>
 What caused these monosyllabic expressions of joy? Lengths of gray velvet with 
large oval windows encircling crystal pendants, iridescent silk taffetas 
scattered with three-dimensional sheer roses, layers of tulle fastened with 
small wooden beads, and bright circles of velvet suspended on white satin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have other more affordable fabrics," said company spokesman Enrico 
Casanovas, "but now, on top of all that, we have this." A pause and a dramatic 
flourish. "The hat."

 A Two-Timer: "Money should not be a determinant in surrounding oneself with 
good design," says furniture designer Dakota Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 The '70s party guy and '80s Gap-ad hipster has a new mantel for the '90s -- 
that of furniture mogul. His latest guise has been incubating for quite some 
time. "I always wanted to be an industrialist like Andrew Carnegie," said the 
man who also lists magician and post-modern dancer on his resume. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has been producing one-of-a-kind furniture, available in Los Angeles 
at Randolph & Hine, since 1977. He's a special favorite among those who travel 
in the fast lane, yet, try as he might, a licensing deal with a mass 
manufacturer has been elusive. "No one was interested. They didn't consider me 
well-known enough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after he was chosen to represent the cognoscenti in ads for Absolut vodka 
and the Gap, his Q factor shot up and opened the door to a deal with Lane, a 
huge North Carolina-based furniture maker. The New Rhythm collection, 
introduced last month , will be available this fall at major department and 
furniture stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 60-piece group of startlingly glamorous pieces is a chest similar to 
one in Jackson's signature line, which includes custom-made pieces for $20,000 
or more. The Lane version is $2,000. The price difference "represents the 
separation between the two industries," Jackson said. "(Custom) pieces are 
extraordinarily expensive. Lane is all about good design at an extraordinary 
price."

 Store Bought: Patina V in Industry is known for its stylish mannequins. But it 
makes equally stylish tables and hanging racks for use as store fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 The furniture, Patina Arts, is made to take a lot of abuse. "If you buy an urn 
or a chair or whatever and it goes into your house, I'm not too worried," said 
company president Norman Glazer. "But when it is in stores and a little child 
crawls over it and it falls over, the owners worry about lawsuits. So we build 
everything like a tank." 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the potential of a dual market, Glazer developed a furniture line 
in mahogany and wicker targeting both the visual display and the home retail 
markets. It will debut May 15 at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair 
in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Glazer hopes to duplicate the crossover success he has had with the 
silver-colored slab chairs with oversized scrolls for backs, $225 to $410, and 
his upholstered settees, $995. The price is the same for individuals as it is 
for stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, Glazer said, "If someone wants over 500 pieces, they get a 
discount."

 Watching Elvis trying to swoon Ann-Margret poolside proved inspiring for 
designer Luis Pulido. No, he didn't run out to Vegas, or even pick up a guitar. 
But the mind behind Gypsys & Thieves did come up with a version of his own. The 
terry cloth top (below), detailed in black or brown, is dubbed the Elvis Pool 
shirt ($56). Just care for it like a regular towel. "They laugh at first," says 
Pulido about store buyers, "but the more progressive stores pick it up." 
Sweater Boys 
</P>
<P>
 If it looks like Granddad's lucky sweater, the one he wore to golf, then it's 
got that "chill, no-hype look" that the post hip-hop crowd is after, according 
to Mike Pringle, designer for streetwear line Greed. Pringle and partner Grant 
Lau put together their fave elements -- a cotton ribbed front panel on a wool 
sweater, lined in silky-smooth gold rayon -- in rich colors like black, 
burgundy, navy, forest green and brown ($77). "It runs parallel to music -- 
with the acid jazz sentiment," notes Pringle. Pair it perfectly with modish 
slim pants. Flaunting Necessities 
</P>
<P>
 Next to underwear, the item turned to most in any woman's wardrobe has to be 
the little black dress. Which is why Laura Weiss and Lily Albaisa of San Diego 
designed a whole collection of these black basics -- long, short, tight and 
flared. Their debut line, Le Soleil (right), is for the "strong, independent, 
modern woman who knows her own style," Weiss says. "We just offer a basic 
silhouette for her to build on with her own accessories." Of poly or sueded 
crepe, the dresses retails at about $80. Think Don Ho

 Whether they're catering to the middle-aged set, tiny tots or the dudes in 
between, surfwear companies are going Hawaiian with a full punch. Vintage 
islander prints are flowering on shirts, shorts and trunks. The hottest appear

FAUX PAS REPORT: TUCKED-IN TIES ARE A PREPPY PROPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the traditional preppy look hasn't been considered new for the past 15 
years, there are still some traces of it around if you search hard enough. Look 
at the large number of young guys who, like their dads once did, tuck their 
ties into their shirts after the second or third button. While they may view 
their appearance as classic, it's important that they remember where they're 
going with a tucked-in tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more of a 'club' look, for a nice casual evening," says Ziva Adams of 
Tie Rack in MainPlace/Santa Ana. "For a traditional office setting, you may 
look out of place." 
</P>
<P>
 If you're going for the tucked look, try it with a denim or chambray shirt. 
That gives you a mix of Western and preppy fashion. And try not to wear a tie 
with a great design on the bottom; no one will see it. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Chuck those shoes: Along with the punk movement's music and fashion came an 
old-fashioned pair of athletic shoes almost forgotten in an era of flashy 
air-and-gel togs. The old canvas Converse Chuck Taylor model, in traditional 
black or white, was the footwear of choice for millions of punks, and -- while 
punk fashion has faded -- that canvas shoe keeps moving right along. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a cheap classic," says fashion consultant Brian Mayne of Mission Viejo. 
"It's never been completely out of style, and it probably never will be." 
</P>
<P>
 What has changed about the old canvas high tops is color. For a while, red was 
chasing black as the most popular hue, while green was coming on strong. If 
you're going for that punkish look, is it OK to go with black? Absolutely, 
especially if you want to avoid today's trend toward wild shades of purple and 
tie-dye. Chuck must be shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Good tie-ming: At many of the local proms, there's been talk about how the 
"cool" guys are showing up for their dates without the traditional bow tie 
accenting their tuxedo. Instead, they're just buttoning the top of the shirt 
and leaving the tie in the box. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the Academy Awards, lots of stars were wearing tuxedos designed to be worn 
without a tie," says clothing buyer Blaine Keil of Laguna Beach. "That's now 
become the hip thing in formal wear." 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to try the tie-less look, you may be better off not using the 
traditional tuxedo shirt. Try finding a formal, white collarless shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finger fashion: It's hip, and a way of being a part of that retro-'60s aura of 
macrame and love beads without going over the edge. It's the little gold or 
silver ring that decorates the pinky. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have to dress conservatively for work, and if it's a plain band or it 
has a simple design, it's OK to wear one," says clothing designer Ellen 
Corcoran of Yorba Linda. "But stick with just one. These are playful pieces of 
jewelry, things you wear for fun, which may not be something you want to 
project (in an office)." 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to hang onto your rings, remember that gold is a little dressier 
than silver, and something with a stone is likely to look more formal than a 
plain band. And those small, fabric rings? They're strictly taboo at work.

 Polo has been known as the sport of kings -- though organizers of the 1994 
Legend's Cup Saturday night say it's also a sport fit for Kings (as in hockey) 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is the format: a fast-paced three-on-three indoor polo tournament 
that will pit the six best arena players in the world against each other (the 
winner prodded by the promise of a $6,900 Piaget watch). 
</P>
<P>
 Actors William Devane and Steve Bond, singers Juice Newton and Micky Dolenz 
are among the horse-savvy celebs scheduled to ride in the Celebrity Pre-Game 
match at 7:30 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Not only is this an exciting weekend of polo for spectators -- it could be the 
only one at the city-run L.A. Equestrian Center, 480 Riverside Drive, Burbank.  
</P>
<P>
 Make a night of it and dine at the L.A. Culinary Institute that overlooks the 
Equidome (other refreshments are also available), and all ticket holders are 
welcome to the post-match dance. Also, with your ticket stub, polo instructor 
Bruce Gaither is offering a free lesson. $15 general admission to $50 for 
center box seats. 
</P>
<P>
 A practice round Friday night is a charity benefit open to the public for 
$10-$25. Tickets at the gate or call: (818) 840-9066. LAURIE K. SCHENDEN

DANCING TO DREAMS' CONTENT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The school-age dancers in the St. Joseph Ballet's "Your Neighbor as Yourself" 
wore costumes that reflected the annual spring concert's African theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by the book "Designs From an African Tribe," costume director 
Jennifer Langeberg incorporated into her sketches African symbolism with urban 
icons such as houses and cars.The dancers' parents made the costumes from 
Langeberg's patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 For the girls, unitards were cut from top to bottom and united with a 
different colored half. Insets and appliques in red, yellow and blue were used 
to create the symbols, and skirts or palazzos were added for the different 
dance pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys wore baggy skater shorts with a colored band on one leg and 
short-sleeved T-shirts with appliques similar to the girls'. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 200 children participated in the concert at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
Most of the children live in Santa Ana's inner city, and their dance tuition is 
paid for by sponsors through the company's Adopt-a-Dancer program. 
</P>
<P>
 A reception preceding the performance on Friday gave founding director and 
choreographer Beth Burns a chance to applaud all the "big hearts in little 
bodies with big dreams," as she referred to the troupe's young dancers.

 We may have just moved into a place that looks straight out of "Leave It to 
Beaver," but so far, the spirit of June has eluded us. Would Mrs. Cleaver have 
forgotten where she'd packed her underwear? Not likely. Ours, on the other 
hand, was missing in action. So we did what we always do in time of crisis: 
headed for Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
 We try not to jiggle in a textured microfiber pantsuit. It isn't easy. Stomach 
muscles taut, bosom sagging, we avoided eye contact -- first with the crew of 
house painters who politely ignored us, then with those hard-bodied makeup 
salesgirls who flanked our route to the lingerie department. We loaded up on 
Adrienne Vittadini's failed attempt at undergarments, 50% off. Our intention 
was to slip the stuff on in the ladies lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we remembered the wicked story we'd just heard at a party. It seems a 
legendary bulimic was outed by a woman who'd followed her to the ladies room. 
The spy spotted bulimia's tell-tale sign: feet pointed the wrong direction in 
the stall. Days later, the story came back to haunt us. Did we really want to 
risk being outed as a public restroom underwear changer? Who knew who might be 
watching? We jiggled all the way home.

 Cover Shots: We love Madonna. So sue us. So does Jonathan Van Meter. So fire 
him. Never mind. He already quit. The former editor in chief of our favorite 
fashion-pop culture magazine, Vibe, was ordered to yank Madonna off the cover 
of the June-July issue by one of his bosses, Vibe founder and record producer 
Quincy Jones, according to the New York Times.  
</P>
<P>
 Executives at the magazine declined to comment Tuesday, saying it is not their 
practice to discuss editorial decisions. Some insiders suggest that Madonna 
isn't the fresh, hot young thing she once was, while others say she's the wrong 
color. Hey, the lily-white Beastie Boys made the cut this month. But then one 
of the Beasties was just convicted of beating up a tabloid television 
cameraman. . . .

in mohair's recent starring role in many a designer's fall collections. We 
wonder how they're reacting to an incident in which actress Fran Drescher 
leaned her mohair-sweater-wearing torso into some votives and caught fire? With 
surprise, it seems.  
</P>
<P>
 "Mohair is sort of self-extinguishing, like wool," said Madeline Daddiego, 
director of promotions for the New York-based Mohair Council of America. "I bet 
she was wearing one of those brushed mohair sweaters. And the candle singed the 
hairs, like when your hair catches fire."  
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, mohair is a big trend for fall and we should know that the United 
States is the largest mohair-producing country in the world. Just keep the 
stuff away from open flames. 
</P>

 The Land That Time Forgot: Just because we're not a country music fan doesn't 
mean we turn a blind eye to that particular fashion scene. And what better 
place than the Academy of Country Music Awards ceremony Tuesday night for 
checking out the biggest hair and sparkliest gowns this side of a wax museum? 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone, of course, stuck to the program. With her stick-straight 
unsprayed hair and shapeless black pants outfit, Mary-Chapin Carpenter risked 
-- in this crowd at any rate -- looking like a cross-dresser. Then there was 
the eerie sight of Randy Travis gone Hollywood. The 
singer-turned-aspiring-actor was clad in a beautifully cut neutral-colored suit 
with matching buttoned-up shirt, no tie and soft, wavy hair. We mistook him for 
Harry Hamlin till we heard the nasal twang. 
</P>
<P>
 But elsewhere it was business as usual. Young, pretty Faith Hill accepted her 
award as top new female vocalist looking like an over-teased, over-aged beauty 
queen. Reba McEntire performed a novelty song wearing rows and rows of blue 
fringe and matching Wonder Woman boots. The menfolk sported get-ups that ranged 
from show co-host Alan Jackson's sleeveless Hank Williams T-shirt tucked into 
skin-tight beltless jeans to a handful of leather tuxedo jackets. The must-have 
accessory? A 10-gallon hat.

 Contempo Casualties: News that the Boston-based Neiman Marcus Group would 
close 50 of its 288 Contempo Casuals stores -- primarily in the Los Angeles 
area -- hasn't quite registered with some of the troops. A salesclerk at a 
local Contempo Casuals had heard that some stores would be shut, but insisted 
that "it's for a positive reason. Nothing negative. They've given us limited 
information, but none of us will lose our jobs. We'll all be reassigned."  
</P>
<P>
 That came as a surprise to Joanne Parker, director of corporate relations, who 
told us that underperforming stores would be shut as early as the end of July, 
and up to 1,000 area employees terminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with stores that cater to the junior customer, Parker said, is 
that the clientele prefers to wear basics -- like those sold at the Gap. 
</P>
<P>
 They could find such basics at Neiman Marcus, couldn't they? "We wouldn't 
complain about that," Parker allowed.

 Book Report: The alleged indiscriminate gay encounters and copious drug use 
have been hashed over by the media. Here's the skinny on the second wave of 
intimacies shared in "Obsession: The Lives and Times of Calvin Klein," straight 
from co-author Steven Gaines. 
</P>
<P>
 On Klein's marriage to pretty, preppy assistant designer Kelly Rector: "It is 
a real, deeply committed marriage. She wanted to live in a fantasy world. . . . 
He wanted to be on the cutting edge of lifestyle movements: When it became hip 
to be clean and sober, he joined rehab. When it was hip in nouvelle society to 
be a mogul with a trophy wife, he married." 
</P>
<P>
 On Klein's request that no one assist Gaines and co-author Sharon Churcher in 
their research: "It brought people out of the woodwork. No one likes to be told 
what to do. Intimates, intimates, of Calvin's came forward." 
</P>
<P>
 On Gaines' next project: "A brilliant American success story, one of the most 
powerful men in America, he speed dials the White House -- David Geffen."

 A Mink of One's Own: Leave it to mink-wearing fashion correspondent Richard 
(you should call him "Mr.") Blackwell to turn up at a fashion soiree without a 
pen. Better you should forget the fur, sir! But then, we all have our 
politically incorrect weaknesses. (Ours is blood-red steak.)  
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope someone else's is celebrity-designed Levi's jackets because a 
hundred of them will be auctioned June 18 at the Century Plaza Hotel to benefit 
the Design Industries Foundation for AIDS (DIFFA). At a preview cocktail party 
last week, we noted our favorites: a button-covered version created by costume 
designer May Routh; Glenn Close's "Sunset Boulevard" interpretation -- complete 
with leopard spots and turban -- and the Whoopi Goldberg jacket, featuring 
curled yarn dreadlocks.

BEHIND THE SCENES; FORMALLY POOLED RESOURCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If a man changes from Speedos to tuxedos, is he a Renaissance man or an 
extremist? Maybe he's just a well-turned water polo player. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of USC men's water polo team modeled menswear at a fashion show last 
week at the Hyatt Regency in Irvine to benefit the Sophisticates' Assessment 
and Treatment Services Center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuxedos for the H2O hunks were provided by Gingiss Formalwear. Other clothes 
-- from casual Reyn Spooner island shirts to Hugo Boss suits -- came from Garys 
& Co. in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The wardrobe for the women in the show was supplied by 341 Bayside in Newport 
Beach, and the outfits for the children came from the Gosling in Newport Beach. 
Stuart Moore in Newport Beach provided the jewels.

PASSIONS STIR DRAMATICALLY IN 'NIGHTFALLS' MELTING POT; THEATER: OCC INSTRUCTOR 
JOHN FERZACCA DIRECTS STUDENTS IN THE PREMIERE OF HIS REFLECTIVE PLAY ABOUT 
'REMARKABLE' LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles' broad mosaic of Hollywood splash, sunbaked eccentricity, casual 
violence and urban ache avoids simple answers at almost every freeway turn. 
Finding a clear perspective seems daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's what John Ferzacca is attempting with "Nightfalls in L.A.," his 
35-character play about a metropolis that's as much a state of mind as it is 
this state's largest city. "Nightfalls" premieres tonight in Orange Coast 
College's Drama Lab Theatre and will continue through May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime OCC theater arts instructor and author of several plays (including 
"The Failure to Zig-Zag," staged at OCC in late 1991), Ferzacca said he started 
"Nightfalls" a few years ago as a series of one-acts focusing on the city's 
vivid history and diversity. As he wrote more and more of these playlets, they 
formed into a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had all these stories in mind and this need to describe a really remarkable 
city. I had something about the Hillside Strangler, something about the Rodney 
King case, something about the earthquakes. Everything, I hope, taps into the 
timelessness of L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also wanted to show why people come here. Some want to be movie stars; some 
come for the opportunities. The ethnic mix was important, too. Of course, 
putting it all together was the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 The play reflects on the past three decades but occurs in one long night. 
During these dark hours, a woman is abducted by a man who could be the Hillside 
Strangler. We're also introduced to Marilyn Monroe's daughter and an LAPD cop 
who must re-examine his feelings toward the King beating when he's seized by 
two black men. Then there's the woman who appears on game shows for a living. 
And that's just for starters. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19 actors -- mostly college students, many with little experience -- 
portray a rainbow coalition of characters -- African Americans, Latinos, 
Vietnamese, Koreans, Hawaiians, Middle Easterners -- who roam freely through 
Ferzacca's drama. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't recall that we've ever done a play at OCC featuring so much 
diversity," the playwright said. "My intent is to show what we were and have 
become. How we've changed and how we've stayed the same. I think it holds a 
mirror to the city's people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It also holds a mirror to OCC's theater arts department which, Ferzacca says, 
needs to stage more ethnically rich shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons I wanted to do this was to generate diversity right here . 
. . get more actors (of different races) into productions. We've always had the 
Newport Beach blond types, which is fine, but not enough others. There are 
plenty of roles in plenty of plays that can take (actors) of any race. 
</P>
<P>
 "For this show, we didn't have any trouble filling the roles. I was amazed how 
many people came out for auditions. It just shows you that they're out there, 
willing to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferzacca has written for Hollywood and said the play gave him an opportunity 
to reflect on that often frustrating corner of the city. The King case allowed 
him to ponder violence and racism, and his treatment of the Hillside Strangler 
became what he calls a rumination on "the psychology of the victim." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Monroe's daughter, Ferzacca said he was just having some fun. "I read a 
National Enquirer story about some woman in Australia who said she was 
Marilyn's daughter. I just wanted to look at that. . . . Of course, there's a 
Marilyn Monroe impersonator in the show, too." 
</P>
<P>
 He realizes that, with all the intertwining tales and characters, "Nightfalls" 
may be difficult for audiences, a worry that has kept him rewriting all the way 
through recent rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
 A further source of anxiety: This is the first time he is directing one of his 
own plays. "It's not easy," he said. "I feel a bit schizophrenic at times. But 
I'm sure I'll survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another challenge came with his decision to sprinkle much of the dialogue 
with foreign languages. He wanted realism but was often confused when it came 
time to introduce the right native phrase. "There's Spanish, Farsi, Vietnamese, 
Korean and French, and I have a problem because I don't speak any of those 
languages. I've had to rely on translators, and the actors themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few in his cast, he said, had language problems of their own because they 
weren't familiar with English slang. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were having a run-through, and these two actors were reading their lines 
very fast because they thought that ('run through') was literally what I 
meant," Ferzacca said. "They just didn't know what I was talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Nightfalls in L.A." by John Ferzacca premieres tonight at 8 at Orange Coast 
College's Drama Lab Theatre, 2701 Fairview Road, Costa Mesa. Continues Thursday 
through Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m. through May 15. $6 to $9. (714) 
432-5880.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: THIS WEEK, WE ARE GOING TO THE BIRDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone is a bird-watcher these days. It is hard not to be, with snowy 
plovers showing up on the endangered species list and gnatcatchers falling off. 
</P>
<P>
 Little birdies wield some major clout. They have been known to inspire fear 
and loathing in real estate developers, and a feeling of protectiveness in 
small children and the Department of the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
 And long before environmentalists began doing battle to protect habitats, 
birds were holding central positions in major religions and mythologies, and 
soaring to the highest levels in business, where as logos they perched with 
dignity and grace atop corporate letterheads. 
</P>
<P>
 They are a symbol of peace, of freedom, of God. We may revere them, respect 
them, fear them or eat them. But, arguably, none of us keeps a closer eye on 
them than Craig Faanes, the subject of this week's Centerpiece story, written 
by staffer Pancho Doll. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his job as head of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 
Ventura, Faanes is known to birders far and wide for having sighted and tallied 
this year the greatest number of North American birds for the annual List 
Report of the American Birding Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 To accomplish such a feat, Faanes has had to dedicate most of his free time 
and disposable income in the pursuit of one bird or another. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which makes Faanes seem to be a rather, shall we say, intensely 
dedicated guy? Which is not necessarily the way Faanes sees himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "While interviewing him for the story," Doll said, "Faanes told me about the 
time he was asked 'When are you not intense?' The answer he gave was, 'When I'm 
below the Tropic of Cancer.' Which goes with his favorite aphorism, manana, 
which he said doesn't mean tomorrow; it just means not today." 
</P>
<P>
 Such an attitude seems at odds with Faanes' actual behavior, which seems 
downright driven at times. Not that he is the Tonya Harding of ornithologists; 
he's never been known to kneecap another birder. But he is a man who goes to 
great lengths to get his bird -- his passport has extra pages to accommodate 
all the necessary visas, and entry and exit stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Faanes likes the thrill of the chase, but he also insists that he has 
the birds' best interests in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "He claims to have done a fair amount of environmental sabotage as a youth," 
Doll said. "When he was a teen-ager, he found some earthmoving equipment near 
his home in Wisconsin. He cut the wires and filled the gas tank with sand. Ever 
since, he has been very concerned with the preservation of bird habitats." 
</P>
<P>
 If you find after reading Doll's story, as we did, that you are more 
interested in Faanes than in the birds he watches, you will be happy to know 
that he is now in the process of compiling an autobiography of his travels and 
birding pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you think will have the greater number of pages, the autobiographical 
text or the index?

THEATER REVIEW; MUSICAL A WARM LOOK AT MARRIAGE; 'I DO! I DO!' FOLLOWS A COUPLE 
THROUGH 50 YEARS -- AND IS AS CUDDLY AS A BUNNY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seldom has the institution of marriage received such a tender and knowing 
treatment as in "I Do! I Do!" The 1968 musical by the writers of "The 
Fantasticks" is playing at Dinner Theatre at Ottavio's in Camarillo, capably 
directed by Pamela Matheson. 
</P>
<P>
 The story follows "Agnes" and "Michael" through 50 years of marriage, 
beginning with their turn-of-the-century wedding. While the relationship isn't 
entirely smooth, the show is as warm and cuddly as a bunny. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyricist-librettist Tom Jones and composer Harvey Schmidt based their show on 
Jan de Hartog's drama, "The Fourposter," brought to the screen in a 1952 movie 
starring Rex Harrison and Lili Palmer; the original Broadway cast of "I Do! I 
Do!" starred Robert Preston and Mary Martin. With just one set and a cast of 
two, it's an ideal property for dinner theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Some old-timers might remember Ed Ames' hit single of one of the show's songs, 
"My Cup Runneth Over," back in the days when Broadway shows could spawn hit 
records. But that isn't the only good song in "I Do! I Do!"; it isn't even the 
best. Jones and Schmidt provide a lot of musical variety, notably in the giddy 
"I Love My Wife," and the gleefully male-chauvinist "It's a Well Known Fact" 
(reminiscent of "A Hymn to Him" in "My Fair Lady"), as well as several more 
conventionally romantic numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Voll and Ronda Borgwardt are a fine pair -- and a natural couple -- in 
this production. She has the more ambitious singing voice; he gets to "play" 
the trombone (remember, this originally starred Mary Martin and Robert 
Preston). 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Matheson designed the choreography, Tom Murry created the set -- 
dominated by a "fourposter" bed -- and musical director Lisa Wolf supplies 
piano accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot is thin, strands wandering off and disappearing without explanation. 
But pay no mind. Champagne, too, is relatively thin, but sometimes sheer 
effervescence provides sufficient kick. And such is the case with "I Do! I Do!"

THEATER REVIEW; CHAOS AND CLOWNING REIGN IN STAGING OF ITALIAN COMEDY; CARLO 
GOLDINI'S "THE SERVANT OF TWO MASTERS" AT VENTURA COLLEGE INVOLVES DISGUISES 
AND HIGH JINKS. BUT MOSTLY IT'S LOUD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Confusion, deception, cross-dressing and saucy servants add up to 
"Shakespeare" to many English-speaking theater fans. Aficionados of classical 
Italian theater, though, might be reminded of prolific 18th-Century playwright 
Carlo Goldini, whose "The Servant of Two Masters" is the current production of 
Ventura College's theater department. 
</P>
<P>
 The translation chosen by director Jay Varela is a (relatively) recent 
adaptation by Tom Cone, one of at least two modern English translations 
available. Goldini is credited with introducing realistic, rounded characters 
to the broad, slapstick commedia dell'arte. This "Servant" is still very broad, 
but mainly it's loud. 
</P>
<P>
 After her fiance is killed in a duel, Clarice finds herself betrothed to 
Silvio, the earnest if less-than-bright son of attorney Lombardi. It is an 
arrangement made by Clarice's father, Pantalone, a Venice merchant. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the first fiance shows up -- alive. Clarice has never had any 
affection for him, never even met him. But, her father insists, a promise is a 
promise, and plans are made for Clarice to marry her first fiance. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait! The first fiance turns out to have been killed in the duel after 
all; the interloper is Beatrice, impersonating her dead brother in an attempt 
to track down his killer. High jinks ensue. 
</P>
<P>
 An ancillary plot involves Truffaldino, a servant who has hired himself out to 
two masters simultaneously, by pretending to be his own cousin. 
</P>
<P>
 Varela and his cast stage all of this for maximum physical impact, with actors 
rushing up and down the auditorium's aisles, offstage pianist Edward B. Wahl 
banging out "That's Amore," and tertiary characters dressed as modern-day 
circus clowns. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sunday afternoon's less-than-crowded performance, at least, much of that 
energy seemed to dissipate into the ether. Practically everybody involved stuck 
to one tone, verging on hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
 The play's strongest aspects may be its energy, and the colorful and inventive 
costume and makeup design credited to Abra Flores: Truffaldino (Rob Sanchez) 
looks a bit like Chico Marx, for instance, and Lombardi (PJ Galligan) resembles 
a cross between Jose Ferrer and Martin Short's "SCTV" character Ed Grimley. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading performers include Jeff Britt as Pantalone; Jill Waggoner as 
Pantalone's spunky maid Smeraldina; Gregory Small, affecting an Elmer Fudd 
voice, as Silvio; Sarah P. Meaney as both Clarice and the voice of 
Truffaldino's stomach; and Jazz Walea as Beatrice. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "The Servant of Two Masters." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Closes May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Ventura College Mainstage Theater, Loma Vista Road (west of Day 
Road), Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: $9 general admission; $7 students, staff and seniors. College ASB 
cardholders free. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Friday night's show only will be signed for the hearing-impaired by 
Deby Tygell. For reservations for any performance or further information, call

 When you were a kid, you could probably get by with giving Mom a "pre-sampled" 
sampler box of chocolates for Mother's Day. But now you'll have to do better 
than that. And a ringside seat to hear fiddle virtuoso Mark O'Connor might be 
just the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor will be featured in a special Mother's Day concert Sunday as part of 
a new intimate showcase series, "Nicholby's Presents," at Nicholby's Upstairs 
Night Club & Pool Hall in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his many accolades, O'Connor just picked up his seventh Academy of 
Country Music "Hat" trophy for best instrumentalist-fiddle. In 1991, 1992 and 
1993, the soft-spoken master fiddler, guitarist and mandolinist was named the 
Country Music Assn.'s "Musician of the Year." And in 1992, he won a Grammy for 
the "Best Country Instrumental Performance" for his historic "New Nashville 
Cats" album on the Warner Bros. label. 
</P>
<P>
 A child prodigy, O'Connor had won every major fiddle competition in the 
country and had recorded four albums by the time he was in high school. After 
moving to Nashville in 1983, he became Music City's most awarded and most 
in-demand musician. In six years, he appeared on more than 450 recordings by 
major stars in gospel, pop and country, including James Taylor, Chet Atkins, 
Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, Randy Travis, Amy Grant, Paul Simon and Leon 
Redbone. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Connor does not limit himself to performing a country repertoire. His 
mastery of musical styles extends to classical, jazz and bluegrass. He appeared 
as soloist with the Santa Fe Symphony this season for the premiere of his 
Fiddle Concerto for Violin and Orchestra. And his latest Warner Bros. album, 
"Heroes," is a compilation of O'Connor performing with 14 of his childhood 
violinist-fiddler idols, including Doug Kershaw, Jean-Luc Ponty, Charlie 
Daniels and Pinchas Zukerman. And last year, he shared the stage at Carnegie 
Hall with Isaac Stern and Itzhak Perlman. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview in Performance magazine last year, O'Connor promised more live 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go out and do an hour and a half to two hours and leave the stage totally 
exhausted," he said. "It's the one place I know I can give the audience my all 
and I know I did my job from their response. It's great." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The third annual Ventura Police Block Party will kick off at 8 a.m. Saturday 
with a pancake breakfast by the Ventura Kiwanis Club. And events for the whole 
family will continue through the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The country music highlights will be found on Stage I. Shiloh will perform 
lots of danceable traditional and new country tunes from 9:15 a.m. to 12:15 
p.m. Then at 12:30 p.m., Chris Hillman, formerly of the legendary Byrds and 
Desert Rose Band, will perform an hour of acoustic music with Jim Monahan, 
guitarist with the Fender Benders, and Ojai singer-songwriter Alan Thornhill. 
And the popular regional group, Darlene O'Connell and the Dixie Flyers, will 
close the show from 1:45 to 4:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of the free event centers around personal safety and crime 
prevention. There will be plenty of show-and-tell emergency response equipment 
for the kids, along with K-9 dog demonstrations, drunk-driving simulations and 
Police Department tours. You'll also find vendor, display, food and game 
booths. Ronald McDonald, Hanna-Barbera's Yogi Bear, Magic Mountain's Yosemite 
Sam, Smokey Bear and McGruff the Crime Fighting Dog will be there. So bring the 
cameras and the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The block party will at the Ventura Police Department, 1425 Dowell Drive. Free 
parking is available at the 101 Drive-In Theatre Lot C, off Portola Road, and 
also in the vacant lot next to the Star-Free Press on Ralston Street. Details

NIGHT LIFE: KMFDM'S RELENTLESS BEAT DUE IN VENTURA; THE BAND, WHOSE LATEST 
ALBUM IS CALLED 'ANGST,' IS LED BY A COUPLE OF GERMANS WHO REVEAL THE REAL 
MEANING OF THE GROUP'S NAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The industrial, techno, sonic guitar assault of KMFDM is like riding on a 
motorcycle about 200 m.p.h. with the Predator singing in your ear. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what happens when children grow up and most of their friends are 
machines. The powerful yet meticulous programming on KMFDM songs is sufficient 
to get the kitchen appliances dancing across the counter, so relentless is the 
beat. Which means that local toaster ovens will be hopping Friday when KMFDM 
comes to the Ventura Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, KMFDM is not your typical barrel of laughs unless you think 
that all Martin Scorsese movies are comedies. KMFDM's latest album -- entitled 
"Angst" -- pretty much says it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some sample lyrics from "Sucks," a single off "Angst." 
</P>
<P>
 Our music is simple, totally fake/It's done by machines 'cause they don't make 
mistakes/We don't have no lyrics; our message is nil/We hate all DJs -- they're 
making us ill/Whatever we tell you is meant to be crap/We hate all music, 
especially rap/We don't like Michael Jackson; we hate Depeche Mode/We don't 
care for Madonna or Kylie Minogue/You must think we're stupid; but we're way 
above it/We don't give a (bleep) and the kids just love it . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of Germans who now live in the United States are mostly to blame for 
all of this. Sascha Konietzko is the programmer supreme and also a vocalist and 
percussionist. En Esch is the one who learned to sing by watching every 
Tasmanian Devil cartoon too many times. He also is a guitarist and 
percussionist. Mark Durante and Svet Am play more guitars, real loud. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors abound about the meaning of their name. The usual explanation is an 
unprintable one that concerns the demise of techno popsters Depeche Mode. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, a Florida radio station sponsored a contest to name the band. Some 
of the entries included Kiss My Friendly Delicious Mom, Koresh Made Fifty Die 
Miserably, Kick Me for Doing Math, Kill Me for Drug Money, Kennels Make 
Friendly Dogs Mean, Kevorkian Makes Feeble Dorks Mighty or Killing Madonna 
Frees Desperate Minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the answer is more prosaic than any of those. Esch and Konietzko 
were doing performance art in Paris in 1983. The French cultural affairs 
minster criticized the act, saying the Germans ". . . had no pity for the 
majority of the visitors to the exhibition." In German, "no pity for the 
majority" is "Kleine Mitlied fur das Mehrheit." KMFDM. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that you know what you're in for, Konietzko talked it all over from his 
Seattle home. 
</P>
<P>
 You guys have been everywhere. What's the difference between American 
audiences and European audiences? 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans seem to be more into it, more enthusiastic. For the Europeans, 
it has to do with a certain arrogance. It's like they've seen it before, heard 
it better, heard it louder and the acid was better, or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 You live in Seattle. What's the scene like up there? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't go out too much. To me, the city seems to be pretty high-strung and 
uptight." 
</P>
<P>
 Your partner, En Esch, lives in New Orleans. What's the writing process? 
</P>
<P>
 "We meet when it's necessary. Usually a song starts with a certain loop, the 
guitar stuff comes later and the lyrics usually come last. I like to call our 
music 'ultra heavy beat.' Some people call it industrial, but that's not really 
what it is. Our music has very positive lyrics and strong song structures. It's 
really not like Ministry or Skinny Puppy at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Why do concerts always start late? 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked myself just last night: Why are concerts always so loud? I'm getting 
older, and I'll have to be wearing earplugs soon. I guess concerts are a 
process of entertainment anticipation. You get dressed, then go to the club and 
stand around sweating, waiting for something to happen. Then you have a couple 
of drinks, then stagger home. We usually start on time within 20 minutes or 
so." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Theatre show is $19.50. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is? That's high, really high. We try to keep the prices down because we 
want people to come and see us. We're not the types that you see driving around 
in limos like U2 talking about crap they don't believe in. We try to keep the 
prices of our T-shirts down to about 12 bucks, and our shows are usually 
between $13 and $16. And usually there's four bands or so on the bill, so it's 
more or less entertaining. We make a conscious decision about those things." 
</P>
<P>
 What's up with MTV attempting to censor "A Drug Against War," one of your 
videos? 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't really try to censor us, but this particular animated video was 
very expensive and some people at Wax Trax thought, 'Yeah, we need MTV,' and 
wanted to change it. But I couldn't care less. MTV is a major source of 
stupefying people. They make kids dumb. But Fox plays our video, and clubs 
everywhere play it, so that's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 What's the secret to survival and sanity on the road? 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't drink. Don't smoke too many cigarettes. Eat good food. If you don't 
drink, you'll usually go to bed early." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: KMFDM, Sister Machine Gun, Chemlab.

CENTERPIECE: DOGGING THE BIRD; IS CHRIS FAANES YOUR TYPICAL WEEKEND BIRD 
WATCHER? DON'T COUNT ON IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PANCHO DOLL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Faanes' field glasses are filled with bufflehead and bobolinks, 
dowitchers and kittiwakes, godwits, gadwalls and golden-eyes, all of them among 
the more than 1,800 bird species he's doggedly pursued across North America. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last decade, Faanes has spent tens of thousands of dollars traveling 
from Panama to Alaska, peering through binoculars at boobies, phoebes and 
towhees, red-breasted sapsuckers and yellow-rumped warblers. 
</P>
<P>
 Each one he sees, he puts a check by its name. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, in May when the American Birding Assn. publishes its annual List 
Report, a compilation of members who submit tallies of the species they have 
sighted, Faanes will sit at the top of the North American list with 1,627 out 
of a possible 1,850. 
</P>
<P>
 Faanes, 42, heads the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Ventura. An 
ornithologist by training, he was first aware of bird watching at the age of 4. 
He listed his first bird, a northern bobwhite, near his Wisconsin home when he 
was 10. As soon as he got a car, he started driving around the state looking 
for birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "When one of my professors asked me what I wanted to do with my life, I told 
him that I wanted to list more North American species than any other person." 
</P>
<P>
 The achievement of that goal hasn't come without a price beyond air fare and 
hotel bills. Some have dubbed Faanes a ticker, a person who, upon achieving one 
objective, presses ahead to the next. Critics of tickers shrug off big lists 
for being as much a factor of time and money as birding skill. 
</P>
<P>
 The disdain for tickers is one of several issues that divide those who treat 
wild birds as a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bird watching" is a broad category that a U. S. Department of the Interior 
survey ranked as the second most popular outdoor activity behind gardening. 
Bird watching differs significantly from what Faanes does, which is birding. 
Racing to Locales 
</P>
<P>
 Birders are dedicated, often intense, individuals who spend vacations in 
distant places where they can observe and list birds. These longer trips are 
punctuated by infrequent dashes to locales where a rare bird has been spotted. 
</P>
<P>
 When Virgil Ketner found a Xantus' hummingbird near his east Ventura home in 
1988, he announced the sighting on a call-in tape, one of several across the 
nation that notifies the birding community of rare sightings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next morning at dawn, there were over 100 people there waiting for it to 
get light," said Ketner, who put out a sign-up sheet for the visitors. "By the 
time the bird left two months later, there were over 1,000 names on the list." 
</P>
<P>
 Those are birders. 
</P>
<P>
 Like pilgrims to the Xantus' hummingbird, Faanes has accumulated a huge number 
of air miles traveled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really kicked in 10 years ago. I got divorced in North Dakota and part of 
the healing process was to travel." 
</P>
<P>
 When a flame-colored tanager was spotted in southeast Arizona, he leaped into 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a flight the next morning, landed in Phoenix, rented a car and drove 4 
1/2 hours to where the bird had been spotted. I found it, got in the car, drove 
back, jumped on the plane and was in my office the next morning." 
</P>
<P>
 A Steller's sea eagle, a Siberian species, turns up on a glacier outside of 
Juneau. Score. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Andrew vireo, a small bird found only on tiny Isla San Andres off 
Panama. Score. 
</P>
<P>
 There are just two corners of the area defined as North American by the 
American Birding Assn. that Faanes hasn't covered: the remote Darien Province 
of Panama and Attu Island on the tip of the Aleutians by the international 
dateline. His passport is so overrun with visas, entry and exit stamps that he 
had to get extra pages from the State Department, and those pages are rapidly 
spilling over. 
</P>
<P>
 When a Fish and Wildlife Service pilot claimed to be more widely traveled, 
Faanes founded the North American Airport and Airline Listing Assn. to decide 
once and for all who had visited more airports. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules state that only airports with a three-letter designator code count 
(there are 35 such airports in California; Faanes has logged 20 of them), and 
that you only have to touch the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after founding the NAAAL, Faanes and the pilot rented a plane and 
spent an afternoon doing touch-and-gos in Norfolk, Neb.; Columbus, Neb.; 
Yankton, S. D., and Sioux City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty bad," Faanes said, acknowledging his compulsion to catalogue and 
categorize everything.  
</P>
<P>
 "One year I made it my goal to list the license plates from all 50 states and 
the District of Columbia by May. Well, that was pretty easy, so the big thing 
next year was to do it by March." 
</P>
<P>
 The license plate exercise culminated the following year when Faanes was 
working in Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one minute past midnight, I cruised the Holiday Inn parking lot in Grand 
Island looking for plates. I got a Vermont, Hawaii and 23 other states by 12:30 
in the morning. That was the year I logged all 51 plates by Jan. 28," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty bad, huh? Someone asked me when am I not intense. I said when I'm 
below the Tropic of Cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 He is, above all, a lover of the lower latitudes. He's visited 41 islands in 
the West Indies and imbibed a lot of rum in the process. The cumulative 
experience has made him a devoted fan of singer Jimmy Buffett. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have all 232 of his songs." 
</P>
<P>
 A friend once asked Faanes how many geographical references he thought that 
there were in Buffett's lyrics. Faanes sat down with a pencil and listened to 
all 232 songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 112 geographical references. Mexico was the most frequently 
mentioned." 
</P>
<P>
 Faanes' listing zeal makes him a figure of controversy among even the 
list-building element in birding ranks. Sightings Questioned 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Balch, the Illinois-based editor of the List Report, to be mailed 
with the June issue of Birding magazine, said some people consider Faanes' 
sightings to be unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's said frequently and vehemently," Balch said. "I don't have too many 
doubts about his North American total. He could be off by 40 birds and still be 
ahead of the next guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Faanes said he's been aware of the criticism for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been making sure that there are a bunch of people around when I go 
chasing a new species, so that if any doubt arises, there are people who can 
say, 'Oh, yeah, I saw it also." ' 
</P>
<P>
 While the vast majority of his sightings are valid beyond question, a few have 
raised some eyebrows. Take the case of the Eskimo curlew, a species Faanes 
reported seeing in Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, the bird migrated in great numbers through the Great Plains to 
its High Arctic nesting grounds. Now it's virtually extinct. 
</P>
<P>
 Balch said that although the sighting was not totally implausible, there have 
been no verified sightings for 10 years and few in the last 30. The Nebraska 
rare birds record committee, a group that determines if a sighting should be 
added to the scientific record, didn't include Faanes' Eskimo curlew. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't even hear about it until six months later and only then through a 
newspaper story," said Tanya Bray, a former member of the rare birds record 
committee. "A sighting like this is important not only to the birding 
community, but to the scientific community. It's very unusual that it should 
come to us through a newspaper article and so long after the fact." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was there," Faanes countered. "I saw it." 
</P>
<P>
 He even went to a museum and got a specimen of the Eskimo curlew, along with 
the other species he had seen it with, and re-created the scene to confirm the 
sighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at the curve of the bill on the Eskimo curlew, and there's no doubt 
in my mind." Rare Finds 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Lehman of Goleta is editor of Birding magazine and a former member of the 
California rare bird records committee. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that in a rare bird sighting -- for instance, the Xantus' hummingbird, 
which was out of its typical range in Mexico -- the bird will hang around for a 
few days and other people will list it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now and then, everybody finds a bird that takes off and can't be found 
again," Lehman said. "But if it happens too often, it leads to suspicion." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Desjardin of Ventura is one of the few people who has gone birding with 
Faanes since the Wisconsin native moved to Ventura a year ago. Desjardin 
defends his sometime birding partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "False sightings happen all the time. He's made as many honest mistakes as 
anyone else," Desjardin said. "In the birding world, you have people who think 
they know it all. That's typical in this hobby where many people are 
over-competitive. Your credibility is always being questioned." 
</P>
<P>
 Faanes counters the doubts with a challenge: 
</P>
<P>
 "Come along with me the next time I go birding." Where the Birds Are 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on how you count it, Ventura County is one of the best places in the 
country to go birding. Virgil Ketner, head of the annual Christmas bird count, 
said the county regularly ranks among the top 10 in the nation for number of 
bird species identified. Each of the public access birding areas listed below 
hosts as many as 100 species over the course of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Casitas: Eagles winter at the lake. During other seasons it's excellent 
for wading birds as well as ducks, grebes and Cattle egrets  
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Sewage Treatment Plant and Santa Clara River estuary: Water birds love 
the waste water settling ponds and the adjoining estuary has shore birds 
galore. The area has a booming population of herons, American avocets, 
yellowlegs and sanderlings. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Grove Park in Camarillo: Colorful orioles, California quail and great 
horned owls. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildwood Park in Thousand Oaks: Purple finch, warbling vireo and other 
woodland species 
</P>
<P>
 Big Sycamore Canyon, Pt. Mugu State Park: Species such as the scrub jay, 
California thrasher and brown towhee abound here. The canyon is also a great 
place for "vagrants," species that are out of their normal range and thus 
constitute rare sightings.

MUSIC; PIANIST CHARLES BROWN TO BRING LEGENDARY BLUES SOUND TO TOWN; HIS TUNES 
TOPPED THE CHARTS IN THE 1940S, AND HE'S JUST AS GOOD TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Charles Brown has been around longer than Charlie Brown. The senior Brown, a 
smooth piano player, had his first hit, "Driftin' Blues" right after World War 
II. Now, at 72, Brown has just released a new album, "Just a Lucky So and So," 
his third since his re-emergence in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his tight band will be at SOhO -- that place in Santa Barbara still 
searching for a capital H -- on Saturday night. Brown has plenty of stories to 
tell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, one big-time critic gave my new one four stars," Brown said from a New 
Orleans hotel room. "Most everyone else, too, gave it four stars except for one 
guy who gave it 3 1/2 stars. He said, 'Charles Brown don't need no band.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is keeping busier than most seniors. He has just returned from Spain, 
France, Italy and Germany. And next month, he is scheduled to play with the 
Oakland Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you know, they don't select no one that would disgrace that symphony," he 
said. "Right now, I have more work than I can hardly do, and that's a good 
thing. I'm in good health. I can't complain -- no pain. Everything has been 
wonderful, and I'm glad to have my voice and my piano." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown came to the Golden State in 1946 after studying chemistry at a college 
in Texas. Brown joined one of the hot L. A. bands, Johnny Moore's Three 
Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were down around 1st Street and San Pedro in L. A., which used to be a 
Japanese area, but they were moved away during the war, and it became a colored 
area. Back then, it was colored, not black. This fortuneteller told us that we 
were gonna sign a contract within 24 hours; but Johnny didn't care about that 
-- he wanted to know about the racehorses. She told Johnny to play No. 7 in the 
fourth race. I'll never forget; it was Lovely Millie and she was like a 99-to-1 
shot. We put our money on this horse and sure enough, it won! We won 175 bucks 
for six bucks." 
</P>
<P>
 Later that night, he said, the president of Philo records showed up at the 
show and offered the trio a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "He offered us 400 bucks to do that song and four more numbers besides," Brown 
said. "I was mesmerized just to make a record, but the company couldn't make 
the records fast enough, and "Driftin' Blues" was selling for $10 Back East. It 
got to be the No. 1 record of the year in 1946, and we got the Cashbox Award -- 
there were no Grammys then. I don't know where that trophy went. I used to move 
around a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The next step for the trio was to conquer New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "The place to play in New York was the Apollo Theatre. The big bands were out. 
Nat Cole was setting the pace for trios by making about as much money as the 
big bands did. Our first night was at the Renaissance Theatre. Nat Cole showed 
up that night because he was from California like we were. 
</P>
<P>
 Next came the inevitable creative differences. "Everyone began to get money 
eyes," according to Brown. He left and signed as a solo artist with Columbia, 
then Aladdin Records. With the latter label, Brown had six songs on the charts 
in 1949. Then came union troubles, and Brown ended up playing little dives and 
was "forgotten in a year." Around 1960, Brown was playing a club in Newport, 
Ky., run by some shady types. 
</P>
<P>
 "One night, Dinah Washington was playing and she noticed me and said, 'Charles 
Brown, what are you doing here? I'm taking you with me back to Chicago to open 
up for me.' At the time, I had this '55 Cadillac El Dorado, great car. So I 
told these people I worked for that I was going to Chicago. And they said, 
'Fine, Charles. But you like that car, don't you? How'd you like to be found in 
it with a bullet in your head?' I decided to stay where I was." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1962, Brown had given up playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I never gave up practicing," he said. "I didn't do nothing until Bonnie 
Raitt found me." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Mike Kauffer, Ojai local, who is to blame for Blue Monday and the Ojai 
Bowlful of Blues Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 1988 or 1989, and Michael Kauffer was the one that said I should be 
seen again," Brown said. "He booked me in at the Vine Street Grill in 
Hollywood. The owner said, 'So who is this Charles Brown?' Michael Kauffer 
asked who was playing then and the guy said 'Mose Allison.' 'Well, just ask 
Mose,' said Kauffer." 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation by Allison was enough to land Brown a gig on Tuesdays and 
Wednesdays, two of the slowest nights of the week. Raitt was one of the many 
patrons who came to see him perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, Raitt and Brown met again, this time in Washington, where she 
presented Brown with a lifetime achievement award from the Rhythm & Blues 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "She came up to me and said, 'Charles Brown, you are Mr. Rhythm & Blues. I 
could marry you, musically.' And I said, 'You don't want to marry me -- you'd 
be smelling liniment all night,' " Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Brown has been on a roll, even receiving a Grammy nomination in 
1992. But is Brown a blues guy, a jazz guy or do they need to invent a new 
category? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not just a blues artist," he said. "Nat Cole and I used to be called 
variety artists, and we made race records. A variety artist is a person that 
could do anything -- we did what made money -- if it was blues, we could do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 And, according to Brown, what Raitt did for him, he has done for others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took other artists with me on the road. I took the Clovers and Ruth Brown. 
I took Etta James, Big Mama Thornton, Floyd Dixon. I took Ray Charles on the 
road when he was young," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I am, still vital and energetic. People knew that I could still work and 
be good, but Bonnie Raitt was the one that saw fit to bring me back." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is he back, but Brown seems in no danger of going away. Details

THEATER REVIEW; GETTING REAL WITH 'DEATH OF A SALESMAN'; PCPA THEATERFEST'S 
STUNNING PRODUCTION FEATURES LEADING REGIONAL PERFORMER JAMES EDMONDSON AS 
WILLIE LOMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Willie Loman, the beaten-down dreamer in Arthur Miller's "Death of a 
Salesman," remains the archetypal casualty of that great American myth -- the 
limitless possibilities of reinvented identity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the unbridgeable gulf between the self-aggrandizing distortions of Willie's 
fantasies and the drudgery of his relentlessly bland world lies a tragedy as 
American as apple pie. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Loman's life may play out as a pitiable negation of the Dale 
Carnegie ideal, there are still limitless possibilities in the oft-performed 
role for a great actor to rivet an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what happens in PCPA Theaterfest's stunning production of 
"Salesman," with James Edmondson's stellar turn as its centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmondson, on loan from Ashland's Oregon Shakespeare Festival, is firmly 
established as one of the country's leading performers in regional theater. And 
in a performance that aches with dying dreams, Edmondson makes Willie's tragedy 
our own. 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment he enters with shoulders sagging beneath the weight of his 
enormous sample kits, Edmondson's grip on the character never falters. He nails 
the full range of Willie's spectrum, whether soaring aloft with pumped-up 
optimism for a promotion he'll never get or ranting at the latest breakdown 
amid the mediocre appliances he's still paying off. 
</P>
<P>
 The subterranean faults that bring Willie down are stripped bare not only by 
the performance, but by the remarkably focused staging of director Paul Barnes. 
With heartbreaking clarity, the flashbacks establish the tiny fissures that 
will one day tear the Loman family to pieces: Willie's unfounded bragging about 
his imagined accomplishments, the unrealistic praise he heaps on his son Biff, 
and his refusal to deal seriously with Biff's stealing and cheating. 
</P>
<P>
 As Biff, actor Frederic Barbour smolders with the worst kind of defeated rage 
-- the kind rooted in self-awareness. And his attempts to bring honesty to his 
relationship with Willie are made infinitely more painful by our knowledge that 
Willie is a lost cause. 
</P>
<P>
 A salesman who doesn't realize that "the only thing you got in this world is 
what you can sell" is the way Willie's friend Charley (Robert Vincent Frank, in 
an impeccable supporting performance) describes him, and in that central 
blindness is a failure both pathetic and all-too-human. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all salesman," Arthur Miller once said. Selling ourselves to our 
friends, our families, our employers in the hope that we can be "well-liked" 
(in Willie's phrase), our own unrecognized flaws and unacted-upon values are a 
time bomb waiting to go off. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching that detonation occur with this much force is as real as theater 
gets. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Death of a Salesman." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: 8 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays, 7 p.m. Sundays, matinees at 2 
p.m. Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays; through May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Allan Hancock College Severson Theatre, Bradley and Stowell roads, 
Santa Maria.

REWIND; VIEWING BRITISH 'FAWLTY TOWERS' IS TO BOTH CRINGE AND LAUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From Monty Python to "A Fish Called Wanda," John Cleese has specialized in 
portraying the repressed Englishman -- a part of him that he has struggled to 
overcome in his own life, he's said in interviews and in books. 
</P>
<P>
 Among all the emotionally straitjacketed characters he has created, none has 
come so tightly wound, or unraveled as spectacularly, as Basil Fawlty, 
proprietor of a small hotel in the English seaside town of Torquay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fawlty Towers," a BBC series of the '70s that still crops up occasionally on 
public television, is something like the television equivalent of a train 
wreck: It's hard to tear your eyes away from Basil's self-destruction. To watch 
"Fawlty Towers" is to cringe and laugh at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleese made only 12 episodes of the show, six in 1975 and six in 1979. He has 
said that it was simply too much work, with he and then-wife (and co-star) 
Connie Booth taking six weeks to write each episode. That attention to craft is 
evident in the work, a tight blend of broad physical comedy and acerbic verbal 
wit. 
</P>
<P>
 All 12 episodes are available on video in a boxed set, or on individual tapes 
of three episodes each. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the action, always, stands Cleese, a supernaturally lithe 
physical comedian who also has an unrivaled way with insults. He is by turns 
fawning with guests he thinks he should impress, and mockingly superior with 
just about everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 His best asides are muttered under his breath to domineering wife Sybil, 
played wonderfully by Prunella Scales. Booth is Polly, the hired help who 
offers a bit of near normalcy amid the lunacy; Andrew Sachs is Manuel, the 
inept but endearing Spanish waiter ("We're awfully sorry. He's from Barcelona," 
is Basil's ever-ready apology for Manuel's gaffes). 
</P>
<P>
 The shows follow a similar pattern: Basil makes a mistake of some kind, and in 
trying to cover it up and save face he merely careens closer and closer to 
complete nervous breakdown. Favorite episodes vary among "Fawlty Towers" fans, 
so here are a couple of personal picks. Overall, however, the series is 
amazingly consistent. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Germans," Basil is left to run the hotel while Sybil undergoes a small 
operation. There is a hilariously sustained comedy sequence as Basil tries to 
organize a fire drill, during which an actual fire breaks out in the kitchen. 
Basil is knocked unconscious trying to fight the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Dazed from a concussion, he escapes from the hospital and sneaks back to the 
hotel, where he reduces a group of German tourists to tears with inadvertent 
references to World War II. He even does a goose-stepping Hitler imitation 
before being dragged back to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Waldorf Salad" sets up an archetypal conflict for Cleese, in which an 
obsequious Basil is cowed by a bullying American tourist. Basil promises to 
deliver a Waldorf salad, though he has no idea what it is. On the same tape is 
"The Kipper and the Corpse," in which Basil tries to conceal the body of a 
deceased guest, whom he assumes has died from eating the kippers at breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 A taste for British humor helps in appreciating "Fawlty Towers." Even armed 
with that, however, there may be a limit to how many episodes one can watch in 
a single sitting. After two shows, for me, the cringes begin to outweigh the 
laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fawlty Towers" episodes "Communications Problems," "The Anniversary" and 
"Basil the Rat"; "Gourmet Night," "Waldorf Salad" and "The Kipper and the 
Corpse"; "The Builders," "The Wedding Party" and "The Psychiatrist"; "Hotel 
Inspectors," "The Germans" and "A Touch of Class." Each episode is 30 minutes.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; SEMINAR TO HELP WRITERS DEAL WITH REBUFFS; 
NATALIE LEMBERG, WHO SPENT FOUR YEARS COMPOSING REJECTION LETTERS FOR A 
HOLLYWOOD COMPANY, WILL ADDRESS ISSUES OF GETTING PRODUCED.

 How does your screenplay stink? Let us count the ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the characters are enchanting, the plot didn't have force." 
</P>
<P>
 "While there's much to recommend your screenplay, we're overcommitted 
already." 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I liked it, I couldn't generate any enthusiasm on the part of 
others in the organization." 
</P>
<P>
 These rebuffs come from Natalie Lemberg. She spent four years with a 
production company in Hollywood writing letters that said, "Don't call us, 
we'll call you." 
</P>
<P>
 "The rejection formula was to come up with one positive and one negative," she 
said. "The writer never knows if the reader fell asleep in the middle of the 
script or if it was the right project, but the wrong company." 
</P>
<P>
 Lemberg will help aspiring screenwriters sort out these and other issues of 
getting produced in a seminar Wednesday evening in Santa Barbara. (For 
information, call 800-397-2615.) 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Hollywood's lexicon of rejection euphemisms, we offer this 
now-famous rejection letter from a Chinese economic journal. The letter was 
reprinted in the Financial Times newspaper: 
</P>
<P>
 "We have read your manuscript with boundless delight. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were to publish your paper, it would be impossible for us to publish 
any work of lower standard. And as it is unthinkable that in the next thousand 
years we shall see its equal, we are, to our regret, compelled to return your 
divine composition, and to beg you a thousand times to overlook our short sight 
and timidity."

 David Brandes, writer and producer of "The Quarrel," will be on hand to answer 
questions after a screening of his film at the Ojai Film Society's Sunday show. 
</P>

EARTHWATCH: COUNTY SEEKS TO LURE EARTH-FRIENDLY FIRMS; THERE ARE WIDE-RANGING 
EFFORTS TO ATTRACT BUSINESS THAT ARE ECOLOGICALLY SOUND.

 A friendly avalanche of information rolled in after last week's Earthwatch, 
triggered, in part, by my suggestion that civic officials invite 
environmentally friendly businesses to move into Ventura County. Apparently, 
there is a lot more going on in green recruitment and investment than many of 
us suspected. To include as many timely items as possible, I've turned today's 
column into one big Details box. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * VITALITY SUMMIT: Last Friday, one day, coincidently, after I wrote that 
raiding parties be formed so Ventura County could capture green businesses, the 
1994 Council On Economic Vitality Summit was held at the Westlake Hyatt. 
Apparently, they had the same idea I had. According to the man leading the 
effort, William McAleer, of Oxnard-based McAleer Financial: "In order to expand 
our economic base and create jobs, we have to make cleaner what we have and 
(attract) economically and environmentally acceptable firms." At the summit, 
these sentiments were echoed by speakers including County Supervisor Maggie 
Erickson Kildee, former Congressman Bob Lagomarsino and Southern California 
Edison Chairman John Bryson, who arrived with a staff that demonstrated an 
electric bus. If you have ideas for this project call County Business Ombudsman 
Ruth Schepler at 654-2229. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * ENTERPRISE CLUSTER: Meanwhile, the city of Thousand Oaks has been selected 
as one of three "regional incubators" by the California Environmental 
Protection Agency. According to Mayor Elois Zeanah, the city will be the site 
of an Environmental Business Enterprise Cluster "to promote entrepreneurial 
activity as well as reduce the risk associated with starting small businesses." 
GTE, which owns the building at 214 Lombard St. where the cluster will be 
located, is offering cut-rate office space and support services for up to a 
score of start-up ventures. Those businesses involved must be working on 
environmental products, services and technologies. For space information and 
eco-business consultations call Steve Wright, 372-6514, or Karen Livesay, 
529-4534. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * THINKING GLOBALLY: Ventura County experts and others will speak on 
international market development for products made of recycled materials, among 
other topics, at the annual meeting of the California Resource Recovery Assn. 
beginning Monday. This three-day event at the Red Lion Resort in Santa Barbara 
should provide a terrific opportunity to check out the expanding job market in 
recycling industries. You can cruise the booths at the trade-show portion of 
the event for free, but attendance at the seminars is about $200 per day. 
Volunteer staff, however, gets seminar privileges free. For more information, 
call Grahame Watts, the city of Thousand Oaks' recycling expert at 492-4876. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * TAKING STOCK: The event couldn't be more timely, because a futures market 
for recycled bulk materials such as glass scrap and shredded plastic has just 
this month been initiated by the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's leading 
commodity futures exchange. If you're tired of taking a flyer in pork bellies, 
why not look into glass cullet. Call Andrew Mayner (312) 435-7137 or your local 
stock broker. Or Hillary Clinton.

SHOP TALK; KNOWING BASICS WILL GUIDE YOU THROUGH FOREST OF FORMAL WEAR; IF YOU 
HAVE TO RENT A TUXEDO, IT HELPS TO KNOW WHAT'S TRENDY AND WHERE TO FIND 
DISCOUNTS. THIS YEAR, VESTS ARE POPULAR. 
</P>

 Tuxedo rentals. Most guys have to go through that rite of manhood at some 
point during their teen-age years. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, that first mention of tuxedo and rental often is followed by 
the word yeeecchhh . Until, of course, the fine threads are put on, and 
suddenly the wearer is overcome with a feeling of maturity far beyond his 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it's now May, and that means a whole new crop of guys will be entering 
the tuxedo rental market in preparation for various junior and senior proms. 
And we are going to lend a helping hand because the world of fancy clothes is 
scary if you've never visited it before. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing you must know is that tuxedo rental businesses are not listed under 
"Tuxedos" in the Pacific Bell and GTE yellow pages. They are listed under 
"Formal Wear Rental," which is right after "Fork Lift Rental." 
</P>
<P>
 We checked around to see what was available to rent (tuxedos, not fork lifts), 
and to get some tips from the experts. 
</P>
<P>
 First, let's relieve some of the pressure: There doesn't seem to be much of a 
price variance from operation to operation. Expect to find the regular rate of 
a basic black tuxedo package to be about $50 to $55 wherever you go. Now, 
remember, the minimum price is for basic black. Prices can range up to about 
$80 depending on how designer-chic you want to get. 
</P>
<P>
 What you'll really want to consider, however, is that many places offer prom 
discounts. And discount policies vary. 
</P>
<P>
 We checked with Whitehall Clothiers in Camarillo, Gingiss Formalwear in 
Thousand Oaks, and in Ventura, both Paramount Cleaners and Classic Cleaners, 
which are under the same ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehall gives 10% off the usual $49-$75 price for any student going to a 
prom. Gingiss rents any style tuxedo -- even those at the more expensive end -- 
for $55 to students from Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, Moorpark and Camarillo. 
Students from other areas may not get the $55 rate, but will get 20% off. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the two cleaners, where the range is $55-$80, there's a 20% discount -- 
if you ask for it or bring in one of the store's discount coupons. 
</P>
<P>
 When we talk about the cost of tuxedo rental, we're generally talking about 
the basic jacket, tie, shirt, vest, cummerbund, cuff links -- everything but 
the shoes. Shoes are extra. Whitehall has them for $10, Gingiss has them for 
$12, and at the cleaners they go for $11. But of course, shoe rental is 
optional. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kids are going with their own shoes, which I guess is a trend," said 
Monika Newman, the store manager at Gingiss. "I'm not sure if they're just 
trying to be different or if it's to conserve price." One added cost that is 
not optional is the damage waiver fee. Again, stores don't vary much in this 
area. At the cleaners and at Whitehall it's $5; at Gingiss it's $3. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that your cost fears either have been alleviated or heightened, let's take 
a quick look at what's in style. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are doing a lot now is renting the basic black tuxedo and customizing 
the look with a designer vest. Vests are very popular," said Keith White, owner 
of Whitehall. "So, instead of renting an $80 designer tuxedo, you can rent the 
opening price tuxedo for $45 and then rent a $5 vest." 
</P>
<P>
 Just so you know, the "in" design in vests involves patterns and bold colors. 
And when we say colors, we're talking red, purple, teal -- the gamut. White 
said the vest is a good way to pick up the accent in the color of your date's 
dress. And remember, guys, you do want to coordinate with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman said she has also seen an increase in the popularity of the vest, and 
the kids renting from the two cleaners in Ventura generally are going with the 
more conservative black outfit. 
</P>
<P>
 So there you have it -- pretty much set to rent that tuxedo. The tricky part 
is finding someone to go with to the prom.

FASHION; PROM PREPARATIONS PUT ENDURANCE TO THE TEST; THE SEARCH FOR THE 
PERFECT DRESS AND NECESSARY ACCESSORIES REQUIRES TRUE GRIT. AND AS ANY GIRL 
WILL TELL YOU, THE GUYS HAVE IT EASY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As high school days draw to a close, there are complex rituals to observe, 
such as planning a career, applying to colleges and shopping for the prom. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the last one seems as daunting as the others; it can take endurance 
and grit. 
</P>
<P>
 More so for girls than for guys, of course. You can talk about equality of the 
sexes until the ERA is ratified, but you won't find parity in prom groundwork. 
Not likely. 
</P>
<P>
 To confirm the premise, we tracked a couple through the rigors of grooming for 
a prom. They were veterans. It was Chris Bae's second venture, Lacey 
Lancaster's fourth. In this case, Lacey, of Ojai, invited Chris, also of Ojai 
and a first-year student at Santa Barbara City College, to her senior prom at 
Nordhoff High School. 
</P>
<P>
 They were not a trendy pair. Chris rejected the popular tux-and-Converse look; 
Lacey ignored the latest in prom wardrobe colors. She did, however, start 
shopping a month ahead. Which was just as well, because complications set in. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the dress was a problem. Lacey decided to hit one store in Thousand 
Oaks where there was a plethora of gowns under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
 She took along her mom, Kathy Lancaster, for dialectic purposes; having 
another opinion strengthens one's resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 This helped with elimination. When Kathy proposed classic black, Lacey pointed 
out that she had passed her black phase at a younger age. When her mom 
suggested a slinky, sequined number, Lacey dismissed it with, "It looks like a 
mermaid." 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Lancaster was drawn to wine velvet and tried two full-length gowns 
in the fabric, one with intricately entwined "gnarly" shoulder straps, the 
other an off-the-shoulder style with ivory lace trim. 
</P>
<P>
 The second won out. Lacey brought it to the cashier just an hour after they 
entered the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the plot thickened. Although Kathy thought that a plain neckline seemed 
best, Lacey decided on a single strand pearl choker. But choker designers seem 
set on double strands. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they have more than one strand, I feel like I'm being choked," Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
 After an hour's search, there was a compromise on a longer pearl necklace that 
would need a bar clip in back to bring it up to choker length. 
</P>
<P>
 Another day, another trip through four stores ran down the elusive pearl clip. 
But it cost $45. They passed it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Earrings are not as simple as in former times. One needs pearl-and-rhinestone 
drops for the lobes, and five rhinestone studs for additional ear apertures. 
Two stores, maybe 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Every gown seems to need its own bra. Four stores finally netted one that was 
strapless and unenhanced with foam. 
</P>
<P>
 Pumps were bought and delivered to the dyers for matching with the dress. The 
gown was shortened -- since the shoes would be taken off as soon as Lacey 
arrived at the dance ("I'm not a heel kind of person") the dress would then 
sweep the floor. A fitting, then back to the shop for a final fitting and to 
pick up the gown. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoeless dancing tends to put runs in nylons, which can be seen through the 
back slit in a gown. Three pair of pantyhose were bought to get Lacey through 
the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 About this time, after a bit of ambivalence ("I'd better go with him; no, I 
trust him. . . ."), a trip was made to the tux shop with Chris to ensure that 
his vest would match the gown. 
</P>
<P>
 As the day neared, an hour was spent getting French-cut, airbrushed fingernail 
extensions -- for Lacey, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 ("You don't want them too long, like Dragon Lady nails.") 
</P>
<P>
 On prom day, the boutonniere was picked up; and the hair issue was debated: 
for one's usual cascade of waist-length hair, a French twist or curls? By 
afternoon, the decision for curls had been made; another hour-plus went into 
the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 With commuting, there were about 19 woman-hours involved in the venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Chris had invested an hour and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 After advance checking with Lacey, he ordered a white rose corsage in a few 
minutes. "The guy made it really painless," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He got a 20-minute haircut and spent a quarter of an hour washing his dad's 
Porsche, their transportation for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in one-stop shopping, he rented everything at the tux shop, including 
shirt and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the fit wasn't quite perfect: The jacket was a tad roomy; the 
embroidered burgundy vest needed a few safety pins to take it up in back. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no big thing. Even Lacey had a safety pin in her ensemble -- to shorten 
the necklace. 
</P>
<P>
 They complimented each other on their appearances and were off on what Lacey 
has described as "the finale" -- the last high school dance -- moving 
cautiously down the path toward the car in unfamiliar footwear.

FOR THE KIDS; SIMI VALLEY ANGLERS GET A LINE ON PRIZES; NEARLY 1,000 YOUTHS ARE 
EXPECTED TO COMPETE AT SATURDAY'S HUCK FINN FISHING DERBY AT THE RANCHO SIMI 
PARK POND. 
</P>

<P>
 It was the one that almost got away. The 19th annual Huck Finn Fishing Derby, 
that is. 
</P>
<P>
 It was looking grim earlier this spring for the popular contest that draws 
hundreds of kids to the banks of a Simi Valley lagoon every May. The Rancho 
Simi Recreation and Park District didn't have the money for the fish-off. 
</P>
<P>
 But enough donations poured in at the last minute that the derby is on for 
Saturday. And it's free, as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which draws 800 to 1,000 boys and girls, is for anglers 14 years 
old and under. The fishing begins at 7 a.m. and runs until 10 a.m. at Rancho 
Simi Community Park's pond near Royal Avenue and Erringer Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to see who can catch the three-fish limit first, but prizes also 
go to the anglers who reel in the biggest and smallest fish. 
</P>
<P>
 These are catfish we're talking about, and Huck Finn never had it this good. 
The district buys nearly 2,000 pounds of catfish -- one to three pounds each -- 
and dumps them into the lagoon just before the derby. Exactly when remains a 
guarded secret. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules are few: no triple hooks, only singles. No spinners or lures. Worms, 
salmon eggs, cheese or bacon are OK for bait. Casting is discouraged because of 
the number of kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The children compete in four age categories; prizes include Zebco rods and 
reels. 
</P>
<P>
 For many kids at the contest, dropping a line in the 2.5-acre lagoon is their 
first fishing experience, according to Doug Gale, recreation supervisor for the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope everyone will catch a fish," he said. In fact, some snare quite a few 
and then throw them back. Last year's prize-winning catfish were in the 
two-pound, five-ounce range. 
</P>
<P>
 Derby contestants don't drain the little pond of catfish. "We've got some 
pretty big ones at the bottom from last year," district spokesman Rick Johnson 
said. (The pond, which is open only to kids and senior citizens for fishing 
during the year, also yields some fair-sized bass.) 
</P>
<P>
 For the derby, kids must bring their own gear, and some have pretty 
sophisticated stuff. But others come with homemade versions, like the bamboo 
pole one boy made in Cub Scouts a few years back. He had also dug his own 
worms. Bait preferences vary. Cheese is popular, even stinky cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't the first year that the derby has run into financial snags. Last 
year, the event nearly got the ax because state budget cuts cost the park 
district nearly $1 million. Private contributions saved the derby then. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, it was more of the same. For a while, there was talk of maybe 
charging kids $1 to participate in the derby to help raise funds. But by the 
end of last month, Simi Valley businesses and groups had donated $3,375 to pay 
for the catfish stocking. (The donors were Simi Sunrise Rotary, Datron Systems 
Inc., First Interstate Bank, Kiwanis Club of Simi Valley, Daily News, Simi 
Valley Women's Club and Tomahawk Termite Control.) 
</P>
<P>
 So the lines will drop in the lagoon early Saturday as anxious parents stand 
by to untangle them, offer encouragement and bait hooks for the squeamish. 
</P>
<P>

 Charlotte, the world's most famous spider, is spinning that old yarn again.

JAUNTS; PETER STRAUSS RANCH GOING BACK IN TIME WITH BEATLES MUSIC; FREE CONCERT 
IS BILLED AS A MOTHER'S DAY SPECIAL. VISITORS CAN LEARN ABOUT THE SITE'S 
COLORFUL HISTORY WITH A DOCENT-LED TOUR.

<P>
 The lake is gone, and the vast swimming pool that once held 3,000 swimmers is 
anempty pit, but the Peter Strauss Ranch -- called Lake Enchanto in its heyday 
-- will be rocking Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Park Service, now owner of the ranch, is offering a free concert 
of Beatles music -- billed as a Mother's Day special -- on the grounds. The 
two-hour Beatles nostalgia trip will be performed by John Wood's group, J. P. 
Nightingale. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you dig the Beatles or not, the ranch -- nestled in the Santa Monica 
Mountains near Agoura -- is a nice Mother's Day getaway for mom and others. The 
best way to see it and learn more about its colorful history is to take a 
docent-led tour Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour tour includes a one-mile hike over a well-groomed trail along the 
hillside overlooking the ranch. Canopied by sprawling oak trees, the trail is a 
good one for novice or young hikers. Keep an eye out for peacocks skittering 
through the brush. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour takes you back to 1923 when auto designer Harry Miller, famous for 
patenting the carburetor, built the white-trimmed stone ranch house along 
Triunfo Creek. It was a weekend retreat for Miller and his wife, who also built 
an aviary and collected wild animals like bear, mountain lion, deer, and even 
parrots and monkeys. 
</P>
<P>
 The Depression wiped out Miller, according to the National Park Service, and, 
in the early 1930s, the ranch was purchased by Warren Shobert and Arthur 
Edeson, two Malibu Lake residents. They opened the secluded ranch to the public 
and marketed it as a "fairyland of charm and paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Hinman, a wealthy real estate speculator and lawyer, bought it in the 
late 1930s and marketed it as Lake Enchanto -- so named for the small lake he 
created by constructing a dam on Triunfo Creek. By the 1950s, the place was 
buzzing with amusement rides, children's summer camps, parties, picnics under 
eucalyptus trees, fishing, swimming, boating, dancing, concerts in a 
stone-terraced amphitheater and overnight cabanas. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes as many as 5,000 Southlanders would flock to the ranch, drawn by the 
giant swimming pool, which was touted as the largest west of the Rockies. 
Visitors listened to big band music and danced on a classy patio laid with 
imported Italian terrazzo tile. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hinman left the area for several years, his Lake Enchanto languished and 
his later plans to rebuild it into a new park with miniaturized world sites 
fizzled. By then, the lake was gone -- washed away by flooding on the creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Then along came actor Peter Strauss, who saw the ranch when he was filming the 
television miniseries "Rich Man, Poor Man" near Malibu Lake in 1976. (Strauss 
was the "good" brother, Rudy Jordache, in the series.) 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its run-down condition, Strauss bought the place as a home in 1977 for 
$200,000. He fixed it up, rebuilding the house and improving the grounds. It 
was his idea to plant the big cactus garden you see in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "He collected the cactus for the garden, and he comes back sometimes to check 
on it," said docent Daphne Elliott, who will lead the Sunday tour. (Strauss, 
who now lives in Ojai, starred last week in the television remake of the movie 
"The Yearling," based on Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' novel.) 
</P>
<P>
 Busy with his career, Strauss sold the ranch to the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy in 1983, and the National Park Service picked it up in 1987, adding 
it to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 It's now an idyllic retreat, a far cry from the hustle and bustle of an 
earlier time. But on her tours, Elliott continually comes across people who 
visited the ranch during its heyday. "Some of them say they learned to swim 
there," she said. Details

RESTAURANT REVIEW; ISLAND DELIGHTS AT NAMESAKE EATERY; CAJUN, CREOLE AND 
CARIBBEAN CUISINE SHARE MENU AT CALYPSO'S NEW NEIGHBOR ON STATE STREET.

 Calypso, the lush bar on Santa Barbara's State Street, "presents" the recently 
opened restaurant, Island Delights, according to the menu. Actually, they 
cohabit quite amiably next to each other, with the bar providing drinks for the 
restaurant and the restaurant whipping up appetizers for the drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant fits into what was once a passageway between two buildings, now 
outfitted with a canvas roof and plenty of lush green foliage. From the street, 
it resembles a jungle garden; inside, the decor might best be described as funk 
and fronds. It definitely feels outdoorsy, but with the heaters blasting, it's 
cozy enough, and the friendly service more than makes up for a dearth of posh. 
</P>
<P>
 The best reasons to go to Island Delights, which offers a mixture of Cajun, 
Creole and Caribbean food, are the island-inspired dishes. Chef Harold Welsh is 
a native of Barbados in the West Indies, and his Bajan cooking can be sampled 
in dishes like West Indian curries, fish cakes, fried plantains and coconut 
bread. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, this is the only place I know in Santa Barbara where you can 
get Jamaican-style jerk chicken and pork. I'm worried that it won't attract the 
clientele it deserves. The spicy jerk seasoning is terrific. It's a different 
kind of hot, not so much in the mouth as down the throat and through the body. 
It makes the heaters superfluous. The chicken was better than the pork, which 
had been roasted and sliced. In fact, I craved a plate of chicken wings for 
days afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Caribbean appetizer, Jamaican patti ($3) resembled a turnover made 
with dough as flaky as a croissant, filled with ground meat or vegetables. Fish 
cakes ($4.50) were even more tasty. Made from salted cod, a staple on the 
islands since the days of Columbus, the cakes were thin, firm, spicy and 
delicious, served with a fresh mango sauce redolent of cloves. 
</P>
<P>
 A Creole gumbo ($8.50), and a Cajun blackened catfish, were decent enough 
renditions of these specialties. The catfish came with hush puppies -- fat 
little fried balls of cornmeal and spices. 
</P>
<P>
 I've had crisper versions of soft-shelled crab, but the one I ate here still 
deserves to be called succulent. It came with a bland Hollandaise-type sauce 
that certainly let the crab keep center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 A marvelous lamb curry ($13.95) tasted as if they'd cooked it with the 
chutney, making it fruity and sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the entrees come with rice and peas -- actually small red beans -- and 
both fried yams and plantains. Plantains are another great island staple, a 
member of the banana family but more starchy than sweet. You can order fried 
plantains here as an appetizer ($3) with a savory yogurt sauce for dipping. 
</P>
<P>
 If you like your food sweet, the coconut shrimp ($13.95) is a knockout, fat 
and crunchy, with filaments of coconut embedded in the crust. On the other 
hand, if you prefer to get your sweet kicks with dessert, you won't be 
disappointed. The coconut bread resembles a coconut-infused pound cake, sliced 
very thin and served warm. Key lime pie ($3.50) was so infused with lime I 
could taste it in my toes. The best dessert was the bourbon pie with its chewy, 
rich mixture of caramel, molasses and pecans. 
</P>
<P>
 This would be a good destination for dessert and dancing. At 9:30 every night 
the live bands begin to play. They range from funk to R&B, jazz and reggae. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day we went back for lunch. It was particularly pleasant to sit in 
the front patio under the dappled light of a lovely ficus tree, with the 
sad-happy strains of a reggae lament in the background. They had fresh crawdads 
-- or crayfish -- as the special that day. I had a bowl of these bright red, 
Lilliputian lobsters, clustered around a tiny trough of horseradish-tomato 
dipping sauce. They made quite an adventure in peel-and-eat, messy and 
delicious. Warm, crumbly corn bread and a fresh salad of greens and avocado 
slices conspired to make a perfect meal. Details

2 FIREFIGHTERS IDENTIFIED AS MALIBU BLAZE SUSPECTS; ARSON: BOTH HAVE DENIED 
WRONGDOING, AND THE FATHER OF ONE OF THEM CALLS THE CASE 'KAFKAESQUE.' 
PROSECUTORS REMAIN UNSURE ABOUT PRESSING CRIMINAL CHARGES.

<P>
 Two Los Angeles-area firefighters have been identified by law enforcement 
authorities as the principal suspects in last year's devastating Malibu arson 
fire, but prosecutors have yet to decide whether to bring criminal charges 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the suspects, Steven R. Shelp, 29, is a Los Angeles City firefighter 
who recently graduated from the Fire Department academy. The other, Nicholas A. 
Durepo, 24, was hired as a volunteer firefighter in Manhattan Beach last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men have denied any wrongdoing in the blaze, which left three people 
dead, caused more than $375 million in damage and took thousands of 
firefighters more than four days to bring under control. Neither Durepo nor 
Shelp could be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses had spotted Shelp and Durepo in a blue pickup truck only yards away 
from the first flames of the Nov. 2 fire, which erupted in the hills along Old 
Topanga Canyon Road. From the start, the two men have contended that they were 
simply driving by when they saw the blaze and jumped from the truck to put it 
out with a garden hose. 
</P>
<P>
 But investigators for the Sheriff's Department believe they have a strong 
circumstantial case against the two men. Although they presented their case to 
the Los Angeles County district attorney's office months ago, prosecutors are 
continuing to investigate. A grand jury has been collecting evidence in the 
case. Shelp and Durepo are scheduled to appear later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an innocent young man and lives are absolutely being torn up over 
this," said Steve Shelp's father, Jack Shelp. "This kid hasn't had a traffic 
ticket in eight years, and he doesn't deserve anything like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Said one friend of Durepo: "He's a nice all-American guy. He wanted nothing 
more than to be a firefighter." 
</P>
<P>
 But authorities say that, among other things, Shelp and Durepo made 
inconsistent statements about their behavior during the period in question. At 
one point, Shelp allegedly was overheard telling Durepo: "Don't sweat this, I 
won't give you up." Both men also failed polygraph tests, which are considered 
unreliable gauges of truthfulness and usually are inadmissible in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are operating under the belief that Durepo and Shelp started the 
fire so they could put it out and be hailed as heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those situations where everything is so damn suspicious, and they 
have the motive," said one source. "Their story just does not add up. What kind 
of coincidence is it that you are trying to be firefighters and just happen to 
see a fire and happen to have a hose to put it out with?" 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the Malibu fire -- one of several that raged out of control 
throughout Southern California last fall -- Shelp had just been certified as 
eligible for hiring by the Los Angeles City Fire Department and was awaiting 
assignment to its academy. After graduating from a 15-week class that began on 
Jan. 3, he was made a firefighter -- despite the fact that department officials 
had been warned he was a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Fire Chief Donald O. Manning, who was told by sheriff's detectives 
in early January that Shelp was being investigated, was instructed not to say 
anything for fear of jeopardizing the investigation, said Battalion Chief Roger 
Gillis, a department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was informed at that time that one of his firefighters was under 
investigation regarding the Malibu fire," Gillis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillis said investigators told Manning that they were going to take the case 
to a grand jury, which led the chief to believe that an arrest was imminent. 
But when nothing happened, Manning assumed that the case had been dropped and 
he did not inquire further. 
</P>
<P>
 "His gut feeling was that they didn't have enough information and that it was 
a done deal," Gillis said, explaining why the chief did not conduct his own 
internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillis said Shelp will be transferred today from active firefighting to 
administrative duties while the case proceeds. That move was prompted by 
inquiries Wednesday from The Times and NBC News about the case, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, he will be under extreme stress when this becomes public 
knowledge," Gillis said. "He's being taken off now because he's carrying a hell 
of a burden on him, and his fellow firefighters might ostracize him." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaken by news of the investigation, Fire Department leaders scrambled late 
Wednesday to contain the fallout. Top officials in the department notified City 
Hall leaders to inform them of the status of the probe and to assure them that 
they would investigate internally as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department officials declined to comment on the case in detail, 
confirming only that they have completed their work and have presented it to 
the district attorney for possible prosecution. A spokesman issued a statement 
briefly explaining the status of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "In December, 1993, Sheriff's Department arson and homicide investigators 
concluded their investigation into the devastating Topanga fire incident," said 
Deputy Fidel Gonzales. "The completed investigative report was referred to the 
Los Angeles County district attorney's office on Dec. 6, 1993, and included the 
identification of two adult male suspects believed to be responsible for the 
fire. The district attorney requested additional investigative work on the case 
by this department. That work was done by our detectives and the case was 
resubmitted on Jan 7, 1994. It is our understanding that at this time, the 
district attorney is continuing with their evaluation of this very complicated 
case and is carefully reviewing each of the facts presented." 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti was unavailable for comment, but Sandi Gibbons, a 
spokeswoman for his office, said investigators were continuing the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation is ongoing," Gibbons said. "It is very active, but that is 
all we can say. Work is being done, people are being questioned." 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the fire, when authorities said they were seeking two men in 
a blue pickup who had been seen near the fire's origins, one of them called The 
Times to deny that they had done anything wrong and to provide their version of 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 The caller said he happened on the fire while driving by on his way to visit 
friends in the San Fernando Valley. He maintained that the two of them tried to 
put it out, assisting firefighters as the fire jumped Old Topanga Canyon Road 
and raced toward Malibu and the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Although witnesses said they saw two men fleeing the scene in the pickup, 
Shelp and Durepo maintained during interviews with investigators that they were 
moving the truck farther down the road out of the fire's path. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days after the fire was extinguished, homicide investigators announced 
that they had interviewed the two men in the pickup truck and did not consider 
them suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, authorities continued to question Shelp and Durepo as the investigation 
went forward. People close to the two men say they have been cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has worked with the Sheriff's Department from Day 1," said Shelp's father, 
a Northridge resident. "We're absolutely sick about this. If two innocent guys 
can get into this Kafkaesque thing where the only thing against them is that 
they are firefighters, then this is just ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 In Venice, Shelp's friends say he insists the fire was started by a downed 
power line near the point of origin -- a suspicion shared by at least one 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Selman, who lives near the fire's flashpoint, said the power failed 
seconds before he first saw flames. He believes the blaze may have been caused 
by a live wire touching a tree or tinder-dry brush. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do they have any evidence against these guys, or is it all circumstantial?" 
Selman asked. "The fire started right after the power went out, which is an 
amazing coincidence. And a power wire right above where the fire started is 
still hanging there." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials, however, concluded shortly after the fire was 
extinguished that it could not have been caused by anything other than arson. 
</P>
<P>
 In Manhattan Beach, some officials were stunned by reports that one of their 
volunteers was under investigation. Durepo was hired as a part-time volunteer 
at the Manhattan Beach Fire Department in November, 1993, said Capt. Steven 
Dixon. Durepo normally works three shifts a month and was last on duty Monday, 
Dixon added. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Dixon, Durepo has never missed a shift and has not had any 
problems at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hasn't missed his required assignments," Dixon said. "And I've had no 
negative comment from any of the captains he works for." 
</P>
<P>
 Manhattan Fire Chief Dennis Groat said he first learned of the investigation 
Monday afternoon when reporters started asking questions. Groat said he 
confronted Durepo with the allegations. Durepo, according to Groat, confirmed 
that he and his girlfriend had received grand jury subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of both men expressed disbelief that either could be implicated in the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is anybody on the face of the planet who is most trustworthy, it is 
this guy," said Guy Okazaki, who has known Shelp for more than 20 years. "That 
is what is so incredible about it -- he is the nicest guy. . . . There's a lot 
of kids who look up to him. He is a role model. This is really a shame." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and family remain convinced that once the investigation is concluded, 
both men will be cleared. In the meantime, some blame overzealous investigators 
for targeting the wrong suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "These sheriff's guys are the biggest bunch of clowns in the world," said Jack 
Shelp. "I've got nothing but contempt for them."

GAZA, JERICHO BECOME CENTERS OF NEW PALESTINIAN HOMELAND; MIDEAST: LAST-MINUTE 
DISPUTE OVER MAPS BRIEFLY DELAYS SIGNING BY ISRAEL AND PLO OF HISTORIC PACT ON 
SELF-RULE. RABIN VOICES MISGIVINGS ABOUT ARABS' READINESS TO GOVERN AREAS. 
</P>

<P>
 The palm-shaded town of Jericho and the broiling slums of the Gaza Strip 
became the centers of a new Palestinian homeland Wednesday as Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, bickering to the last moment, signed an 
unprecedented pact on Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin expressed fears that the PLO is not ready 
to assume the government of its turbulent people over the next three weeks. But 
he still signed with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat the final autonomy accord, 
which for the first time in the modern era puts Palestinians in control of 
territories in the historic land of Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 As hundreds of Palestinian prisoners were released from Israeli jails and the 
first Palestinian police crossed the border from Egypt into Gaza, Israel and 
the PLO ended almost seven months of often painful negotiations with a 
last-minute dispute over maps. 
</P>
<P>
 That disagreement left Rabin and Arafat fuming in frustration on stage as the 
signing drama unfolded in front of an audience of 2,500 dignitaries and of 
television viewers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to create peaceful coexistence between two entities where there 
is no love lost between them, and I put it mildly," Rabin explained of the 
dispute that came as one of the world's most enduring conflicts was about to 
move a major step closer to resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 But both Rabin and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres were adamant that 
Israel is determined to make peace work. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres, as he stepped to the podium, looked over at the PLO chairman, clad in 
khaki military dress, and grinned, "Chairman Arafat, our partner in a very 
difficult journey: We did it! 
</P>
<P>
 "For almost half a century, we experienced blood and hatred, terror and war," 
Peres said. "Today, we declare that the conflict is over. We don't want to be 
the generals, the judges or the police of the Palestinian people. . . . Today, 
we welcome you, the Palestinian people, as neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, whose irritation over the map reflected months of frustration at 
trying to turn the Declaration of Principles signed last September into a 
meaningful statement of Palestinian independence, stood subdued for much of the 
ceremony. He kept his hands clasped behind his back, stared straight ahead and 
tapped his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this step needs great courage to complete it after long decades of war and 
violence, then the coming steps will need even greater courage and deep 
vision," Arafat said. "Our peoples have struggled for a very, very long time to 
witness this day. . . . We must all realize that all those who are lovers of 
peace must consider the seriousness of this step to see that it is carefully 
executed and implemented." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's signing touches off a rapid series of events in the occupied 
territories, as Israel prepares to make its first troop withdrawal from 
Palestinian lands it has occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 6,000 new Palestinian police are to arrive in Gaza and Jericho over 
the next week to two weeks, and the hundreds of prisoners released from Israeli 
jails Wednesday are the first of 5,000 scheduled to be freed during the next 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO will appoint a 24-member Palestinian Authority to take over within the 
next three weeks, to be replaced later in the year by an elected council that 
eventually will govern all over the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks on the final status of the territories, including the issue of 
Palestinian statehood and the future of Jerusalem, will not begin for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's remarks Wednesday reflected PLO concerns that the new autonomy in 
Gaza and Jericho, a dramatic gamble that risks alienating millions of 
Palestinians, must represent a meaningful enough step to relieve years of 
pent-up frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO chairman seethed over Israel's reluctance to grant a significant block 
of territory for Palestinian control in Jericho. In the end, the Israelis 
conceded 25 square miles -- half what Arafat had pleaded for at the last 
minute, though the issue remains subject to further discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis also declined to grant symbolic concessions, such as Palestinian 
police on the international borders and the designation of Arafat as rais, an 
Arabic word that could be defined as president. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO sees all these stands as shortsighted and counterproductive to its 
attempts to lure support amid what has been an ambivalent or even hostile 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Rabin expressed fears that the two sides spent so much time 
negotiating the agreement that not enough attention was paid on the Palestinian 
side to preparing for a transition from Israeli military rule to Palestinian 
autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks were a clear indication that Israel does not expect the transition 
in the next few weeks to go smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, Rabin said Israel on Wednesday paid salaries to 24,000 
employees in Gaza, about 6,000 of them permanent employees of the civil 
administration. "Tomorrow we will leave. Who will pay these 24,000 people? We 
can leave in two weeks, but (who will) . . . handle all these problems?" Rabin 
asked at a news conference after the signing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin also raised fears that most of the 9,000-member police force and 
additional civilian cadres returning to administer Gaza and Jericho have not 
been in the West Bank and Gaza for some time, in many cases since Israel's 
occupation of the region in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 "How long will it take them to acquaint themselves with the situation there?" 
he fretted. "There are practical problems that, unfortunately, focus was not 
given enough for proper preparation in the handing over . . . (and) we have now 
unfortunately to waste time." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Arafat, apparently heeding the same concerns, hinted early Tuesday 
that he might favor drawing out the coming transition period. While Rabin said 
Israeli forces can be out in two to three weeks, or even days, Arafat seemed to 
be suggesting a four-week withdrawal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Israel, where Jewish settlers seized the synagogue at Jericho and dozens 
more gathered for prayers and psalm readings, the opposition to the Rabin-Peres 
peace overtures in Cairo was already building. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a black day for the state of Israel, and one of the most difficult 
days in the history of Zionism," said Likud opposition leader Benjamin 
Netanyahu. "Rabin will be able to say, 'In Cairo, I established the Palestinian 
state, the Palestinian terrorist state.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Zvi Hendel, a Jewish settler in Neve Dekelim, told Army Radio: "We are 
continuing to build, to live, to take in new residents, and with the help of 
God are waiting for better days when there will be a new government." 
</P>
<P>
 Syria -- which, like Lebanon, did not send a foreign minister to Wednesday's 
glittering signing ceremony -- vowed that it will never sign a separate peace 
with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Such separate and partial solutions would put obstacles in the way of the 
achievement of a just and comprehensive peace that should be based on U.N. 
resolutions and the principle of land for peace," the official Syrian daily Al 
Thawra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Radical Palestinian factions in Lebanese refugee camps, who have little to 
gain from autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, demonstrated against the agreement, 
burning tires, calling for strikes and hailing posters that said "To Hell With 
the Shameful Cairo Agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's signing ceremony -- held in the presence of such dignitaries as 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. 
Kozyrev, Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and their counterparts from 
nations around the globe -- was hosted by Egypt on the occasion of Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak's 66th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Conducted at a conference center only a few hundred yards from the reviewing 
stand where Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was assassinated after he made his 
daring, single-handed peace with Israel, the PLO-Israeli ceremony to a great 
degree culminated Egypt's attempts to square its peacemaking with its Arab 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Isolated and rejected by Arabs for years because of the 1979 Camp David 
accords, Egyptian diplomats have worked feverishly to help broker the PLO 
accord. Mubarak beamed as he declared, "A historical move toward peace in the 
land of peace has started." 
</P>
<P>
 The signing took place against a stage backdrop of the Sphinx, a pyramid and 
twinkling stars; Christopher, Kozyrev and Mubarak all signed as witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in an age of political wonder, where old hatreds are giving way to 
new hopes," Christopher declared. "With leadership, vision and courage, peace 
between old enemies is possible. . . . We're here today because unspeakable 
acts of violence could not still the voices of peace, or weaken the resolve of 
the peacemakers." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the audience of international political leaders, intellectuals and 
artists were delegations from Jewish American and Arab American groups and 
other political organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It borders on the unbelievable. You have to pinch yourself that these 
dramatic events are happening. It's an incredible tribute to the tenacity of 
the parties to commit to make peace despite the obstacles in the way of Rabin 
and Arafat," said former Westside congressman Mel Levine, co-chair of Builders 
for Peace, a group of American Jews and Arabs working to promote deals that 
will facilitate a better life in the territories with the onset of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Sheinbaum, former president of the Los Angeles Police Commission and 
one of five American Jews who broke the ice on the peace process in 1988 by 
visiting Arafat, observed of Wednesday's accord: "It means that the idea of 
peace is increasingly acceptable and realistic and that major change among the 
mainstream political groups is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all groups have come around," he added. "But this helps show that having 
direct contact is the best way to go to find peace."

Jericho, in the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip -- are about to experience their 
first freedom after 27 years of occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY POINTS IN THE PACT 
</P>
<P>
 * What the Palestinians get: Responsibility for a broad range of their own 
affairs, ranging from health services and police to zoning, tourism, air 
service, fishing and finances. 
</P>
<P>
 * What Israel gets: Overall security responsibility in the occupied 
territories and control of international borders. 
</P>
<P>
 * A new government: A new appointed Palestinian Authority headed by PLO 
Chairman Yasser Arafat will become the effective government in Gaza and 
Jericho, with its authority expanded throughout the West Bank later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Palestinian police: The autonomous territories will be policed by 9,000 
Palestinian police officers, rather than Israeli troops. About 7,000 will be 
drawn from PLO troops throughout the Middle East and the rest from the West 
Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 * Troop withdrawal: Israeli troops will immediately begin withdrawing from 
Gaza and Jericho, with withdrawal to be completed within three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Israeli military options: Israeli retains the right to move troops into Gaza 
and Jericho in the event of an outbreak of general hostilities or threats to 
the safety of Israeli settlements. Israeli troops will remain around Jewish 
settlements in Gaza as well as at military installation area nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jewish settlements: Jewish settlements will remain in place, though they may 
be consolidated to provide better security. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT PALESTINIANS FAILED TO GET 
</P>
<P>
 * More room: Jericho will remain only a little larger than the existing city 
limits, much smaller than the 93-square-mile enclave the PLO had envisioned. 
But the boundaries are subject to further discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Own currency: There will be no Palestinian currency, though talks on that 
issue are continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Economic independence: The Palestinian economy will remain to a very large 
degree dependent on Israel. Palestinians will regulate banks and set taxes on 
imports and income, but Israel retains customs quotas on a broad range of goods 
to protect against a flood of cheap Palestinian goods, including gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 TIMETABLE 
</P>
<P>
 1) Israeli troops are to begin an immediate withdrawal from Jericho and the 
Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 2) The first Palestinian police officers begin arriving, with 6,000 to be 
deployed in the first two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 3) The new governing Palestinian Authority will be appointed and take power in 
Gaza and Jericho within three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Elections to appoint a governing council throughout the West Bank are 
tentatively scheduled for Oct. 10.

COLUMN ONE; SUBIC BAY: A RELIC IS REBORN; OLD U.S. NAVY BASE IS NOW A HUB OF 
ENTERPRISE AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT. 'PEOPLE POWER' HAS HELPED CONVERT BARRACKS 
TO A CASINO, LURED FIRMS SUCH AS REEBOK AND SAVED THE FACILITY FROM LOOTERS, 
VOLCANIC ASH.

<P>
 The big warships don't dock here anymore. The F-18 Hornet fighters no longer 
roar overhead. The bar girls have migrated away, and about 40,000 civilian jobs 
are gone, lost to a fit of Philippine national pride that kicked the U.S. Navy 
out of here two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, in the eerie ghost town atmosphere of what used to be the Navy's 
largest overseas base, something rather remarkable is happening: free 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses, one of them making Reebok shoes, are starting to blossom inside 
the gray military buildings that line the gloomy wharves. Federal Express is 
planning to use the Navy airstrip. Tourists are lounging in a casino hotel 
converted from a barracks and playing golf on fairways salvaged from the ash 
fallout of Mt. Pinatubo. 
</P>
<P>
 Subic Bay, not long ago a Cold War relic symbolizing America's decline in the 
Pacific, is being transformed into a plucky little free-port zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by a spurt of foreign investment and an army of "people power" 
volunteers, Subic is an experiment in economic development that embodies the 
new optimism rising in the Philippines, the so-called Sick Man of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Decades of economic malaise -- compounded by legendary corruption, political 
turmoil and a chain of natural disasters -- left the Philippines lagging far 
behind its successful neighbors. But people say things are different now, at 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 Venal dictator Ferdinand Marcos is dead. And the days of periodic coup 
attempts against housewife-turned-President Corazon Aquino have been replaced 
by humdrum stability since President Fidel V. Ramos -- the general who rebelled 
against Marcos and quashed the insurrections against Aquino -- took office in 
June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos has earned mixed reviews on the economic front. He has proceeded timidly 
with plans to liberalize the economy and bungled an attempt at hiking an oil 
tax to fix a worrisome fiscal deficit. He dragged his feet, then hastily 
assumed emergency powers to resolve an energy crisis that caused daily 
blackouts in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 But political peace under Ramos seems to have allowed some modest economic 
growth, after years of volatility and stagnation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philippine economy grew 2.3% last year, and this year analysts predict 
gross national product will rise in real terms by more than 4%. That 
performance pales in comparison to the double-digit pace enjoyed by some East 
Asian export dynamos. But it's not a bad start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the numbers are starting to be good for us," Ramos said in an 
interview at Malacanang, the presidential palace in Manila. "The conditions for 
takeoff are in place." 
</P>
<P>
 If the economy does take flight, the Subic Bay Freeport Zone is the kind of 
launch pad that will provide some of the thrust. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one of 18 designated areas -- including Clark Field, the former U.S. air 
base -- where the government is trying to woo international investment with tax 
incentives and aggressive publicity. The strategy is to mimic the pattern of 
rapid industrialization that made "tigers" and "dragons" out of the 
Philippines' neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, if the marriage of cheap labor and foreign capital works for the 
Indonesians, why not for English-speaking Filipinos? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best-kept secret in Asia," said Thomas Leber, president of the 
American Chamber of Commerce in Manila. He maintains there isn't a scent of 
genuine anti-Americanism in the Philippines today, despite the base expulsion 
debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a more logical place for American companies to use as their 
springboard into Southeast Asian markets," said Leber, who represents New 
York-based American Home Products Corp. in the Philippines. "We certainly 
wouldn't want to see Japanese or Taiwanese investors supplant the Americans 
here. That would be a travesty." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-Philippine relationship has been complex and emotionally intense over 
the past century, beginning with the Spanish-American War, which left the 
islands a U.S. colony for nearly 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 No one personifies that legacy better than Richard J. Gordon, the cheerful 
chairman of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority, the government agency that 
runs the free-port zone. 
</P>
<P>
 During Gordon's reign as mayor of Olongapo, a city that thrived outside 
Subic's gates, he was an early proponent of gradual U.S. withdrawal and 
conversion of the base into a special economic zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Gordon now sits in the executive office once occupied by Rear 
Adm. Thomas A. Mercer -- the last U.S. commander at Subic -- is one of those 
ironic twists of history. His grandfather, John J. Gordon, waded ashore at 
Subic Bay with the New York regiment in 1898, the story goes, and later 
mustered out of the U.S. Army to marry a Filipina and settle nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon's father served as the first elected mayor of Olongapo until he was 
assassinated. Gordon's mother was elected to succeed him. Richard, a practicing 
lawyer, later took up the civic mantle. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by nationalistic sentiment, the Philippine Senate voted in 1991 to oust 
the U.S. military. Gordon pounced on the opportunity to exploit the billions of 
dollars in inherited military infrastructure, using all the hoopla and 
machinery of a political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 By the autumn of 1992, Gordon had organized laid-off base workers into a 
skilled force of volunteers. They stepped in to maintain security in the 
confusion of the American withdrawal that October and November, which itself 
came in the wake of the catastrophic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. 
</P>
<P>
 While the facilities at Clark air base were heavily damaged by volcanic ash 
and then trashed by looters, Subic emerged virtually unscathed. Volunteers 
hauled away tons of ash blanketing the golf course, kept the lawns trimmed and 
protected 1,876 units of family housing from scavengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon also has used his political charisma to recruit a corps of youthful 
camp followers, many of them children of wealthy families with fresh degrees 
from U.S. universities. They work without pay for months until Gordon, who does 
not disclaim future presidential ambitions, offers them meager civil service 
wages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's my duty to do something for the country," said Felicia Ravago, 
27, a Harvard Law School graduate who quit a corporate job in New York to join 
Gordon's assistants. "This is really exciting work with a lot of 
responsibility. If it weren't for Chairman Gordon, I think my talents would be 
wasted." 
</P>
<P>
 Blue-collar volunteers, meanwhile, are registered by computer, and when jobs 
open up in the free port, they're at the top of the hiring list. So far, Gordon 
said, 9,000 have gone back to work. 
</P>
<P>
 During the transition, Subic retains a sense of order that is at odds with the 
conventions of chaotic Philippine society. 
</P>
<P>
 The free port was swarmed by about 100,000 tourists over the Easter weekend, 
many driving two to three hours from Manila to swim, gamble and shop their 
quota at PX outlets converted into duty-free stores. Gordon's volunteers issued 
540 traffic tickets, shocking motorists who never would have imagined getting 
ticketed in the anarchy of Manila's streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Subic sparks a fire here, we'll be a model that changes the nation's 
attitudes about discipline and work ethic," Gordon said. "This will give the 
Filipino confidence. Subic will grow and become the magnet for the Philippines. 
You watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Subic Bay Freeport also might serve as a comparative case study for base 
conversion in the United States, where communities face layoffs of civilian 
employees and the loss of spinoff benefits to their economies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the business incubator at Subic wouldn't be warming up without foreign 
investment and low wages -- a formula that doesn't apply to the area around El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station or other U.S. sites affected by the closure list. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taiwan government has been a conspicuously enthusiastic patron at Subic, 
putting up $100 million in loans for Taiwanese companies planning to invest 
here. Already, as many as 1,000 of the new jobs have been created by a single 
Taiwanese-owned factory, Subic Star, which makes soccer shoes under contract 
for Reebok International of Stoughton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty impressed with the level of workmanship here. It's exceptional," 
said Steve Brown, a Reebok executive from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's partly because communication with the front-line labor is all in 
English," said Brown, interviewed at a restaurant in the Malaysian-owned Subic 
Bay Resort and Casino, formerly a barracks. "That helps us meet our technical 
requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 Memphis, Tenn.-based Federal Express Corp. is planning to use the Cubi 
Airfield at Subic as its regional hub starting in January, once equipment is 
installed that will convert it to a commercial airport. Chairman Frederick W. 
Smith recalled visiting the base when he was a Navy pilot during the Vietnam 
War. But that didn't influence the decision to invest here, a company 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon is counting on the convenience of a major express cargo carrier to lure 
more light manufacturers. He has applied to the World Bank for a $36-million 
loan to upgrade the airport for Federal Express; daily commuter flights to 
Manila are on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the military infrastructure, the U.S. Navy also left behind one of 
the last remaining virgin rain forests in the Philippines, intact with its rare 
mahogany and teak stands, monkeys and wild boar. Indigenous Aeta tribesmen were 
given sanctuary and employment here. 
</P>
<P>
 Boots Litsay, who trained civilian employees in the Navy's personnel office 
and now heads Subic's tourism division, said "eco-tours" are catching on; the 
truly adventurous can hire unemployed Aeta men who trained Navy pilots in 
jungle survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Another unusual attraction is a vast forest of ammunition bunkers -- 286 
concrete "igloos" with foot-thick walls, steel doors and sod-covered roofs. 
When the base was turned over, the volunteers inspected these igloos with 
Geiger counters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to have something interesting to show the tourists," said Litsay, a 
third-generation U.S. military employee. "There were a lot of stories over the 
past 30 years about there being a dungeon out there for nuclear weapons. 
Unluckily, we haven't found one." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Gordon says the industrial side of the free port is reaching 
critical mass, with commitments for as much as $400 million in investment from 
foreign and domestic sources involving more than 50 projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, Subic brings forth the idea that there's a world that will leave us 
behind unless we take action. Subic is the idea of the global economic 
village," said Gordon. "You are looking at a resurgent Philippines. We're just 
now reawakening." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the nation has some serious hurdles to cross before it can apply the 
lessons of Subic Bay on a wider scale. The most urgent task is to get its 
macroeconomic house in order. 
</P>
<P>
 President Ramos, a graduate of West Point, must charge ahead with economic 
reforms before growth can be sustained, his critics say. He's under pressure to 
hold down inflation, broaden the tax base, liberalize financial markets, 
increase the domestic savings rate and reschedule the country's $34-billion 
foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge to the president is focused in pending negotiations with the 
International Monetary Fund, which has laid down stringent conditions before it 
grants a so-called "Good Housekeeping label" to the government's economic 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a final agreement is hammered out, the IMF will lend the Philippines up 
to $650 million over three years in a program of fiscal restructuring. The IMF 
program is an endorsement that will open the door to financing from other 
sources of international capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "The IMF (program) is very important. But if we're playing baseball, we're on 
third base," Ramos said. "That Good Housekeeping label, I'm quite optimistic on 
that in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiscal policies aside, one of the most daunting tasks Ramos faces is following 
through on promises he made early in his administration to break up the cartels 
and monopolies that keep a chokehold on the nation's economic life. 
</P>
<P>
 He's had some success with the phone company, but tremendous economic power 
remains concentrated in the hands of an elite group of business families, some 
tracing their lineage to the Spanish colonial era, others powerful vestiges of 
Marcos cronyism. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Jose T. Almonte, the president's national security adviser and one of his 
closest aides, has been a vociferous trust-busting ideologue, denouncing "East 
Asia's most powerful oligarchy" as an enduring social evil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the generations, there has been a pattern of behavior that has acquired 
its own life and influenced our national ethos," Almonte said in an interview. 
"It has a character that has no capacity to serve the common good, only its own 
self-interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos, the son of a civil servant, is by nature a populist and cites the 
importance of advancing Filipino "people power" from the political to the 
economic sphere. But he has been cautious in his pursuit of economic justice, 
leaving the impression that he and Almonte have honed a good-cop, bad-cop 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
 "This business of leveling the playing fields and abolishing the monopolies 
and cartels is just one aspect, just a part of it," Ramos said about his reform 
program. "Although it's a significant aspect." 
</P>
<P>
 Having neutralized a long-festering Communist insurgency, Ramos perhaps is 
able to move slowly and calmly in his attack on entrenched economic interests. 
This is no revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are reforms being undertaken, not a military blitz," said Alex Magno, a 
political science professor at the University of the Philippines. "They come in 
bit by bit. But it's a solid edifice of policies." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, national confidence is building under the relatively steady hand -- 
by Philippine standards -- of the Ramos administration. The Subic experiment is 
a case in point, suggesting that the country soon may shed the inferiority 
complex it developed watching the dazzling economic success of its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Later this year, Ramos will move away from the catching-up rhetoric," Magno 
said, "to the rhetoric of overtaking our rivals." New Life for an Old Base 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two years after the U.S. Navy pulled out of its base at Subic Bay, 
the Philippines has turned the site into a thriving free port that embodies the 
nation's newfound economic optimism.

LAST LOOSE END WRAPPED UP IN ZZZZ BEST FRAUD CASE; FINANCE: KEY PLAYER MAURICE 
RIND SIGNS DECREE, AVERTING TRIAL. BUT U.S. WON'T BE ABLE TO COLLECT $720,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the moment authorities tried to brand him as the mob-connected mastermind 
behind the fraud-ridden ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning company, Maurice Rind issued 
a challenge: "They can investigate . . . until the world comes to an end, and 
they wouldn't come up with nothin'." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, for nearly seven years, it looked like he might pull it off. 
</P>
<P>
 While the whiz kid who founded ZZZZ Best in his parents' garage, Barry Minkow, 
was convicted with 11 others and jailed on federal fraud charges, Rind was 
never even indicted; this after he had been described by Los Angeles police -- 
before Congress, no less -- as having ties to "all five New York organized 
crime families" and as being the man who sent ZZZZ Best public, enabling its 
stock to soar to a value of $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 He was, to be sure, a defendant in civil suits brought by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission against 14 principals of ZZZZ Best when its miracle rise 
turned out to be based more on cooked books than shampooed rugs. But after 13 
others settled or defaulted, leading to injunctions against them, Rind fought 
on. And on. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this week. On Tuesday, the SEC announced it had reached a consent decree 
with Rind just as his trial was to begin in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
The action not only resolved the civil case against the 55-year-old Encino 
resident, but concluded, at long last, all government action stemming from the 
1987 demise of ZZZZ Best. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time," said SEC attorney Karen Matteson, clearly relieved to 
reach a settlement with the combative "last defendant," who often served as his 
own attorney as he delayed and exasperated government lawyers with convoluted 
explanations -- in his classic New York twang -- of matters such as his 
criminal record and allegations that he helped ZZZZ Best file false financial 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Rind, the SEC said, cleared a $720,000 profit for himself by using aliases and 
a backdated document to purchase power generators for ZZZZ Best through a 
Cayman Islands company. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rind admits no wrongdoing in the "Final Judgment and Permanent Injunction 
and Disgorgement," simply pledging to obey all relevant securities laws in the 
future. And while the government gets the full judgment it sought -- the 
$720,000, plus interest -- it acknowledges that it will not be able to collect 
a penny. For Rind's financial records now show no assets to seize. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's a win," declared Rind. "As far as I'm concerned, it's no runs, no 
hits, no errors . . . I'm not admittin' or denyin' anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Even one of the former ZZZZ Best prosecutors acknowledged that the SEC 
sanctions were not a bad outcome -- or an unfamiliar outcome -- for the man 
once listed among the prime ZZZZ Best suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many times has he agreed not to do it again?" asked onetime prosecutor 
Gordon Greenberg, now in private practice. "Three, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, as the ZZZZ Best scandal played itself out, Rind liked to mock 
authorities -- Los Angeles police in particular -- for the way they had gotten 
it all wrong at the start, seeing the Reseda-based company as a "house of 
hoods," as an organized crime case. Later, federal prosecutors saw it 
differently, branding ZZZZ Best as merely a "house of scams," a classic 
financial fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, however, "they made me bigger than Meyer Lansky!" Rind 
exclaimed one day. And this time, at least, he could not be accused of 
distorting all at much. 
</P>
<P>
 It began in March, 1987, when LAPD detectives set out to investigate a tip 
seemingly far removed from carpet cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead concerned the owner of Splash, a Malibu restaurant, who was suspected 
of being a member of the Bonnano crime family with a warrant against him in New 
Jersey. The warrant proved trivial, but local authorities began frenzied 
investigations of the restaurateur, Ronnie Lorenzo, who finally was sent to 
prison last year on unrelated federal charges and in the process drew attention 
as the best friend of actor James Caan. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years ago, detectives soon found themselves on a winding trail when they 
learned that Splash had recently changed hands in a sale handled by an Encino 
company, Richman Financial Services, and that Lorenzo's car, a Pontiac, had 
been registered by the president of that firm, one Maurice Rind. 
</P>
<P>
 A background check came up with a hit on the new name: As a stockbroker in New 
York, Rind had been convicted twice on fraud charges in the 1970s and sentenced 
to a year in prison. In separate SEC civil actions, according to legal briefs 
filed by the agency in federal court, he was barred from working as a broker, 
and twice was enjoined -- the last time in 1985, while acting as a consultant 
-- from violating portions of the securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
 No rap sheet, however, could do justice to a man described by one of his own 
attorneys as "straight from Central Casting." 
</P>
<P>
 Though by then living in Encino, in the shadow of the Ventura Freeway, Rind 
was firmly planted in the streets of New York. A bespectacled, pinky-ringed 
chain-smoker, he used lingo straight out of Damon Runyon to expound on favored 
topics: the many injustices he had suffered over the years, and the stocks he 
liked, often the obscure offerings of small companies recently gone public. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, his acquaintances included other colorful East Coast refugees, 
such as his partner in Richman Financial, 300-pound Richard Schulman, who had 
once served time for extortion and now liked to sit around in his underwear, 
smoking cigars. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives soon speculated that Rind had become a financial adviser to the 
"Mickey Mouse Mafia," L.A.'s ragtag coterie of mob fringe figures known as much 
for their bumbling as their menace. 
</P>
<P>
 But others from the straight world -- attorneys, investigators and the like -- 
also had open ears when Rind dished out stock tips, much like a racetrack tout 
offering his wisdom on the daily double. "A lot of people think I have an 
educated opinion," was the way Rind put it. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, investigators got a clue to his hot stock of the moment when they 
learned that the utilities at Richman Financial's address -- Schulman's condo 
-- were paid by another company, whose registered agent was Barry Minkow, then 
gaining fame with his promises to clean two rooms for $39.95 and his TV 
anti-drug campaign, "My Act Is Clean. How's Yours?" 
</P>
<P>
 He had met Rind in 1985, it turned out, when ZZZZ Best was still a small 
private company. That October, Minkow hired Rind as a consultant to perform 
"whatever duties are necessary" to take the company public. 
</P>
<P>
 Rind set Minkow up with a New York attorney who knew one route, merging ZZZZ 
Best with a publicly held Utah shell corporation. Of 15.3 million original 
shares, Rind acquired 500,000 through a company he owned and 200,000 in his own 
name, for "about five cents per share," according to the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities never challenged the legality of those deals. What did draw 
special scrutiny were the maneuvers designed to earn ZZZZ Best a listing on the 
over-the-counter Nasdaq exchange, something that required a company to have $2 
million in hard assets. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was that one of ZZZZ Best's first press releases announced that it had 
acquired 22 used power generators "for $2 million in cash and notes." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest, as they say, is history. The stock rose steadily, helped by Minkow's 
propensity for public relations and millions in profits listed for a side 
specialty in "insurance restoration work," repairing large buildings damaged by 
flood or fire. By the spring of 1987, the company was poised to acquire a 
national carpet cleaning chain that got its business through Sears Roebuck, the 
country's premier retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not to be. Creditors got hints that the insurance jobs existed only 
on paper. ZZZZ Best was forced into bankruptcy. Then Los Angeles police moved 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 In a remarkable July 8, 1987, press conference announcing the serving of 
search warrants around the city, then-Police Chief Daryl F. Gates listed nine 
individuals, including Rind, who were suspected of using ZZZZ Best and several 
less-notable businesses to launder "large organized crime proceeds" for East 
Coast crime families. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead LAPD detective later went before a Congressional subcommittee and 
further spotlighted Rind as "an associate to all five" major organized crime 
families who had made "staggering profits" on ZZZZ Best stock. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the LAPD's talk, though, it was federal authorities -- the FBI and the 
U.S. attorney's office -- who were assigned to bring the criminal case. And to 
them, the local cops seemed mob-crazy. To the feds, ZZZZ Best was about "a lot 
of financial shenanigans," as the main prosecutor put it, particularly the 
fabrication of insurance jobs to drive up the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 While the feds were suspicious of the role of several convicted felons in 
Minkow's inner circle, Rind, for one, threw them for a loop by hardly acting 
like a culprit with something to hide. The day after Gates' press conference, 
he volunteered to tell authorities anything they wanted -- even lead them 
through his ledgers. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his friends had been among the victims of ZZZZ Best, he said, simply 
advisers and early investors who had no idea about the insurance fraud. With 
all the bloodsuckers sniffing around Minkow, "we were protecting the kid from 
being extorted," Rind told authorities when they took him up on his offer to 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
 When the federal indictments came down, only one of the suspects trumpeted by 
Gates -- Minkow -- was named as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem for federal prosecutors, recalled Greenberg, was figuring out "who 
duped who . . . whether Maurice Rind took advantage of Barry Minkow or Barry 
Minkow took advantage of Maurice Rind -- or (if it was) a feeding frenzy on 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't mean the mob angle was absent from the criminal trial. Minkow made 
it the centerpiece of his defense, claiming he acted under "duress," terrified 
of tough guys who threatened him until he was "just a puppet." 
</P>
<P>
 At least that was his spin until sentencing in 1989, when he drew a 25-year 
term. "They got the right guy," he announced then, adding that he had "enjoyed 
being a little Mafioso." 
</P>
<P>
 Rind declined an opportunity to testify. Called by the defense, he pleaded the 
5th Amendment -- 92 times. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hardly silent, however, when the SEC civil case was brought in August, 
1990. He vowed to "beat their ass," to win exoneration once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue was the supposed $2-million generator deal. The SEC alleged that ZZZZ 
Best actually paid just $597,000, then made the sale look larger with "sham 
transactions" through an intermediary firm -- set up by Rind, using the names 
Michael Phelps and Michael Stone in correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
 Rind had explanations for every detail. A company lawyer "directed" him to 
sign another name. The generators were "valuable pieces of equipment . . . the 
only real thing in the whole company." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I made a profit," he said when a reporter dropped by his condo, 
dominated by a pool table and a giant print of Marilyn Monroe. " . . . Me 
myself, I made, let's put it this way, a sizable amount of money -- but nowhere 
near the amount they claim." 
</P>
<P>
 The legal fees, though, were grinding him down, he said. "Are you kiddin' me 
-- $250 an hour?" 
</P>
<P>
 So he took over his own case, for the most part, conducting lengthy 
depositions himself. While 13 ZZZZ Best principals, two auditors and an 
accountant were accepting SEC sanctions, Rind trekked to Minkow's federal 
prison in Colorado to quiz the onetime whiz kid, who since his trial had 
claimed to have gotten religion and who -- from behind bars -- marketed 
videotapes advising accountants how to avoid another ZZZZ Best. 
</P>
<P>
 As Rind's case dragged on, SEC attorneys complained that some of his arguments 
were "a rambling hodgepodge," attempts "to retract or modify certain of his 
previous admissions, (and) explain away his responsibility." They noted how 
Rind once started talking about the New York judge who presided over one of his 
criminal cases and declared "on his own 'personal knowledge,' (that the judge) 
was 'disbarred for corruption at a later time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 SEC lawyer Matteson reported that she had contacted New York authorities to 
check on the man. He was, she learned, "still a judge." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was the legal fees, Rind said, that recently convinced him, "I just can't 
go any further." And maybe it wasn't wise to go to trial as his own lawyer. And 
since his financial records showed "I'm in very, very bad shape," what could 
they get? 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC knew Rind had agreed to injunctions before, only to fall under 
scrutiny again. But the new order enjoins him from "future violations" of 
sections of the securities laws never covered before, SEC attorney Matteson 
said, and the government could seek to have him cited for contempt if he 
violates them. Similarly, if Rind is found to have any assets, "we can pursue 
him," she noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were satisfied he didn't have any income or assets," Matteson said, though 
she acknowledged that SEC officials "just have his representation of what he's 
been doing." 
</P>
<P>
 So what has he been doing? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doin' some things," Rind himself said. ". . . I'm not looking for no 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 His latest pursuit: acting as a consultant to a company "really starting to 
make tremendous headway." 
</P>
<P>
 The concept: put hidden markings on paintings and other artworks so they can 
be registered and traced if stolen. In other words, "a systems company designed 
to protect the collectibles industry against fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice Rind in the anti-fraud business. He savors the notion, then adds, 
"Believe it or not."

NEWS ANALYSIS; PEACE DEPENDS ON ISRAELI SAFETY, BETTER ARAB LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dynamics of peacemaking in the Middle East changed dramatically Wednesday 
when Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed the agreement on 
Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace now depends less on bold moves by courageous leaders like Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and far more on the 
ability of tens of thousands of people to make the agreement work, day in and 
day out, so that coexistence and cooperation replace confrontation and 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 If Palestinians get from autonomy the sense that life is improving, they will 
become believers in the efficacy of negotiations and seek a political solution 
to their statelessness and impoverishment. If they do not, they will return to 
the gun to achieve what this agreement failed to bring. 
</P>
<P>
 If Israelis feel safe, if not safer, as a result of the accord, they will be 
ready to yield more territory for peace -- in the West Bank, the Golan Heights 
and southern Lebanon. And if Israelis find their security diminished, they will 
oppose even the extension of Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the broad logic underlying the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin put it plainly: "Without security for Israel and new hope for the 
Palestinians, the objectives of the agreement won't be achieved." 
</P>
<P>
 But the relationship is as complex as it is direct. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians' focus has been and remains on the future -- the independent 
state they hope will come after five years of autonomy, if not sooner. The 
Israeli focus is on the operational, the here and now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace should never become so prosaic that it will be reduced to municipal 
chores like street repairs and trash collection," said Mahdi Abdul Hadi, a 
prominent Palestinian political scientist. "But we will be measured and tested 
by our ability to give our children an education, to improve health care, to 
create jobs. . . . Political power is always to be used for betterment." 
</P>
<P>
 But the PLO has always given primacy to Palestinian dignity in asserting its 
people's right to self-determination and independence. On Wednesday, Rabin 
hammered the PLO hard for its lack of preparedness for assuming control of the 
Gaza Strip and the West Bank city of Jericho; he asserted that the PLO is 
interested more in stamps, flags and other symbols than in real governance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main question now -- a big, big if -- is whether the Palestinians can 
control the area, whether they can provide the education, the health care, the 
jobs, what Gaza needs," commented Ori Orr, chairman of the influential foreign 
affairs and defense committee of the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament. "This 
agreement succeeds or falls on this. If the Gaza refugees don't see some kind 
of light ahead, an improvement in their miserable lives, they will pick up the 
knife, the gun again. . . . The main problem before us is the PLO's ability to 
rule." 
</P>
<P>
 Sufyan abu Zaideh, a long-imprisoned leader of Arafat's Fatah movement in 
Gaza, acknowledged that the PLO is not prepared to govern there -- that three 
weeks will be needed to deploy the new Palestine police in the region and at 
least three months to establish a governmental structure. "This is not because 
you are Jews and we are Arabs," he told an Israel Television reporter, "but 
because you're a state and we're an organization scattered among many 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian leaders in Gaza and the West Bank are acutely aware of the need to 
deliver -- and worried by what failure would mean. 
</P>
<P>
 "Popular support for the PLO is tied to progress, not just progress in the 
peace process but to changes in daily life," Tawfik Mabhouh, a leader of the 
pro-Communist Palestine People's Party, said in Gaza City. "There is no real 
conviction here in favor of this settlement, but there is a hope of change -- a 
hope that we can do a better job than the Israelis did for 27 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian task forces have been planning the PLO assumption of power for 
more than two years. There are detailed programs for education, health care, 
agriculture, industrial development, even an electrical grid. Thousands of 
potential officials, many with impressive professional qualifications and some 
with years of experience abroad, have been identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there is total uncertainty about tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the agreement signed Wednesday morning by Arafat and Rabin laid down 
a timetable for the Israeli withdrawal and the Palestinian assumption of power, 
neither side could say Wednesday evening what, in fact, will happen this week 
or next -- when Israeli forces will pull out of Gaza, when the Palestine police 
will arrive, who precisely will assume responsibility for water, hospitals or 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the negotiations in Cairo in the small hours of Wednesday 
morning, Rabin took Arafat aside and talked to him seriously about all these 
problems. At the end of that very private talk, a tired Arafat was heard 
promising Rabin to "do my best." 
</P>
<P>
 Much depends on Arafat's success. Israelis see the Gaza-Jericho agreement very 
much as a test not only for the Palestinians but for their other Arab 
neighbors. Speaking after signing the agreement, Rabin again told Arafat, "The 
people of Israel hope you will not disappoint us." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Israelis, whether they approved or not, recognized the agreement signed 
Wednesday as a major step toward a Palestinian state; the question for them was 
what this will mean for Israel's security. A hostile Palestine would not 
threaten the existence of Israel, but it could make life hell. 
</P>
<P>
 "A large majority of Palestinians does not accept the existence of the Jewish 
state and wants to destroy the Jewish state," Gerald Steinberg of Bar Ilan 
University said. "The question is whether through this agreement we will 
channel this conflict . . . into more diplomatic ways that are easier for us to 
live with." 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset, Rabin has been clear about his goal of extricating Israel 
from the pain of occupation and the ultimately unwinnable conflict that the 
Palestinians intensified with their intifada, the rebellion begun in 1987 after 
20 years of Israeli rule. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a major strategic factor as well -- securing a comprehensive peace 
in the Middle East that would turn now-hostile Arab neighbors into a buffer 
zone against the advance of militant Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 But all depends on the workability of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, with its 
effort to give Palestinians sufficient incentives in the future -- principally 
their own state throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip -- so they realize the 
medium-term goals of what amounts to a form of collective security with Israel, 
as well as economic cooperation.

FORD, CARTER, REAGAN PUSH FOR GUN BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three former presidents endorsed legislation Wednesday to ban the future 
manufacture, sale and possession of combat-style assault weapons as a closely 
divided House neared a showdown today on the hotly controversial issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan sent a letter to all House 
members expressing their support for the measure, effectively joining President 
Clinton in urging approval of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the four make a formidable lobby, stretching across a broad 
ideological spectrum and giving political cover to wavering House members. 
</P>
<P>
 As pressures intensified Wednesday, several lawmakers who had never voted 
against the National Rifle Assn., the leading opponent of the ban, announced 
that they would support the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, while momentum was clearly with supporters of the bill, congressional 
aides continued to predict late Wednesday that it would be narrowly defeated -- 
and proponents acknowledged that they were about five votes short of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be neck and neck," said Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), chief 
sponsor of the bill. "This is going to be some horse race." 
</P>
<P>
 With Clinton continuing his campaign on behalf of the ban, law enforcement 
officers joined with Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
(D-Calif.), author of a Senate-passed ban on assault weapons, to urge approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "I beg the undecided members of the House -- give this bill a chance," 
Feinstein said in an emotional speech here. "I can't really share with you the 
fear I feel if this does not get a positive vote." 
</P>
<P>
 In their letter, the three former presidents said: "This is a matter of vital 
importance to the public safety. . . . Although assault weapons account for 
less than 1% of the guns in circulation, they account for nearly 10% of the 
guns traced to crime. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "While we recognize that assault-weapon legislation will not stop all 
assault-weapon crime, statistics prove that we can dry up the supply of these 
guns, making them less accessible to criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We urge you to listen to the American public and to the law enforcement 
community and support a ban on the further manufacture of these weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 Former President George Bush, an opponent of gun-control measures during his 
term in the White House, did not sign the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's vote amounts to a directive to a Senate-House conference committee on 
whether to include the Senate-passed ban on assault weapons in a final version 
of the crime bill, which must be ratified by both chambers before being sent to 
the President. 
</P>
<P>
 The House bill would ban the manufacture and transfer of 19 semiautomatic 
assault weapons, copycat models and others with more than one military-style 
feature such as a pistol grip or detachable, high-capacity clip. Such guns 
currently lawfully owned would be exempted. Another 650 models commonly used 
for hunting or target shooting would still be permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the House voted on a bill to bar assault-style weapons -- in 
late 1991 -- the measure was rejected, 247 to 177. Both sides agreed Wednesday 
that the outcome will be far closer this time. 
</P>
<P>
 There were some surprising expressions of support for the ban Wednesday as the 
House approached a decision that could have an impact on the 1994 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Rep. Ronald D. Coleman (D-Tex.) agreed to support the ban 
although he has never voted against an NRA position since coming to Congress in 
1972. After Clinton telephoned him Wednesday, however, Coleman switched and 
said he will go along with the wishes of law enforcement officers in his 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it is a political offense that costs me my job to try to take Uzis out of 
the hands of schoolkids and make it harder for drug thugs and gangs to get the 
machine guns that wantonly kill our police officers and children, then so be 
it," Coleman said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Rep. Michael A. Andrews (D-Tex.), who said he voted against a 
proposed ban in 1991 because it was too vague, endorsed the current bill as 
drawn narrowly enough to protect the rights of hunters and sportsmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always believed in the old Texas saying that gun control means steady 
aim," Andrews told reporters. "At the same time . . . I am convinced that if we 
limit the availability of military-style assault weapons, we will be taking a 
meaningful step toward improving the safety of our streets without trampling on 
our constitutional rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews, a lifelong hunter, asked: "Who can, in good conscience, defend such 
weapons as appropriate for hunters or sportsmen? Anyone that needs a 20-round 
clip of high-velocity ammunition to fell a duck or deer needs to look into 
taking up golf." 
</P>
<P>
 Conversions like these have raised the hopes of supporters of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time last night, I went to bed thinking that this was 
winnable," Schumer said. "We are really gaining momentum." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), sponsor of a previous assault-weapons ban 
that passed the Senate but died in the House, said police organizations will 
deserve the credit if the bill succeeds in the House this time around. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the time for the House to take the political risk and do the right 
thing," DeConcini said. "There is political life if you vote against the NRA." 
Plea From 3 Ex-Presidents 
</P>
<P>
 The letter from three former presidents to the House: 
</P>
<P>
 May 3, 1994 
</P>
<P>
 To Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: 
</P>
<P>
 We are writing to urge your support for a ban on the domestic manufacture of 
military-style assault weapons. This is a matter of vital importance to the 
public safety. Although assualt weapons account for less than 1% of the guns in 
circulation, they account for nearly 10% of the guns traced to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Every major law enforcement organization in America and dozens of leading 
labor, medical, religious, civil rights and civic groups support such a ban. 
Most importantly, poll after poll shows that the American public overwhelmingly 
support a ban on assault weapons. A 1993 CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll found that 
77% of Americans support a ban on the manufacture, sale, and possession of 
semi-automatic assault guns, such as the AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1989 import ban resulted in an impressive 40% drop in imported assault 
weapons traced to crime between 1989 and 1991, but the killing continues. Last 
year, a killer armed with two TEC9s killed eight people at a San Francisco law 
firm and wounded several others. During the past five years, more than 40 law 
enforcement officers have been killed or wounded in the line of duty by an 
assault weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 While we recognize that assault weapon legislation will not stop all assault 
weapon crime, statistics prove that we can dry up the supply of these guns, 
making them less accessible to criminals. We urge you to listen to the American 
public and to the law enforcement community and support a ban on the further 
manufacture of these weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Sincerely, 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald R. Ford

HUNDREDS MORE BRIDGES MAY NEED RETROFITTING; ROADS: CALTRANS DIRECTOR SAYS 
INSPECTIONS FIND A GREATER NEED THAN EXPECTED. BOND ISSUE MAY NOT COVER ALL 
COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of additional bridges throughout California may need retrofitting, 
officials disclosed Wednesday, raising fears that a proposed $2-billion bond 
issue may not cover the cost of strengthening highway overpasses for earthquake 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning from a Senate budget committee, Caltrans Director James van 
Loben Sels said at least 80% of the bridges that have been screened so far to 
determine their susceptibility to earthquake damage have been found to need 
retrofitting. He said the number is much higher than what Caltrans estimated 
when it projected the costs and scope of its seismic retrofitting program. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he said, the agency has found an additional 700 bridges that 
need to be examined for earthquake vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that the state will probably be retrofitting at least 2,200 
bridges, but it currently has funding for only about half that many repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Loben Sels' disclosure prompted an angry outburst from Senate 
Transportation Committee Chairman Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), who 
complained that the Wilson Administration has been deliberately downplaying the 
number of bridges that need retrofitting to avoid jeopardizing the passage of 
the bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of California haven't been told that there is a substantial amount 
of additional money which will be needed to retrofit and make safe (highway 
bridges)," Kopp said. "Let's assume the bond issue is approved. We're still 
going to need more money." 
</P>
<P>
 But Van Loben Sels argued that it is too early to tell how much money will be 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the bridges screened so far are those in the Los Angeles and San 
Francisco Bay areas and were considered most vulnerable. As the remaining 
bridges are examined, he said, officials are hopeful that fewer of them will 
require strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing is not how many bridges (but) how much it will cost," he 
said. "As you get down into the lower-vulnerability bridges, you could expect 
the retrofit . . . could be done relatively cheaply. They will be smaller 
fixes, less complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 The retrofitting program, initiated after bridges collapsed in the 1971 Sylmar 
quake, has been a sensitive political issue in Sacramento ever since the 
October, 1989, Loma Prieta earthquake knocked down part of the Nimitz Freeway 
in Oakland and a section of the San Francisco Bay Bridge. A board of inquiry 
determined that the retrofitting program had moved too slowly and been 
underfunded. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, six bridges -- none of them retrofitted -- collapsed in the 
Northridge earthquake, again raising questions that cost concerns and competing 
transit projects had slowed the program. A Los Angeles Times report found that 
80% of the state's most earthquake-vulnerable bridges still had not been 
strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson responded by accelerating the program and calling for a bond 
issue that he said would pay retrofitting costs without sacrificing other 
transportation programs or requiring an immediate tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The state already had set aside $750 million in its gasoline-tax-financed 
transportation program to cover the costs of retrofitting 1,039 bridges that 
were considered susceptible to earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency had made no provisions to pay the costs of retrofitting toll 
bridges and another 1,500 overpasses that were in the process of being screened 
to determine how many required strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials estimated that 1,000 of the bridges in this group would 
require retrofitting, at a cost of $1 billion. But subsequent screening 
indicated that 1,200 would probably need strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, another 700 bridges were identified as needing screening. 
Caltrans officials said they expect the retrofitting of any of these bridges to 
be relatively minor, compared to the cost of $1 million per bridge for earlier 
retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond issue, which goes before voters in June, would provide $950 million 
for the strengthening of about 1,000 highway overpasses and seven toll bridges. 
Officials in the Wilson Administration have been strong backers of the issue, 
claiming its passage -- along with federal funds -- would provide the money 
needed to complete the retrofitting program. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp contended that the existing funding and the bond issue will not cover the 
retrofitting costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least another 1,500 structures will need retrofitting," he said. "I'm so 
confident that if I'm wrong, you can throw me out of office." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk West, president of the California Chamber of Commerce and a leader of the 
campaign to pass the bond issue, said that even if Kopp's projections are 
correct, they do not minimize the need for the bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the bond issue, he said, there would not be enough ready cash in the 
state's transportation program to complete the retrofitting program at an 
accelerated pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not to pass this bond issue would be unwise because as a practical matter 
there is not the amount of money amassed to do this retrofitting," he said. "If 
you put this off and do this gradually and do not accelerate the retrofitting, 
it could be a very dangerous gamble."

U.S., 15 OTHER NATIONS ACT TO BOLSTER DOLLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plunging aggressively into volatile currency markets, the Clinton 
Administration moved Wednesday to prop up the value of the steadily slipping 
dollar and head off a potential threat to the struggling global economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve, coordinating their measures with 
15 other nations, moved in concert for the first time since President Clinton 
took office to prevent the dollar from weakening further against the Japanese 
yen and the German mark. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar closed at 1.654 German marks, up from 1.637 marks on 
Tuesday. The dollar also rose to 101.85 yen, up from 101.05 yen late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the end of 1993, the dollar's value has slumped from a high of 1.738 
marks and 111.6 yen. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short run, the action could make imports from these two major 
manufacturing nations less expensive in the United States. And in the longer 
run -- if successful -- it could restore stability and predictability to the 
international currency trading picture. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar has been losing value all week, despite a much more limited 
intervention in currency markets Friday. In recent days it has been flirting 
with a historic low against the yen and a six-month low against the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The declining dollar placed the Clinton Administration in a "damned if you do, 
damned if you don't" predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 If investors expect the dollar to lose value, they hesitate to put their money 
into the United States. That cuts down the flow of much-needed foreign capital 
to U.S. financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 But a strong dollar brings problems of its own, tending to worsen the nation's 
trade deficit. That is because it boosts the price of U.S. products bought with 
foreign currencies overseas. Conversely, it makes imports cheaper in the United 
States. That might be good news for consumers but it damages the ability of 
U.S. manufacturers to compete with foreign rivals in price. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the Administration has decided that propping up the dollar's value is 
the lesser evil. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, highlighting the significance of the move by 
taking the unusual step of publicly announcing it, said Wednesday's actions 
"reflect our view that recent movements in exchange markets have gone beyond 
what is justified by economic fundamentals." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen sought to make it clear that the United States was not trying to drive 
down its trade deficit by letting the dollar slide. "This Administration sees 
no advantage in an undervalued currency," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar has been sagging even though U.S. interest rates have been rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher rates usually make the dollar a more attractive investment for money 
managers, and growing demand pushes the dollar's value up. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, investors seem to have discounted the effect of rising U.S. 
interest rates, and, with U.S.-Japanese trade talks stalled, analysts said 
there was little else to promote long-term confidence in the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Most private analysts found Wednesday's coordinated intervention in the 
currency markets significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time," said Marc Hendrix, head of research at the Swiss Bank 
Corp. in London, "central banks have become concerned about the dollar's 
decline and the potential for a mini-crisis. It is significant in terms of 
restoring some order or stalling the dollar's decline." 
</P>
<P>
 The intervention was accomplished through a massive sale of other currencies 
for dollars, a move designed to drive up the dollar's value much as a large 
purchase of stock can drive up the value of remaining shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The specific amount of purchases was not disclosed but it was believed to 
involve several billion dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The step had the desired effect of driving up the dollar's value, if only 
temporarily. But the dollar began to slip again by the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Treasury officials said the intervention was meant to counteract what 
was described as "a negative psychology that had developed on the basis of 
false perceptions that the United States was trying to drive the dollar down 
for reasons of competitiveness and leverage." They said the United States is 
"not indifferent to where market forces took the value of the dollar." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans in Congress warned that, with an estimated trillion dollars 
washing through international currency markets every day, foreign governments 
could not influence currency values for long. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, ranking Republican on the House Banking, Finance and 
Urban Affairs Committee, called the intervention "a risky sideshow -- risky in 
the sense that taxpayer funds are being used as a hedge fund; a sideshow to the 
extent that any effect is likely to be short term: hours, days, perhaps weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 "The only sustaining governmental action that can bolster a currency relates 
to long-term political and monetary discipline, not to transitory political 
manipulation," Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
 C. Fred Bergsten, a senior Treasury official in the Jimmy Carter 
Administration and now director of the Institute for International Economics, 
said the Clinton Administration was making "a mistake, based on a fear we might 
get a large dollar decline that might drive the bond market down further. I see 
little evidence of that."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: BROWN FOLLOWS ROOTS, FINDS CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly before she formally announced her candidacy for governor in February, 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown visited her ailing 88-year-old father, Edmund G. (Pat) 
Brown. She told of her plans for a two-day kickoff tour and asked how he'd 
started his own first gubernatorial race back in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a turning point in her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got this great grin," she recalls. "He said, 'I went right up to the 
Oregon border, stood behind the Welcome to California sign and announced, 
California, here I come. I'm running for governor.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Then he stumped south, down through the state. Pat Brown loved bounding along 
the campaign trail. In those days, before big buys of 30-second TV spots, 
that's how you ran for office. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown took off on her two-day tour and found she loved the trail, 
too. And she began talking to aides about her father's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Her strategists "had this bunker mentality," one aide says. "They were going 
to keep Kathleen locked inside a room" and, except for an occasional speech, 
focus on TV ads. The spots are all that really matter today, many consultants 
think. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen did some old-fashioned campaigning and realized this stuff is in her 
blood," the aide continues. "It's like a drug to her. It gives her energy and 
more confidence. She finally rebelled and the fist came down on the table. She 
said, 'I want to be out there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Being tied to a tether was one of the final frustrations that prompted Brown 
to shake up her staff and recruit new advisers. She realized the critics were 
right -- her campaign lacked focus and she was slipping. Brown had a second 
debut at the Democratic state convention in mid-April and she's been on the 
trail virtually ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, she'll park her automobile and board an old fashioned campaign 
bus, except this one will be decked out like some country singer's with swivel 
chairs, tables, phones and refreshments. Brown's first stop will be in San 
Bernardino County, where unemployment remains high and working class Democrats 
provide a battleground for swing voters -- and presumably a receptive audience 
for her "one million new jobs" theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's new campaign manager, Clinton Reilly, packs around a foot-high "count 
book -- my bible" -- that tells him where to find the voters she'll need to win 
the June and November elections. The book contains numbers and locations of 
registered voters by practically every demographic group -- gender, race, 
marital status, age and income, plus likelihood of voting. 
</P>
<P>
 The count book will be Brown's electoral road map as she campaigns by bus, up 
and down the state, on most days until the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Brown sees it, slogging the trail may be old fashioned, but it also 
reflects '90s necessities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grass-roots campaigning -- region by region -- is the only way I can win this 
race," Brown says, referring to the fall battle she expects with Gov. Pete 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can do the TV (ads) -- that's a given. But I've got to do the grass-roots 
because we have a fragmented market today. There aren't brand loyalties in 
politics. People want to know specifically what I can do in their area. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't do it just by TV. Technology really has changed society. People 
watch cable more. They've got the clicker and they surf." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, a candidate with the fund-raising prowess of Kathleen Brown isn't 
forced to make priority choices. She can afford it all -- grass-roots, 
sophisticated field work and expensive television. 
</P>
<P>
 Her latest TV ads hit Wednesday. The plan is to run different spots in major 
markets every day until the primary -- at a cost of $3 million to $4 million. 
They'll promote her record as treasurer, attack Wilson's economic performance 
and pitch her jobs plan. She likely also will run radio ads tweaking her main 
Democratic opponent, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the recent jabbing at Brown -- by political opponents and the news 
media -- has been aimed at her jobs plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most devastating, oft-repeated comment came from an anonymous 
economist, who was quoted calling Brown's plan "a no-brainer" because one 
million jobs should be created automatically during the next four years. Dr. 
Stephen Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California 
Economy, believes he is the source for that blind quote and says it was 
misinterpreted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a no-brainer," he says. "Projections of that many new jobs are 
predicated on the state getting its act together. The governor has an important 
role to play." 
</P>
<P>
 By hitting both the trail and television, Brown is trying to bypass political 
reporters and blind quotes and take her message straight to the voters. "I love 
it out here," she says from her car phone.

CONFLICT BETWEEN MEXICAN STATE, NATIONAL GOVERNMENT GROWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a politically charged clash over the arrest of Baja California's deputy 
attorney general on drug corruption charges, the state's governor Wednesday 
criticized federal authorities for accosting the official at gunpoint and 
unfairly accusing him in the murder of the city's police chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the accusations as a "total political irresponsibility," Gov. 
Ernesto Ruffo Appel said: "These are not simply speculations, they tend to 
cloud the vision of events and (create) a confusion that no one needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the case grew confused the day after federal agents hustled Sergio 
Ortiz Lara from the state justice complex at gunpoint, igniting a brief 
confrontation between state police and dozens of heavily armed federal officers 
in downtown Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict intertwines a probe of high-level corruption in Baja with 
election-year hostilities between Mexico's ruling party and an 
opposition-controlled state administration. It also has provoked accusations 
that authorities are trying to divert attention from the unsolved assassination 
of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz was arraigned Wednesday on charges related to a March 3 shootout between 
federal agents and state officers, who allegedly were escorting a drug lord of 
the Arellano cartel of Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 But federal authorities said Ortiz also is suspected in the assassination last 
week of Federico Benitez Lopez, the municipal police chief and a trusted 
confidante of the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Benitez had obtained evidence against Ortiz and others regarding the shootout 
and the cartel, whose leaders are fugitives in the slaying of the Roman 
Catholic cardinal of Guadalajara last year, Atty. Gen. Diego Valades said at a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to the investigation asserted that on the day before Benitez 
was slain in a highway ambush, he presented the governor with a report 
implicating the deputy attorney general in corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that Benitez had been investigating Ortiz's ties to drug traffickers 
and had presented a report to the governor the day before he was killed," the 
source said. "We think that could have been why he was murdered." 
</P>
<P>
 The accusation raises the possibility that state officers were involved in 
chief's murder. Ortiz heads a state task force investigating the Benitez case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Ruffo, however, denied Wednesday that the chief gave him information on 
misconduct by Ortiz, a 43-year-old law professor and friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the aspects that most disturbs me" about the federal 
accusations, Ruffo said. The governor called for cooperation and respect 
between the two governments and said he hopes to discuss the matter with 
Mexico's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ortiz defended himself in an interview in the La Mesa state prison, 
where he is being held pending a judge's ruling. "This is an abuse by the 
federal attorney general's office," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When two plainclothes agents escorted him forcibly from his office to a 
waiting pickup truck, Ortiz said, he thought he was being kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
 One agent told him, "You're coming or we're going to kill each other,' " Ortiz 
said. "I told him 'Don't take this attitude. The judges, employees, the public 
are watching. . . . I'm not armed. I don't have a bodyguard. I'm willing to go 
with you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 With the arrest, the federal government's longtime investigation of 
high-ranking Baja California officials suspected of collusion with drug cartels 
is accelerating, said a federal official, predicting more arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are heating up," he said. "They intend to get to the bottom of this 
matter in Tijuana." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal investigation led to the March 3 shootout that left five dead, 
including a state police officer allegedly serving as a drug lord's bodyguard 
and the federal commander of a special anti-drug unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said he expects new arrests to include five state police 
commanders initially charged with abuse of authority along with Ortiz in the 
shootout, then cleared by a judge. An appellate court has reversed the judge's 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Baja California residents, including state officials, said the dramatic 
arrest and show of force amount to a political attack by the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. The state is a stronghold of the 
National Action Party, one of two strong opposition challengers in August 
presidential elections, which could be the most competitive ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Ruffo was asked if he suspects the federal government of trying to 
divert attention from the Colosio assassination, which has fomented charges of 
a high-level conspiracy. Baja California officials, including Ruffo and 
Benitez, the slain police chief, were among the most outspoken voices in the 
Colosio investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffo said he hopes that politics are not involved. Regarding the unsolved 
Colosio case, he said: "As the days pass and we don't have information that 
describes what happened and leads us to the truth, we will be in confusion. And 
that confusion, in these times, will hurt us."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; HAYDEN TO AIR 13-MINUTE AD ON CABLE TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In keeping with his unorthodox campaign for governor, Democratic state Sen. 
Tom Hayden on Wednesday released copies of an extraordinary 13-minute 
television commercial that focuses on political corruption and features an 
interview with a convicted felon -- former state Sen. Alan Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial, which will air initially only on public access cable 
television stations, consists of nine separate short segments in which Hayden 
tours the state trying to explain how the actions of lobbyists affect the 
everyday lives of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The footage of Hayden, much of it in black and white, was shot with a 
hand-held video camera in the style of a low-budget documentary. Produced by a 
crew that has specialized in music videos, it is reminiscent of the 
well-received protest film "Roger and Me." 
</P>
<P>
 At each break, a statement about campaign contributions to Gov. Pete Wilson 
and to legislators from a particular industry flashes on the screen, along with 
Hayden's toll-free campaign telephone number. Hayden accepts contributions of 
no more than $94. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in tweed coat, his shirt unbuttoned at the collar, Hayden starts at 
the state Capitol and shifts to earthquake-ravaged Los Angeles, where he says 
that developers and transportation interests persuaded the Wilson 
Administration to spend far more on expanding freeways than on making existing 
highways safe from earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate also stands in front of St. Johns Hospital in Santa Monica and 
notes that state regulations did not require it to be upgraded to meet new 
seismic standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lobbyists for the hospitals say that it would cost too much money to 
bring them up to seismic safety standards," Hayden says. "When I ask them at 
least could the patients and their families know that the hospitals are not 
built up to seismic safety codes, they say that would make them hysterical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about hysteria," Hayden adds, "But it makes me very angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Other segments include a train yard in Richmond that was the site of a toxic 
chemical spill, Hayden's own electric car, Folsom state prison, and a state 
university campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden interviews Robbins in a garden at the UCLA campus. Robbins notes that 
his corruption case got great notoriety but says a far more insidious type of 
scandal goes on daily in the Capitol with little fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
 It is commonplace, he says, for a lobbyist to arrange a campaign contribution 
to a legislator on Monday and come back Tuesday to ask for the legislator's 
vote on a bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take very long before the least bright legislator figures out that 
if he keeps ignoring the Tuesday request, then the lobbyist is going to stop 
coming to his fund-raisers," Robbins says. "It's very easy for legislators to 
come to the conclusion that (the lobbyist's) arguments are persuasive." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, at a news conference, said he plans to air the ad constantly in hopes 
of catching the attention of viewers flipping through channels. He said he 
hopes to build some momentum that would make him competitive with fellow 
Democrats Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi by 
the time the three debate later this month.

JUDGE DELIVERS SETBACK TO NUCLEAR DUMP; ENVIRONMENT: RULING SAYS STATE HAS 
FAILED TO ANSWER RADIOACTIVE LEAKAGE QUESTION. ACTION SUSPENDS LICENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a significant setback to California's efforts to build a low-level nuclear 
waste dump in the Mojave Desert, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled 
Wednesday that the state has not adequately addressed scientific arguments that 
radioactive material could leak into the nearby Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides in the case agreed that the ruling by Judge Robert H. O'Brien 
effectively suspends the license to operate the proposed Ward Valley dump. That 
license was issued last year to US Ecology Inc., a firm that runs several other 
waste dumps around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's nine-page opinion dismissed most of the objections raised by 
opponents in their lawsuit challenging the license. The opponents had argued 
that the state failed to measure the impact of a dump not only on the river but 
also on wildlife habitat and misled the public on the amount of highly toxic 
plutonium that would be buried there. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Brien made it clear that the state needs to provide more answers on the 
issue of radioactive leaks into the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "The questions of most concern to all parties and the public generally are: 
Will the Colorado River be contaminated?" O'Brien wrote. "Is it threatened to 
be contaminated? Is it possible it will be contaminated?" 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the questions raised in a controversial document known as the 
Wilshire Report which Ward Valley opponents claim that state and federal 
officials tried to quash when it was released last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by Howard Wilshire, a U.S. Department of Interior scientist, and 
two colleagues says the geology surrounding Ward Valley would allow 
contaminated water leaking from the facility to make its way to the Colorado by 
one of several pathways. The river is about 20 miles from the proposed dump 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge found that the California Department of Health Services, the agency 
responsible for licensing Ward Valley, had not given the report adequate 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not appear that the analysis therein has been placed in a proper 
perspective, so that an objective person can properly evaluate it with the 
overall concerns and issues," O'Brien wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to the extraordinary importance of what is at stake here, e.g. 
radioactive waste and drinking water . . . the analysis of the Wilshire Report 
should be placed side by side, in its complete form, with the counter-analysis 
before any approval." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien was ruling on a lawsuit brought by four groups, including the Ft. 
Mojave Indians, whose land is located near the proposed dump, Physicians for 
Social Responsibility, the Southern California Federation of Scientists and 
Committee to Bridge the Gap, a nonprofit, anti-nuclear organization that has 
spearheaded the campaign against Ward Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Carrick, the lawyer for the groups, hailed the judge's ruling as "a 
courageous decision that cut to the heart of the issue at Ward Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the state must prepare a rebuttal to the Wilshire Report that satisfies 
O'Brien and puts the Ward Valley approval process back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what O'Brien is really looking for is something that both he, the 
judge, and the public can understand," said Peter Baldridge, a staff attorney 
for the Health Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldridge suggested that the job could be time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
 "First we need to decide what is the best way to approach it. We are going to 
want to provide him with a good explanation. That's not going to be difficult 
to do, but it's going to take some time," Baldridge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Lytz, the lawyer for US Ecology, said the judge's ruling could delay 
legal approval of the project by many months. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if O'Brien gives his approval to the environmental assessment, opening of 
the dump is far from certain. The proposed dump site is owned by the federal 
government and it must agree to transfer it to the state before the dump can be 
built. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has pledged to hold a hearing to 
resolve any unanswered safety questions before agreeing to the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Consisting of several unlined trenches, the dump would accept radioactive 
waste from nuclear power plants as well as hospitals and biomedical firms.

CASINO OWNER'S DAUGHTER TESTIFIES ABOUT KIDNAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. LA GANGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a rare public glimpse of the vulnerable side of this city's wealthy 
gambling Establishment, the daughter of casino mogul Steven A. Wynn testified 
Wednesday that kidnapers photographed her in her underwear and threatened to 
distribute the pictures nationally if her father contacted police instead of 
paying her ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Wynn, 27, described being grabbed in her kitchen by two masked men last 
July, blindfolded, posed and photographed with a tall assailant whom she could 
not see. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shorter one said, 'You are my insurance,' " Wynn testified, visibly 
shaken. "I thought I'd take off my clothes, and I'd be raped. I said, 'Please 
don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me.' . . . I was shaking. I was petrified." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Marion Cuddy, 48, and Jacob Sherwood, 22, are charged with extortion and 
money laundering in the July 26 assault, whose aftermath has riveted Las Vegas' 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But in federal court Wednesday, Sherwood's attorney said that Irvine real 
estate agent Spyro Kemble, 37, not Sherwood, was involved in the attack on 
Nevada's wealthiest family. Kemble did not return telephone calls seeking 
comment, but his father disputed the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "This implication of Spyro's complicity is just (bull)," said Donn Kemble, a 
Newport Beach attorney. Cuddy is a longtime family friend of the Kembles, and 
owed Spyro $20,000. "Spyro was as surprised about this as I was. Spyro was not 
an accomplice to anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is unfolding in America's flashiest city, a gambling mecca 
beleaguered by mounting casino holdups -- 10 increasingly brazen attacks in the 
last two years, two within 48 hours of each other less than two weeks ago. Los 
Angeles gang members are suspects in half of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Jittery casino owners met last week with police and gambling authorities and 
are fortifying their cash-rich operations and evaluating just how to keep the 
increasing violence at bay -- a process that began nine months earlier at 
properties owned by Mirage Resorts, the sprawling company headed by Steven 
Wynn. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Las Vegas saw a remarkable side of the imposing and take-charge 
chief executive, who was rated by Fortune magazine in 1993 as the top-paid 
chief executive in the nation. In a shaking voice, Wynn described what it was 
like to get the phone call informing him that his daughter, his "particularly 
close buddy," was in mortal danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was frightened beyond description and very confused," Wynn said. "Your 
brain is jumbled. Your brain doesn't function. I knew I needed help. I felt if 
I used my cellular phone (to call for help), they could hear me and it would 
mean her death." 
</P>
<P>
 On July 26, after a normal day's work in the retail operations of Mirage 
Resorts, Kevin Wynn worked out at the Mirage Hotel gym and dined with her 
family. She walked into her home at 10 p.m. and was grabbed by two masked men 
who had been waiting for her. 
</P>
<P>
 The men covered her eyes with cotton balls and tape and forced her to strip 
down to her panties, according to testimony Wednesday. They placed dark 
sunglasses over her blindfold so that she would appear in the pictures as a 
willing participant. They posed her several times with the taller of the two 
suspects in the dining alcove of her condominium and threatened to make the 
photographs public if the authorities were called. 
</P>
<P>
 They called her father, who had just pulled into the driveway of his home. In 
eerie detail, Wynn described how he returned to the Mirage Hotel and Casino, 
where, standing in the middle of a bustling gambling hall, he took ransom 
instructions by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling himself Voss, one of the kidnapers demanded $2.5 million, at which 
point Wynn became angry and argued about how much cash the casino kept in its 
vault -- $1.45 million in $100 bills on that particular night -- and how he 
could get access to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was new money stacked there like bricks," he said of the white plastic bag 
he was eventually given in full sight of the casino guests. "It was very dense. 
It was heavy. . . . I held it like a baby with my arms around it" and walked 
through the hotel to his car. 
</P>
<P>
 After the ransom was delivered, Steven Wynn was given directions on how to 
find his daughter in the parking lot at McCarran International Airport, where 
she was left unharmed after midnight in her black, late-model Audi. 
</P>
<P>
 Two friends had met him there in a separate car, but he insisted on going up 
to Kevin's Audi alone. "Whatever I was going to find in the car, it was going 
to be me doing it," he said. "But after three steps, I couldn't do it. I was so 
mortified. I called her name. 'Kevin.' From the back seat of the car, she said, 
'Dad, is that really you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Cuddy, the alleged mastermind of the kidnaping, is a former circus 
performer, black jack dealer and Newport Beach and Las Vegas health club 
manager with a hankering for fancy sports cars. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 27, the day after the kidnaping, Cuddy, returned to California to 
"take his place among the rich and famous of Newport Beach," said Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Tom O'Connell in his opening statement Wednesday. Cuddy was arrested 
there Aug. 2 while arranging the final cash payment for a Ferrari Testarosa, 
with a price tag of nearly $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Spyro Kemble was not there during the arrest, he had gone with Cuddy 
earlier to purchase the wedge-shaped white car, Dan Albregts, Sherwood's 
attorney, said in his opening statement. In addition, $500,000 of the ransom 
money was found in the garage of Kemble's Newport Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble was never arrested in the case and is expected to testify for the 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Paul Watkins, 20, an accomplice in the kidnaping, has pleaded guilty 
to extortion and is expected to testify as the trial continues over the next 
two weeks.

U.S. DECIDES TO REINTRODUCE GRAY WOLVES TO ROCKIES; CONSERVATION: ANIMALS WILL 
RUN WILD IN YELLOWSTONE AND OTHER WILDERNESS AREAS. SOME RANCHERS WORRY ABOUT 
DANGER TO LIVESTOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Interior Department, ending two decades of passionate debate, said 
Wednesday that it plans to restore the elusive gray wolf to its former habitat 
in the northern Rocky Mountain West, after an absence of more than 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, packs of the gray wolves -- predators both demonized and 
venerated in Western and Native American lore -- would run wild and hunt freely 
through parts of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, including Yellowstone National 
Park, as early as this summer. The wolves could establish themselves as a 
vibrant population within eight years, experts said, allowing the federal 
government to withdraw protections for the endangered species by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, contained in a final environmental impact statement 608 pages 
long, has provoked anguished opposition from ranchers throughout the 
45,000-square-mile area into which wolves from western Canada would be 
transplanted. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials from the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service said 
the recommended action would give western ranchers substantial rights to 
protect their cattle and sheep from wolves that might prey on livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 After 30 days, the Clinton Administration will decide whether it will accept 
the Fish and Wildlife Service's recommendation. Senior Interior Department 
officials signaled that they plan to adopt the hard-fought compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan "responds to the call of the wild, but it also responds to the 
concerns of ranchers and state and tribal officials," said George T. Frampton 
Jr., assistant secretary of the interior. "This comes with the weight of a lot 
of consensus." 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt also sought to placate ranchers. He noted 
that the proposal to restore the gray wolf to the Yellowstone area on an 
experimental basis would give ranchers greater protections from wolves than 
ranchers would have if the animals were permitted to re-establish themselves 
naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 Small numbers of wolves are beginning to filter into the northern Rockies on 
their own. Their status as an endangered species makes it illegal for ranchers 
to harass or kill them, even if the wolves are threatening their livestock. The 
experimental reintroduction proposed Wednesday would allow the harassment of 
any wolves loitering in settled areas and the killing of wolves that attack 
sheep or cattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The gray wolf, which officials called "a very resilient, mobile and 
high-impact carnivore," has been viewed as a threat to livestock, pets and 
people and has been hunted aggressively ever since the West was settled by 
Europeans. By the mid-1920s, the wolf population had been virtually eliminated 
from the Yellowstone area, its disappearance hastened in part by a national 
program to eradicate predators on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
 The result has been a disruption of the natural balance of predators and prey 
throughout the northern Rocky Mountains area, resulting in the substantial 
growth of such species as elk and deer. Several species, including bison and 
bighorn sheep, have been reintroduced to the Yellowstone area. Only wolves 
remain largely absent from the original Yellowstone ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wolf is the missing link there," said Sandy McIntyre of the Wilderness 
Society. "Reintroducing the wolf would work to bring the system a bit more back 
in balance. And at a deeper level, it would be a case in which humankind has 
been able to replace some piece of the puzzle we took out decades ago -- to 
restore something we did wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 That is an objective that polls show is heavily favored by Americans. In Idaho 
and Montana, majorities of those polled favored the reintroduction of the gray 
wolf. In Wyoming, more were in favor than opposed. A 1985 poll of visitors to 
Yellowstone National Park showed that three of four respondents supported 
bringing back wolves. 
</P>
<P>
 Although conservation groups have been active in pressing for the return of 
the gray wolf, they expressed disappointment in the final recommendation of the 
Fish and Wildlife Service. Environmental activists were critical of what they 
called the absence of strong protections for wolves. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, conservationists complained that the recommendation does not 
include strict prohibitions against the harassment of wolves in denning areas 
during the months immediately after wolves are born. They objected to 
provisions permitting ranchers operating on public lands -- such as national 
forest land used to graze cattle -- to shoot and kill wolves in any area where 
six mating pairs had become established. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fear they'll become a national sacrificial animal unless they've got some 
decent protection," said Brian Peck of the Audubon Society's Boulder, Colo., 
office. "Ranchers have plenty of benefits already without being allowed to 
shoot wolves on public lands in addition." 
</P>
<P>
 But ranchers countered that the plan saddles them with the cost of carrying 
out an experiment demanded by national conservationists, offering them 
inadequate protection and no government compensation if their herds are 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 720,000 sheep and cattle graze in the areas to which the gray wolf 
would be restored, and the Interior Department has estimated that wolves could 
hunt down and kill 156 such animals per year. Currently, a privately funded 
conservation group, Defenders of Wildlife, offers ranchers compensation for 
such losses and Interior Department officials said they are counting on that 
program continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 William Myers, director of federal lands programs for the National Cattlemen's 
Assn., called the Interior Department's estimate of livestock killing "patently 
absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 "Wolves are very intelligent and efficient predators -- we all agree on that 
-- and livestock are easy pickings for them," Myers said.

U.N. MAY BE TARGET IN RWANDAN ARTILLERY BATTLES

 Troops of Rwanda's rival tribal groups battled in the capital with artillery 
Wednesday, and the United Nations voiced fears that renegade government 
soldiers were purposely firing at U.N. compounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortar rounds blasted the airport, severely wounding a U.N. soldier from 
Ghana, and shells also fell outside U.N. headquarters in the city center, U.N. 
spokesman Abdul Kabia said by telephone from Kigali, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations has already reduced its peacekeeping force from 2,500 to 
fewer than 500 soldiers because of fighting that international aid workers 
estimate has killed up to 200,000 Rwandans. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, a congressional panel was told Wednesday that a Rwandan radio 
station is encouraging slaughter of all members of the minority Tutsi tribe. 
The disclosure prompted a shouting match between the Rwandan ambassador and 
Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.). 
</P>
<P>
 Burton told Rwandan Ambassador Aloys Uwimana, who was in the hearing room, 
that "if there is a grain of truth" in the allegation about the radio station, 
"your government will go down in the annals of history right alongside Idi 
Amin." Amin was a Ugandan leader who was much criticized for human rights 
abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 When the hearing broke, Uwimana followed Burton into the hallway, and the two 
engaged in a finger-jabbing argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a high-level U.S. delegation was headed for Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 
on Wednesday for talks regarding Rwanda with African leaders, the State 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda has been enmeshed in violence since a mysterious April 6 plane crash 
that killed the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, both members of the Hutu 
majority that held power in Rwanda. Government troops and civilian militias 
launched a killing spree against political opponents, Tutsis and U.N. 
peacekeepers.

POLITICS; SHAD AND SENATE CANDIDATES BOTH FEELING THE HEAT IN VIRGINIA; STATE'S 
CONTENTIOUS SLATE CONVERGES ON BIPARTISAN FISH COOKOUT. THE VOTERS SMELL 
DESPERATION CAMPAIGNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Even before the crowd started gathering for last month's shad planking -- 
Virginia's most celebrated bipartisan political ritual -- it was clear that 
this year's edition of the customarily convivial cookout was not going to be 
any love feast. 
</P>
<P>
 Not with the 1994 contest for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Democrat 
Charles S. Robb threatening to rend both political parties asunder and send a 
warning to nervous Democratic and Republican leaders around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The star attraction at the festival here was Iran-Contra protagonist Oliver L. 
North, who has sharply divided the GOP by his front-running bid for its Senate 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John W. Warner, Virginia's highest-ranking Republican officeholder and 
the main speaker here, has warned that he will support an independent candidate 
if, at its June 4 convention, the GOP nominates North -- who was convicted of 
aiding and abetting the obstruction of Congress' investigation of the 
Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Democratic side, incumbent Robb has been so damaged by allegations of 
extramarital dalliances and attendance at cocaine parties that he faces a stiff 
primary challenge in his bid for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 And he knows that if he wins the party's June 14 primary, former Democratic 
Gov. L. Douglas Wilder is already positioning himself to oppose Robb as an 
independent candidate in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Illustrating the dissatisfaction with both front-runners, a poll of 610 likely 
voters by the local polling firm of Cooper & Secrest showed that about twice as 
many people expressed negative opinions as positive opinions about both Robb 
and North. 
</P>
<P>
 The turmoil in the Old Dominion reflects the widespread discontent around the 
country with politics and with the two major parties. This was signaled by the 
19% vote for Ross Perot's 1992 presidential candidacy, the biggest share of the 
electorate to back any third-party candidate since ex-President Theodore 
Roosevelt ran on the Bull Moose ticket in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's another example of the two parties' being out of touch," said University 
of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato. "A lot of voters are saying, 
'We're mad as hell and we're not going to take it any more.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Virginia is at an advanced stage of what's going on in politics throughout 
the country," said Benjamin Ginsberg, Johns Hopkins University specialist in 
elections and political parties. "Parties mean less and less, and each 
so-called party is breaking up into various wings." 
</P>
<P>
 The shad planking is not what it used to be. Conceived about 50 years ago as a 
beer bust for good ol' boy Democrats, it has expanded in recent years to take 
in women, blacks and, finally, even Republicans. Over time, some say, the event 
has also surrendered some of its folksy charm. At a planking, shad are nailed 
to boards and cooked over smoky trench fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mostly now you got politicians, lobbyists and reporters looking behind each 
other and trying to find some old guy in bib overalls to interview," said 
Robb's campaign press secretary, Bert Rohrer. 
</P>
<P>
 Old-timers grumbled that even the shad is no longer quite the same. The oily, 
bony fish that once flourished in local waters now must be imported from 
Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
 But a more serious complaint among the 4,000 who were here concerned the 
erosion of political stability. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot more commotion and controversy than we used to have in the old 
days," said Nelson Jarrett, a retired engineer and political buff from 
Richmond. "Apparently morality and ethics aren't what they used to be. And the 
political parties haven't produced like they did before." 
</P>
<P>
 Some characteristics of the Virginia Senate campaign reflect complaints with 
the political process everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the emergence of powerful interest groups on both the left and the 
right that are accused of using the political process to advance their agendas. 
In the Republican contest, many feel that the religious right has provided the 
core of support for North. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are tired of the same old thing," said GOP state chairman Patrick 
McSweeney, who has remained neutral in the contest. "They really do believe in 
their frustration that this kind of politician (North) can make things change. 
They want someone who will not be sucked into the vortex." 
</P>
<P>
 North's aides say he has lined up about 60% of the delegates to the convention 
-- leaving his chief rival, James Miller, former budget director for President 
Ronald Reagan, only 25%. The rest are undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller says the contest is closer than that. He points out that his 
differences with North on issues are few, and he is basing his hopes on the 
argument that he has a better chance of beating the Democrats in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't take the chance of losing the Senate seat," Miller told the crowd at 
the GOP reception. "We have to go with the conservative who can win." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's aides distributed copies of the Cooper & Secrest poll results showing 
him defeating Robb while North would lose. They also handed out copies of a 
letter from Reagan saying he was "getting pretty steamed" by North's statements 
about Iran-Contra. 
</P>
<P>
 North, a member of Reagan's National Security Council staff, has always 
claimed he was acting on orders from higher-ups in directing secret arms sales 
to Iran and diverting the profits to the anti-leftist Contra guerrillas in 
Nicaragua. "I never instructed him (North) to mislead Congress on Iran-Contra 
matters or anything else," Reagan wrote in a letter made public by foes of 
North. 
</P>
<P>
 North has acknowledged that he hid the truth from congressional investigators 
who first questioned him in 1986 about reports that he was secretly assisting 
the Nicaraguan rebels. His conviction was later overturned on technical 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Another zinger at North came from Warner, who in delivering the featured 
address at the shad planking contended that voters would choose "integrity" 
over "party" if given the choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner and other Republicans who oppose North are already planning to raise 
money and gather signatures to put an independent Republican candidate on the 
ballot in November to oppose North. Their likely choice is J. Marshall Coleman, 
the GOP's defeated nominee for governor in 1981 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile on the Democrat side, Robb has benefited from his incumbency, 
another trait of the party system that at times appears to frustrate the 
majority of voters. Critics claim that the special advantages of fund raising 
and string pulling that go with Robb's Senate seat discouraged most potentially 
formidable opponents from challenging him. 
</P>
<P>
 His only opponent for the nomination to hold public office is Virgil Goode, a 
state senator from southern Virginia who is little known outside his own 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 Robb has been plagued not only by allegations of sexual improprieties and drug 
parties but also a 19-month grand jury probe of his involvement in the tapping 
of phone conversations of Wilder, with whom he was feuding. 
</P>
<P>
 Robb was not indicted, but the electronic eavesdropping episode seems to have 
wrecked any prospect of healing his relationship with Wilder. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sat next to each other on the flatbed truck from which Warner 
delivered his oration here, stone-faced until Warner asked the crowd, "Why 
aren't they smiling at each other?" a comment that drew laughs from them both. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people have called me to say we need people to fight for our state," 
Wilder said in an interview, explaining his interest in running. "They are very 
concerned, and I am too. We fought for our state to be a symbol of progress, 
not to be a mark of derision."

MIDEAST BREAKTHROUGH; MAPS GIVE LATITUDE FOR DISCORD AS SIGNING ALMOST COMES A 
CROPPER; CEREMONY: AS WORLD WATCHES, MEN ON STAGE BICKER AND HUDDLE. FINALLY, 
ISRAEL AND PLO SIGN -- AND THEN SOME. 
</P>

<P>
 The historic Palestinian-Israeli signing here was almost the deal that wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama unfolded on the stage of the cavernous International Conference 
Center when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin started to sign the six maps 
of Gaza and Jericho in a separate light blue folder but noticed that Palestine 
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat's signature was missing from the 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
 So Rabin didn't sign them either. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next 45 minutes -- as the whole world watched -- the pact looked 
almost as if it would fall apart with the eight men on stage bickering, 
debating and huddling. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahmoud Abbas, the chief Palestinian mediator who is also known as Abu Maazen, 
and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev continued their congratulatory 
speeches to the audience of 2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 But most eyes were fixed center-stage, where Arafat gesticulated angrily, his 
hand cutting through the air indicating he would not budge, as Rabin turned 
brighter and brighter shades of red. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides were summoned on stage. Documents were checked and consulted, pages 
taken to the signatories. But Arafat only grew more adamant and Rabin redder. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem turned out to be the six maps. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli-PLO negotiations had concluded at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday -- little 
more than eight hours before the signing ceremony began. And while the 
agreement was reached in the wee hours, the final documents for Wednesday's 
ceremonies were not finished by an American drafting team until after 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The early morning talks had ended with an agreement that the final size of 
Jericho would be left open for discussion, along with the issues of the 
Palestinian role at the Allenby Bridge to Jordan and the Rafah crossing between 
the Gaza Strip and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat didn't want to sign maps that he thought were final. Because of their 
production schedules, he also had not seen the color-coded maps of various 
zones in the two areas. "Since he hadn't had a chance to see the maps, he 
feared that if he signed, he would preempt" discussion of them, explained a 
senior U.S. official involved in the last-minute crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Marwan Kanafani, Arafat's press adviser, explained: "He didn't like the idea 
of signing a map without knowing and discussing it. . . . We know the area, we 
think it's known, but signing the maps is a very complicated issue. It has to 
be discussed and measured." 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis said they had pledged to have continuing discussions; they said 
that Arafat was just posturing to reopen negotiations. Arafat countered that he 
did not need to sign something that was not in final form. "There was a very 
good chance that you would not have concluded" the accord on the day it was 
scheduled to be signed, the American official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis were so close to leaving the conference hall, American officials 
said, that their motorcade was brought around to the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, after consulting with his chief 
Mideast mediator, Dennis Ross, suggested a recess. The men walked off stage. In 
the end, the crisis was resolved in less than five minutes. Offstage, Rabin 
offered to write a letter guaranteeing that the maps would still be open for 
discussion. Arafat agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The dignitaries then piled back on stage and watched what quickly became known 
as the "second signing." 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, Arafat did more than just put his name on the disputed papers, 
Kanafani said. He said the PLO chairman wrote in: "Approval of these maps are 
pending, to be negotiated." 
</P>
<P>
 That prompted a second series of scowls from Rabin. He insisted on having 
Arafat's scrawl translated and read to him. But he still signed the maps. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole world got to watch what has often gone on in the negotiations 
themselves. It's been the most incredible negotiation anyone has ever been 
involved in," said the American official, who has been a key player in the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, at a news conference after the ceremony, said he had insisted all along 
that the 25-square-mile area of Jericho reflected in the agreement, although 
subject to further discussions, was what was being agreed to, including in the 
maps. "I made it clear that unless the maps will be signed, there will be no 
agreement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he agreed to send a letter affirming that there will be continuing 
discussions on the Jericho issue, as well as the question of a Palestinian 
border guard on the bridge between Jordan and the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's accord totals 186 pages, which, he said, "demonstrates the level 
of detail that has gone into that process. It has been a difficult one. If 
there hadn't been a deadline, you would have seen the discussion go on and on 
as more details emerged." 
</P>
<P>
 Although negotiators were down to just seven unresolved issues a few days 
before the signing, the list had grown to 24 items on the eve of the signing. 
</P>
<P>
 American mediators, who had drawn up the negotiating agenda based on 
Christopher's trip here last week, said that early Wednesday mediators were 
even debating whether to refer to driver's license or driving license for 
documents in the new Palestinian entity. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened at the end is symptomatic of what has been going on in an 
unbelievably complex discussion" on political, economic and security issues, 
the American official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all involved were concerned, the American official said there was 
little doubt that the deal would have eventually been signed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have negotiated (186) pages of a very complex text, the maps were an 
issue that would be settled," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tension was really broken when Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres 
took to the microphone to give his speech. "Once we had a dream before we had a 
map," he said. "Now we have a map and a dream together."

MIDEAST BREAKTHROUGH; AFTER SIGNING, CYNICISM, BITTERNESS PERSIST; REACTION: 
'LET THE LAST SOLDIER LEAVE . . . AND THE LAST PRISONER BECOME FREE, AND YOU 
WILL SEE THIS CELEBRATION,' ONE PALESTINIAN SAYS.

<P>
 Within minutes of Wednesday's historic signing ceremony in Cairo officially 
liberating his land, Akil abu Shammala left his television set and took to the 
streets here. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not in celebration or in protest that he joined hundreds of fellow 
Gazans outside the barbed wire of the city's central jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Shammala, 41, a former English teacher, spent hours in the afternoon sun at 
Israel's military headquarters to wait for something far more concrete, 
profound and personal: He came for his older brother. 
</P>
<P>
 After nine years of an imprisonment that was emblematic of Israel's 27 years 
of military occupation in this impoverished, desperate strip of land, Faiz abu 
Shammala, 44, was among the hundreds of Palestinian prisoners released 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the first of the 5,000 Palestinians whom Israel promised to free in 
the three weeks after Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation 
Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat signed an accord on Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even that was not enough for Shammala and hundreds of thousands of other 
Gazans to rejoice about. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can we celebrate in Gaza when we still see the Israeli jails full of 
prisoners, when we still see the Gaza Strip full of Israeli soldiers?" Shammala 
asked. "Let the last soldier leave Gaza and the last prisoner become free, and 
you will see this celebration." 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the mood of cynical anticipation and enduring frustration in this, 
the land that Wednesday's agreement frees for a future as uncertain as its 
present. For most Gazans, who took little more than a passing interest in the 
drama in Cairo, Wednesday's events were just another in a series of ceremonies 
and signings that have brought few tangible changes here. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the estimated 850,000 residents of the Gaza Strip probably followed 
the signing ceremony on television or radio. Immediately afterward, there were 
isolated, apparently orchestrated, Palestinian celebrations -- and protests 
too: 
</P>
<P>
 * At another entrance to the Gaza City central jail, battle-weary Israeli 
soldiers in full combat gear endured -- with impressive restraint -- hours of 
taunts from Palestinian children as dozens of PLO supporters honked horns, 
waved flags and chanted slogans of victory. A 70-year-old woman, Umm Hassan 
Zwaid, whose two sons remain in prison, mounted the hood of a battered Peugeot, 
holding a huge Palestinian flag in each hand, and wailed with joy before a 
dozen television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Jericho, Israeli soldiers dragged hundreds of Jewish settlers away from 
an ancient synagogue where, in defiance of army orders, they had staged a 
prayer vigil against the autonomy accord, the Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In the city's market, a festive mood turned sour when some teen-age boys 
pelted the police station with bottles and stones until a car with a big 
Palestinian flag and yellow police siren drove through. 
</P>
<P>
 Fatah leader Bassam Khatib jumped out to stop the violence. "You are not doing 
us any service," he admonished. 
</P>
<P>
 * At the Rafah border crossing from Egypt, at the southernmost point of the 
Gaza Strip, a handful of buses festooned with banners proclaiming "Welcome! 
Welcome our heroes, home to our soil!" greeted the first 19 Palestinian police 
commanders. The senior PLO police officials arrived in Gaza dressed in business 
suits as the signing ceremony took place to lay the groundwork for a vanguard 
Palestinian force of 1,500 expected here within the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are ready to start now," declared Ghazi Jabali, 40, the major general in 
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Army who was identified as the leader of the 
arriving police commanders. "Definitely we will succeed, because we are among 
our people. If we come even with only the clothes on our back, the people will 
accept us. We are not an occupation force. We are not a colonizing force." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the simple shops and cafes, the squalid refugee camps, the few modest 
homes and luxury villas and the cavernous streets that make up the Gaza Strip 
today, Jabali and his future commanders also are a largely unknown force. Few 
took note of their arrival. And, as the new Palestinian police spent most of 
the day with the soon-to-depart Israeli forces, most Gazans echoed the 
sentiments of skeptics such as Shammala. 
</P>
<P>
 This, after all, was still a land under occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli military camps still bristled with heavily armed soldiers. Guard 
towers were manned with heavy machine guns. Long lines of Palestinians still 
formed outside the headquarters of Israel's Civil Administration, the military 
authority that controls everything from driver's licenses and electricity bills 
to garbage collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout this trash-strewn area, there were the usual military roadblocks, 
foot patrols and armed convoys. The Israeli army still controlled the borders, 
and its longstanding 8 p.m. curfew for all was still in force. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian opposition also continued. Even as the autonomy accord was 
signed, the fundamentalist Islamic resistance group known as Hamas deployed 
masked men throughout the Gaza Strip to scribble graffiti claiming 
responsibility for the most recent attack on an Israeli patrol that left three 
soldiers wounded Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Their spray-painted work proclaimed: "The Cairo agreement represents the peak 
of mockery, concession and shame and disgraces those who are selling the 
homeland. The rights of our people are not to be bargained away." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Khuzendar Restaurant, Gaza City's most popular breakfast spot, a small 
television carried the Cairo ceremony. Many of the diners spoke of how Arafat 
had settled for too little in the agreement. For others, the agreement was a 
good start -- but only that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, they're signing. Everybody is signing. (But) it's not going to affect 
my life," observed Abed abu Tibi, 24, a baker who said he spent six months in 
detention in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Wael Saleh Nimr, 31, a prominent auto-parts dealer, stayed just long enough 
for a plate of hummus and left before the signing ended. "Look, for our society 
and the conditions we live under now, we just don't feel it's a very important 
event," he explained. "We hear that billions of dollars are going to come in 
here, but we see nothing. We don't feel anything concrete that is real and 
alive. All we see are formalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, everybody here is watching this today," he said. "But . . . if there 
was an important soccer match on, they would all be watching it. Me? I'm going 
to work. Make some money. It's better than this nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jabara abu Thabet, another diner and a real estate broker from the town of 
Khan Yunis, disagreed. "Undoubtedly, this is a turning point in our history, 
and they will be teaching about this day for generations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Gaza City's central jail, Shammala -- who works as a district relief 
officer for the U.N. agency that looks after Gaza's hundreds of thousands of 
refugees -- was not so certain. He felt Wednesday's ceremony was, in itself, 
hardly encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 He was struck by the hitch that delayed the signing when, on global 
television, Rabin and Arafat openly disagreed on maps drawn to depict the 
future Palestinian enclave in Jericho. "Today, as I watched, I felt that if Mr. 
Rabin is arguing here in front of the world about a few kilometers of land in 
Jericho, to get the Israelis to withdraw from all of the West Bank will take us 
another 40 years," he said. "We cannot wait generations for this, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Shammala worries most about his generation -- his brother and how he 
will readjust after nine years in Israeli prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 "How to rehabilitate my brother to face his sons -- he has six children -- how 
to face the streets. These are immediate concerns," he said. "And the PLO has 
taken no steps for this. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the realities of Gaza right now. So, you tell me, how can there be 
celebration in such a time?"

 Israeli and PLO negotiators set aside three issues for further talks after the 
signing of an accord for limited Palestinian self-rule: 
</P>
<P>
 PRISONERS: Israel has agreed to free 5,000 of the estimated 8,400 Palestinians 
it holds in three to four weeks. But Israel has refused to release members of 
the extremist Hamas movement or Palestinians convicted of killing Israelis.A 
compromise could permit release of some prisoners who sign a pledge of support 
for the peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 SIZE OF JERICHO: An impasse on Jericho was broken in talks early Wednesday 
when Israel increased the size of the autonomous Jericho area from 54 square 
kilometers (21.5 square miles) to 62 square kilometers (25 square miles). The 
PLO wants even more and is not fully satisfied with the configuration of the 
autonomous area in Gaza, which excludes Jewish settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 ALLENBY BRIDGE: The PLO had sought to post a uniformed Palestinian guard on 
the bridge linking the West Bank to Jordan. Palestinians want the post as a 
symbol of their authority, but Israel says it would conflict with its retention 
of responsibility for external security. Israel also has rejected the PLO 
demand for a uniformed Palestinian police presence at the Rafah crossing to 
Egypt.

LET HAITIANS SOLVE THEIR CRISIS, U.N. CHIEF URGES; CARIBBEAN: REPORT WAS 
DELAYED FOUR DAYS. OFFICIALS DENY IT CONFLICTS WITH CLINTON CALL FOR MORE 
SANCTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the Clinton Administration proposal for tougher sanctions on Haiti, 
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali issued a pessimistic report 
Wednesday that urged outsiders to take a more passive role and allow Haitians 
to work out a solution to the crisis themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But the report to the U.N. General Assembly, dated Friday and released after a 
delay of four days, was evidently written before the Administration completed a 
review of its Haitian policy and changed course. American diplomats insisted 
that the report did not mean that Boutros-Ghali opposes the new American call 
for intensifying sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Secretariat officials have indicated to us," a U.S. official said, "that it 
was written before and that they have no quarrel with our present sanctions 
resolution." He predicted the Security Council will pass the resolution by the 
beginning of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials also were quick to deny any conflict between the United States 
and Boutros-Ghali over renewed sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The report was written and approved by the secretary general a week ago," 
said Alvaro de Soto, Boutros-Ghali's special adviser for political affairs. "It 
is an update on developments and should not be taken as a policy statement. It 
wasn't intended to be a divergence from anything the Security Council might 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 But the report suggested that the time has come for the international 
community to step back. Boutros-Ghali wrote that, over the months, "the 
international community's role changed gradually from that of mediator between 
parties to that of sole agent responsible for finding and implementing a 
solution to the deadlock." 
</P>
<P>
 "This new role for the international community is prejudicial," he wrote. 
"Some see it as compromising the international community's neutrality and thus 
weakening its ability to instill confidence and lead the parties to a vital 
compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of negotiating and compromising, he said, parties in the conflict are 
looking "to the representatives of the international community for a solution 
that should not be inherently dependent on them." 
</P>
<P>
 He recommended that "a more specifically Haitian solution be found" with the 
two parties, supported by the United Nations, resuming "an effective role in 
this process." 
</P>
<P>
 But the American official said the Boutros-Ghali report reflected a theory, 
discarded by the Administration only a week ago, that the best tactic for 
ending the Haiti crisis was pressure on deposed President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide to compromise with the military and police officers who overthrew him. 
</P>
<P>
 In its new strategy, the Administration has decided to transfer pressure to 
the military and police commanders, demanding that they resign and allow the 
return of Aristide to Haiti and the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior American officials said Clinton has asked aides to suggest concrete 
options for use of U.S. military power in Haiti, although he still believes 
stepped-up economic sanctions can force the military regime there to step down 
without any use of force. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials maintain that Clinton's warning on Tuesday that force is an 
option was more than saber-rattling. "The President is wrestling with that 
question . . . with a very high degree of seriousness," a close aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although contemplating the use of military power, the aide went on, Clinton 
does not believe he would have to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 In his report, Boutros-Ghali, proposing a year's extension for deployment of 
U.N. human rights observers in Haiti, offered a grim survey of the plight of 
political opponents there. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Port-au-Prince area, he said, "the number of murders remained at an 
alarming level . . . with extrajudicial executions, suspicious deaths and 
enforced disappearances." In some cases, he said, members of the armed forces 
and their associates were the culprits. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali also reported the existence of secret detention centers in the 
Port-au-Prince area and "very large numbers of arbitrary arrests, illegal 
detentions, abductions." He said victims were often handcuffed, blindfolded, 
carted away and beaten before their release "in very poor physical and mental 
condition." 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations believes, he said, "that the aim of these practices is to 
obtain information about the members and activities of popular organizations 
and to terrorize the popular movement in favor of the return of President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide." 
</P>
<P>
 The American-sponsored resolution would impose a near total trade embargo on 
Haiti and prohibit the military and police officers and their families from 
traveling outside the country or using funds now in foreign accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Haiti on Wednesday, the lower house of Parliament introduced a measure to 
bypass Aristide and create an emergency government, the Associated Press 
reported. If approved, the measure would head to a divided Senate, which must 
consider it before lawmakers begin a one-month recess Monday.

DECISION ON CANING DISAPPOINTS WHITE HOUSE; ASIA: CLINTON AIDE SAYS SINGAPORE'S 
REDUCTION OF U.S. TEEN'S SENTENCE IS STILL 'OUT OF STEP' WITH CRIME. YOUTH'S 
MOTHER THINKS FLOGGING IS IMMINENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite a decision by the government here to reduce the flogging sentence 
against an American teen-ager by two lashes as a gesture to President Clinton, 
the White House on Wednesday expressed disapproval, and the youth's mother said 
the punishment is still torture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed," White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said after the 
Singaporean decision to proceed with the caning of Michael P. Fay, 18, who 
entered a guilty plea to spray-painting cars in March, touching off a worldwide 
controversy about vandalism and appropriate punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers noted that Clinton had sent a letter appealing for the caning sentence 
to be commuted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the punishment is out of step with the crime. We believe that the 
government knows our position on that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Chan, Fay's mother, said she expects the sentence of four strokes of the 
rattan cane may now be carried out immediately after the government decision to 
reject her son's clemency appeal. She said that even with the reduction, she 
found the punishment excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's torture at six strokes, and it's torture at four strokes," Chan said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a mother," she added, "I'm grateful for the reduction in the punishment. 
But that doesn't alter the fact that the punishment is excessive or that 
Michael was coerced into confessing to a crime he did not commit." 
</P>
<P>
 Fay, a senior at the $10,000-a-year Singapore American School at the time of 
his arrest last year, had been sentenced to receive six strokes of a four-foot 
rattan cane after pleading guilty in March to vandalism, mischief and 
possessing stolen property. He also received a four-month jail term, which he 
began serving March 31, and a $2,230 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 After saying for two months that the government would not intervene in the 
judicial process in the Fay case, the Singapore Cabinet on Wednesday shifted 
course and ordered President Ong Teng Cheong to reduce the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Western diplomats said it was the first time they could recall the government 
ever accepting a clemency appeal, even partially. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect was to create a "lose-lose situation," said one diplomat, noting 
that critics will still deride the government for excessive punishment while 
supporters will be disenchanted by the government's apparent concession to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The government said in a statement that it tried to accommodate Clinton 
because Singapore values its good relations -- economic and military -- with 
the United States, the largest foreign investor here. The U.S. Navy now 
regularly uses permanent facilities in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton had called the caning for Fay extreme and urged the Singaporeans to 
grant clemency. The Singapore government statement said it appreciated 
Clinton's statement that Americans overseas must abide by the laws of foreign 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "To reject his appeal totally would show an unhelpful disregard for the 
President and the domestic pressures on him in this issue," the statement said. 
"Therefore, even though the Cabinet found no merit in Fay's petition, it sought 
a way to accommodate President Clinton's appeal for clemency without 
compromising the principle that persons convicted of vandalism must be caned." 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech on Wednesday morning, Foreign Minister Shunmugan Jayakumar said 
the issue in the Fay case was not caning but whether "a country should not 
respect the right of another country to enact and enforce its laws within its 
jurisdiction, even though one may disagree with that law, so long as such law 
is applied without discrimination and after due process of law." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Fay case, the youth's family has maintained that he was singled out 
because he is American, noting that vandalism laws calling for mandatory caning 
sentences were adopted in the 1960s to fight political graffiti; they were 
never used before in cases of damage to private property. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fay case has become a global cause celebre, the subject of countless talk 
shows and newspaper editorials, as many people in the West vent their 
frustration with crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has given no hint when Fay might be caned, but a statement 
released by the prisons department on Tuesday said that he would be given no 
advance notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's mother said the coincidental timing of the statement with her visit to 
the prison suggested that the punishment is imminent; she noted that she will 
not be able to see her son for another two weeks. With time off for good 
behavior, Fay will be released from jail on June 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan compared her son's plight to a case reported this week in which a 
Singapore man was given three months in jail for burning his 20-month-old son's 
face with a lighted cigarette, incense sticks and a hard-boiled egg. She said 
the case showed that Singapore "attached much less value to human life than a 
manufactured vehicle."

HATA DECRIES DENIAL OF WWII ATROCITIES; JAPAN: NEW CABINET MINISTER HAD CALLED 
MASSACRE OF CHINESE IN NANJING 'A FABRICATION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Wednesday issued a statement from Paris 
rebuking his justice minister for calling the 1937 Rape of Nanjing "a 
fabrication" and denying that Japanese acts in World War II constituted 
"aggression." 
</P>
<P>
 Hata, on a tour of four European nations, said he had not yet contacted 
Shigeto Nagano, whom he named to his Cabinet just last Thursday as his new 
administration took office. 
</P>
<P>
 "But calling the Nanjing Incident a 'fabrication' is not an appropriate 
statement," Hata said. "Acts of aggression and colonial rule by our country 
inflicted upon many people unbearable suffering and sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is important for each Japanese to face history straight-on and share the 
resolve that these acts should not happen a second time," Hata said in a 
statement that was also released here. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagano made the remarks in an interview published Wednesday morning in the 
Mainichi newspaper. "The Nanjing Incident and the rest was a fabrication. I was 
in Nanjing immediately after" Japanese soldiers seized the Chinese city on Dec. 
13, 1937, the Mainichi quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagano, himself a soldier at the time, later became a chief of staff of 
Japan's postwar army, the Ground Self-Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese soldiers killed more than 155,000 people in the six weeks after they 
seized Nanjing (Nanking) in eastern China and raped many women, according to 
the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal conducted by American Occupation authorities 
after World War II. Chinese estimates put the death toll at 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The new justice minister also was reported as saying that "calling that war a 
war of aggression is incorrect. . . . We were seriously thinking about 
liberating colonies and (establishing) the (Greater East Asian) Co-Prosperity 
Sphere." 
</P>
<P>
 The comments were a major embarrassment to Hata, who -- even before joining 
the coalition government established last August -- had urged Japan to 
apologize for its aggression, colonial rule and atrocities before and during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, in his first news conference after 
taking office, flatly denounced Japan's Pacific war as "a war of aggression. . 
. . It was a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 On trips to China and South Korea before he announced April 8 his intention to 
resign, Hosokawa apologized for Japanese aggression against China and for a 
35-year colonial rule of Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's admission of aggression, the first such unqualified declaration by 
any Japanese prime minister, brought protests from veterans groups and the 
Liberal Democratic Party, which lost its 38-year grasp on power last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Yohei Kono, the LDP president, insisted that "not all parts" of the war 
constituted aggression. Later, asked what parts were not aggression, Kono said 
that young Japanese soldiers did not go to war in the belief that they were 
committing aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagano's statements were the latest in a sporadic series of outbursts from 
conservative politicians who have tried to play down Japan's guilt for 
aggression dating back to its 1931 invasion of Manchuria. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers in Seoul prominently reported the remarks. The Dong-A Ilbo said in 
an editorial that the comments showed that "an inclination toward militarism 
still lives in the consciousness of Japanese leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement today that the Beijing government 
was "shocked and indignant," and it urged the Japanese government to deal with 
Nagano's remarks with "an earnest and serious approach . . . to safeguard 
bilateral relations."

DEATH TOLL FROM CYCLONE THAT HIT BANGLADESH RISES TO 167 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rescuers sifting through collapsed homes and twisted forests recovered 37 
bodies Wednesday, raising the death toll from Monday's cyclone to 167, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The death toll could pass 200, they said, as hundreds of people were still 
missing after high winds and heavy rains battered the Bay of Bengal coast and 
offshore islands. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 7,000 people have been injured, many critically, and more than half 
a million made homeless, according to official estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials supervising rescue and relief efforts said more than half of the 
dead were refugees from Myanmar, killed when the storm blew down 16 of their 18 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp officials said food, medicine and other supplies had been washed away or 
damaged by heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The damage is much worse than I expected," said Dan Prewitt, spokesman for 
the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. 
</P>
<P>
 "In effect, the camps are almost completely wiped out," he said Wednesday 
after visiting some of the camps. "But, despite the devastation, loss of life 
in the camps has been low." 
</P>
<P>
 Prewitt praised the government of Bangladesh for its quick relief efforts, 
saying they have been "effectively coordinated with the efforts by 
non-government organizations and aid agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have worked in many countries where there was lack of such coordination," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials said virtually no house was left standing in affected 
villages. Uprooted trees and electrical poles blocked highways, witnesses said.

EUROPEAN UNION PLAN FOR 4 NEW MEMBERS APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The European Parliament on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved European Union 
plans to admit Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden to the 12-nation bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 The "yes" removes one hurdle to EU enlargement and throws the spotlight on the 
four countries, which must gain the backing of their populations in referendums 
whose outcomes are far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
 In the European Parliament, the legislative assembly of the European 
Communities, what had originally promised to be a nail-biting vote turned into 
a massive welcome for the four. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also endorsed plans to extend the EU to 16 members stretching 
northward beyond the Arctic Circle and along Russia's western border. 
</P>
<P>
 Austria and Norway were each approved by a vote of 374 to 24, while Finland 
was approved by 374 to 21 and Sweden by 380 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Parliament to give its assent, 259 members of the 517-member house had 
to vote in favor in each case. 
</P>
<P>
 Parliament President Egon Klepsch told a packed, applauding chamber that the 
vote in favor of extending the EU will increase confidence in the assembly only 
six weeks before its elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a large, warmhearted invitation to join us. It's up to them to decide," 
Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos told a news conference after 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Pangalos forecast that the EU's 12 national parliaments will have no 
difficulty in ratifying the accession deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats have previously expressed doubts that they can all do so by Jan. 1, 
the planned date for enlargement. 
</P>
<P>
 The large "yes" vote came as a surprise after months of threats by members of 
the Strasbourg-based Parliament to veto the enlargement plans unless they went 
side by side with an overhaul of the EU's institutions.

EPA'S GARDEN VARIETY IDEA: REGULATE LAWN EQUIPMENT; ENVIRONMENT: MOWERS, SAWS 
AND OTHER GAS ENGINES ACCOUNT FOR 10% OF NATION'S POLLUTION. NEW RULES SIGNAL 
NEED FOR TIGHTER CONTROLS TO FURTHER CLEAR THE AIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that it will reach 
into the nation's garden sheds to regulate the source of about 10% of air 
pollution: lawn mowers, chain saws, leaf blowers and other garden equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA Administrator Carol Browner, standing on the manicured lawn of the 
Washington Monument in a driving spring rain, said that the federal government 
intends to impose unprecedented national emission standards on all new 
gas-powered garden tools sold in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reducing the emissions from these engines," she told reporters, "will help us 
assure that all Americans have clean, healthy air to breathe." 
</P>
<P>
 Americans own 89 million lawn mowers, garden tractors, chain saws and other 
gas-powered garden and outdoor equipment, according to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowner who indulges in the noisy Saturday morning ritual of mowing his 
lawn for an hour would contribute as much pollution as he would if he drove his 
modern automobile for 11 1/2 hours, the EPA said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that the decision to regulate such small engines is a measure 
of how far regulators now must reach in their efforts to further cut air 
pollution. In addition to Wednesday's announcement, EPA is working on new 
standards for outboard motors. The boat engines can emit as much pollution in 
an hour as 800 miles of driving in a typical automobile. Those regulations are 
to be announced later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting harder and harder to control air pollution," said Dick Wilson, 
director of the Office of Mobile Sources in EPA's air quality bureau. "Despite 
having spent years and years cleaning up factories and cars, we need to keep 
looking at sources that 10 years ago didn't seem that important." 
</P>
<P>
 The government's decision will become final after a lengthy period for public 
comment. It will allow the California Air Resources Board, after several years 
of delay, to enforce similar emission standards throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 The board adopted similar rules in 1990 for "utility engines," including 
gas-powered lawn tools, but chose to delay enforcement until the federal 
government had come up with the same regulations. The purpose was to allow 
manufacturers of lawn equipment to adhere to a single standard for the entire 
U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 Those rules now will go into effect for California consumers in 1995, said 
Bill Sessa, a spokesman for the state board. The rest of the nation will be 
subject to the EPA rules in 1996, with manufacturers required to improve the 
air and fuel mixture used by gas-powered garden equipment to ensure better 
combustion. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA said that the changes would cost buyers $5 more per new lawn mower. By 
the year 2003, when the new engines are expected to power most lawn equipment, 
the changes would reduce carbon monoxide emissions in the atmosphere by 14%, 
the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emissions of hydrocarbons, which contribute both to smog and to the 
accumulation of "greenhouse gases," would fall by 32% under the plan, the EPA 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second phase of the regulatory plan, the agency expects to reconsider 
the existing standards and the availability of new technologies, and possibly 
to propose new standards by 1996. The agency said that potential technologies 
for powering lawn equipment could include catalytic converters, multiple 
circuit carburetors, fuel injection systems and four-stroke overhead valves, as 
well as alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers of lawn equipment responded calmly to the rules. They have been 
partners in negotiating them and have committed tens of millions of dollars to 
developing cleaner engines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really as a company are positioned to support and respond to the final 
rules, whatever they are," said Don St. Dennis, spokesman for The Toro Co. in 
Bloomington, Minn.

'A TO Z' LAWMAKERS PUSH FOR WIDE-OPEN DEBATE ON CUTS; HOUSE: REPS. ANDREWS AND 
ZELIFF WANT TO END THE PANEL SYSTEM ON BUDGET BILLS. THEY WANT A 56-HOUR 
FREE-FOR-ALL DEBATE. SPEAKER FOLEY BLASTS THE IDEA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two House members launched a drive Wednesday to make an end-run around the 
Democratic leadership and give rank-and-file lawmakers a chance to vote on 
wholesale budget cuts from "A to Z." 
</P>
<P>
 The A to Z proposal, which gets its name from its chief sponsors -- 
second-term Reps. Robert E. Andrews (D-N.J.) and Bill Zeliff (R-N.H.) -- would 
allow members to bypass House committees and take their proposed budget cuts, 
including such untouchables as Social Security and Medicare, directly to the 
House floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates said that the idea is to keep the leadership from blocking proposed 
cuts either by bottling them up in hostile committees or by using the rules to 
prevent them from reaching a floor vote. Instead, A to Z backers want a 56-hour 
floor debate created specifically to consider any suggested budget reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and his lieutenants have begun a crash 
campaign to torpedo the plan, arguing that it would unleash a legislative 
free-for-all without adequate hearings or even notice on what programs would be 
targeted for reduction or elimination. Foley said that the plan may be a 
legislative nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 The A to Z proposal is "a very poor way to legislate," Foley told reporters 
recently. "It denies the opportunity for members to have thoughtful 
consideration and review of legislation prior to votes. . . . It could lead to 
quick and preemptory votes on very large issues, including entire bills." 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the process, however, claim that it would offer every member of 
the House a chance to propose cuts in any part of the federal budget. "The A to 
Z plan gives us the opportunity to set aside power politics" and deliver "a 
body blow to big government spending," Zeliff said. 
</P>
<P>
 To succeed, A to Z advocates must get a majority of the House to sign a 
"discharge petition" that would bypass the leadership-dominated Rules 
Committee. The little-used mechanism permits a House majority to insist on 
bringing legislation to the floor over opposition of the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 230 members have agreed to co-sponsor the A to Z proposal, or 13 more 
than the current majority of 217. The House has 435 members but there are two 
vacancies. All but two of the 176 Republicans have co-sponsored the measure, 
along with 56 Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sponsors' problem now is to get them to follow up by signing the 
petition -- an act of direct defiance of the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-sponsor Andrews said that it will not be an easy task in view of opposition 
from the Speaker and possibly from some Republicans on the House Appropriations 
Committee who fear retaliation from the Democratic majority on the panel if 
they endorse the A to Z approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guess is that in the next few days we'll get 150 signatures," Andrews 
said. "The next 30 days are going to be crucial." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he and Zeliff would be appearing on radio talk shows to drum up 
support for their proposal. "If this becomes a grass-roots, in-your-district, 
in-your-face issue, we'll get the signatures." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Foley is meeting with Democrats to offer them a chance to bring 
up budget-cutting bills that they think cannot get a fair hearing in the House. 
He noted that any member can offer amendments to reduce spending when the House 
considers its 13 annual appropriation bills, which account for about one-third 
of all federal outlays, so long as the proposals are germane to the legislation 
being debated. Those amendments would be subject to review by committees. 
</P>
<P>
 "A to Z simply throws away the committee system," Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Speaker said that the procedure also could force House members to vote in 
the dark, even without a word of debate on many proposed amendments, since the 
ground rules would limit debate to 56 hours, with a maximum of one hour on each 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is the most poorly thought out proposal for the consideration of 
public policy that I have seen in many years, and maybe the worst one ever in 
terms of consideration by the House," Foley added. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Speaker's objections, Democratic aides voiced concern that the A 
to Z plan had a simplistic appeal that might be hard to resist in an election 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "A to Z is untraditional," acknowledged Rep. Cass Ballenger (R-N.C.), a 
supporter of the plan. "But we have all seen where traditional methods take us: 
straight into debt."

TWO DEMOCRATS BACK GOP HEALTH PLAN; CONGRESS: SENS. KERREY AND BOREN SAY MOVE 
IS NEEDED TO PREVENT GRIDLOCK ON REFORM. THEY SAY THEY STILL SUPPORT CLINTON'S 
GOAL OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Democratic senators Wednesday announced their support for a Republican 
health care reform plan that seeks to achieve universal coverage by forcing all 
individuals to buy insurance while freeing employers from that responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Sens. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and David L. Boren of Oklahoma said they are 
backing the GOP bill -- whose sponsors include Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) -- in hopes of breaking what they see as partisan 
gridlock-in-the-making over health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 They insisted that their action should not be regarded as a snub of President 
Clinton, saying they share his goal of universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "My action today should not be viewed as any opposition to the President's 
goals, but as the best way to move them forward," Boren said. He and Kerrey 
said they were motivated by a belief that none of the committees in either the 
House or the Senate appears likely to produce a bill with a realistic chance of 
congressional enactment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today we are crossing the line and saying that we will not allow the 
rivalries and political games that too often dominate this process to get in 
the way of the health care that Americans need," Kerrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boren added: "If we do not form a bipartisan consensus soon and we don't begin 
to work on a bipartisan basis within the Senate Finance Committee, we will lose 
health care reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Their endorsement of the Republican plan stunned congressional observers and 
health care analysts, but many said the senators' action could have the 
intended effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most significant breakthrough all year in moving the Congress 
toward action," said Bill Gradison, the head of the Health Insurance Assn. of 
America. "There's been very little true compromise and not much bipartisanship 
so far." 
</P>
<P>
 The only Republican senator to support Clinton's plan is James M. Jeffords of 
Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
 While a half a dozen or more congressional panels are struggling to develop 
health care legislation, much of the attention is riveted on the critical 
Senate Finance Committee, where the 11 Democrats and nine Republicans are said 
to be "entrenched" in conflicting positions, in the words of one member. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is a bellwether panel because both Dole and Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) are members, as are Boren and John H. Chafee 
(R-R.I.), author of the plan that Boren and Kerrey endorsed. In addition, 
Kerrey has long had close ties to committee Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan 
(D-N.Y.). 
</P>
<P>
 Gradison said: "That committee is where many of us have been looking for 
signals that a bipartisan approach might happen. And if it can happen there, it 
can happen in other places." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House also viewed the development with some optimism. "What Kerrey 
and Boren said today is, they are committed to enacting legislation that 
provides universal coverage," said spokeswoman Lorrie McHugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Boren and Kerrey took pains to note that they were not offering an unqualified 
endorsement of Chafee's plan, saying they may seek major changes, such as 
adding some form of an employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 A mandate for individuals, as proposed by the Chafee plan, has numerous 
skeptics, most notably the President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who 
headed the Administration's health care reform task force. 
</P>
<P>
 They have repeatedly criticized that approach as one that would be nearly 
impossible to enforce and would require the Internal Revenue Service to "engage 
in an enormous administrative oversight of our health care system," in the 
words of Hillary Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 She and the President also have said that an individual mandate would 
encourage businesses to stop covering workers. In a speech earlier this year, 
the First Lady said: "Wouldn't employers, looking at this rationally, say to 
themselves: 'If I am currently paying benefits for this population group and 
now the government will subsidize them, I will drop them?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Chafee's plan, whose chief House sponsor is Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Bakersfield), 
would require employers to offer workers insurance but not to pay for it. It 
would also provide government subsidies to workers with low incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton plan would require all businesses to pay at least 80% of a 
worker's insurance premiums, with the employee paying the rest. But no firm 
would have to pay more than 7.9% of payroll, while some small businesses would 
pay as little as 3.5% of payroll. There would also be subsidies for small 
businesses with low-wage earners. 
</P>
<P>
 Chafee's bill would allow for the creation of voluntary, consumer-based 
insurance-buying cooperatives, whereas Clinton would force all businesses with 
more than 5,000 employees to join such "alliances."

REDRESS OKD IN RAZING OF BLACK FLORIDA TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 70 years after a racist rampage left a small black community in 
flames and its terrified residents scattered, Florida acknowledged its 
responsibility Wednesday and agreed to pay $2.1 million in compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven survivors looked on as Gov. Lawton Chiles approved legislation that will 
pay up to $150,000 to anyone who proves he or she was forced to flee from the 
violence that wiped out Rosewood in January, 1923. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors said the plan would ease some of the bitter memories of the loss of 
lives, homes and land. 
</P>

 A mob of whites went on a weeklong rampage after unsuccessfully searching for 
a black man accused of assaulting a white woman. They burned virtually every 
building in Rosewood and killed at least six of the 120 blacks who lived there. 
At least two white men also were killed.

 Descendants said state and local officials knew about the violence but did 
nothing to prevent it.

PANEL SEEKS TO EXTEND SCHOOL HOURS, YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY JORDAN, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Typical U.S. students spend three hours a weekday learning core academic 
subjects, half as much time as their counterparts in Germany and Japan, 
according to a congressionally mandated commission that today will recommend 
lengthening the American school day and year. 
</P>
<P>
 The report aims to scrap the current school schedule in favor of a more 
rigorous one. The standard American school is now organized according to 
50-minute class periods, six-hour days and 180-day school years. 
</P>
<P>
 That limited schedule makes it difficult for American students to compete 
internationally and should be "relegated to museums," the National Education 
Commission on Time and Learning said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are talking about here is nothing less than fundamentally changing 
the structure and rhythm of American life," Education Secretary Richard W. 
Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission noted that, as jobs of the 1990s demand more skills and a 
higher level of education, students are being asked to learn more in a time 
frame that has barely budged in a century. 
</P>
<P>
 The average time required in American high schools for the core subjects -- 
English, math, science, history, geography, foreign languages and the arts -- 
has shrunk to 41% of the day, the study found. That time has decreased as 
non-academic subjects, such as sex education, instruction on AIDS and 
counseling on drug and alcohol abuse, have been added. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the commission's findings was that Germany, France and Japan required 
at least twice the number of hours in core subjects. In Germany, for instance, 
the minimum high school requirement in the main subjects is 3,528 hours, 
contrasted with 1,460 hours for American students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to explode the old time metaphors, forget about the 50-minute class 
and the 180-day year," said Milton Goldberg, executive director of the 
commission, created in 1991 by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-member commission -- including educators, business leaders and 
politicians -- declined to recommend the ideal length of the school year, and 
said local communities would have to make that decision according to their 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 But it did state that 5 1/2 hours of each day should be devoted to main 
academic subjects, instead of three. Some schools in every community should be 
open year round and at night, and some students should be given longer to learn 
than others, who may not need it.

VOTES FOR BAN PROVING TO BE ELUSIVE TARGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the surface, the House vote today on banning 19 types of assault weapons 
draws on the same forces as last fall's vote to impose a waiting period on 
handgun purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 But an analysis of the House Democratic leadership's internal vote tally shows 
that subtly different dynamics are shaping this vote -- and making it more 
difficult for advocates of the assault weapons ban to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 The central problem for the White House and other gun control supporters is 
the defection of at least 45 legislators who last fall backed the so-called 
Brady bill, which requires a waiting period before handguns can be purchased, 
but are almost certain to oppose the assault weapons ban today, according to 
the analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of those defecting members come from a handful of states that 
restricted handgun purchases even before Congress passed the Brady legislation. 
In other words, assault ban advocates face the greatest defections from 
legislators for whom the earlier handgun vote was largely symbolic -- a fact 
that suggests the difficulty of assembling a winning coalition on the new 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is largely from members in whose state Brady was academic," said 
one House Democratic leadership aide. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, defections from the earlier gun control vote are also 
concentrated in heavily rural districts -- where the prospect of banning 
weapons that could be used in hunting inspires far more resistance than the 
legislation restricting handguns, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes of supporters for passage of the ban depend largely on encouraging 
switches from suburban legislators, particularly Republicans, who opposed the 
Brady bill but may be open to the assault weapons ban. Just under 20 
legislators who opposed Brady are leaning toward support of the assault weapons 
ban, or remain undecided, vote counts show. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brady bill passed the House with 238 votes last November. Counts of those 
who have switched allegiance since that vote show that an assault weapons ban 
remains within reach -- but is an uphill climb. 
</P>
<P>
 To win, advocates must either convert more Brady opponents or reverse some of 
the apparent defections from the gun control camp. There is no question that 
either possibility would require many legislators to cast a vote with more 
tangible impact on their state than the Brady bill had. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Brady bill finally passed last November, legislators representing 
states with their own forms of gun control could portray their support for 
Brady as simply a step to force other states to meet equal standards, noted 
Susan Whitmore, the press secretary for Handgun Control Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 To a substantial extent, defections from the gun control camp are coming from 
legislators in that circumstance. In Florida, for instance, which imposes its 
own background check on handgun purchases, six Republican legislators who 
backed Brady are likely to vote against the assault weapons ban, Democratic 
vote-counters said. In New York five legislators are likely to switch from pro- 
to anti-gun control votes; in California, Indiana and North Carolina four; 
Michigan and Ohio three; in Tennessee and Wisconsin at least two each. 
</P>
<P>
 All of those states impose at least some restrictions on handgun purchases, 
either waiting periods or background checks, according to a House Democratic 
compilation. 
</P>
<P>
 The second trend, the defection of rural members, is apparent in figures 
showing that of about 45 members believed to be switching from yes votes on the 
Brady bill to no votes on the assault weapons ban, about two-thirds come from 
districts where at least three of every 10 voters live in rural areas. Another 
10 come from districts where at least one of every seven voters live in rural 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers underscore the success that opponents led by the National Rifle 
Assn. have had in painting the proposed ban as a risk to weapons used in 
hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 These two trends appear to be contributing more to the precarious state of the 
proposed ban than partisan considerations. Of about 45 members viewed as likely 
to switch camps in today's vote, about 25 are Republican and nearly 20 are 
Democrats, with about half the defecting Democrats coming from Southern states. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes of pulling out the vote are centered on suburban legislators who opposed 
the Brady bill, but are leaning toward support of the assault weapons ban. 
These include suburban Republicans like Peter T. King of New York and Jay C. 
Kim of Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suburbanites are the ones who most are feeling their constituent pressure 
on violence," said the House Democratic leadership aide. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gun control advocates' challenge is being stiffened by defections from 
a half dozen suburban legislators who backed the Brady bill, including 
California Republican Bill Baker of Danville and Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.).

'ARYAN BEAUTY' KILLING BRINGS DEATH PENALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Nazi sympathizer was sentenced to death Wednesday for killing a prominent 
plastic surgeon because he promoted "fake Aryan beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Haynes was charged with murder in the Aug. 6 shooting of Dr. Martin 
Sullivan in his suburban Wilmette office. 
</P>
<P>
 Circuit Judge Earl Strayhorn found him guilty last Friday. Haynes acted as his 
own attorney but called no witnesses and presented no evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said he searched for mitigating factors that might have resulted in 
a sentence of life in prison without parole but found none. Haynes, 35, showed 
no reaction when the sentence was pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
 His father and court-appointed public defender have contended that he is 
insane, but in November Haynes was ruled fit for trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The former government chemist espoused neo-Nazi views during his various court 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "You fought World War II against Aryan beauty, and now you try to fake it with 
cosmetics," Haynes said during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before his sentencing, Haynes reaffirmed his disgust with cosmetic 
surgery, hair coloring and blue-tinted contact lenses, saying, "I condemn fake 
Aryan beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes faces extradition to California in the 1987 slaying of a San Francisco 
hair colorist. 
</P>
<P>
 Death penalty cases are automatically appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court.

STATE ARGUES CLAS TEST DOES NOT REQUIRE CONSENT; COURTS: EDUCATION DEPARTMENT 
FILES BRIEF IN LAWSUIT BY PARENTS, SAYING THE EXAM DOES NOT INVADE PRIVACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Department of Education officials Wednesday fought back at critics of 
the California Learning Assessment System tests, filing a legal brief in a Los 
Angeles lawsuit brought by opponents seeking to require parental permission for 
the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning court permission to intervene in the lawsuit brought last week 
against the Los Angeles Unified School District, the education department has 
its first opportunity to respond to allegations that the test violates state 
and federal laws against invasion of privacy, the department's top attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe firmly that the CLAS tests do not require (parental) consent. It's 
a reading and writing test, not a Masters and Johnson-type survey," said Joseph 
R. Symkowick, the department's general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two dozen suits have been filed against school districts statewide 
in which parents and religious groups have complained that the exam questions 
pry into students' personal lives. Plaintiffs in most cases have received legal 
help from one or the other of two organizations, the Escondido-based United 
States Justice Foundation and the Rutherford Institute of Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups allege that the language arts portions of the tests, now being 
administered to more than 1 million public school students in grades four, 
five, eight and 10, require prior written parental permission because they ask 
students to divulge personal matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The privacy question has become a big issue in the tests, which like other 
standardized exams are kept confidential to preserve their fairness and 
effectiveness. Although the state has allowed school board members to review 
test questions under certain circumstances, the department has fought public 
dissemination of the tests and has felt hampered in its efforts to dispel 
rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Education Code provides that "no test, questionnaire, survey or 
examination containing any questions about the pupil's personal beliefs or 
practices in sex, family life, morality and religion, or any questions about 
his parents' or guardians' beliefs and practices in sex, family life, morality 
and religion, shall be administered" to anyone in kindergarten through 12th 
grade without written permission from a parent or guardian. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles suit is significant, the state lawyers said, because it is the 
first to explore the issues themselves -- the nature of the questions and 
whether they invade privacy. In other cases, judges have ruled on restraining 
orders but have not held hearings on the issues in the suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Robert O'Brien, who has asked to examine copies of this year's tests, 
has scheduled a hearing Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court on whether 
parental permission must be obtained before the tests are given. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Kreep, head of the U.S. Justice Foundation, said he had not yet seen a 
copy of the state's brief and could not comment. But he said his reading of 
last year's questions, some of which were released as samples to prepare 
students for this year's exams, convinced him that the questions "clearly are 
invasive." 
</P>
<P>
 In court documents, state attorneys offer examples of questions they say would 
require parental consent and those that would not, and argue that the CLAS 
questions fall into the latter category. For example, a question such as, "How 
many husbands has your mother had?" would clearly require parental consent and 
ones asking a student to comment on how a father in a story treated his two 
sons would not, the state argues. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the CLAS questions is "not to elicit the personal beliefs and 
practices of the student" because the student has many ways of responding. 
</P>
<P>
 The state also alleges that none of the questions the plaintiffs have 
submitted appear on this year's tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the state argues that the Legislature, in calling for development of 
the CLAS system, clearly intended to create performance-based tests in which 
students would use "written expression to demonstrate reading comprehension and 
writing skills" and that it clearly meant for virtually all students to take 
the exams.

HOUSE COMMITTEE APPROVES DESERT PROTECTION ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The House Natural Resources Committee on Wednesday passed the California 
Desert Protection Act on a 28-14 vote along party lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The swift action, after Senate passage last month, means the full House could 
take up the legislation before Memorial Day, a committee spokesman said.It is 
expected to pass easily in the House, which approved a more ambitious desert 
preservation act in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, introduced by Chairman George Miller (D-Martinez), is similar to 
desert protection legislation drafted by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). It 
would create three national parks and place about 6.3 million acres off-limits 
to recreational vehicles, mining exploration and new livestock grazing. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists expressed disappointment over a provision that would allow 
cattle grazing to continue indefinitely in the proposed Mojave and Death Valley 
national parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the idea of cow pies in our parks," said Marty Hayden of the 
Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he is optimistic that the bill, introduced in Congress eight years 
ago, will be passed by the House and become law soon.

'THE MUSIC OF MEXICO'; TRENDS (SUCH AS BANDA ) COME AND GO, BUT MARIACHI IS 
FOREVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a free-lance writer who contributes 
regularly to The Times Orange County Edition. Free-lance writer Willson Cummer 
contributed to this story. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So, banda music is big, along with its accompanying dance, the quebraditas.  
</P>
<P>
 The border-music dance sensation, a mix of German oom-pah-pah and Mexican folk 
music influences, has swept Orange County's Latino dance clubs and dominates 
Spanish-language radio in Southern California. But Samuel Nolasco isn't 
worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolasco is music director and trumpet player for the 10-piece Mariachi 
Nochistlan -- and part owner of El Mariachi, the restaurant where it plays -- 
and has seen mariachi weather musical trends that have come along before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other kinds of music come and go, but mariachi stays," said Nolasco, in an 
interview at the restaurant. "The mariachi music has been around for years. 
Maybe because you could say it's the music of Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 Tlaquepaque Restaurant in Placentia has been presenting live mariachi music 
since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have our ups and downs, our slow periods," said Raul Davis, one of the 
owners, "but overall, it's always remained popular." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he added, "Cinco de Mayo is the biggest time of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, mariachi music can be heard at points all over the county today 
through Sunday, presented along with other expressions of traditional Mexican 
culture, including ballet folklorico.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to regular performances at Tlaquepaque and El Mariachi, places to 
hear the string-driven music of Mexico include Cal State Fullerton (Mariachi 
Jalisco, today on the quad), UC Irvine (Mariachi Juvenil Sol de Mexico, tonight 
at 8 in the Anthill Pub and Grill), San Juan Capistrano Library (Mariachi 
Olympico, Saturday at 5:30 p.m.), Max Berg Park in San Clemente (Los 
Michoacanos, Saturday at 1 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 The musical theme will be extended with a screening of the 1993 film "El 
Mariachi," Friday at 7 p.m. at Saddleback College. The film follows the 
misadventures of a young man who dreams of becoming a mariachi, like his father 
and grandfather before him. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual Santa Ana Mariachi Festival, planned for May 22 with a series of 
activities leading up to it, was canceled this week in the wake of violence at 
a Cinco de Mayo celebration last week in Los Angeles. It is the second time the 
festival has been canceled because of violence -- two years ago, the cause was 
the riots in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariachi string orchestras evolved as an accompaniment to folk music on the 
streets of Mexico, and today's groups play both traditional and recently 
composed popular music. Some historians believe the name derives from a Spanish 
variation of the French word for marriage, because of the ensembles' early use 
at weddings. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Davis, mariachi music hit a mid-'70s peak before leveling off. 
But the late-'80s mariachi recordings of Linda Ronstadt helped fuel a new boom 
that continues to hold strong, leading to an array of festivals (including a 
recent one at the Pond at Anaheim, and the annual Mariachi USA Festival at the 
Hollywood Bowl). 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Davis said, mariachi music is in some ways stronger in Southern 
California than it is in Mexico -- even in Guadalajara, where it was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just in Guadalajara a couple of weeks ago, and they don't have it at 
the same level as here," Davis said. Here, "the crowds will really sit down and 
listen to the music. It's a different ambiente ." 
</P>
<P>
 Several bands have been based at Tlaquepaque since the restaurant started 
offering mariachi at lunch on Fridays in 1972. Three years ago, the restaurant 
established its own band, Mariachi Tlaquepaque, and the group has started to 
build a solid reputation since recording an album last year. The group will 
participate in a festival in Oxnard on May 14, will play the Hollywood Bowl in 
June as part of Mariachi USA and may even travel to Guadalajara for a 
first-ever festival there. 
</P>
<P>
 The band plays at the restaurant each Friday at noon, Friday and Saturday at 7 
p.m. and at Sunday brunch beginning at 11:30 a.m. The lineup comprises five 
violins, two trumpets, two guitars and a bass. The folks who come to the 
restaurant are true aficionados, he said: "The people that listen to mariachi 
are a lot different than the banda dance crowd," Davis said. "Mariachi people 
come to hear the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Nolasco, music director of Mariachi Nochistlan, stressed the traditional 
aspects of mariachi music as one reason the music has endured and prospered. 
Nolasco grew up in the town of Nochistlan, in the state of Zacatecas, in 
north-central Mexico. It's a town rich in musical tradition, he said -- his 
father was a saxophonist in a swing band, and all the children learned to play 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolasco came to the United States for the first time with a touring mariachi 
group in 1972 and about a year later returned for good. He eventually hooked up 
with Mark Fogelquist, an ethnomusicologist from UCLA, and Mariachi Uclatlan was 
born. Fogelquist, Nolasco and others in the band opened El Mariachi in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Fogelquist was a leading local supporter of mariachi music and organizer of 
the Santa Ana festival since its inception but moved out of state last year to 
resume his teaching career. Florinda Mintz, an event organizer in Santa Ana, 
said Fogelquist's departure was a "big, big loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Mariachi isn't the only expression of traditional Mexican culture that will 
get a spotlight at Cinco de Mayo observations this week -- ballet folklorico is 
another. Volunteer Jose Hernandez teaches a student group in San Clemente that 
will perform at this weekend's festival there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps them learn about their culture and about their roots," said 
Hernandez. "We don't just tell them about dance, but also about painting and 
other arts." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez started learning various dances at age 15. Now 27, he teaches 
traditional dances from 10 regions of Mexico to about 40 students, both boys 
and girls. "I think it helps them to develop mentally, physically and 
socially," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cinco de Mayo (May 5) marks the defeat of the French by outnumbered Mexican 
soldiers, at Puebla in 1862. The county's biggest observance of the holiday was 
held last weekend at La Palma Park in Anaheim; the accompanying list gives 
details of some of the Cinco de Mayo celebrations planned in the days ahead, 
along with the entertainment schedules of El Mariachi and Tlaquepaque.

BROAD IN THE BEAT; NOT ALL THE ACTS FUSING INTO THE FESTIVAL IN IRVINE ARE EASY 
TO CATEGORIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

jazz for the The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a decidedly contemporary slant to the first Southern California Jazz 
Festival, set for this Friday through Sunday at the Koll Center in Irvine. The 
majority of the 25 acts scheduled to appear on the fest's dual stages have an 
affinity for big beats and lots of electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to center our music around the Jazz FM format," says festival 
director Rich Sherman of Ritz entertainment. "But we didn't try to exclude 
anything." (Jazz FM -- representing KBJZ Newport Beach and KAJZ Santa Monica -- 
is the official radio sponsor of the event.) 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, each day's schedule includes at least a couple of acts that stretch 
the contemporary designation or stand completely outside it. But overall the 
emphasis is on fusion sounds, especially among the headliners: saxophonist 
Everette Harp on Friday, tenor man and one-time Tower of Power member Richard 
Elliot on Saturday and keyboardist Keiko Matsui on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Acts that don't easily fit into the fusion category include Stan Getz-inspired 
saxophonist Nino Tempo on Friday. Also in this category are young blues and 
boogie pianist A.J. Croce (son of the late singer-songwriter Jim Croce), and 
drummer Ralph Penland's Penland Polygon with "Tonight Show" bassist Robert 
Hurst, both on Saturday. Sunday's lineup carries bassist Nedra Wheeler's 
acoustic quintet that fuses a number of world-beat styles into its jazz-based 
mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler's band is one of the fest's highlights. Others include Croce, whose 
rollicking style on his recent eponymously titled Private Music CD mines the 
New Orleans barrelhouse tradition, and guitarist Richard Smith, who has a 
respected solo career in addition to being a longtime member of headliner 
Elliot's band. 
</P>
<P>
 Also worth noting are Saturday's appearances by Brian Bromberg, a bassist of 
amazing facility on both electric and acoustic instruments who's worked with 
such well-known crossover artists as guitarist Lee Ritenour and keyboardist 
Jeff Lorber, and the lush, tropical-flavored sounds of keyboardist Daniel Ho's 
band Kilauea. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, search out bassist John Patitucci, a fixture in keyboardist Chick 
Corea's various bands during the past several years, and the team of 
percussionist Ndugu Chancler and keyboardist Patrice Rushen, who work as a duo 
dubbed 1 + One. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted the program to reflect the energy level of the music today," says 
radio personality and SCJF talent agent Bubba Jackson, who booked the 
festival's entertainment. "Groups like 1 + One, with Ndugu Chancler, who played 
with Miles Davis, have ties to the straight-ahead tradition but are part of the 
crossover music of today. And I also wanted to focus on Orange county-based 
musicians, like Tony Guerrero, who's an outstanding player deserving of 
worldwide recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to music on two stages, the festival will host food vendors from 
17 restaurants -- ranging from McCormick & Schmick's to Burrell's Barbecue -- 
and displays from some 60 arts vendors. Child care will be available for $4 an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival is organized by Ritz Entertainment, the same group that marketed 
last summer's financially troubled Orange County Blues Festival in Dana Point. 
"We had almost 30,000 people attend that event, and we still lost money," Rich 
says. "But this year we're taking the time to do things right." 
</P>
<P>
 What: The Southern California Jazz Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Friday, May 6 from 5 to 11:15 p.m.; Saturday, May 7 from 12:30 to 11:15 
p.m.; and Sunday, May 8 from 11 a.m. to 9:15 p.m.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE "IF 60'S WERE 90'S" / CONTINUUM RECORDS  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One might expect any self-respecting Hendrix fan to be up in arms over a 
project like this: an album by a British techno-dance group, based around a 
profusion of digitally sampled chunks of Jimi. There already are hideous 
precedents for it, albums of the '70s "Midnight Lightning" ilk for which 
producer Alan Douglas used splices and overdubs to fabricate shoddy "new" 
Hendrix music that was leached of the genius and fire that graced the 
guitarist's legitimate works. 
</P>
<P>
 Beautiful People, however, have managed an inspired bit of grave-robbing. It's 
not a perfect album: As surprising as the group's taste and insight are, it 
also is ultimately frustrating to consider how much better this could have 
been. Hendrix, who died in 1970, was such an innovative, spiritual musician 
that nearly any collaboration -- particularly one distanced by the grave -- 
must fall short of his singular vision. 
</P>
<P>
 While adding modern beats, atmospheric synths and backing harmonies, the main 
"instruments" the group uses here are Hendrix recordings: Guitar riffs, solo 
sections, vocals and spoken asides from dozens of songs are mixed to create 
compositions. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of the numbers are merely clever and cluttered, piling on one 
Experienced snippet after another until there's a Stratocaster logjam. Other 
tracks, though, are done with a judicious ear and keen humor, remarkable 
considering the members of the Beautiful People quintet were in diapers when 
Hendrix was alive and blazing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stone Crazy" percolates with bits of "Spanish Castle Magic," "Purple Haze," 
"Ezy Rider" and other tracks, while "Feel the Heat" takes the "bus ride through 
the galaxy" theme of Hendrix's obscure "Stars That Play With Laughing Sam's 
Dice" and sends it spiraling through the rest of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 It's on the slower tracks that the choice of samples approaches brilliance -- 
which perhaps is even achieved on the title track, "If 60's Were 90's." Over a 
slow, slinky Sade-ready dance groove, the group mixes Hendrix's "If Six Was 
Nine" super-cool anthem of independence with his sex-steeped solos from the 
slow version of "Voodoo Chile." The result is haunting, with a dreamlike, 
late-night mood that recaptures some of the magic of first hearing Hendrix back 
in the '60s.

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: THROWING MUSES "THROWING MUSES" (1986) / 4AD (BRITISH 
IMPORT) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a list of the best college-alternative-indie-whatever youcallit albums ever 
released, Throwing Muses' debut ranks with R.E.M.'s "Murmur" and the most 
accomplished albums of the Replacements, Violent Femmes, Husker Du and Sonic 
Youth. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no obvious precedent for "Throwing Muses." The Muses did gather 
strands of influence from the Velvet Underground, Patti Smith, Devo, B-52's, 
Yoko Ono and other underground icons. The Rhode Island-bred band also 
appreciated a good folk-rock melody and was open to the pleasures of a 
galloping, countrified beat. But the Muses (founders Kristin Hersh, Tanya 
Donelly and David Narcizo were still in their teens when they made the album, 
and bassist Leslie Langston was only slightly into her 20s) emerged with 
something distinctively and strangely their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throwing Muses" is an album of constant dips, turns and reversals, in which 
hard, driven guitar passages evoking a race through a dark and scary tunnel can 
give way suddenly to lovely, gently rueful ballad singing. Hersh, the main 
singer and songwriter, is the one doing most of the tunneling (Donelly, who 
went on to front Belly, contributes one song, the haunting, ethereal "Green"). 
Hersh's lyrics are oblique shards of imagery and symbolism; most of the time 
she seems to be fighting off night fears of being blanketed by some 
unidentified psychosexual dread. Her voice makes vivid the barking fear of a 
madwoman being set upon by her worst demons, but it can subside into a quiet, 
intimate zone of emotional weariness. 
</P>
<P>
 Dread may have been the album's keynote, but a fresh listening reveals a good 
deal of humor as well. The slyness and exaggeration in some of Hersh's vocal 
contortions suggest that she could momentarily distance herself from the woes 
being enacted and gain a wry, self-mocking perspective on her Angst . 
</P>
<P>
 Throwing Muses has had fine moments in six subsequent studio albums and EPs, 
and Hersh comes off well on her current acoustic solo detour, "Hips and 
Makers." But the first one cuts the deepest and will be well worth the import 
premium until somebody has the sense to issue it domestically. 
</P>
<P>
 (Kristin Hersh plays Friday, May 6, at 8 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. $17.50 (714) 496-8930.)

POP MUSIC; HINOJOSA SPICES SONGS WITH CULTURAL VARIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Does ethnic pride stand in the way of a larger sense of commonality and social 
cohesion? 
</P>
<P>
 In music, at least, the evidence suggests that ethnicity doesn't have to build 
walls but can serve as a foundation for a vision that is at once particular and 
widely embracing. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Lobos is one of the grandest examples of artists who immerse themselves in 
the music of their ethnic heritage but also venture into a wider world of 
influences. The band's concerts and albums offer a vibrant display of the 
Mexican folk roots it absorbed when it was starting out 20 years ago in East 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But cherishing a Mexican identity didn't stop Los Lobos from mastering blues, 
heartland rock and, more recently, avant-garde rock influences. For Los Lobos, 
heritage is vital, but it lives alongside a love of music that comes from 
sources outside its own ethnic background. When the band weaves its shows from 
many strands, including the ones passed down through its bloodlines, it plays 
with a higher artistic understanding that allows diverse strands to hang 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 One gets the same sense of the particular and the universal listening to Tish 
Hinojosa, the Texas-born singer who plays a Cinco de Mayo concert tonight at 
Cal State Long Beach's new Richard and Karen Carpenter Performing Arts Center. 
Hinojosa will appear with a backing trio. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest of 13 children raised in San Antonio by Mexican immigrants, 
Hinojosa grew up listening to the folk songs and pop ballads of her ancestral 
homeland. But she also absorbed American folk music, country and rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Los Lobos, Hinojosa never seems to be on foreign musical turf. Her pure, 
pliant voice can call to mind Joan Baez and Nanci Griffith in folkier moments, 
Emmylou Harris when she veers toward traditional country and Natalie Merchant 
when she turns up in a pop-rock context and dips into a dusky lower register. 
On record, she also has shown an easy way with Western swing and the dreamy 
rhythms of Cuban salsa and Brazilian samba. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinojosa writes most of her own material. Her fine ear for melody shows in 
numerous lovely, tender, romantic ballads. Her social concerns come across in 
songs that seek to put a human face on political issues. "Something in the 
Rain," from her 1992 album, "Culture Swing," personalizes the plight of migrant 
workers exposed to toxic chemicals while working in the fields. Her gentle, 
sorrowing approach proves more moving and effective than soapbox thunder. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in her late 30s, Hinojosa made her first career gambit in 1983 when she 
moved to Nashville. After two years yielded scant results, she headed back to 
the Southwest. She eventually wound up on the Austin, Tex., scene that has been 
an incubator for diverse, progressive roots music in which folk, rock and 
country are seen as complementary, not mutually exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 She emerged on the national scene in 1989 with the well-received "Homeland," 
on A&M Records (Los Lobos member Steve Berlin was the producer). Difficulties 
with the label led to her shelving a planned follow-up that was produced by R&B 
great Booker T. Jones, but Hinojosa returned in 1991 with "Aquella Noche," a 
lovely, ballad-oriented release on the independent Watermelon label. Sung 
almost entirely in Spanish, "Aquella Noche" captured a concert she gave in 
Austin in honor of Cinco de Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Culture Swing," on a bigger independent, Rounder Records, explored Hinojosa's 
full range of influences. Next up is "Destiny's Gate," due out later this month 
on Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on a major label, Hinojosa is clearly bidding for a mainstream audience. 
The production is too glossy at times, indulging in synthesizer and string 
sweetening that gilds the lily. However, her essence as an intelligent, 
melodically gifted writer and fetching singer consistently comes through. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps "Destiny's Gate" will help Hinojosa reach the audience that has opened 
up for such popular folk-pop-country hybrid artists as Mary-Chapin Carpenter 
and Rosanne Cash. Worse compromises have been made to further the careers of 
far less interesting talents. 
</P>
<P>
 Who: Tish Hinojosa. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Tonight, May 5, at 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Richard and Karen Carpenter Performing Arts Center, 6200 E. Atherton 
St., Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the San Diego (405) Freeway to the Palo Verde Avenue exit; 
go south on Palo Verde, turn west on East Atherton Street. Theater is on the 
south side of Atherton. 
</P>
<P>

KID STUFF: A FEW WAYS TO MAKE MOM'S DAY; WHETHER IT'S BALLET TICKETS, BRUNCH OR 
THE ZOO, PART OF THE GIFT IS BEING TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Cory Flocken covers children's events for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every year, I ask my mother what she wants for Mother's Day. And every year 
the answer is the same: "Let's just spend some time together." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, when I was a kid, I thought she was crazy. After all, here was her 
once-a-year chance to collect serious loot from her doting children ("What! I 
thought you bought her the card!"), but of course, now I see her point. In the 
right setting, a day spent together as a family can generate more lasting 
memories, and far fewer grams of fat, than another marathon brunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a few outings suitable for two or more generations. Pigs en Pointe 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's a Peter Rabbit (textbook problem child) or a Jemima Puddleduck 
(well-meaning but ditsy mom), chances are your family has someone very much 
like one of the characters Beatrix Potter created for her classic children's 
stories. This weekend, you can introduce your clan to Potter's in "Tales of 
Beatrix Potter," a one-act ballet presented by the Royal Ballet of Great 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also includes "The Dream," based on Shakespeare's comedy "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream." Performances are Saturday at 3 and 8 p.m. and Sunday 
at 2 and 7:30 p.m. at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 650 Town Center 
Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $20 to $70. (714) 556-2787. 
</P>
<P>
 (If you can't get to the ballet, Goodtimes Home Video produces a series of 
30-minute tapes for younger children titled "The World of Peter Rabbit and 
Friends." For more Mother's Day video selections, see the next category.) Pop 
in for a Movie 
</P>
<P>
 Family movie outings are nice, but if you're packing small children, it's not 
the most relaxing experience for Mom ("Dear, get off the armrest. You're going 
to spill that nice man's Cooooooooooooooooke!"). And many older children would 
rather die than be seen with Mom at the multiplex. 
</P>
<P>
 Home videos are a good alternative. An informal survey of some moms I know 
yielded the following suggestions for a family video fest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mary Poppins," "Beauty and the Beast" and "Charlotte's Web" are big with 
younger kids, as is the film version of the original Broadway musical "Peter 
Pan" and "Beethoven." Also popular: "Homeward Bound" (which throws in a nice 
subplot of a single mom embarking on a second marriage) and "Milo and Otis," 
which features a theme song by children's artist Dan Crow. 
</P>
<P>
 Families with school-age children suggested "Free Willy," "Big," "The Wizard 
of Oz," "Home Alone" and "Mrs. Doubtfire," and sports-minded types pitched "The 
Sandlot," "The Mighty Ducks" and "Field of Dreams." Soft-hearted teen-agers and 
their moms might share a good cry watching "Beaches." Off to the Thea-tuh 
</P>
<P>
 With lots of color and razzmatazz, a G-rated dalliance and old-fashioned 
values, "The Music Man" ranks high on the family friendly scale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brea Civic Light Opera wraps up its staging of Meredith Willson's chestnut 
at the Curtis Theatre (1 Civic Center Circle, Brea) with performances tonight 
through Saturday at 8 and at 2 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Tickets are $10.50 
to $12.50 for adults, $7 for children 12 and under. Mom gets $1 off her ticket 
on Sunday. (714) 990-7722. 
</P>
<P>
 The youthful cast of Broadway on Tour children's theater presents "The Sound 
of Music" Friday through May 21 at The City shopping center (20 City Drive, 
Orange) on Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $5 to $7. 
</P>
<P>
 This production features the full Broadway score, and of course, 
representations of all seven of the Von Trapp children, which BOT director Dan 
Halkyard figures makes it a perfect choice for Mother's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 BOT will host a special Mother's Day dinner show that includes a catered 
Italian dinner. The evening starts at 6 p.m. Tickets are $10 for children 12 
and under, $15 for adults. Reservations are required. (714) 385-1555. Mosey 
Around a Museum 
</P>
<P>
 Mother's Day is a great day to check out local museums, especially those 
designed for families. 
</P>
<P>
 The Launch Pad science center in Costa Mesa's Crystal Court (3333 Bear St.) 
offers hands-on exhibits that help families get a grip on scientific 
principles. Admission is $5. The center is open Monday through Friday 10 a.m.

One adult per child is admitted free. (714) 540-2001. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, you might pop in for a shake and a burger at Ruby's restaurant 
downstairs. Cholesterol be damned; it's a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Grandma may feel like a pup next to the Victorian-themed exhibits in the 
Discovery Museum of Orange County (3101 W. Harvard St., Santa Ana), which 
features hands-on activities in the turn-of-the-century Kellogg House. 
Activities include a turn with an old-fashioned washboard and tub; who knows, 
even the kids may gain an appreciation for the family Maytag. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the museum hosts a Mother's Day Tea with sandwiches, scones and a 
variety of teas, plus lemonade. Seatings remain at the 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. teas.

(714) 540-0404. 
</P>
<P>
 The Children's Museum La Habra (301 S. Euclid St., La Habra) presents 
permanent exhibits that help visitors explore the worlds of art and science, 
plus a preschoolers' area jammed with indoor play equipment. On Sunday in its 
changing gallery, the museum wraps up "Under the Big Top," a hands-on display 
that caters to kids, and moms of course, who fantasize about running away to 
join the circus. There are picnic and playground facilities in a neighboring 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is open Monday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from 1 
to 5 p.m. Admission is $3.50 per person, children under age 2 get in free. 
(310) 905-9693. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m., the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art (2002 N. Main 
St., Santa Ana) will host a workshop for moms and older children titled 
"Mother's Day in a Japanese Garden." The program includes a lecture, a Japanese 
flower-arranging demonstration and a film. $10. (714) 567-3670. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Thursdays 
until 9 p.m. Admission: $1.50 to $4.50; children under 5 get in free. 
</P>
<P>

offer a champagne brunch with live big band music from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The 
price is $5.95 for children ages 5 to 10; $12.95 for adults. Reservations 
required. (714) 835-2002. 
</P>
<P>
 (For more brunch suggestions, see "Brunch, If You Must," below.) Toons, Tunes 
and Tours 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday at 1 p.m. at the Santa Ana Zoo (1801 E. Chestnut Ave., Santa Ana), 
the Mother's Day Safari Symphony offers live music by the Irvine Youth Symphony 
and an excuse for families to enjoy a picnic on the zoo's expansive lawns. All 
mothers will be admitted to the zoo at no charge on that day. 
</P>
<P>
 The zoo is open daily from 10 a .m. to 4 p.m. Admission is $1 to $3. (714) 
836-4000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gourmet Lollipop Co. (7831 Heil Ave., "Sweet" J, Huntington Beach) will be 
closed Sunday, but Tuesday through Saturday the business welcomes groups of all 
sizes for free behind-the-scenes tours. Visitors can see how lollipops are made 
start to finish and make a few taste tests of their own. A candy store is also 
on site. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservations are required. (714) 841-2000. Brunch, if You Must 
</P>
<P>
 If you do decide to brunch, be aware that even on Mother's Day, not every 
restaurant lays out the red carpet for children. Here are a few ideas: 
</P>
<P>
 The Back Bay Cafe (1131 Back Bay Drive, Newport Beach) will offer an 
affordable Mother's Day breakfast buffet with killer views and quick access to 
adjacent Newport Dunes, said the resort's general manager Anne Quinn. (Note: 
There is a $5 parking fee at the Dunes, but the cafe validates parking.) 
</P>
<P>
 From 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., the all-you-can-eat buffet includes omelet and waffle 
stations. There will also be a clown to entertain the kids with balloons and 
face painting while Mom lingers (yeah, right) over coffee. Quinn recommends 
dining on the patio, which overlooks the boat launch of Newport Harbor. 
Reservations are suggested. (714) 729-1144. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, diners can walk to the Dunes, where they can rent bikes, skates, 
sea cycles, windsurfers or even "cocktail cruisers" that can carry up to 10 
people. Fees range from $5 to $45 an hour. A two-hour kayak tour of Back Bay 
departs at 10 a.m.; the fee is $15 per person and includes instruction. 
Children must be 4 or older to participate. (800) 585-0747 for kayak tour 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hornblower Dining Yachts presents a pricey but intriguing option with its 
Mother's Day cruises. On Sunday, the company hosts two-hour cruises departing 
from its Newport Beach dock (2431 Pacific Coast Highway) that include an 
all-you-can-eat brunch with champagne, live music and views of Newport Harbor 
waterfront and the Fun Zone. Guests are free to explore the 150-foot motor 
yacht and visit with the captain in the pilot house. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruises depart at 10 a.m. and 1:30 p.m.; boarding is a half-hour prior to 
departure. Tickets: $40.30 for adults, $22.30 for children 12 and under. 
Reservations are required. (714) 631-2469, Ext. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The Disneyland Hotel puts on a Mother's Day fete that caters to kids. On 
Sunday, from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., the hotel's grand ballroom will be decorated 
to resemble the park scene from "Mary Poppins" for its "Supercalifragilistic 
Brunch," which offers an all-you-can-eat spread plus a chance to hobnob with 
Mary, Bert the chimney sweep, the ever-dapper Penguin Waiters and a handful of 
other Disney characters. 
</P>
<P>
 The price is $34.95 for adults; $12.50 for children age 4 to 12 and $3 for 
children 3 and under. Reservations are advised. (714) 956-6413.

SURFING: ROCKIN' FIG & DAVE; FOUNDATION UNITES ACTIVISTS IN BATTLE AGAINST 
OCEAN POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK FIGNETTI and DAVID REYES, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington 
Beach surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. 
surf teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recent surf session with Pierce Flynn and Ed Mazzarella reminded me of the 
eclectic nature of surfers. Both work for the San Clemente-based Surfrider 
Foundation. As Surfrider spokesman, Flynn tells us who's responsible for ocean 
pollution, while Mazzarella links the foundation with its chapters, letting 
them know what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 I told Rockin' Fig I was going surfing with two guys I hadn't surfed with 
before, and he was stoked. He wanted to know how they surfed, what they talked 
about and whether they took their environmentalism seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 They do. But the fun part was getting to know these guys and hear about 
Surfrider, which celebrates its 10-year anniversary in August. 
</P>
<P>
 At 27, Mazzarella has long hair, drives a pickup and wears beanies. He rides 
long and short boards, lives in San Clemente and is quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 At 40, Flynn's the character. The guy drives an old Volvo station wagon 
plastered with decals -- his favorite is "Free Tibet" -- and rides an epoxy 
long board and a Dave Parmenter Stubb Vector -- you know, one of those wider 
boards for us older surfers. Flynn lives in Leucadia and holds a doctorate in, 
get this, ethno-methodology from UC San Diego. He says it's Advanced People 
Watching. 
</P>
<P>
 The waves were small, and we made plans to surf San Onofre. I was all set to 
get in the water, when Mazzarella turned to Flynn and said, "Dr. Pierce, isn't 
it time for ginseng?" 
</P>
<P>
 I looked at them and wondered, "Time for ginseng? What is this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, all surfers have their little pre-surf rituals. For some, it's loading 
up on hot coffee. For others, it's slamming down glazed doughnuts or munching 
Skittles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzarella reached into his pack and took out three tiny vials. The label 
read: "Red Panax Ginseng Extraction" an export of Tianjin, China. 
</P>
<P>
 I said, "You guys take this stuff?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah. It gives you a natural energy boost," Flynn said. "It has a bittersweet 
taste, but it's mixed with honey extract." 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzarella handed me a vial and a miniature straw. I didn't want to seem 
inhospitable, so I poked the straw through the vial's lid and sipped. Eeeeyech. 
Within a few minutes, though, I felt this speed -- no, euphoria -- that helped 
the paddle out. It didn't make me climb mountains, but it wasn't bad. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Figgy if he's ever had ginseng and what has he taken before a go-out. 
</P>
<P>
 I've heard of of it but haven't tried it. But there are guys who always are 
bringing back something from some part of the world.  
</P>
<P>
 As we surfed, we talked. For nearly 10 years, Surfrider has been fighting 
ocean polluters and coastal development. 
</P>
<P>
 The group began as a loose-knit handful of surfers who defeated plans to 
dredge a creek near Malibu that would have ruined surfing there. In Orange 
County, one of their first projects was to help scuttle a proposed marina at 
Bolsa Chica in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're an organization with about 25,000 members and a $600,000 budget," Flynn 
said. "A few years ago, then-(U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) Director 
William K. Reilly said, 'The EPA likes surfers. We consider them the new 
indicator species.' Basically, they're watching us to see if we mutate." 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of surfers recall Surfrider's 1991 Humboldt County victory, in which it 
helped stop toxic pollution of a popular surfing beach by two paper pulp mills, 
which were fined $5.8 million. Foundation members also stopped plans to build a 
big breakwater that the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station wanted in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more important, Flynn and Mazzarella said, is their role in reminding the 
public not to dump anything toxic, such as oil and anti-freeze, down storm 
drains. That accounts for 80% of coastal ocean pollution, they added. 
</P>
<P>
 Fig says it's this type of pollution that surfers face every day. 
</P>
<P>
 You gotta kept an eye on this pollution, not just for us but for the kids and 
the future. Hey, we just had a sewage spill that closed the beach at the Santa 
Ana River jetty, and it's a concern right now, especially with summer's big 
south swells that can push that pollution right up the coast.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tribute: South Bay surfers had a memorial paddle-out for Tom Pratte, 44, of 
Huntington Beach, Surfrider's first executive director, who died of cancer 
early this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Contest: The Bud Tour winner up at Pismo Beach was Chris Brown. In second 
place was Pat O'Connell, followed by Taylor Knox and Rob Machado. Fig said 
Kelly Slater had zeroed in on the contest but was defeated in the 
quarterfinals. With a win, Slater could have gotten a triple -- a No. 1 rating 
on the world tour, the world-qualifying series and the Bud Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Contest II: The 15th annual Katin Team Challenge is Friday through Sunday on

tag-team format, is already talking trash about a repeat.

DO IT!: WHEELMEN TO EMBARK ON TOUR DE FORCE OF LOCAL CYCLING

<P>
 The Orange County Wheelmen, the county's biggest cycling club, return Saturday 
with the county's biggest group bike event. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour of the Canyons is back for its eighth year, with an expanded array of 
options. There will be a half-metric century (32 miles) on a bike trail, a full 
metric (64 miles), double metric (128 miles) and even a double century (200 
miles). 
</P>
<P>
 The canyons in question are strung out along Santiago Canyon Road in the 
foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains -- Silverado, Modjeska and Trabuco. 
</P>
<P>
 Riders who feel in top shape can choose a route that includes the Modjeska 
Grade, one of the toughest climbs in the area (and, according to ride 
organizers, one that takes in "the highest house in Orange County"). 
</P>
<P>
 Tour of the Canyons starts at Yorba Regional Park in Anaheim between 6:30 and 
8 a.m. There will be roving support vehicles along all routes for anyone 
experiencing mechanical (or physical) breakdowns. There will also be food and 
rest stops and an end-of-ride lunch and beverage. The courses close at 4 p.m. 
except for the double century, which closes at 10 p.m. (All riders in this 
event must meet California Vehicle Code requirements for riding in the dark.) 
</P>
<P>
 The rides are not races, although the better riders certainly will be moving 
at a fast clip. The double century was designed to avoid traffic lights and 
stop signs as much as possible and is part of the California Triple Crown 
series (ride any three double centuries in the series and you get a jersey 
patch commemorating your achievement). 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Wheelmen offers a variety of weekly rides and large group events 
all through the year. The next big event is the Ride Around the Bear, a 
grueling 100-mile ride on June 11 that will climb from Redlands to Onyx Summit 
-- 8,443 feet -- and back down again. It's not for beginners. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Saturday, the Southern California Hillsea returns to Central Park West 
in Huntington Beach. One of the more unusual races in Southern California, this 
footrace features a staggered start by age and sex (10-year-old Megan McGowan 
was the narrow 1993 winner). 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 7.57-mile course is on grass and dirt trails within the park and 
stays off the streets. The race begins at 8 a.m. with registration starting at 
6:30 a.m. Entry is $18 (including T-shirt). Information: (714) 841-5417. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Tour of the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Saturday, May 7. Registration between 6:30 and 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Yorba Regional Park, Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: From the Riverside (91) Freeway, exit north on Imperial Highway. 
Turn right onto La Palma Avenue and proceed half a mile to the park entrance, 
on the right, near the baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $30 for the 32- and 64-mile rides, $40 for 128 miles, $50 for 200 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to call: (714) 956-2453.

REWIND: KEEN SUBTLETY, SUSPENSE MAKE FOR AN INVITING 'UNINVITED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you want flashy pyrotechnics and gore, proceed straight to "The Amityville 
Horror" movies. But if you yearn for a classy ghost film with some 
old-fashioned storytelling magic, turn to "The Uninvited." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike so many modern-day haunted-house films, this 1944 entry endures 
primarily because of its keen sense of subtlety, mystery and suspense. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't even matter that the ghosts in "The Uninvited" are rarely seen. The 
film is so deftly crafted that their implied presence is enough to draw the 
viewer into this work's spooky milieu. Doors slamming shut by themselves, 
candles flickering ominously on a shadowy staircase and the late-night moans of 
a tortured spirit are some of the elements that help paint a mysterious, 
spine-tingling atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Windward is the name of the haunted house in a chilly coastal section of 
western England. When music critic Roderick Fitzgerald (Ray Milland) and his 
sister Pamela (Ruth Hussey) stumble upon the vacant mansion, they see only a 
lovely old house in an appealingly out-of-the-way location. At the behest of 
Pamela, Roderick buys the estate for the two of them at a bargain price. 
</P>
<P>
 The mansion's previous owner, an old military commander, does give the new 
buyers a hint of Windward's troubled history: The commander's daughter once 
lived there with her husband and infant daughter before falling fatally off a 
nearby cliff. 
</P>
<P>
 After Roderick and Pamela encounter eerie and unexplained happenings, they 
embark on a desperate search to uncover the true identities and motives of the 
ghosts haunting Windward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Uninvited" is really as much a seductive mystery as it is a bone-chilling 
story of the supernatural. Director Lewis Allen tantalizingly unravels the 
surprising events that lead to the spiritual unrest at Windward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Uninvited" (1944), directed by Lewis Allen. 98 minutes. Not rated. JON

SPECIAL SCREENING: DIVINE RIGHT IN 'POLYESTER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody could fill a bra and panties quite like Divine. Take a look at 
"Polyester" if you have any doubts. There he is, right at the start of John 
Waters' uncivilized comedy, a 300-pound troublemaker all dressed up in feminine 
mystique. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters, who's gone on to almost mainstream respectability (say it isn't so!) 
with such recent studio releases as "Serial Mom," started his career with 
Divine, a large, marauding transvestite who gave the legendary "Pink Flamingos" 
just the right trash cachet. "Pink Flamingos," which came out in 1972, is 
perhaps the grossest movie ever -- Divine (a.k.a. Glenn Milstead) caps a couple 
of hours of queasy mischief by eating dog droppings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Polyester," which continues UC Irvine's "Off the Beaten Path" series Friday 
night, isn't quite up to the low standards of "Pink Flamingos," but it's still 
a worthy effort by Waters, then one of the most on-the-fringe of the fringe 
directors. Besides, Divine is in great form, if you like forms that way. Girls 
just wanna have fun, and Divine puts a radical spin on the notion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1981 flick (which, ironically, was supposed to be Waters' entry into 
real filmmaking, since it was financed by big-name New Line Cinema), Divine 
stars as Francine Fishpaw, a frantic member of the Silent Majority, mother of 
two monstrous kids and wife to cruel, toupeed Elmer (David Samson), who runs a 
porno movie house. 
</P>
<P>
 While Elmer's theater inspires rabid protests by Baltimore's conservative 
citizens, daughter Lulu (Mary Garlington) runs off for sex with Bo-Bo (Stiv 
Bators, the former singer of the punk group Dead Boys) and generally just can't 
keep still (she wants to be a go-go dancer). Son Dexter (Ken King) has a drug 
problem and a foot fetish; he's the notorious "Baltimore Foot Stomper." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait; there's more. Elmer takes his freaky secretary to lousy motels and 
enjoys tormenting Francine by driving around town with a loudspeaker, telling 
everybody that "my wife is the hairiest woman I've ever known" and "she's an 
alcoholic who can eat a cake in one sitting." Francine begins a to-the-bottom 
spiral until she meets Todd Tomorrow (Tab Hunter), the owner of a drive-in 
theater that only shows art films and serves caviar, champagne and oysters in 
the snack bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, those are just the basics. Besides, the plot in a Waters' movie is 
usually only incidental; it's what happens to the characters when things are 
moving along that makes you sneer, laugh and grimace. It's almost impossible to 
explain; seeing is believing with vintage Waters. 
</P>
<P>
 What's also funny about "Polyester" is how little Waters had improved as a 
technician since "Pink Flamingos" made its debut. Despite extra money (with New 
Line Cinema bankrolling, it had to be more than the $10,000 he spent on "Pink 
Flamingos") and more experience, Waters still barely knows where to put the 
camera. In "Pink Flamingos," everybody was framed in a five- to 10-foot range; 
in "Polyester," it's maybe five- to 20-feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The acting is largely improvisational, with Divine making the most of the 
freedom. Tab Hunter is pretty good, too, mocking his teen idol image and not 
being self-conscious about his sagging features and waistline. 
</P>
<P>
 One last point: any discussion of "Polyester" requires at least a brief 
mention of "Odorama," the sniff-good gimmick that Waters used to publicize his 
picture. Moviegoers were given a card and were expected to scratch a circle 
when the corresponding number flashed on the screen. The scents from perfume, 
pizza and a skunk (predictably, most were bad) were supposed to add to the 
experience. Sorry, no Odorama cards at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 A different, quieter sort of humor is also on Friday's bill. Buster Keaton's 
20-minute silent, "One Week," will follow "Polyester." 
</P>
<P>
 What: John Waters' "Polyester." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Friday, May 6, at 7 and 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The UC Irvine Student Center Crystal Cove Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the San Diego (405) Freeway to Jamboree Road and head south 
to Campus Drive and take a left. Turn right on Bridge Road and take it into the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $2 to $4.

KIDS ON FILM: IN LIFE LESSONS 101, 'WITH HONORS' PASSES; IN "WITH HONORS," A 
DRIVEN HARVARD GOVERNMENT MAJOR AND A HOMELESS BUM TEACH EACH OTHER LESSONS 
ABOUT LIFE AFTER THE BUM FINDS THE BOY'S LOST SENIOR THESIS AND DEMANDS FAVORS 
FOR ITS RETURN. (RATED PG-13)

<P>
 From the previews he'd seen, Damien Munsinger, 16, expected "With Honors" to 
be a happy comedy. Boy, oh, boy, what a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect it to be so . . . kind of a tear-jerker," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The privileged Monty, it turns out, was abandoned as a child by his father. 
The bum Simon, coincidentally, had abandoned his own wife and children decades 
earlier. Simon (played by Joe Pesci) is also dying of lung disease caused by 
breathing asbestos while working in a shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon is also said to suffer from alcoholism and perhaps schizophrenia but 
wins applause from an advanced class in government when he one-ups the stuffy 
professor and delivers a spontaneous lecture of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Postgraduates who have spent some time in the real world will probably gag 
trying to swallow their disbelief at some plot and character development, not 
to mention the entire premise. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Sunday matinee in Newport Beach, usher Brian Goggins said many members of 
the older generation have come out of this movie shaking their heads and 
wondering why Monty didn't just force Simon to give him back the thesis in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
 But kids older than 12 said they enjoyed the movie and its lessons in Moral 
Development I: Bums are people, too; you can learn more on the street than in 
an ivory tower university. 
</P>
<P>
 "We loved it," said Monet Corso, 14, whose same-age friends Cynthia Miranda 
and Tiffany Long brought her after having seen it themselves the night before. 
"It made you laugh. It made you cry. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Interrupted Cynthia: "You sound like a commercial." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the girls agreed it was a nearly perfect show. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't think it was sappy?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all ," they chorused. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cynthia: "I thought Joe Pesci was really funny, and I liked his 
character." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Monet, "He was intelligent." 
</P>
<P>
 The line they remembered the most was his oft-repeated signature phrase, "Boy, 
oh, boy. Boy, oh, boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Monet was also impressed with a poetic message Simon gave Monty when he 
returned his original thesis -- parroted from his professor's negative views on 
the decline of democracy and mistrust of the common man. "He told him not to 
take ideas second- and third-hand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were trying to show you don't need to study to learn things," 
Tiffany said. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder kids love this film. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon eventually moves in with Monty and his privileged housemates, affecting 
all their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls particularly liked the only female housemate, Courtney, a snob 
played by Moira Kelly, who had a similar role in "The Cutting Edge," another 
movie popular with the girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Sex, nudity and violence are all minimal in this movie. But until Courtney 
falls in love with the gentle Monty, she isn't much of a role model, treating 
her boyfriends as condom-necessitating sex objects. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the humor went over the girls' heads and would surely bore younger 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though she enjoyed the film, Monet said, "I think older kids can relate 
to it more than we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia agreed, saying: "My sister's 18. She absolutely loved the movie. She's 
in college, so she knew." 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany said she liked it even better the second time around. "You pick up on 
little parts you didn't get at first. You can understand it more."

GET USED TO BUCKETS O' LOBSTER, BAJA STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I sit down to a lobster dinner, I expect to see fishnets, clapboard walls 
and a couple of crusty old fishermen, not the bright colors of Mexico, but 
that's just the New Englander in me. Out here, we're right next door to Baja 
California. Ergo, Rockin' Baja Lobster. 
</P>
<P>
 You just have to get used to eating lobster out of a bucket. This busy Newport 
restaurant specializes in Baja-style slipper lobster, crammed onto a platter 
with shrimp in the shell, carne asada and grilled chicken, all brought in a 
giant metal bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockin' Baja Lobster's Mexico theme also means frozen margaritas in huge 
glasses, sides of rice and beans and a variety of creative salsas such as 
jicama-mango and pineapple-papaya. Add a team of waitresses clad in black 
shorts and T-shirts emblazoned with the tasteful slogan "Best Tail in Town," 
and you've got your basic Newport hangout. 
</P>
<P>
 The twist is that this one actually has a few good things to eat. It's not 
going to put the nearby Crab Cooker out of business, but most of the dishes are 
fun. The Newport Pier area, once so restaurant-poor, is beginning to offer 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the Rockin' Baja Lobster concept is wrinkle-free. When this place 
gets crowded, the service, close to nonexistent when things are slow, gets 
astonishingly aggressive. There are some unpleasant restaurants in our part of 
the world where waiters "push" the wine -- they overfill everyone's glass in 
order to finish off the bottle and then immediately ask the host about ordering 
another. How rude. At Rockin' Baja Lobster, they push mixed drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy, do they push. One waitress (who seemed miffed that only two people at our 
table ordered cocktails) came back at least seven times in 10 minutes to check 
and recheck the status of the margarita glasses. She kept asking whether we 
needed more drinks virtually until we ordered dessert. When dessert arrived, 
she started pitching us on after-dinner drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, they pour exceptionally generous drinks. The terrific Rockin' 
Baja Rita, for instance (made with Reales anejo tequila, Cointreau, Grand 
Marnier, orange juice, lime juice and sweet-and-sour mix -- did I leave 
anything out?), could easily serve two. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the food portions, expect a similar sensibility. You may pay 
more for a lobster dinner here than you do in Puerto Nuevo, but believe me, it 
isn't that much more, considering how much you get. The "lobster bucket" -- 
tastily seasoned pieces of Pacific lobster with rice and beans and a creamy 
Caesar salad on the side -- is only $11.95. 
</P>
<P>
 With all these buckets and platters of food, it would take a very big eater to 
order appetizers as well, particularly because most of the appetizers are 
standard chain restaurant fare. If you must have a starter, you might order the 
B.S. platter, which includes Buffalo wings, chicken fingers, taquitos and chili 
poppers (deep-fried jalapenos that ooze a cream cheese filling when punctured). 
An even better idea might be the lobster queso skillet, where lobster meat and 
chorizo combine with a mass of gooey cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobster is the center of the action, and you can have it several ways: in a 
taco, seared with spices and stuffed into a quesadilla or (my choice) topped 
with bacon and avocado in the surprisingly delicious Rockin' Lobster Burger. 
This last is shredded slipper lobster meat shaped into a patty and crammed into 
a good, yeasty bun. I know of no lobster preparation to compare with it at 
anything like $7.95 this side of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular menu choice is the restaurant's "Big Baja Bucket" (note the 
copyright sign on the menu), which serves two. This is some lunch pail: a good 
half dozen slipper lobster tails -- softer and chunkier than I can remember 
eating in Baja -- along with grilled chicken, a slab of lean carne asada and 
some Baja-style shrimp. This is one kitchen that is not afraid to turn up the 
heat, by the way. The shrimp are especially piquant and peppery. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many other possibilities, should you wish to order more simply. 
Many, however, suffer from Rockin' Baja's obsession with excess. The pastas 
(huge portions, big enough for two) would be a lot better except for a careless 
overabundance of sauce and ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, rock shrimp Veracruz (among its ingredients: sauteed prawns, 
artichoke heart, cilantro, capers, olives) has nice flavors, but there is just 
too much of everything. Ditto the Santa Fe chicken, tossed with sweet peppers 
(in three colors, natch), red onions, cilantro and a jalapeno lime cream sauce. 
The good ingredients metamorphose into a vague mush. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, however, a few reasonably sized items you might consider. They 
include fine guacamole with chips and salsa, properly lean and grainy carnitas 
(have them in a taco shell) and tacos del patron: three tacos with fillings of 
lobster, seasoned shrimp and grilled beef. 
</P>
<P>
 The desserts are better left alone, particularly the gummy Key lime pie and 
the refrigerator-hard cheesecake. Of course, you can always try one of those 
after-dinner ice cream drinks. Don't worry, someone will remind you about them. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockin' Baja Lobster is moderately priced. Appetizers are $3.95 to $9.95. 
Pastas and burgers are $5.95 to $10.95. Party buckets are $11.95 to $25.95 (for 
two). * ROCKIN' BAJA LOBSTER

FULLERTON SHOPPES OFFER JOURNEY DOWN BRITISH AISLES 
</P>

<P>
 The Renaissance Pleasure Faire takes place weekends and Memorial Day through 
June 5 at Glen Helen Regional Park in Devore. You can get outfitted for the 
Elizabethan event and get in the mood with more than a little bit of the Brit, 
anytime in historic downtown Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon to 1: StairMasters were hardly the thing in the Renaissance, so start by 
cultivating that rotund look and jovial air: Eate, drinke and be merrye at the 
Olde Ship restaurant and bar. Better to keep in mind the belly-stretching 
turkey legs and shepherd's pie offered at the fair before you are fitted for 
your costume. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen entrees (most around $7.95) at the Olde Ship include steak 
and kidney pie, served with its delicate pastry on top; bangers and mash, 
British sausages with mashed potatoes and fried onions; Scottish bridie, 
beefsteak in whiskey sauce wrapped in pastry; and corned beef and cabbage, 
simmered in a "Guinness water liquor." Desserts change daily but often include 
an elaborately layered sherry trifle and a rhubarb crumble with custard. 
</P>
<P>
 Each dish is named for a seagoing vessel (Cutty Sark's Chicken Curry) or 
personage (Nelson's Cottage Pie). Dotting the walls are vintage naval prints: 
"Man o' War Firing Salute at Sunset," "Victory at Anchor in Spithead," and, 
near the restrooms, "I Told You So," depicting two frigates and a small 
outboard-motor boat -- it's British humor -- about to go over a waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Among 19 draft brews served are Fuller's E.S.B. (extra special bitter), 
Young's Ram Rod Ale and Murphy Stout. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also Blackthorne cider, Graham's "Six Grapes" port, and Harvey's 
Bristol and Savory & James cream sherries, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 1:45: OK, scratch all that about being realistically fitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the beautiful thing about the Renaissance," explained Chuck Van, owner 
of Unique Costume Rental. "Nothing was tailored -- you don't want to alter 
anything. Look at these sleeves. On some of the royalty gowns, they're four 
feet long and you could stick your head through any of the sleeve holes. This 
skirt has a drawstring; it'll fit any size waist from 15 to 40 inches. So why 
try it on? All these pieces, you can mix and match what you like." 
</P>
<P>
 There are hundreds of costumes to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
 For men, outfits include Louis XIII and King Henry VIII, musketeers and 
Franciscan monks, Robin Hood and beggars. For knights alone, there are mail 
coats, full sets of armor (made from fiberglass, $50 for the weekend), and 
leisure wear -- "for when they take their armor off," Van explained -- such as 
men's tunic outfits with pumpkin pants, tams and tights. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's peasant costumes come with skirt, blouse, shirt and bodice. "Royalty" 
outfits are fashioned from fake jewels, heavy-duty upholstery, velvet, satin 
and lame. "Most people rent the fancy stuff and buy the peasant outfits," Van 
said. A peasant blouse can be bought for as little as $20; royalty can run into 
several hundred dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Most weekend rentals -- pick it up Friday, bring it back Monday -- run between 
$25 and $35. "It's used; sometimes it's a little wore out," Van said. "But then 
at the Renaissance Faire, the worn-out look seems to be big." 
</P>
<P>
 1:45 to 2:15: You can find British antiques in any of several establishments 
within a block of the costume shop, including Kindred Co. and the Harbor 
Antique Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 I ducked into Snob Hill Antiques and Endearments, where, to the accompaniment 
of a canary named Chopin, I found a Georgian-era sterling silver chalice 
($1,095), twin Victorian crystal inkwells set side by side in silver ($1,000) 
and Edwardian muffin serving stands ($325). 
</P>
<P>
 2:15 to 3: If you have fewer discretionary funds and still want the mood to 
last, stop in at the British Grocer, off the courtyard of the pretty Villa del 
Sol, before heading home. It has the same owner as the Olde Ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Take home a box or two of Walker's Pure Butter Shortbread Petticoat Tails or 
Cocktail Oatcakes. McVitie's biscuits include "oatey, crunchy" Hob-Nobs and 
others made from wheat meal called Digestive. Marmite, a yeast extract, is 
purportedly delicious "when spread thinly on toast." Licorice Allsorts come in 
all sorts of shapes and garish colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott's Porage Oats is the official breakfast of the Royal Highland Games 
(Braemar Gathering), and the box sports a kilted, shotputting Scotsman. Along 
the same wall are Burgess Genuine Anchovy Essence, a selection of mince meats 
for use as a pie filling or as hot sauce for ice cream, lemon curds, and ginger 
and orange suet pudding. 
</P>
<P>
 Just plain shredded vegetable suet, gluten-free from Ashland, can be found in 
the refrigerated section, as can black treacle, ideal for treacle tarts, toffee 
and gingerbread. English cheeses include Leicester, Double Gloucester and 
Caerphilly. In the freezer awaits a cake-like concoction called Spotted Dick. 
</P>
<P>
 Among books are the "Country Life Book of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother," 
and another titled more simply, "The Queen." Teapots come in a wide variety of 
floral patterns; a few show scenes from Shakespeare plays. Soaps are 
illustrated with moments from Beatrix Potter stories designed to last for the 
life of the bar.

FROM $650,000 O.C. HOUSE TO WELFARE LINE; FINANCES: DESPITE ASSETS INCLUDING A 
$7,700 WATCH, SUSIE HERNANDEZ APPLIES FOR AFDC, AUTHORITIES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When times were better and the money was flowing, Susie Hernandez had a 
$400,000 jewelry collection, a fleet of luxury cars at her disposal, a 12-room 
house in Mission Viejo and the expectation that she could travel with her 
husband, Danny, wherever she pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent weeks, with her husband in prison, Susie Hernandez has appeared 
so desperate for money that the former socialite has sold the shrubbery and 
palm trees from her yard, stripped the house of its light fixtures and built-in 
appliances, and even made off with the garbage disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, she was sentenced to 16 months in federal prison for income tax 
evasion, while her husband got 71 months for his role in a scheme to divert 
nearly $9 million from the precious metals company where he worked. 
</P>
<P>
 And after sentencing, authorities say, Susie Hernandez applied for welfare in 
an effort to support her children while she and her husband serve their prison 
terms. She is due to report to prison May 23 but has asked for a delay so she 
can attend her son's kindergarten graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a district attorney's investigator with the welfare fraud unit came 
across Susie Hernandez's application for Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children, a program that provides money for the care of needy children whose 
parents are absent, disabled, dead or unemployed. The Hernandezes have a 
daughter, Amanda, 7, and a son, Nick, 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigator, Pam Reighard, contacted the U.S. attorney's office in Santa 
Ana and asked for information about Susie Hernandez's income. Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Stephen Wolfe sent over a four-page list of the family's assets as of 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Reighard said she could neither confirm nor deny whether Susie Hernandez had 
applied for benefits. However, Wolfe said Reighard told him last week that she 
had remembered the Hernandez name from newspaper accounts and confirmed that 
Susie had applied for welfare benefits on behalf of her children. Susie 
Hernandez could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely that the Hernandezes would qualify for aid. A family with more 
than $1,000 in assets, such as bank accounts, stocks or real estate, is 
ineligible for benefits. Clothing and furniture do not count toward income, but 
jewelry -- other than family heirlooms and wedding rings -- do. 
</P>
<P>
 "One Piaget watch of Susie's is worth $7,000 alone," Wolfe said. "I doubt 
she'd qualify for welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 The list of assets included the Piaget watch ($7,700 on sale when it was 
purchased 10 years ago), a Chanel watch given as a Christmas gift and a Turkish 
coin bracelet from Susie Hernandez's parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The assets also included Danny Hernandez's 31 Giorgio Armani ties, 20 new 
Armani shirts, eight new Armani suits and seven new Armani sports jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost none of the property, including the furniture, was confiscated, because 
federal agents didn't think it was worth the effort to try and sell it. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are upset with the Hernandezes' behavior and years of free spending 
say it is outrageous that they would apply for welfare after squandering a 
fortune on country club memberships and Rolls-Royces. But those who sympathize 
with the family say it appears they are so broke that they have no other 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Politeo Freeman, Susie Hernandez's deputy public defender, said she had 
not heard directly from her client about her welfare application, but that such 
an action would not surprise her, nor would it be it inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The family's fairly destitute, and Susie is trying to arrange for the 
guardianship of her children," Freeman said. "If she's trying for benefits, 
then they'd be for the children. The proper view of all this may be that she's 
making arrangements for the care and feeding of her children because there's no 
other income." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman said Susie Hernandez is still trying to decide who will take care of 
her children while she's in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe, who prosecuted the case against the Hernandezes, said Susie Hernandez's 
behavior never ceases to amaze him. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is part and parcel of the way she has behaved since her arrest," he 
said. "She has shown no remorse. Her personality is more manipulative than 
honest by nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Susie Hernandez has made another enemy in Pacific National Bank, which 
foreclosed on the family's $650,000 Mission Viejo home in February and evicted 
her in April. 
</P>
<P>
 A bank executive visited the home the day after she moved out and found that 
refrigerators, cabinets, entertainment centers and a microwave oven -- all of 
which the bank owned -- had been removed. The official also found that outside 
plants were dug up and taken, and all the drapes had disappeared. The garbage 
disposal also was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank filed a police report on April 9, and damages to the house are 
estimated at $13,500. The bank had given Susie Hernandez $2,000 to leave the 
house in good order. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Petry, vice president and general counsel for Pacific National Bank, 
said Susie Hernandez's personal attorney has argued that the house was left in 
good order. The $2,000, she was informed, would not be returned.

MORE O.C. BRIDGES FACE QUAKE TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hundreds of additional bridges throughout California may need retrofitting, 
officials disclosed Wednesday, raising fears that a proposed $2-billion bond 
issue may not cover the cost of strengthening highway overpasses for earthquake 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning from a Senate budget committee, Caltrans Director James van 
Loben Sels said at least 80% of the bridges that have been screened so far to 
determine their susceptibility to earthquake damage have been found to need 
retrofitting. He said the number is much higher than what Caltrans estimated 
when it projected the costs and scope of its seismic retrofitting program. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he said, the agency has found an additional 700 bridges that 
need to be examined for earthquake vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that the state will probably be retrofitting at least 2,200 
bridges, but it currently has funding for only about half that many repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 700 structures targeted for further examination, 70 are scattered 
throughout Orange County, said Maureena Duran-Rojas, a public information 
officer for Caltrans in Santa Ana. That number is likely to increase as 
additional examinations are conducted, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 70 bridges, 51 already have been scheduled for retrofitting and are on 
the list to receive state funds, Duran-Rojas said. Nine of those bridges are on 
the San Diego Freeway and four are on the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Loben Sels' disclosure prompted an angry outburst from Senate 
Transportation Committee Chairman Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), who 
complained that the Wilson Administration has been deliberately downplaying the 
number of bridges that need retrofitting to avoid jeopardizing the passage of 
the bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of California haven't been told that there is a substantial amount 
of additional money which will be needed to retrofit and make safe (highway 
bridges)," Kopp said. "Let's assume the bond issue is approved. We're still 
going to need more money." 
</P>
<P>
 But Van Loben Sels argued that it is too early to tell how much money will be 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the bridges screened so far are those in the Los Angeles and San 
Francisco Bay areas and were considered most vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 The retrofitting program, initiated after bridges collapsed in the 1971 Sylmar 
quake, has been a sensitive political issue in Sacramento ever since the 
October, 1989, Loma Prieta earthquake knocked down part of the Nimitz Freeway 
in Oakland and a section of the San Francisco Bay Bridge. A board of inquiry 
determined that the retrofitting program had moved too slowly and been 
underfunded. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, six bridges -- none of them retrofitted -- collapsed in the 
Northridge earthquake, again raising questions that cost concerns and competing 
transit projects had slowed the program. A Los Angeles Times report found that 
80% of the state's most earthquake-vulnerable bridges still had not been 
strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson responded by accelerating the program and calling for a bond 
issue that he said would pay retrofitting costs without sacrificing other 
transportation programs or requiring an immediate tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The state already had set aside $750 million in its gasoline-tax-financed 
transportation program to cover the costs of retrofitting 1,039 bridges that 
were considered susceptible to earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency had made no provisions to pay the costs of retrofitting toll 
bridges and another 1,500 overpasses that were in the process of being screened 
to determine how many required strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials estimated that 1,000 of the bridges in this group would 
require retrofitting, at a cost of $1 billion. But subsequent screening 
indicated that 1,200 would probably need strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, another 700 bridges were identified as needing screening. 
Caltrans officials said they expect the retrofitting of any of these bridges to 
be relatively minor, compared to the cost of $1 million per bridge for earlier 
retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond issue, which goes before voters in June, would provide $950 million 
for the strengthening of about 1,000 highway overpasses and seven toll bridges. 
Officials in the Wilson Administration have been strong backers of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp contended that the existing funding and the bond issue will not cover the 
retrofitting costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk West, president of the California Chamber of Commerce and a leader of the 
campaign to pass the bond issue, said that even if Kopp's projections are 
correct, they do not minimize the need for the bond issue.

CASINO OWNER'S DAUGHTER TELLS OF KIDNAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. LA GANGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a rare public glimpse of the vulnerable side of this city's wealthy 
gambling Establishment, the daughter of casino mogul Steven A. Wynn testified 
Wednesday that kidnapers photographed her in her underwear and threatened to 
distribute the pictures nationally if her father contacted police instead of 
paying her ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Wynn, 27, described being grabbed in her kitchen by two masked men last 
July, blindfolded, posed and photographed with a tall assailant whom she could 
not see. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shorter one said, 'You are my insurance,' " Wynn testified, visibly 
shaken. "I thought I'd take off my clothes, and I'd be raped. I said, 'Please 
don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me.' . . . I was shaking. I was petrified." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Marion Cuddy, 48, and Jacob Sherwood, 22, are charged with extortion and 
money laundering in the July 26 assault, whose aftermath has riveted Las Vegas' 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But in federal court Wednesday, Sherwood's attorney said that Irvine real 
estate agent Spyro Kemble, 37, not Sherwood, was involved in the attack on 
Nevada's wealthiest family. Kemble did not return telephone calls seeking 
comment, but his father disputed the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "This implication of Spyro's complicity is just (bull)," said Donn Kemble, a 
Newport Beach attorney. Cuddy is a longtime family friend of the Kembles, and 
owed Spyro $20,000. "Spyro was as surprised about this as I was. Spyro was not 
an accomplice to anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is unfolding in America's flashiest city, a gambling mecca 
beleaguered by mounting casino holdups -- 10 increasingly brazen attacks in the 
last two years, two within 48 hours of each other less than two weeks ago. Los 
Angeles gang members are suspects in half of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Jittery casino owners met last week with police and gambling authorities and 
are fortifying their cash-rich operations and evaluating just how to keep the 
increasing violence at bay -- a process that began nine months earlier at 
properties owned by Mirage Resorts, the sprawling company headed by Steven 
Wynn. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Las Vegas saw a remarkable side of the imposing and take-charge 
chief executive, who was rated by Fortune magazine in 1993 as the top-paid 
chief executive in the nation. In a shaking voice, Wynn described what it was 
like to get the phone call informing him that his daughter, his "particularly 
close buddy," was in mortal danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was frightened beyond description and very confused," Wynn said. "Your 
brain is jumbled. Your brain doesn't function. I knew I needed help. I felt if 
I used my cellular phone (to call for help), they could hear me and it would 
mean her death." 
</P>
<P>
 On July 26, after a normal day's work in the retail operations of Mirage 
Resorts, Kevin Wynn worked out at the Mirage Hotel gym and dined with her 
family. She walked into her home at 10 p.m. and was grabbed by two masked men 
who had been waiting for her. 
</P>
<P>
 The men covered her eyes with cotton balls and tape and forced her to strip 
down to her panties, according to testimony Wednesday. They placed dark 
sunglasses over her blindfold so that she would appear in the pictures as a 
willing participant. They posed her several times with the taller of the two 
suspects in the dining alcove of her condominium and threatened to make the 
photographs public if the authorities were called. 
</P>
<P>
 They called her father, who had just pulled into the driveway of his home. In 
eerie detail, Wynn described how he returned to the Mirage Hotel and Casino, 
where, standing in the middle of a bustling gambling hall, he took ransom 
instructions by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling himself Voss, one of the kidnapers demanded $2.5 million, at which 
point Wynn became angry and argued about how much cash the casino kept in its 
vault -- $1.45 million in $100 bills on that particular night -- and how he 
could get access to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was new money stacked there like bricks," he said of the white plastic bag 
he was eventually given in full sight of the casino guests. "It was very dense. 
It was heavy. . . . I held it like a baby with my arms around it" and walked 
through the hotel to his car. 
</P>
<P>
 After the ransom was delivered, Steven Wynn was given directions on how to 
find his daughter in the parking lot at McCarran International Airport, where 
she was left unharmed after midnight in her black, late-model Audi. 
</P>
<P>
 Two friends had met him there in a separate car, but he insisted on going up 
to Kevin's Audi alone. "Whatever I was going to find in the car, it was going 
to be me doing it," he said. "But after three steps, I couldn't do it. I was so 
mortified. I called her name. 'Kevin.' From the back seat of the car, she said, 
'Dad, is that really you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Cuddy, the alleged mastermind of the kidnaping, is a former circus 
performer, black jack dealer and Newport Beach and Las Vegas health club 
manager with a hankering for fancy sports cars. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 27, the day after the kidnaping, Cuddy returned to California to "take 
his place among the rich and famous of Newport Beach," said Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Tom O'Connell in his opening statement Wednesday. Cuddy was arrested 
there Aug. 2 while arranging the final cash payment for a Ferrari Testarosa, 
with a price tag of nearly $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Spyro Kemble was not there during the arrest, he had gone with Cuddy 
earlier to purchase the wedge-shaped white car, Dan Albregts, Sherwood's 
attorney, said in his opening statement. In addition, $500,000 of the ransom 
money was found in the garage of Kemble's Newport Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble was never arrested in the case and is expected to testify for the 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Albregts said evidence points to Spyro Kemble as the man who drove Kevin Wynn 
to the airport and left her. But after Kemble was questioned by authorities, 
"the FBI goes on a Jacob Sherwood chase, and Spyro Kemble is left behind as a 
witness in the Newport Beach part of the trial," Albregts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor O'Connell would not comment on the defense attorney's assertions 
about Kemble. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell told the court that on the day before the kidnaping, Cuddy was 
"emotionally broken." 
</P>
<P>
 He had won a civil court judgment for $500,000 against Edward G. Baker, his 
partner in the Newport Beach Sporting House before it closed in 1989, but the 
judgment had been reversed on appeal. He had borrowed a total of $50,000 from 
his two best friends so that he could survive; now he could not pay it back. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks before the kidnaping, Albregts told the court, Kemble had called 
Cuddy to talk about getting the money back. The day of the kidnaping, Albregts 
said, Cuddy "told his son, 'I'm going to California to pay off a friend." 
</P>
<P>
 When Cuddy arrived in Newport Beach after the kidnaping, Albregts said, he 
bought a closet full of clothes and took a suite at the Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spyro Kemble's credit card got him that room," Albregts said. "Cuddy was in 
Kemble's Mercedes when he was arrested." 
</P>
<P>
 Donn Kemble said he and his son were shocked when notified of the case by the 
FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say Ray's been arrested and they'd impounded Spyro's car," Kemble said. 
"I look at one of the agents and ask what the hell did Ray do? He said Ray 
kidnaped someone. I laughed. That's how far off it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Donn Kemble said last August that he and his son first met Cuddy in 1979. At 
the time, Cuddy managed the Newport Beach Sporting House, an athletic club that 
Donn and Spyro Kemble frequented, Donn Kemble said then. For a time, Spyro 
Kemble worked for Cuddy at the club, Donn Kemble said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spyro Kemble now rents a real estate office in a building on MacArthur 
Boulevard in Irvine. He is a licensed real estate broker, said Ann Shawver, 
spokeswoman for the California Department of Real Estate. His license is in 
good standing and expires in 1996, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Paul Watkins, 20, an accomplice in the kidnaping, has pleaded guilty 
to extortion and is expected to testify as the trial continues over the next 
two weeks.

A TIGHT PAIR: MAN AND HIS JEANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hard to separate a man and his blue jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Guys become attached to jeans the way they might to a car or favorite baseball 
team. Whether loyal to their Levi's or hooked on designer jeans such as Calvin 
Klein and Versace, men who otherwise could not care less about fashion have 
definite opinions on jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Some like them tight; some like them loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Some won't spend more than $20 on a pair; others fork out $200 for the 
privilege of displaying a status label on their backsides. 
</P>
<P>
 Men hate to part with an old pair of jeans. They treasure their jeans' worn 
places and faded blue. Years of wear will transform a man's jeans into a frayed 
and faded garment as individual as his thumbprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no other jeans incite more devotion in a man than Levi's 501s. 
</P>
<P>
 Locals Only, a vintage clothing store in Laguna Beach, sells only pre-worn 
Levi's 501s (see story on page 4). The fascination with Levi's stems from their 
history, says Larry Craig, owner of Locals Only. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a whole Levi mystique of the Wild West. They're very masculine, and 
they're American-made," Craig says. "People identify with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Such devotion would amaze Levi Strauss, a Bavarian immigrant who arrived in 
San Francisco in 1853 during the height of the gold rush and found his fortune 
in jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Strauss was operating a dry goods store when he hit upon the idea of making 
sturdy pants for miners in the 1870s. Before long he'd run out of the 
heavyweight brown canvas he'd imported from Bavaria and began making his pants 
out of denim, so named because the fabric came from Nimes, France, and was 
called serge de Nimes, later shortened to just denim.  
</P>
<P>
 (The word jeans comes from the twilled cotton cloth, similar to denim, used to 
make work pants in Genoa, Italy. Genoa was shortened to genes, and became jeans 
when translated into English.) 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long before Levi's became popular with cowboys -- who would sit in 
horse troughs filled with water to get the pants to shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 To add to the Levi's lore, Levi Strauss & Co. recently held a contest to find 
the oldest pair of blue jeans in the United States. The winner, Heath Rackley 
of Lubbock, Tex., found a pair at the bottom of a Nevada silver mine that date 
to the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeans have since evolved into a high-fashion item, with Calvin Klein, Gianni 
Versace and just about every major designer delving into denim. 
</P>
<P>
 Versace's line of couture jeans is hot with young, fashion-forward men, says 
William Kennedy, sales representative for Bernini Sport in South Coast Plaza, 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're buying a certain aura with those jeans," Kennedy says. That certain 
aura comes with a price: about $200 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
 The line ranges from a basic indigo or solid black denim jeans with Versace's 
trademark leather patch and gold Medusa head on the back ($195) to a wild pair 
printed all over with colorful crosses ($225). One navy pair has rainbow-hued 
thread used for the double top-stitching ($185). 
</P>
<P>
 Though jeans were once considered working pants, they're now worn everywhere 
with practically anything, Kennedy says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men come in here and buy $1,200 cashmere sport coats, and they're going to 
wear them with jeans," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fashion rebels still wear jeans two or three sizes too large, but most 
men want jeans with a narrow yet comfortable fit, says Elie Kevorkian, menswear 
buyer for Politix in Fashion Island Newport Beach. Among Politix's best-selling 
brands: Diesel, Rivet, Big Star and Fire Trap ($60 to $145). The jeans come 
dyed in the season's neutral hues such as stone, brown, hunter green and beige, 
but nothing beats a faded indigo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men like their jeans to look worn," Kevorkian says. 
</P>
<P>
 Trendy colors and designer names don't matter to at least one segment of the 
jeans-wearing population. 
</P>
<P>
 "My customer is the true jeans customer. He's very resistant to change," says 
Alexa Garrell, vice president and menswear buyer for the Grant Boys in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the older guys are die-hards," she says. "We have guys come in and 
buy the same jeans they wore in high school. If they wore boot-cut jeans, they 
want boot-cut." Wranglers and Levis are top sellers at the Grant Boys, and they 
go for $20 to $30 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the gold miners before them, many guys want jeans just for work. Dino 
Katsiametis, owner of Denim Blue in Garden Grove and Anaheim, says, "Levi's are 
working pants and always have been." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether chosen for function or fashion, jeans have become a staple of most 
men's wardrobes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeans are like a uniform," Craig says. "They always look good on guys, and 
every guy has three or four pairs in various degrees of fading."

A SAFETY NET FOR EMPLOYEES WITH KIDS; FAMILY: KNOWING THAT A CHILD-CARE MIX-UP 
CAN KEEP A WORKING PARENT AT HOME -- AND CUT PRODUCTIVITY -- A GROWING NUMBER 
OF COMPANIES ARE OFFERING BACKUP ASSISTANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jane Sherburne was an ambitious junior associate at the venerable Washington 
law firm of Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering nine years ago -- and she was also the 
mother of a 4-year-old boy. The day Hurricane Gloria thundered through the 
capital, closing Ben's nursery school, her entire professional future flashed 
-- and nearly crashed -- before her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 In desperation, because two of Sherburne's partners needed her help and 
because Ben's father was out of town, she brought the child to work. Busied 
with coloring books, Legos and a stern lecture to be quiet or Mom's career was 
history, Ben was doing fine while his mother and her colleagues stewed over 
their papers at a conference table. Their concentration was abruptly shattered 
when a tiny voice piped up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 Sherburne, now a partner at the law firm and the mother of two more children, 
still shudders at the memory: 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched one of my partners. This shiver started in his toes and went right 
up to his face. I thought it was the end of my career." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it was the beginning of one of the country's first backup child-care 
centers. Nearly a decade later, as large and small businesses alike follow 
suit, the Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering facility is cited as the model for a 
slice of the work/family menu that is now regarded not as corporate 
benevolence, but as economic necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 Backup child care has become "a business imperative," said Susan Seitel, who 
edits a Minneapolis-based periodical called the Work/Family Newsbrief. "It's 
all about billable hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Few organizations are prepared to minister on-site to sick children. But a 
growing number of companies have recognized that if an employee can't get to 
work because of a glitch in child care, it's money down the corporate drain. No 
one has come up with an exact number, but more and more businesses are setting 
aside on-site space to provide temporary child care in emergency situations. 
</P>
<P>
 As the newest piece of the work/family equation, backup child care remains 
chiefly the province of big, successful companies or small, forward-thinking 
enterprises. Those who have embraced it are adamant that backup child care is 
vital to the modern work force. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not about philosophy," said Ellen Reynolds, a managing director at 
Bankers Trust in New York. "It's about productivity, productivity, 
productivity." 
</P>
<P>
 The two backup child-care centers at the Bankers Trust buildings in Manhattan 
and in Jersey City, N.J., turned out to be a godsend when a number of local 
schools were closed during an asbestos scare, Reynolds said. Bankers Trust is 
also part of a consortium of Manhattan financial organizations that share a 
larger backup center on Wall Street, accommodating up to 40 children from 3 
months to 12 years old at a nominal hourly cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether we're talking about a secretary or a senior-level manager, we know 
we're at a loss if that person doesn't come to work because of a child-care 
problem," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone would say this is a soft and fuzzy place," she added. 
"We're very lean and mean and tough. But where possible, we try to provide 
people with some crutches to get over the hard spots." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when the subject is day care, said Richard Stolley, this awareness is 
confined to a narrow stratum of American business. Stolley, founder of People 
magazine, is now a senior editorial adviser at Time Warner Inc. He also serves 
on the board of directors of the Child Care Action Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Stolley travels the country to meet with top executives. "You start talking 
about on-site child care to businessmen -- and even businesswomen -- and they 
turn white," he said. "They don't want to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 A major problem in even introducing a discussion of on-site child care -- 
backup or otherwise -- among most employers is that "at the level where the 
decisions have to be made, few of those involved have ever wrestled with the 
problem." With the bottom line on their minds, "what they're really looking for 
is empirical studies," Stolley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, survey after survey shows backup child care to be a source of employee 
anxiety, said Judi Presser of Work/Family Directions. The Boston consulting 
firm has found "people reporting that they miss up to one to three days of work 
per month" because of child-care emergencies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees say they have no role models, since no previous generation has seen 
so many single mothers or working couples in the labor force, Presser said. A 
near-universal lament is that workers are unprepared when their baby-sitters 
get sick, have an accident on the way to work or quit on a moment's notice. 
Unexpected school closings also wreak domestic havoc -- and even predictable 
holidays can throw working families into a tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
 Working parents have "this kind of card-house arrangement that we have 
struggled so hard to build," said Seitel of Work/Family Newsbrief. "A 
child-care failure of any kind just knocks down all the cards." 
</P>
<P>
 But many parents put on child-care blinders, Seitel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is just perfect until something goes wrong," she said. "And we 
pretend that it's not going to happen to us." 
</P>
<P>
 As the working parents of two children, Mayer and Sharon Berg of Minneapolis 
were only too familiar with the potholes that even the most perfect child-care 
arrangements can encounter. Six and a half years ago, they turned the nightmare 
of necessity into a dream invention called Club Kid, catering to families whose 
child care has suddenly cratered. From 7:30 a.m. until midnight children from 
18 months to 10 years old can now dance, finger-paint or operate computers at 
five facilities in the Twin Cities area. 
</P>
<P>
 "With so many working parents and the way things have been going, there was 
definitely a need," Berg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Platt, the director of work/family services at Time Warner in New York, 
said her company's financial overseers have not quibbled with the $400,000 it 
costs each year to subsidize Time's backup child-care facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never done a cost-benefit analysis," Platt said. "You can add it up 
yourself and see the savings, never mind the improved morale." 
</P>
<P>
 Top-echelon executives and junior-level clerks are equally likely to use the 
services on an upper floor of the Time-Life tower, said Patti Maltese, manager 
of the 1 1/2-year-old center. Up to 30 children per day may use the backup 
program, Maltese said; each employee parent is entitled to send a child there 
for free for up to 20 days in a calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids love it," Maltese said. "It's like going to work with Mom or Dad." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Cal-Tot Child Care Center in the Ronald Reagan State Office Building in 
Downtown Los Angeles, assistant director Lalila Rivera reported a similar 
chorus of enthusiasm from parents in the City Hall vicinity. Cal-Tot is open 
weekdays from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., and state employees are given priority for the 
80 full-time child-care slots that are available to children from six weeks to 
six years of age. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera said parents can call to see if there are openings when the need for 
backup child care arises. Per-day prices vary, depending on the child's age. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have started this a long time ago," said Rivera, pointing to the 
decline in employee absentee rates since backup care became an option. "I think 
every building should have one." 
</P>
<P>
 Backup child care also turns out to be a leveling experience. At the staid 
Manhattan law firm of Cravath, Swain and Moore, attorneys who were born in 
three-piece suits trip over Brio trains in the firm's backup care facility 
right alongside the parents who are secretaries and mail clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the great equalizer," said Barbie White, who runs the backup care center 
at Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 White giggled impishly, as if to concede that corporate attorneys are not 
always known as a fun bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's neat to watch the attorneys turn into parents," White said.

THE HEATHER CHRONICLES; JUST WHO IS THIS WOMAN WHO HAS CAPTURED THE HEART OF 
SENATE LEADER GEORGE MITCHELL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALDINE BAUM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps it is a love story, this tale of the senator and his bride-to-be. But 
if so, it is more a mystery than romance novel. 
</P>
<P>
 What is known, for sure, is this: 
</P>
<P>
 George Mitchell, who is three heartbeats away from the presidency as majority 
leader of the U.S. Senate, has made three decisions: 
</P>
<P>
 He is leaving the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 He is turning down a chance to be on the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 And he is marrying a woman he met last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the time they met, in fact, both George Mitchell and Heather MacLachlan 
had both reached milestones. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, a senator for 15 years, had marked his 60th birthday in August by 
climbing the highest mountain in Maine. MacLachlan, a sports marketing manager, 
had turned 35 in January and shortly thereafter told a reporter she was ready 
to settle down after 15 years on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 In most press reports MacLachlan's identity has been reduced to who she works 
for -- her boss who also happens to be her last boyfriend, tennis manager Ion 
Tiriac, a colorful character and ex-player from Romania who contrasts with the 
seemingly colorless senator from Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, they assume the senator found himself a cupcake -- a pretty 
young thing with a racy past. In the world of tennis, they assume the lady 
landed herself a big fish -- an old guy with money and power. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't tell nearly enough. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more to Heather MacLachlan than her last lover and more to George 
Mitchell than his access to the President. Apparently she and the Senator have 
a private vision of their lives together that might make him as much a trophy 
husband as she a trophy wife. MacLachlan is vying to be CEO of women's tennis 
as hard as Mitchell is campaigning to be baseball commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's getting ahead of their game, by quite a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First, there is the life of Heather MacLachlan. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she has spent most of her career spoon-feeding sports writers on behalf 
of her clients, she has refused to take reporters' calls since the announcement 
of her engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 "She doesn't want a story about her," says David Gogal, a Washington 
consultant who has advised Tiriac on lobbying on Capitol Hill, and as a favor 
to MacLachlan has agreed to pass out her resume to an overheated press. 
</P>
<P>
 According to that sketchy resume, MacLachlan was born Jan. 20, 1959, in 
Montreal, and has a mother and two brothers who still live there. She has 
managed athletes -- mostly tennis players -- and marketed sporting events. She 
is an "avid sports fan" and "enjoys skiing, skating and swimming. Her interests 
include music and literature." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no mention of her education. It does not say whether she plays tennis 
like her fiance -- or speaks Romanian. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews with associates, friends and sports writers give a fuller profile 
of MacLachlan, though most people who say they have known her for years admit 
they really know very little about her. 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus is that MacLachlan is friendly, professional and appealing -- 
but distant. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLachlan first turned up in the tennis world in 1980, a sophisticated young 
woman who spoke English, French, Italian and German and who seemed worldly 
beyond her years. Her first job was in the small Paris office of the Assn. of 
Tennis Professionals; later she worked at tennis marketing companies, 
eventually helping to run the men's tour in Europe in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a very attractive woman out there on her own going from tournament to 
tournament dealing with the tennis media in Europe, the most notorious group of 
philanderers you can imagine," recalls one man who worked with her back then 
and asks to remains anonymous. "Heather had to fend them off and she always 
handled herself professionally." 
</P>
<P>
 A tall, slim woman with long dark hair that she often wears pulled back, 
MacLachlan was known by her conservative clothes, often silk tailored suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "One writer, I remember, once said to me, 'Why does Heather always dress like 
a schoolmarm?' " recalls the same man. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, MacLachlan moved into increasingly responsible jobs in sports 
marketing until 1986 when she hooked up with Tiriac, an outrageous yet 
brilliant manager whose greatest accomplishment might have been discovering and 
nurturing Boris Becker into a world-class tennis player. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLachlan, who along the way became Tiriac's girlfriend, was an essential 
part of his team, running his office in New York, serving as a go-between for 
Becker, the media and Tiriac. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you wanted to talk to Boris or Ion you went through Heather," says another 
sports marketing agent. "Ion cut the deals and Heather carried them out." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1987 Sports Illustrated profile of Tiriac, MacLachlan was quoted a few 
times, usually interpreting his behavior or explaining his eccentric habits -- 
as a player his daily breakfast included six steaks, four bowls of pasta and a 
dozen eggs.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ion has become his own aura," she told SI. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiriac, a high liver who says he eats caviar by the handfuls, was also known 
to eat glass as a party trick, according to NBC tennis commentator Bud Collins, 
who claims to have actually witnessed such behavior. "He would crunch away," 
says Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLachlan seemed always to be Tiriac's stabilizing force. And always, he 
overshadowed her, say people who were around them.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you would get her away from business, Heather could be very funny, witty 
and loosen up," says a sports writer who knew MacLachlan pre-Tiriac. "But she 
wasn't like that around Ion. She was very cool around him. Very discreet. You'd 
never know they had a relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Although their personal relationship ended sometime in 1992, say various 
friends, MacLachlan still runs his company.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet recently she has sought recognition as an agent independent of Tiriac that 
would vault her out of his shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tennis Week listed the 10 most important women in women's tennis, they 
excluded MacLachlan -- perhaps because most of her work has been in men's 
tennis through Tiriac's company, T-V Enterprises, which has run only a few 
women's tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLachlan complained about the omission in a letter to Tennis Week and in the 
Feb. 10 issue the magazine expanded the list to include MacLachlan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Heather would have made it without Tiriac in the business world," 
says one admirer. "She's bright and assertive and not just about tennis -- but 
about people and about the world." 
</P>
<P>
 But even that admirer was stunned that she went from a dashing European 
womanizer like Tiriac to George Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A bespectacled lawyer from Waterville, Me., Mitchell has accumulated power in 
the U.S. Senate quietly, efficiently -- and relentlessly. He is now considered 
President Clinton's key ally in passing some form of health-care legislation 
this year. And he is apparently the only glue holding Congress together in that 
effort these days. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his social life, Mitchell is not typical of the Grab-and-Grope Senate 
Club. (According to one observer, Mitchell tried to pick up a woman last year 
by engaging her in a conversation about health care.) 
</P>
<P>
 Divorced in 1987, Mitchell is said to consider his ex-wife, Sally, his closest 
friend and when he won the contest for majority leader a year later he said she 
was the first person he called. He is also extremely close to his grown 
daughter, Andrea, a social worker, and family -- a sister and three brothers -- 
in Maine. During the 1992 Democratic convention in New York he turned down 
princely accommodations and stayed in an ordinary hotel room so he could afford 
to pay for his whole family to stay near him. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mitchell is not a stay-at-home wallflower. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, long before Republican Mary Matalin and Democrat James Carville were 
breaking Washington tradition by cross-pollinating, Mitchell was quietly dating 
Janet Mullins, a high-ranking George Bush aide. Their relationship didn't make 
the gossip columns often but many Washington insiders were shocked at the 
potential betrayal to party affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Mullins, Mitchell has dated several other women, often quite 
younger than him, according to friends. But in all the smarmy, gossipy 
conversations that circulate in Washington, Mitchell rarely gets smeared. 
Rather, he is known as a gracious gentleman who can be lively if a topic 
interests him -- though he is not known as the most entertaining politico 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 He apparently met MacLachlan through Tiriac who became active lobbying on 
Capitol Hill to help Romania get most-favored nation status after the 1989 fall 
of Nicolae Ceausescu.  
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, a dedicated amateur tennis player, became well-acquainted with 
Tiriac and last September Tiriac apparently offered to help the senator get 
tickets to the U.S. Open in New York. In late September Mitchell got in touch 
with MacLachlan about the tickets and although it is unclear whether they 
actually met in New York or Washington their relationship began sometime in the 
early fall.  
</P>
<P>
 One version has MacLachlan coming to Washington after the U.S. Open and 
calling Mitchell when her plans were suddenly canceled. They had dinner and 
their courtship began. What is known for sure is that on Nov. 23, George 
Mitchell took MacLachlan to a White House dinner. But how these two wildly busy 
and traveling professionals -- she's in Europe most of the time -- conducted an 
intense relationship is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 And they're not talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Their liaison has been so discreet that even the President, who Mitchell in 
effect spurned by walking away from the Senate and a possible Supreme Court 
nomination, was taken by surprise when he learned of the engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am praying for the large-mindedness to forgive George Mitchell for 
retiring," Clinton teased at a Democratic Party dinner in Washington on April 
23. "I didn't have it figured out until he announced his engagement . . . This 
is the method behind his madness." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite convoluted theories of why he's walking away, Mitchell has 
repeatedly insisted that marriage and MacLachlan were not behind his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe he wants to have cocktails at 7 instead of a caucus?" says one longtime 
political associate. "Maybe he wants to earn money. You know the baseball 
commissioner gets $1 million?" 
</P>
<P>
 (In fact, the politics of baseball these days makes what is business-as-usual 
in Washington look like student government. Although Mitchell is being pushed 
for the job, it will remain unclear for awhile if the 28 owners will actually 
give it to him, according to sources.) 
</P>
<P>
 All along, Mitchell has simply said he's ready for "other challenges." 
</P>
<P>
 At a tribute to him at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel Monday night, 
Mitchell waxed eloquent about the joys of public life but made it clear he had 
had it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I entered the Senate 15 years ago, I made the decision that I would not 
remain in the Senate for life -- even if I had the opportunity to do so," he 
told a L.A. Times reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "My conception is that one should not serve on a permanent lifetime basis. 
That it's healthier for the institution, the society and the individual to have 
change. And therefore the only question for me was when would the time be 
appropriate for me to leave. And I decided that this is an appropriate time." 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing relaxed, Mitchell was quite sanguine about the nosing around his 
personal life.  
</P>
<P>
 MacLachlan, on the other hand, told Bud Collins last week that she was upset 
about being reduced to a stereotype -- the bimbo on a stick or a set piece to 
Mitchell's career. 
</P>
<P>
 No one understands that she and the senator are in love, she told Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's tempted to call a press conference of her own," says Collins, with a 
knowing old-timer's laugh. "But I don't think so.";

BURIED TREASURES; MUSEUMS ARE CASHING IN ON ANCIENT RICHES WITH A DIZZYING 
ARRAY OF REPRODUCTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The burnished gold bracelets and jewel-encrusted rings once worn by an ancient 
Nubian queen brought shivers to the people who run the Metropolitan Museum of 
Art. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of cashing in on the traveling exhibit of riches unearthed from 
the tomb of Queen Amanishakheto -- who ruled in the First Century BC in what is 
now Sudan -- almost made them drool. But the two German museums that own the 
jewels said nein earlier this year to the Met's money-making idea, dashing any 
dreams of minting and selling reproductions of the 200-piece collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to know if donors will come through with a promised gift or whether 
the government will continue to give you money," says Lisa Koch, 
general-merchandise manager for the New York City museum. Selling 
reproductions, on the other hand, provides a reliable income, she says. "It's 
not a panacea, but it's a way to meet the budget shortfall." 
</P>
<P>
 With so many other institutions in the same position, consumers can now choose 
from a dizzying array of items with roots in ancient Greece, the pre-Columbian 
Americas and czarist Russia, to name a few. The market for such jewelry has at 
least doubled in the last few years, say museum representatives and jewelry 
makers, who believe the trend taps into a desire for unusual, historical and 
ethnic designs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting stampeded now with requests for reproductions from museums all 
over the world," says Julie Levesque, vice president of Museum Reproductions, a 
Brookline, Mass., firm with licenses to reproduce jewelry from 50 museums 
worldwide. Business has "easily tripled" in the past few years, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest has been so great that the Met -- long in the business of selling via 
mail order everything from greeting cards to candlesticks -- recently issued a 
separate catalogue of its jewelry reproductions. And costume jewelry giant 
Monet has joined up with the Smithsonian Institution to produce a line of 
baubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our target is a more educated, affluent consumer," says Jennifer Jiunta, 
director of licensing for Monet, whose new Smithsonian Collection features 
replicas of Victorian earrings, Art Deco brooches and Renaissance cameos, among 
other items. "(We've found) that women are becoming more individualistic. They 
want something unique and different, and the cachet of a museum makes a woman 
feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Cowell, product development manager for Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, 
agrees. In the 1990s, "People don't want name brands, or the biggest or the 
best," she says. "(Museum jewelry) has symbolic meaning. It's taking home a 
small part of history." 
</P>
<P>
 Most museums and firms offering reproductions enclose a detailed biography of 
the purchase item. Just browsing through the catalogues can amount to a crash 
course in decorative-arts history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Met, for example, notes that its Langobard drop earrings in 24-karat gold, 
decorated with enamel and set with cabochon aventurine stones in red and green 
($85), date back to the Seventh Century, when migratory tribes invaded Western 
Europe and the Byzantine Empire rose to eminence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wayfarer Trading Co. in Vail, Iowa, explains that its cartouche pendants 
encircling ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics were inspired by those originally 
worn, 4,000 years ago, to protect the spirits of royalty. 
</P>
<P>
 And a tasteful gold-on-ivory card accompanying the Smithsonian Collection's 
pendant re-creation of an antique Japanese Banko-Yaki rabbit sculpture says the 
animal is associated with the full moon in that culture's mythology and is the 
symbol of the Yin, or female principle. 
</P>
<P>
 The reproductions also offer unlimited possibilities for cocktail party 
repartee. "When someone comments on their earrings, they can say, 'Oh, I got 
them from a museum, they're from a painting,' " Cowell says of the tear-drop 
pearls copied from artwork by Peter Paul Rubens. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurel Beizer, who has been making museum jewelry reproductions for 14 years 
under the name DVB Inc. in New York, says her clients are "very devoted 
museum-goers, interested in history and art and the museum collection." 
</P>
<P>
 While many famous designers re-interpret Byzantine Orthodox crosses or ancient 
Egyptian ankhs without regard for historical accuracy, Beizer and many of her 
museum counterparts do extensive research and pay excruciating attention to 
detail.  
</P>
<P>
 Among her bestsellers is the "poesy" ring. Inscribed with love sayings, the 
designs originated in First-Century Rome and were popular in England and France 
between the 15th and 17th Centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the first thing one learns in this field is that every era steals from 
the past. "Reproductions have been going on since ancient times," says Beizer, 
whose credentials include degrees in fine arts from the University of Michigan 
and in jewelry design from the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a 19th-Century reproduction of a medieval reproduction of a Roman 
reproduction of a Greek original. I think we're constantly inspired by 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 Detective work is part of the job. Beizer recalls trying to track down a ring 
designed by May Morris, a well-known figure in the British Arts and Crafts 
Movement, at London's Victoria and Albert Museum. A little sleuthing led to a 
painting of Morris by her husband, portraitist William Morris, in the Delaware 
Art Museum. The ring turned up in the portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum merchandisers, always eager to expand their catalogues, work closely 
with the business office and the curators, often browsing in the museum's 
archives and storage sites for ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Met's Koch says such research sometimes pays off. Its version of the 
so-called Venus pearl-drop earrings painted by Rubens, priced at $48 for 
simulated pearls and 24-karat gold electroplate, have sold more than 100,000 
pairs over the past five years, she explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Koch declined to discuss profits, but says the Met goes so far as to copyright 
items it believes have good sales potential. The Venus earrings, for instance, 
were quickly knocked off by other firms that changed a few details to avoid 
copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
 Some museums lean toward exact reproductions of pieces in their collections. 
Others pluck details out of a painting or sculpture for jewelers to reproduce. 
Still others take artistic liberty, creating pieces "inspired" by a historic 
item. The Met's "cage-bead" necklace ($525) and earrings ($98) of blue howlite 
encased in twisted gold wire, for example, borrow from a hollow, cylindrical 
bead from ancient Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 It may take a year or more for a design to travel from the exhibit hall to the 
shopping mall. Some pieces are impossible to reproduce, because of either 
prohibitive cost or technical difficulties, such as the impossibility of making 
a mold. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, museums often bring in artisans to sketch and make models of 
pieces too fragile to mold from the original. Dorothea Arnold, the curator in 
charge of Egyptian art at the Met, says jewelers take photos and come back 
again and again to show the curators works in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We point out if the colors are matching, if it's too far from the original, 
if it looks like traditional Egyptian style," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold says that despite late-20th-Century technology, it's impossible for 
contemporary jewelers to cut semiprecious stones into the tiny inlays favored 
by the ancient Egyptians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such fine work we can't do it. It's all handwork, and now we use more 
technical tools. Also, the precision of the joints is hard to achieve." 
</P>
<P>
 But the museum's Reproduction Studio, which has become a center for the study 
of advanced duplication techniques, comes pretty close to the originals. There, 
craftspeople make master molds and patinate and assemble jewelry by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold says she has no philosophical objection to copies, so long as quality 
comes first. "It has an educational effect and people are made aware of ancient 
times," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Met has the second-largest collection of Egyptian artifacts outside of 
Cairo, but many of its offerings from other places and periods were produced 
with help from foreign museums. Its current catalogue features a large 
selection of historic Russian jewelry from the State Historical Museum in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand dowager of American museums also has perhaps the longest tradition 
of reproducing items from its vast holdings. Jewelry was first copied in 1877 
when trustees appointed Tiffany & Co. as the sole agent to manufacture and sell 
replicas of the finest pieces in the Cesnola collection of handcrafted gold 
jewelry from Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany's facsimiles of 146 pieces of the Cypriot jewelry were displayed at 
the Paris Exposition of 1878, where they won a gold medal for excellence and 
were purchased for display by several European museums. 
</P>
<P>
 While other museums have long sold to a small but steady clientele, the 
arrival of mainstream fashion jewelers signals a boom for museum reproductions. 
Monet put a year of research and development into its new museum line of 
pieces, available at Nordstrom, from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, 
D.C., and the Cooper Hewitt Museum in New York, and it has paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a wonderful response, which told me the business was exploding and 
growing," says Jiunta, Monet's director of licensing. "The thing is, you have 
to do it tastefully." Sources

BY DESIGN; THE BIG E; CAPITAL LETTERS ON YOUR LEVI'S LABEL COUNL PUT CASH IN 
YOUR POCKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Sheila Clancy remembers the last time she almost bought a pair of 501s. She 
had just handed over $5 for used Levi's at a Ventura swap meet when a guy came 
up behind her and offered the seller $15. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'Wait a minute. You can't do that. I've already paid,' " says 
Clancy, a veteran antiques dealer. "And the seller said, 'Huh-uh, here,' and 
handed me back my money.  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I flipped out and grabbed hold of the guy and told him if he didn't 
stay out of my way, I'd kill him. Then I was very frustrated with myself 
because I looked like the idiot, grabbing some guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Used jeans and jackets have been causing commotion ever since the Japanese 
started to go crazy for denim a decade ago. Levi's in particular seem to convey 
a truly American image, something associated with cowboys, James Dean and Bruce 
Springsteen. The fact that they've been worn by Americans just adds to their 
mystique. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had truckloads of jeans shipped in from all over the Western states and 
the Japanese would line up to buy them," says Larry Craig, a former jeans 
trafficker and co-owner of Locals Only, an upscale vintage clothing shop in 
Laguna Beach. "We would charge them $4 a pair and thought it was great." 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese scouts combed swap meets, thrift shops and resale stores and bought 
up all the 501s -- the Levi's model with the button fly -- they could find. 
They examined each pair in hopes of scoring really big on the older Big E 
jeans. Before 1971, the sliver of red on the back pocket said "Levi's" in 
capital letters. Since then, the e has been lowercase to conform to the 
company's new logo. 
</P>
<P>
 Used Levi's prices have skyrocketed since Craig and his partner, Jim Olarte, 
started dealing in denim in the early '80s. At a Paris auction house last year, 
two pairs of '30s Big Es with copper rivets on the back pockets went for 
$3,500. Six months ago, Bob Butler, a San Fernando Valley dealer in old denim 
and other collectibles, sold a '30s Levi's jacket -- the No. 1 or one-pocket 
jacket, as the Japanese call it -- to an English dealer for $600, and that was 
with a hole in the sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a pair of small e used 501s now retails locally in such stores as Fred 
Segal Santa Monica ($49), Urban Outfitters ($30) and Jet Rag ($23). And in 
other parts of the world, prices are considerably higher. In Japan and 
Thailand, used 501s sell for about $70; a pair of soft, nicely faded jeans 
starts at $40 in parts of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Denim has been a favorite uniform of Americans since Levi Strauss fashioned 
the first button-fly jeans in the 1870s for cowboys and miners. But it took 
almost a century for them to become a wardrobe staple -- and fresh fodder for 
fashion gimmickry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember my uncle trying to get his Levi's faded by turning the garden hose 
on them and then leaving them out in the sun," Butler says, "and that was in 
1948." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, blue jeans had a bad reputation of sorts for a while, partly because of 
the bad boys, including James Dean and Elvis, who wore them and partly because 
the copper rivets on the back pockets destroyed furniture. The company replaced 
the rivets with bar-tacking in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a lot of used 501s to be had, but don't think visits to a few yard 
sales or thrift shops will make you a killing. Most likely, someone else has 
been there first. Ads on billboards, the Yellow Pages, even on milk cartons 
blare 800 numbers offering cash rewards for used and vintage Levi's. A very new 
black Mercedes has been spotted around Los Angeles with the license plate "BIGE 
501." USA 501, a vintage clothing store in West Los Angeles, proclaims in 
newspaper ads that it will pay up to $17 for used jeans. And in Reseda, a pawn 
shop buys gold and silver and used 501s. 
</P>
<P>
 "These Levi's buyers are so secretive, I've heard it referred to as a cult," 
Butler says. "Some of us are struggling to make a few hundred dollars and these 
people pull into the Rose Bowl (flea market) with a U-Haul truck and pull out 
thousands of Levi's jeans and jackets, and the Japanese show up with big thick 
rolls of hundred-dollar bills." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig has also become disenchanted with the used-jeans market. Instead of 
wholesaling, he now sells them only at his store, and only if they are No. 1s. 
(Dealers grade the condition of jeans 1 to 4. A No. 1 has no stains or holes 
and its original hem; a No. 2 might have holes no bigger than a dime, a torn 
button hole or belt loop; a No. 3 might have spots and/or busted-out knees, and 
a No. 4 is primarily used for parts.)  
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be vintage dealers that have a love of old clothing that were in 
this business," he says. "Now it's a whole new group of people driven by greed. 
Friends of mine have made millions on 501s. They have charitable clothing 
companies like Goodwill and Salvation Army that save 501s for them." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Levi's can be turned into instant cash, just like precious metals. 
"Levi's are not like regular antiques or art; they are a commodity," Butler 
adds. "If I find something really nice and old, I can take it out and turn it 
around within two hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the shaky global economy, the market for vintage denim -- and other 
American collectibles -- is in a slump in Japan. But other countries have 
picked up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Italians and the Germans have been coming to us," says Pam Garvin, 
co-owner of U.S. Denim in Rancho Cordova, near Sacramento. The company enlists 
recycling centers throughout the state to collect used 501s, paying up to $12 
for a pair in No. 1 condition. It then cleans, repairs and sells the jeans for 
export to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Denim collects about 10,000 used 501s a month, and they are immediately 
out the door. "We could sell twice as many," Garvin says. "The hard part is 
getting them." 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Glendale is among Garvin's steady suppliers. Along with glass, 
aluminum cans and newspapers, its recycling center handles denim. Manager Rick 
Eidson buys about 25 to 30 pairs of used 501s per week, paying $1 to $9 per 
pair, depending on condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use the jeans as a teaser to get people to recycle," Eidson says. "I 
pretty much buy every 501 jean that comes through the door, though, because 
even the ripped ones can be used for parts." 
</P>
<P>
 But used jeans are no longer on antiques dealer Clancy's agenda. She would 
much rather spend time searching for things she loves, such as California 
pottery or Victorian jewelry. "I'm not even looking now," Clancy says. "The 
competition is too tough and I don't want any more confrontations." 
</P>
<P>
 She may have given up on denim for now, but tomorrow, who knows? Clancy might 
not be able to resist a pair of '60s psychedelic Chemin de Fer bell-bottoms or 
even a pair of '80s acid-washed stretch jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a whole mystique to denim," Butler says. "Someone should really make 
a movie about this." THE REAL WORLD 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody is always trying to tweak the blue jean, mess with its utilitarian 
image by making it skintight, studded, patched, fringed, acid-washed or baggy 
beyond belief. This year's "We've been doing it for a year, though it's new to 
other people. I like the way it looks." -- Blake Fairchild, 29, Hawthorne 
</P>
<P>
 "I buy my pants extra long so I can cuff them. But I'm not one of the trendy 
people -- I've been doing it before any of them were around." -- Frank 
Rodriguez, 18, Arcadia 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought my overalls looked better cuffed. I know it's fashionable, but I 
also just like it." -- Jackie Tallarido, 18, Thousand Oaks Capital Gains 
</P>
<P>
 Used and vintage denim, particularly with a Levi's label, has been in demand 
since the early '80s in Japan and Europe. Ads on billboards, in the Yellow 
Pages, even on milk cartons offer cash rewards for jeans and jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 Vintage: Levi's with this pre-1971 tag can bring thousands. At a Paris auction 
house last year, two pairs of '30s Big Es with copper rivets on the back 
pockets went for $3,5000. 
</P>
<P>
 Used: Dealers, pawn shops, even recycling centers buy gently worn 501s. Such 
local stores as Urban Outfitters and Jet Rag sell them for $23 and up.

 Jeans: During the Middle Ages, sailors from Genoa, Italy, were noted for their 
heavy cotton pants.French tailors later adapted the idea and created denim 
pants called genes, French for Genoa, which evolved into the American term 
jeans.  
</P>
<P>
 Denim: The tough cotton fabric loomed in Nimes, France, originally known as 
serge de Nimes, or denim for short. 
</P>
<P>
 Dungaree: From the Hindi word for dugri , or coarse cloth. 
</P>
<P>
 Levi's: Named for Levi Strauss, the Bavarian-born son of a dry-goods peddler. 
He added copper rivets to reinforce the pockets of his denim trousers in the 
1860s, patenting the idea in 1873.

THE FACTS ABOUT THOSE LEVI'S MYTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Each Levi's dealer has his own trade secrets for identifying and dating jeans 
and jackets . . . and most of them are wrong. "There's so much misinformation 
about our history, it makes me sick," says Lynn Downey, historian for Levi 
Strauss & Co. in San Francisco. "(Levi's dealers) are a bunch of idiots. I 
really hate them." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the misconceptions floating around: 
</P>
<P>
 * A red line on the inside pants seam means the jeans were made before 1971 
and are desirable.  
</P>
<P>
 "The red line means zip. Up until the early 1980s, the fabric (from which) 
Cone Mills cut our jeans was 29 inches wide and the selvage edge had this red 
thread in it. Then the mills went up to 60-inch wide looms and the red selvage 
disappeared. You could have a pair of Levi's from 1927 that would have had the 
red selvage, but you can't see it because back then pants were washed with 
really harsh soap and the line faded." 
</P>
<P>
 * Look for the older indigo-dyed pieces because the blue jeans are no longer 
produced with indigo dye.  
</P>
<P>
 "They never used real indigo. There was a change in recipe in the '70s, but 
Cone Mills has been using synthetic, petroleum-based indigo from the 
beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 * A real connoisseur wants jeans with punctured buttons. Before the '30s, the 
metal buttons had holes in them, resembling doughnuts.

MAKE PLANS BEFORE YOU NEED THEM

 Backup child care is a little like those other unpleasant subjects -- death 
and taxes -- that no one wants to talk about until they are upon us. But 
work-family specialists say planning is critical where emergency child care is 
concerned.Here are some suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assume the worst: Sooner or later, your regular child-care system will break 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 * Speak to your regular child-care provider about alternatives. Does he or she 
have a colleague, friend or relative who might work in a pinch? 
</P>
<P>
 * Be clear on your employer's policies. How much flexibility do you have if an 
emergency comes up? 
</P>
<P>
 * It is never too early to plan for holidays or vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Talk calmly, rationally and honestly with your spouse or partner about this 
issue. A relaxed conversation about who stayed home last time, whose job is 
more flexible and who has a deadline to meet is much more productive than a 7 
a.m. shouting match the day you need care. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider your child's needs. Some children welcome new child-care options as 
an adventure. Others throw Richter-scale tantrums. 
</P>
<P>
 * Network with other parents. ELIZABETH MEHREN

SICK KID? THERE'S SOMEPLACE TO TURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Facilities for sick children are the rarest of those providing backup child 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 In West Los Angeles, however, there is the Wishing Well, located on the 
grounds of the Samuel Goldwyn Child Care Center.Since August, 1991, mildly ill 
children from six weeks to 12 years have been welcomed, said Estelle Kramer, 
director of the entire child-care operation. Kramer stressed that for $5 per 
hour, the services are "open to the public, not just people in the 
entertainment industry." 
</P>
<P>
 She remembered the attorney, for instance, who frantically telephoned at 7 
a.m. because her toddler had an earache and her child-care provider was also 
sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just call the judge and say my kid has an earache," said Kramer, 
who told the mother to bring the child right over. 
</P>
<P>
 A full-time health assistant watches over the children, Kramer said. "She 
doesn't mind just sitting and rocking a child all day," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer said that when possible, the child-care center also accepts healthy 
children on a drop-in basis. She said she is amazed that with so many women in 
the work force, child care remains such a battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I deal with women who are really high-powered, women who could rule the 
world," Kramer said. "And with day care, we still have to fight for every 
little thing." ELIZABETH MEHREN

FORGOTTEN HERO; WHITTIER BASH TO HONOR MAN WHO HEADED MEXICAN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They're throwing a birthday bash Saturday in Whittier for a forgotten local 
hero. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which runs from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., commemorates Pio de Jesus Pico, 
a prominent landowner and the last governor of Mexican California. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be Mexican folklorico dancers, a mariachi band, a children's talent 
show, lasso tricks and Mexican food. Local historical societies will serve up a 
healthy dose of information about Pico. Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
 Pico, who was born May 5, 1801, amassed thousands of acres of ranchland in 
Southern California for his cattle business. The remains of his large adobe 
residence constitute the centerpiece of the Pio Pico State Historic Park, site 
of the celebration, at Whittier and Pioneer boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers plan to use the occasion to launch a drive to raise money to fix up 
the mansion, which was damaged in the 1987 Whittier earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say about $1.2 million is needed to restore the residence. 
Adobe walls must be anchored to the ceiling to withstand future quakes; the 
veranda needs repairs, and the entire house could use a fresh coat of 
whitewash. Security alarm and climate control systems must be installed before 
state officials will return Pico-era furnishings now in storage. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials also want to begin a drive to encourage elementary 
schoolteachers to give Pico more recognition in history lessons. He is not 
included in the fourth-grade California history curriculum in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 State park officials say Pico's rags-to-riches life story and his ancestry -- 
Latino, African, Native American and European -- make him an ideal role model 
for an ethnically diverse California. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a California original," said Sylvia Sun Minnick, a deputy assistant 
director of the state Department of Parks and Recreation.  
</P>
<P>
 She is seeking $40,000 in donations to pay for posters and study kits that 
would be sent to fourth-grade public schoolteachers in an effort to give Pio 
the recognition accorded such early settlers as John A. Sutter and John Charles 
Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Pico, the fourth of 10 children, was born near the San Gabriel Mission. He 
became a wealthy landowner and political leader. After the Mexican War, he 
remained a political force, serving on the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Pico built his adobe hacienda overlooking the San Gabriel River in 1852. The 
home in its heyday was twice as large as the existing structure, and his 
9,000-acre ranch covered territory that became part of the cities of Whittier, 
Montebello, Pico Rivera and Santa Fe Springs. The four cities are joining with 
the state parks agency to sponsor Saturday's celebration.  
</P>
<P>
 Pico lost the mansion in 1891. He claimed that he had been the victim of a 
real estate scam, but he lost a lawsuit to regain ownership and was evicted. He 
died a poor man three years later. 
</P>
<P>
 The house has undergone two restorations over the years, but was closed after 
the 1987 earthquake left many of the brick walls unstable. Pico-era furnishings 
were put in storage, and a chain-link fence went up around the house.  
</P>
<P>
 Federal earthquake rebuilding money paid for some stabilization work, allowing 
the residence to open on a limited basis in 1989. Visitors could walk through 
parts of the interior, but only when guided by the park's resident interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 The fence was not removed until last week.

PRIEST RELIEVED OF DUTIES AT PARISH SCHOOL; BELLFLOWER: PARENTS OF CHILDREN AT 
ST. BERNARD'S AND CHURCH OFFICIALS QUESTIONED HIS HANDLING OF FINANCES AND 
PERSONNEL. HE WILL REMAIN AS PASTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Catholic priest who has led St. Bernard's parish and elementary school in 
Bellflower for 19 years has been stripped of much of his authority by church 
officials who questioned his financial practices and personnel decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Philip J. McGrath, 66, will remain pastor at the parish. But another 
priest is scheduled to take control Monday of parish finances and management of 
its school, which has an enrollment of 300 students in kindergarten through 
eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 The action, which has touched off a series of protests and has divided 
parishioners, came on the heels of an investigation by the archdiocese of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Mary Elizabeth Galt, who headed the inquiry, told about 200 
parishioners at a meeting Friday that she was concerned about the budgeting 
process at the 71-year-old parish and the frequent turnover of principals at 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Five principals have headed the school since 1987, when the parish began 
hiring outside administrators instead of appointing clergy members. McGrath had 
notified principal Kathleen Flynn, who arrived last year, that she would not be 
rehired. But the archdiocese overruled the priest. 
</P>
<P>
 The archdiocese also will conduct an internal audit of parish finances, a 
spokesman, Father Gregory Coiro, said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath maintained that he has done nothing wrong, and said he was shocked by 
the archdiocese's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was launched after parents complained to the archdiocese 
that thousands of dollars of financial support earmarked for the school 
apparently had been spent elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the parents said the school received only a fraction of the 
money generated by bingo games at the parish, even though the bingo license 
filed with the city says the proceeds should benefit "grammar school 
education."  
</P>
<P>
 City records show that the bingo games at St. Bernard's raised $286,487 from 
July, 1992, to June, 1993. But, parents said, school budget documents showed 
that the school received only $24,430 in bingo proceeds during that fiscal 
year.  
</P>
<P>
 McGrath could not be reached for comment on the distribution of bingo 
proceeds, but he acknowledged after Friday's meeting that the parish has been 
making payments on new buildings, including a school library, parish hall and 
rectory. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, city records show, St. Bernard's application for a city bingo 
license was modified to list "grammar school education/parish needs" as the 
charitable purpose. The change angered some parents, who say the school should 
be the sole beneficiary of the weekly fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 At Friday's meeting, Galt said Flynn would be rehired as principal for at 
least the 1994-95 school year. Galt said McGrath had failed to follow "correct 
archdiocesan procedures" in evaluating the principal. 
</P>
<P>
 The trimming of McGrath's authority and the apparent endorsement of Flynn was 
met with boos from many in the audience Friday. Since that meeting, some 
parishioners have picketed the campus, calling for Flynn's ouster. Critics 
question Flynn's commitment to the religious aspects of Catholic education. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn was not available for comment. Her supporters say she is being blamed 
for problems beyond her control, and credit her with bringing energy and 
direction to a struggling program.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WALNUT PARK: CITY TO TEST CURFEW SWEEPS OF JUVENILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials in Walnut Park expect to launch a curfew crackdown 
by early May, following the example set in a number of cities that are reviving 
curfews to combat street crime, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is scheduled to begin curfew 
sweeps in Walnut Park in a trial program that will eventually target the county 
areas of Willowbrook, Florence, Firestone, Athens Park and East Rancho 
Dominguez, and the city of Lynwood, said Sheriff's Department Lt. Art Burgess. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd Dominguez, president of the Walnut Park Community Assn., said residents 
requested the program about two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many youngsters hanging around at night, and God only knows 
what they are doing," Dominguez said. "This curfew, I think it will work." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, officials will enforce existing laws and cite any juvenile 
younger than 18 who is found on the street after 10 p.m.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MONTEBELLO: FAULTY GAS SYSTEM MAY HAVE RELEASED TOXINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hazardous gases may have been released into the air this winter at the 
Monterey Park landfill by a deteriorating gas control system, according to the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Landfill gases, including methane and cancer-causing vinyl chloride, may have 
been released into the atmosphere on a number of intermittent days from 
November, 1993, through March of this year from the Operating Industries Inc. 
landfill, a federal Superfund site, according to EPA officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A system of gas smokestacks designed to burn off the gases was not operating 
at a high enough temperature, EPA officials said. "This wouldn't be considered 
an immediate health risk," said Roy Herzig, project manager for the site. "A 
large proportion of the gases was still being destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 An EPA monitoring program inside and outside nearby Montebello homes did not 
indicate a problem with the air in that period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The landfill, with its 300-foot-high mountain of waste on either side of the 
Pomona (60) Freeway, was closed in 1984 and placed on the EPA's list of 
Superfund sites after it was revealed that the 190-acre dump was contaminated 
with hazardous waste and polluting the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the EPA has persuaded about 65 blue-chip companies that dumped 
toxic waste to spend more than $200 million to clean up the site through two 
specially formed companies, Cure Inc. and New Cure Inc. Last month, 14 cities 
that used the dump agreed to give the companies $31 million toward the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) said he is concerned that the EPA 
has not directly rebutted concerns among nearby residents "that cancer-causing 
chemicals were being spewed out of the smokestacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Ullensvang, an EPA project manager, said the agency will give more 
specific information about the number of days the temperature fell below 1,400 
degrees Fahrenheit, the required temperature, when it receives the information 
from Cure Inc. However, he said, a January sample "showed a number of days with 
temperatures below 1,350 degrees." Bud Neumann, Cure project coordinator, 
declined to answer questions, deferring to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Caponi, an engineer for the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County, 
said a temperature below 1,400 degrees on a stack means higher exposure for 
nearby homes. "Whoever is downstream is exposed to greater level of toxics." 
</P>
<P>
 Without the gas system, landfill gases would migrate through the soil into 
nearby homes. RICHARD WINTON

COMMUNITY NEWS: TEACHING TEEN-AGERS RISKS OF SEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At South Gate High, where an average of one girl each school day reports a 
pregnancy, and losing one's virginity on prom night is not uncommon, student 
leaders decided that their peers needed a crash course on abstinence and safer 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The leadership group produced "Face the Facts -- It Could Be You," an hourlong 
multimedia brushup on pregnancy, AIDS and other consequences that sexually 
active teens face, and presented it to 800 students two days before this year's 
prom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows what goes on that night," said Ezequiel Navarro, 18. "A lot 
of people think about having fun but they see it in the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to reach teen-agers in a language they would listen to, "Face the 
Facts" featured a humorous but pointed theater presentation, rap music and a 
clip from the film "Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the student audience hooted during the message-laden comedy sketch, 
many slouched in their seats and looked away while a Planned Parenthood 
representative told them that getting pregnant would probably mean putting 
their dreams on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, about 72% of all high school seniors have had sexual intercourse, 
according to statistics from Planned Parenthood. In Los Angeles County, a 
teen-ager gives birth every 7 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate High documented 121 pregnancies between July, 1993, and April of 
this year, said school nurse Wilma Wilson. "It's real shocking because we have 
the highest attendance rate in the district and the lowest dropout rate," said 
Cindy Rosales, 17, senior class vice president. "I have five friends here at 
school who are pregnant and one who had her baby yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 Audience members agreed that "Face the Facts" was an effective way to get the 
message across: There is no such thing as safe sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "School classes on health and sex education don't get it across as well," 
Navarro said. "Nobody pays attention because they're so boring. . . . Everybody 
feels it won't happen to them. (This program) makes you realize it can happen 
and you should be careful." MARY HELEN BERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH: ANOTHER FIRE SETS BACK REOPENING OF BALLROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two days before it was scheduled to reopen after a fire, the International 
Grand Ballroom was hit by another blaze that will keep the facility closed for 
another four to six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire in the ballroom attic late Friday was probably caused by faulty 
wiring, said Long Beach Fire Department spokesman Randy Grimm.Damages were 
estimated at $150,000. No injuries were reported, but 25 residents in an 
apartment building next door were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballroom interior was damaged in an October fire. That blaze, which caused 
$40,000 in damage, was traced to a malfunctioning commercial refrigerator, said 
Ed McMahon, who has owned the downtown facility on East 1st Street for 22 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballroom, which opened in 1956, has been used for wedding receptions and 
private parties in recent years, McMahon said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH: STREET SAFETY GROUP LOSES CASE AGAINST HOTEL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Betsy Bredau and her community watchdog group, Safe Streets Now!, have been 
dealt a rare setback by a Small Claims Court judge, who rejected 14 suits filed 
by neighbors against a downtown hotel owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge John S. Lane ruled against neighbors who had filed suits against 
Vanmalibhai Galal, owner of the 10-room Arcade Hotel at 1097 Long Beach 
Blvd.Lane did not explain the ruling and was not available for comment. The 
complaints had accused Galal of operating a haven for prostitution and drug 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there is nothing going on in this property," said Galal's son, 
Mahesh, who manages the inn for his father. "This is just malicious 
prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors had sought $5,000 each from Galal for mental and emotional 
distress they say they have suffered while living near the inn. The lawsuits 
were patterned after a Safe Streets Now! strategy that tries to help 
neighborhoods root out drug dealers and troublemakers by taking owners of 
problem properties to Small Claims Court. The program was recently awarded a 
$20,000 grant by the city to conduct six neighborhood workshops over the next 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Bredau said this was the second time one of the group's efforts had been 
unsuccessful since she brought the program to Long Beach in August. All but 
five of the group's 55 campaigns have been settled out of court, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Galal has filed a suit in Superior Court against Bredau, alleging 
that most of his tenants have moved out because of what he described as 
harassment by her group. GREG MILLER

COVER STORY; THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING LONG BEACH AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 9 p.m., the terminal building empties of passengers, sparrows gather on 
the tail of a sleek American Airlines MD-80 parked outside and, like other 
places of business, Long Beach Airport dozes off for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately, the airport has been snoozing in more significant ways. Long 
Beach's commercial air business is threatening to go into the Big Sleep, with 
potentially dire consequences for businesses all over the city. 
</P>
<P>
 All those shiny, bullet-shaped passenger jets that used to swoop down onto the 
10,000-foot main runway are becoming an endangered species in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when the city is reeling from Defense Department cutbacks and the 
withdrawal of the Navy, American Airlines has announced that, as of June 16, it 
will no longer fly out of Long Beach Airport. The decision was based on 
economic factors, an American spokesman said. Last month's announcement came 10 
days after Alaska Airlines officials said they were reducing their number of 
daily Long Beach flights from six to three. 
</P>
<P>
 And those were just the latest bulletins in four years' worth of bad news for 
the airport, as one by one -- Continental, Delta, TWA and USAir -- took their 
business elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the incredible shrinking airport," said Kevin McAchren, president of 
Airserve, an airport-based company that provides ground support for the 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the airport is still one of the busiest general aviation centers in 
the nation, with more than 400,000 takeoffs and landings by small private 
airplanes last year. Only Van Nuys and John Wayne airports are busier. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the passenger jets that stir Long Beach's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of five daily flights -- two from American and three from Alaska -- 
means that, starting next month, Long Beach will have only seven commercial and 
three cargo flights per day. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a USC study, for every commercial flight withdrawn by an airline, 
the city loses $175,000 a year in direct revenue and $6 million in economic 
impact, which includes everything from hotel bookings and restaurant meals 
consumed by passengers to jet fuel and the services of airplane mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ripples go everywhere," said Dennis Rouse, president of the Long Beach 
Yellow Cab Co., referring to the economic effects of the shrinking passenger 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, city officials and residents have been of two minds about 
their 1,160-acre airport, imposing rigid regulations to keep the airlines from 
expanding while fretting that they weren't getting enough bang for their 
airport buck. 
</P>
<P>
 Rouse has laid off almost 40 cabdrivers since the airport started its decline. 
"We used to have 50 guys making a living there," he said. "Now we're down to 
about 10." 
</P>
<P>
 But the paring back of daily commercial flights has also meant blissful 
silence at home, he said. Fewer jet engine run-ups and mad-dash takeoffs. Less 
dealing with the daily noise from cross-country flights jetting into the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was one flight -- the 6 p.m. United flight from Chicago," said Rouse, a 
Belmont Shore resident. "My God, it was loud! You could hear it in the shower." 
</P>
<P>
 The reduction of commercial flights, combined with new rules limiting the 
hours of operation for small private airplanes flying in and out, has made the 
airport a quieter place, community leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the private pilots are becoming more noise-conscious, said Mike Donelon, 
president of the neighborhood association for California Heights, the community 
located west of the airport. "We've been working with the Long Beach Pilots 
Assn. to get them to fly quieter," said Donelon, who is in a runoff election 
for the 7th District City Council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 There hasn't been an airplane accident since October, 1991, when a twin-engine 
Cessna 414 smashed into a back yard on Argonne Avenue, killing the pilot and a 
passenger but missing homes by inches. Donelon believes residents have been 
lulled into a sense of serenity. 
</P>
<P>
 But the airport threatens to become a hot issue again, particularly as the 
City Council extends its search for new sources of revenue. In last month's 
mayoral primary, several candidates, including top vote-getter Beverly O'Neill, 
pressed for a more "business-friendly" approach to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Like her opponent in the June runoff, City Councilman Ray Grabinski, O'Neill 
sees the airport as an economic underachiever that could be revived with a 
little marketing magic. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be political dynamite, some elected officials warn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, efforts by the airlines to drastically increase their 
number of daily flights out of Long Beach electrified residents of surrounding 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long Beach Airport is a bull's-eye airport," said Grabinski. "Unlike, say, 
LAX, there are neighborhoods all the way around it." 
</P>
<P>
 The airport's neighbors organized pressure groups, initiated legal action and 
packed the City Council chambers with overflow crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were some of the largest council meetings ever," said Vice Mayor 
Jeffrey A. Kellogg, who represents some of the residential areas near the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The big jets were rattling windows and interrupting conversations, the 
neighbors said. Life near the airport -- complete with buzzing helicopters and 
touch-and-go student airplane flights -- was becoming "annoying as hell," they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 That round of hostilities led to a strict noise-reduction code, limiting 
flight hours and the noisier types of jet motors. It also prompted a federal 
lawsuit, initiated in 1983 by 10 airlines claiming that a city-imposed cap on 
the number of daily commercial flights was unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal action, challenged vigorously by the city, has still not been 
formally resolved. But a federal judge in Los Angeles, with the concurrence of 
the U.S. 9th District Court of Appeals, has fashioned a temporary compromise, 
allowing the city to place a "reasonable" limit on the number of daily flights 
by commercial jets. 
</P>
<P>
 That number, said U.S. District Judge Laughlin E. Waters, should be 41, more 
than double the cap of 18 that the city had imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It has been the economy, more than the court action, that has cooled the 
antagonism, airline officials say. A spokesman for American said that the 
decision to cancel its two daily flights from Long Beach to Dallas/Fort Worth 
had less to do with the nature of the airport than with an inability to sell 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been operating at 35 to 40% of capacity," said spokesman Tim Smith. 
Established airlines, such as American, need planes to be 60% full to break 
even, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the community outpouring goes," Kellogg said, "it has been real 
quiet, like the airport itself." 
</P>
<P>
 But that could change overnight, say residents of neighborhoods such as Bixby 
Knolls and Los Altos, which sit at the ends of that 10,000-foot runway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can almost guarantee that, if the numbers (of flights) start to grow 
significantly, the community will be very active in opposing major expansion," 
said Barbara Shoag, a real estate agent who has been active in resisting 
increases in the number of jet flights. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, an expansion is exactly what airport officials are hoping for. As of 
last month, four new airlines, hoping to elbow their way into the marketplace 
with discount flights, had applied to the city for a total of 33 new daily Long 
Beach flights. If all were approved, the total daily flights would exceed the 
cap by two. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 People waiting to board flights often say Long Beach is a passenger's dream 
airport, with long-term parking across the street from the terminal and 
stress-free boarding procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day, Alan Gendler arrived by bicycle a few minutes before his 
America West flight to Phoenix, a rubber band still affixed to the bottom of 
his trouser leg to keep it from getting tangled in the drive chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a miracle," said Gendler, who lives in Lakewood and parks his bicycle in 
a bike rack next to the terminal. "You know what the traffic would be like at 
LAX?" 
</P>
<P>
 The airport is a good deal all around, said Stanley M. Cobb Jr., president of 
the new Foster City-based Jet USA, which wants to run six flights a day to 
Baltimore and Newark. 
</P>
<P>
 "At other airports, the planes are pushed into a Congo line, then you wait 20 
or 30 minutes to take off," Cobb said. "All of that counts in your fuel burn. 
In Long Beach, you leave the terminal and you're in the air in two minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 A Southern California Assn. of Government (SCAG) study in the mid-1980s said 
that, because of its accessibility and central location in the metropolitan 
area, Long Beach Airport could handle about 22% of the region's air traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the most centrally located in terms of its proximity to where 
people live and work," said Michael Armstrong, SCAG's air transportation 
expert. "It's even better than LAX." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For as long as airplanes have been around, Long Beach has been a flying town. 
Early in the century, stunt pilots and barnstormers gravitated to the city's 
beaches and open fields like June bugs to a street light. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1923, to get airplanes off the beach, the city set aside 150 acres on the 
north side of town for an airport. By the beginning of World War II, when Long 
Beach's new Douglas plant was throwing itself into the war effort, the airport 
had tripled in size. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Airport became the liftoff point for more than 9,000 World War II 
military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the airport is a deceptively quiet place, with a classic passenger 
terminal at the east end of the field -- an imposing white building, slightly 
curved so that diners in The Prop Room on the second floor get the full 
panorama of the landing field through a huge, segmented picture window. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the feeling of emptiness when airplanes aren't racing down any of five 
runways, the airport is still busy. At the west end of the field, workers 
tinker with some of the 40 C-17 cargo airplanes that McDonnell Douglas is 
producing for the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they fire up the engines, irritating the residents with the 
penetrating wheeze of new jets. "It's like white noise at a deafening decibel 
level," said Carroll Lachnitt, a writer who lives nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 200 businesses operating at the airport -- airplane servicing 
outfits, a hotel, Automobile Club of America, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
helicopter unit, air-freight transportation companies and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The 183-foot control tower handled 431,000 takeoffs and landings last year, 
making it one of the busiest in the nation in total air traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real diverse airport," said Robert Patton, controller in charge, on a 
slow afternoon recently, keeping an eye on an approaching McDonnell Douglas 
craft. "We get business jets, general aviation, commercial carriers, 
helicopters and C-17s." 
</P>
<P>
 Though there are still dozens of Cessnas and Beechcraft buzzing at the edges 
of the field, the economy has put a hurt on general aviation, airport officials 
say. The number of airplanes based in Long Beach shrank to 539 last year from 
its peak of 800 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the airlines that bring the jobs into the local economy -- 92 of 
them for each daily flight, studies have shown.  
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to tell that to Airserve president McAchren. At the peak of 
airport passenger jet activity, when almost 1.5 million passengers a year were 
going through the terminal, his company was servicing 26 flights a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had 70 people on the payroll," McAchren said. "Today we have 20 people 
working for us, and I think we'll end up with 14." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As with many people in airport-related businesses, McAchren blames the 
"political" way in which the airport is administered, with city officials 
paying more attention to neighborhood groups than to the business community. 
"There's a feeling here at the airport that the city hasn't been 
user-friendly," McAchren said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the passenger business has declined in Long Beach, other airports in the 
region have shown marked increases in total passengers. According to a SCAG 
study, as Long Beach's total of commercial passengers was plummeting by more 
than 50% between 1990 and 1993, the number for the region as a whole increased 
from about 60 million to 66 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the city hasn't adequately marketed its airport because of 
neighborhood pressures to keep it small, merchants say. 
</P>
<P>
 As the city prepares to open its expanded and remodeled $112-million 
Convention Center in August, the absence of a selling program for the airport 
is especially worrisome, Yellow Cab's Rouse said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand why they build a Convention Center, then nail the front 
door shut," Rouse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport manager Chris Kunze says there is little money for marketing in his 
$11-million budget, which relies on the airport's shrinking revenues. But city 
officials have, among other things, hosted special events for travel agents, 
attended trade shows and shaved parking fees for cars to try to give Long Beach 
a competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunze's hope is that Long Beach can carve out a niche, with airlines such as 
Cobb's Jet USA establishing a base at the airport for discount flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, the new airlines would give Long Beach a higher profile, as Jet 
America did in the 1980s before it was taken over by Alaska Airlines in 1987, 
Kunze said. "It was Long Beach-based and it started flying a lot of flights to 
Chicago and Dallas," Kunze said. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, it advertised its Long Beach location on billboards and in 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Airport businesses are skeptical about the new airlines' prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, only Sun Jet International, a Florida-based airline that wants to 
take over the two American flights, has financing. The others, aside from Jet 
USA, are California Air Corridor's The Coast Airlines, which has applied for 24 
flights along the Pacific Coast, and Belize International, hoping for a daily 
flight to Belize. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the questions I've been asking them is, 'What makes you think you can 
make money at Long Beach Airport when the majors have had to pull out?' " 
McAchren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobb concedes that Jet USA will be "a very small fish in a great big pond," 
but he thinks there's a market for it. "It's going to be low frills, bare bones 
and low prices, attracting (business) people who don't have a lot of time to 
plan ahead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But nowadays, the most successful airlines have been flooding new routes with 
frequent flights, rather than starting out small, said SCAG's Armstrong. "If 
there are a lot of flights to a destination a passenger is interested in, 
that's the airport he'll choose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, with its 41-flight cap, poses too many constraints on the airlines 
pursuing that kind of a strategy, Armstrong said. Competition from other 
airports with fewer limitations, as well as the possibility that the El Toro 
Marine Air Base in Orange County may go private in 1996, could signal Long 
Beach's doom as a commercial airport, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long Beach is going to have to do some soul searching to figure out what 
comes first -- the economy of the city or the noise environment of the 
communities around the airport," Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is precisely what the city has been doing for almost 20 years, said 
Kellogg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take the cap off and I guarantee you, Long Beach might have an active airport 
to go along with an active seaport," he said, "but we won't have the 
good-quality neighborhoods. The airport isn't going to be the economic engine 
that will drive this city into prosperity." On the Cover 
</P>
<P>
 Things are slow in the middle of the day at Long Beach Airport, which has 
scaled back its operations significantly in the past few years. Starting next 
month it will have only seven commercial flights daily. Airlines' Daily Flights

PRESERVATION: LOST LONG BEACH LANDMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Friday at the Farmer's Market in Long Beach I was saddened to see the Barker 
Brothers Building being torn down to be replaced with yet another parking lot. 
The Promenade will no longer be a Promenade, just a couple of buildings 
surrounded by parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this the message the downtown businesses want to convey? If any more of 
these buildings come down, I think that all the efforts to renovate downtown 
will be wasted. The Redevelopment Agency, which has historic preservation 
guidelines, has facilitated many historic renovations on Pine Avenue, including 
the Kress Building, First National Bank and the Bradley Building (Birdland 
West). But they have not accomplished historic preservation in the Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown doesn't begin and end on Pine Avenue, and the downtown businesses 
better realize that preservation of our historic buildings has an important 
economic impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven more Long Beach historical landmark buildings could be torn down in the 
next year or so. They include the Masonic Temple, the Long Beach Professional 
Building near 8th Street and Pine Avenue, the Insurance Exchange Building, the 
former Terry's Camera Building, Art Deco Commercial Building, Hancock Motors 
and Harriman Jones Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 These buildings may very well be torn down because the owners have not or will 
not meet seismic code requirements written in the 1970s peculiar to Long Beach, 
which require all buildings built before 1934 to be retrofitted regardless of 
construction type. Performance of buildings in recent quakes indicates that 
these older buildings do well, and the buildings not up to code from the '60s 
and '70s did poorly. None of these historic landmarks are brick or unreinforced 
masonry, which are the most hazardous types of buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 When owners could not afford to retrofit buildings like these in other cities 
such as Claremont or Pasadena, the buildings would be vacated and closed until 
they could be rehabilitated and seismic work done. Seismic technology is being 
revised continuously and Long Beach needs to find a more acceptable solution. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the Masonic Temple needs only about $100,000 worth of 
reinforcement, but the owner is ill and can't get a loan. This building has 
seven ballroom theaters, with murals, mahogany and brass fittings, and a huge 
pipe organ. It would be absurd to demolish this building when it needs so 
little work. 
</P>
<P>
 Building and Safety seems to have its own schedule, while the Redevelopment 
Agency has a separate schedule. The two need to coordinate their plans. If 
people care about this issue they need to let the city know.

 Another year, another championship for the Long Beach City College men's track 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings won their 16th consecutive conference title under Coach Ron Allice 
at the South Coast Conference championships at Mt. San Antonio College on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach amassed 309 1/2 points to outdistance Mt. San Antonio, which 
finished with 268 points. El Camino and Cerritos were third and fourth with 55 
1/2 and 54 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have been successful, tradition can work for you or against you and 
I was worried about the team being complacent," said Allice, who has guided 
Long Beach to 10 state championships and a 78-4 dual-meet record over the past
