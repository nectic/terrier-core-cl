 BUCKLE UP: The new bicycle helmet law for youngsters takes effect today. But 
that doesn't mean your child will be cited for forgetting. "We're going to 
educate the public first," says Fountain Valley police Lt. Robert Mosley. 
"We're going to have a six-month grace period where we'll just be issuing 
warnings." . . . Some local police departments will be spreading the word 
through flyers and programs at schools. But Mosley warns: "Kids need to follow 
the law."

 SMOKING MONEY: If you must smoke, the state of California is at least going to 
make it more expensive for you. The state tax on cigarettes goes up today, two 
cents per pack -- making it 37 cents. Will this deter smokers? Some Orange 
County vendors doubt it. Says a spokesman for a Circle K in Anaheim: "Right now 
we charge $2.30 a pack, including tax. But it wouldn't matter if we charged 
$2.50 or $2.80. It never stops someone who has to smoke." The tax boost is 
expected to raise an added $39 million a year for breast cancer research.

 HUSKER PARTY: Not all Cornhuskers will be at the Orange Bowl in Miami for the 
Nebraska-Florida State game. The University of Nebraska men's and women's swim 
teams are training at Corona del Mar High School for a Wednesday match with 
UCLA. Assistant Coach Kelly Long Nordell, a former Newport Harbor High swim 
star, is hosting all 47 of them at her parents' Newport Beach house tonight to 
watch the bowl game. "Nebraska does love its football," she says. "But we've 
got some pretty good swimmers too." 
</P>
<P>
 WILL TRAVEL: UC Irvine Extension is bringing English-as-a-second-language 
training straight to the workplace, like office-delivered pizza. The Extension 
program has several courses, including Speech Improvement and English Grammar 
Review, that it will be teaching next year at business sites. . . . Says 
spokeswoman Loan Vo: "Orange County is becoming more diverse, and for 
foreign-born professionals working here, language training can be the key to 
advancement."

 MAJOR CRIME DROPS: While they dreamed of Hollywood stardom, athletic careers 
or quiet motherhood, most of the Valley's 128 homicide victims in 1993 died 
doing the banal: pumping gas, walking home from school, withdrawing money from 
a bank ATM. (A1) . . . The homicide rate dropped last year, along with robbery, 
burglary and aggravated assault, with only rape among major crimes increasing, 
according to projections. 
</P>
<P>
 TOUCHDOWN DROUGHT: With only two touchdown catches in his four years as a 
tight end at UCLA, Brian Allen, who played at Hart High in Newhall, has lowered 
his expectations (C10) for today's Rose Bowl game. In his last game for the 
Bruins, he will settle for just one long run against Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 POWER OF THE PRESS: Despite its location in small town Calabasas, the Jewish 
Spectator magazine has drawn the attention, and the writings, of prominent 
Jewish intellectuals. (B5) . . . And, because a majority of its 6,000 
subscribers are libraries and rabbis, its influence spreads wide and deep. But 
even this highbrow publication is not above a mention of Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 LOOKING BACK: Steve Burdett, a race-car driver at Saugus Speedway, earned a 
surprising outpouring of support from his macho colleagues (C11) after he 
announced last summer that he was gay and had contracted the virus that causes 
AIDS. His courage and candor made him one of the Valley's most memorable sports 
personalities of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 WHO'S THE BOSS: The city of Lancaster has jumped into the landlord business, 
buying up mobile home parks as a way to preserve housing options for 
lower-income residents. The practice (B7) has been described as "pioneering" by 
some, although some mobile home residents suspect they are merely being wooed 
as voters. So far the city is the proud owner of two parks and talks are under 
way with the owners of three more. Valley Homicides 
</P>
<P>
 The number of homicides has increased since 1991 in Devonshire and West Valley 
divisions of the LAPD. Homicides reported to the Valley Bureau, as of Dec. 7 
for the past three years: 04,14,06,06,06 1991 1992 1993 Devonshire 28 17 30 
Foothill 36 40 36 N. Hollywood 27 23 19 Van Nuys 29 38 22 West Valley 16 19 21

MANDELL WEISS; RETAILER AND ARTS PATRON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mandell Weiss, a pioneer of such retail shopping clubs as FedMart and an arts 
patron who gave millions to support San Diego's burgeoning theater scene, died 
Wednesday. He was 102. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss died at home in San Diego after a short illness, said his daughter, 
Patricia Donovan. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, Weiss donated $1.25 million to build a theater that anchors the 
Mandell Weiss Center for the Performing Arts at UC San Diego. He donated $1.3 
million in 1991 for the Mandell Weiss Forum, which is shared by the nationally 
respected La Jolla Playhouse and the university. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss, whose gifts helped San Diego emerge as a regional center for theater, 
was introduced to Yiddish theater in a New York City high school and decided to 
become an actor. Those plans were interrupted by World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gather a tremendous amount of enjoyment in the theater," the Romanian 
immigrant and onetime actor told The Times on his 100th birthday. "And I know 
that added a few more years to my life."  
</P>
<P>
 In 1923, he moved to San Diego and got his start in business importing 
Japanese wristwatches wholesale. In the 1950s, Weiss and Sol Price started 
FedMart, which grew into a 46-store retail empire in Southern California and 
the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Price, Weiss recalled, who talked him into giving the money for the 
first theater. 
</P>
<P>
 FedMart, which closed in 1982, pioneered the concept of membership shopping, 
in which customers pay a minimal fee to become a member of the store. 
Membership entitles them to steep discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 FedMart was a precursor of the Price Club, another membership store where food 
and merchandise are sold in bulk at discount prices. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Weiss supported the United Jewish Fund and contributed money 
to found a chair for the UC San Diego department of Judaic studies.

THOMAS J. WATSON JR.; LED IBM INTO COMPUTER AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thomas J. Watson Jr., who brought International Business Machines -- the firm 
founded by his father -- from the age of typewriters into the era of computers, 
died Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A company spokesman said Watson, who spent years feuding with his father over 
the direction IBM should take, was 79 when he died at Greenwich Hospital in 
Greenwich, Conn., after a stroke. He had retired in 1971 after a heart attack 
and later served as ambassador to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson was credited with taking a firm similar to the tightknit, stringently 
run companies operating in Japan today and shaping it into an enduring model of 
corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1990 book, "Father, Son & Co., My Life at IBM and Beyond," Watson wrote 
that his father had employees sing company songs and recite company slogans. 
His father's favorite motto, "Think" was emblazoned on posters and company 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Watson's contributions were hailed at the company's annual meeting 
in April: 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps the most important legacy of his leadership can be summarized in just 
three words, 'IBM means service,' " IBM Chairman Louis V. Gerstner said at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson was chief executive of IBM from 1956 to 1971, a period during which the 
company had become a world leader in typewriters and adding machines. 
</P>
<P>
 He succeeded in blazing a trail into the unknown world of corporate computing, 
a move his father strongly resisted at first. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson led IBM through the longest and most spectacular growth in modern 
business history. The company grew from about $700 million in annual revenues 
to $7.5 billion during his tenure as chief executive, developing into a 
paternalistic organization that engendered hard work, pride, loyalty and 
lifelong employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson became chief executive officer a few months before the death of his 
father, who started IBM in 1914, the same year Watson was born in Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a job he relished at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd heard so many stories about sons of prominent men failing in business," 
he wrote in his book, "and I could imagine their devastation at finding 
themselves unable to fill their fathers' shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, who wrote that he learned to love his father, also said he respected 
him as "the greatest man I ever knew." 
</P>
<P>
 The son had grown up in awe of his father's accomplishments. Raised in Short 
Hills, N.J., and attending private schools, he called himself a privileged and 
unimpressive youth. He admitted in his memoirs that he spent so much of his 
time at Brown University flying airplanes and partying that he barely 
graduated. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson applied to become a commercial airline pilot after World War II. But 
friends persuaded him to join IBM, where he became assistant to Charles Kirk, 
the company's vice president in charge of sales. When Kirk died in 1947, Watson 
took over his job. 
</P>
<P>
 After his contentious apprenticeship under his father, Watson became the 
company's president in 1952 and CEO four years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fought about every major issue of the business -- how to finance IBM's 
growth, whether to settle or fight a federal antitrust suit, what role in IBM 
other members of our family ought to play," Watson wrote in his book. 
</P>
<P>
 "From around 1950 my goal . . . was to push into computers as fast as 
possible. That meant hiring engineers by the thousands and spending dollars by 
the tens of millions on new factories and labs. The risk made Dad balk, even 
though he sensed the enormous potential of electronics as early as I did." 
</P>
<P>
 After Watson left the company in 1971, he pursued a variety of interests 
outside IBM, including aviation, sailing, travel and public service. President 
Jimmy Carter appointed him ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1979, a post he 
held through 1980, and he later continued working for disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson is survived by his wife, Olive, six children and 15 grandchildren.

L. J. RITTENBAND; SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Laurence J. Rittenband, whose piercing manner and brusque 
style often overshadowed even the high-profile cases in his courtroom, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Madeline Bessmer, his friend and companion for many years, said Rittenband -- 
who retired in 1989 from the Santa Monica courthouse but continued to sit on 
trials occasionally -- was 88 when he died Thursday in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for his impatience with unprepared or confused attorneys, he also drew 
antagonism for scowling at witnesses whose testimony he suspected was faulty. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the defense attorneys he frustrated and the prosecutors he cut short 
praised him as one of the sharpest jurists in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 His demeanor alone would have kept him in the public eye even had he presided 
over routine cases. But many highly publicized trials were held in his 
courtroom, including those of the Billionaire Boys Club murderers; Frederick 
Jerome Thomas, killer of Sarai Ribicoff, a newswoman and niece of a U.S. 
senator; the drifter who attacked actress Theresa Saldana, and film director 
Roman Polanski, who fled the country rather than serve a jail term for having 
sex with a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Rittenband also ruled on the legality of many of Santa Monica's rent control 
ordinances in the long battle over that issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard P. Byrne, presiding judge of the Los Angeles County Superior Court 
when Rittenband retired, said the jurist's assignment to well-known cases was 
not accidental. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you have a case that is complicated . . . you want somebody who is 
experienced to do it, and he had the experience," Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also had the style, recalled Robert Philibosian, the former Los Angeles 
County district attorney who as a young lawyer often found himself in 
Rittenband's courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Philibosian remembered the day Charles Manson appeared before Rittenband. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to face this court," said the mass murderer, turning his back 
to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not proceed unless you face this court," warned Rittenband. "You will 
turn around now . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 And Manson, who was flanked by his female followers, did. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost as if he were hearing the word of a much higher authority," 
Philibosian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rittenband was attracted to the law when he was only 10, he said in a 
post-retirement interview four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 With a librarian as his tutor, he began reading the Code of Hammurabi, a set 
of Babylonian laws noted for their severity but much more humane than earlier 
statutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strict but fair," said Rittenband, adding that the 4,000-year-old code was 
"as apt then as it would be today." 
</P>
<P>
 He graduated from Stuyvesant High School in New York at 15 and studied law at 
New York University by night. It was not until he graduated at age 19 that he 
found he was too young to practice. 
</P>
<P>
 He attended Harvard University, and when he graduated magna cum laude three 
years later became a federal prosecutor. He was commissioned an Air Force 
intelligence officer in World War II, was injured in a raid over Algeria and 
sent to California to recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
 Rittenband remained in the state, practiced law in Los Angeles and met Gov. 
Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, who named him to the Los Angeles Municipal Court in 1961 
even though Brown was a Democrat and he was a Republican. He was appointed to 
the Superior bench in 1962 and assigned to the west branch, where he remained. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was prone to take over the cross-examination of witnesses himself 
when he felt attorneys had overlooked important testimony, and was known for 
sometimes taking written motions and throwing them in the trash, Rittenband 
said his record spoke for itself. He was reversed on appeal an average of only 
once every 20 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he said, "a judge should not be an automaton or referee. He should 
participate in the case to make sure that justice is done, not just lie back."

 The rebels also set off a bomb that wounded one person Wednesday, a day after 
three bombs killed one person and wounded 30.

NHL ROUNDUP; HASEK STOPS 39 SHOTS IN SABRES' VICTORY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Goaltender Dominik Hasek turned back 39 shots Friday night in leading Buffalo 
to a 4-1 victory over the New York Rangers at Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasek turned aside 21 shots in the second period alone, the most faced by a 
Sabre goaltender this season. 
</P>
<P>
 After a tight, hard-checking first period, the Sabres got the scoring started 
at 11:10 of the second when Donald Audette converted Brad May's pass on the 
power play. 
</P>
<P>
 May added the second goal when he tucked in a rebound after Derek Plante's 
slap shot had trickled by Healey. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Sabre goals were by Dale Hawerchuk and Yuri Khmylev, the latter an 
empty-netter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 5, Chicago 2 -- Andy Moog stopped 30 of 32 shots and five Dallas 
players scored as the Stars ended the Blackhawks' eight-game home winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moved the Stars within one point of Central Division-leading 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 4, Boston 3 -- Mark Recchi scored the tying goal with 6:32 left 
and then set up Eric Lindros' winner with 2:17 to go as the Flyers rallied from 
a 3-0 deficit for a victory over the Bruins in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 10,855 fans showed up for the second of six neutral-site games to be

ON NEW YEAR'S EVE, KINGS TIE ONE ON, 4-4; HOCKEY: RED WINGS PUMMEL STAUBER WITH 
55 SHOTS, AND MELROSE TAKES SOLACE IN FACT THAT HIS TEAM DIDN'T LOSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His team had all but disappeared offensively after the first period, yielded a 
season-high 55 shots on goal and mustered only 18 shots, yet King Coach Barry 
Melrose racked his brain and found a positive statistic in the aftermath of a 
4-4 tie here against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we've lost a game when we've given up over 50 shots," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he wasn't joking. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, Melrose does not play goal for the Kings. Robb Stauber, who did 
tend goal on Friday night, slid and sprawled and lunged as he tried to keep the 
Kings (14-20-3) afloat in the Western Conference. The Kings, undefeated in 
their last three road games, are four points out of a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Stauber could not remember whether he had faced more than 55 shots on goal at 
any level. He did see the shot meter turning over at a rapid rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I was aware of it, I could see it," Stauber said. "But I didn't pay 
that much attention. My job is hard enough."  
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Rob Blake, standing nearby Stauber, leaned over and joked: "We were 
trying to get him the record." 
</P>
<P>
 That club record remained far off in the shot-meter distance -- 68 shots 
launched by Minnesota on March 25, 1981. The Kings' goalie of record, Mario 
Lessard, survived and even earned a 4-3 road victory despite the barrage. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Melrose should not get his hands on those kind of statistics if he 
thinks the Kings are immune to losing when the opponents hit the 
fifty-something range. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a strange set of circumstances, he is right. The Kings are 2-0-2 when 
opponents have more than 50 shots on goal. Forty-nine shots is dangerous, 
though. Montreal had 49 shots on goal and beat the Kings, 4-0, on Nov. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Melrose thought the shot meter was a little out of control at Joe Louis Arena. 
"I think it was three-for-one night," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His players thought so too.  
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like they were fudging on their side and on ours," defenseman Tim 
Watters said. "A couple of times guys I thought they had shots and there was 
nothing on the (score) sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robb Stauber played unbelievable, but we can't give up that many shots and 
expect to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Watters attempted to take matters into his own hands early in the third 
period. Detroit's Steve Yzerman, who scored the game-tying goal and added two 
assists, dropped his stick in front of the King net. The quick-thinking Watters 
shoved Yzerman's stick into the net behind Stauber. Yzerman was irritated, dug 
the stick out of the net and demanded a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 It was probably the best way to temporarily halt Yzerman. The game had been 
billed as a showdown between the league's top scoring leaders -- the Red Wings' 
Sergei Fedorov and the Kings' Wayne Gretzky. Fedorov has 65 points and Gretzky 
is second with 63. 
</P>
<P>
 Fedorov had one goal on an outstanding play at 6:36 of the first period to 
make the score 2-2. He took advantage of a Gretzky giveaway, skated down the 
left wing and stopped up in the middle of the left circle and knocked a shot 
past Stauber on the stick side. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky helped make it 3-2 at 13:30 of the first, setting up Jari Kurri on the 
power play, sliding a pinpoint pass across the slot to Kurri at the left 
crease. 
</P>
<P>
 The other King goals came from defensemen Darryl Sydor (his fifth), Charlie 
Huddy (second) and a shorthander from Shawn McEachern (seven). Former King 
defenseman Paul Coffey had three assists for Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 McEachern's goal made it 4-2 at 17:29 of the first, but the game then turned 
into a Red Wing shooting gallery against Stauber. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of time to shoot and it was probably too much," Detroit Coach 
Scotty Bowman said. "We tried to overpower him (Stauber) and we ended up 
putting a lot of shots right into his midsection."

MORNING BRIEFING: NAH, IT HAS TO BE A LOT MORE THAN A MAN'S (FOOTBALL) WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pass the potato chips, please. In true Rose Bowl spirit, let's examine the new 
book, "Why Men Watch football," by Bob Andelman. 
</P>
<P>
 So, why do men watch football? 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, Andelman writes, because it gives men a chance to be separate from 
females: 
</P>
<P>
 "Men watching games with other men -- and without women -- creates a masculine 
space, not unlike an adolescent's tree house." 
</P>
<P>
 The author listed other reasons why men watch football, such as it's fun, it 
has military appeal, some relish its mix with gambling and, lastly, it gives 
men something to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
 Something besides women, presumably. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who was the USC lineman ejected in the first half of the 1963 
Rose Bowl against Wisconsin for a personal foul? 
</P>
<P>
 Let it Snow: The first touchdown in Rose Bowl history was scored in 1902 by 
Michigan's Neil Snow, who actually scored the first five in a 49-0 victory over 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Formation innovation: In the 1941 Rose Bowl, the country became aware of a new 
offensive concept, the T-formation, designed by Stanford Coach Clark 
Shaughnessy for quarterback Frankie Albert. Stanford defeated Nebraska, 21-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Small type: The smallest player to appear in the Rose Bowl was 128-pound Skeet 
Manerud of Oregon, who kicked a field goal and narrowly missed another that 
would have won the game for Oregon, which lost to Harvard, 7-6, in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
 What water shortage?In 1934, more than 2 1/2 million gallons of water were 
pumped out of the Rose Bowl by local fire departments after torrential rains 
had flooded the stadium. Columbia went on to defeat Stanford, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose Bowl East: Because of a restriction on large crowds on the West Coast 
after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the 1942 Rose Bowl game was played in Durham, 
N.C. Oregon State defeated Duke, 20-16. 
</P>
<P>
 Vision quest: In 1956, Dave Kaiser, who had been injured all season and had 
not practiced field goals for two months, lost a contact lens during the game 
but still kicked a 41-yard field goal with seven seconds left as Michigan State 
defeated UCLA, 17-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Marv Marinovich, father of former USC quarterback Todd 
Marinovich. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Times columnist Jim Murray, after watching USC defeat Michigan, 
14-7, in the 1977 Rose Bowl: "Seven of the last eight games have been won by 
the guys who are supposed to bleed orange juice and play in sunglasses and 
train in swimming pools and go around dating movie stars and hanging 10 at 
Malibu." THOMAS BONK

IT'D BE A REAL KICK TO GET MORE SOCCER COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The L.A. Times' coverage of high school soccer is virtually nonexistent.There 
have been several major tournaments in this area during the past two weeks. No 
stories in my edition. The Day in Sports, however, does give me the indoor 
track schedule (I know the Knights of Columbus Indoor Games will take place in 
Saskatoon next month), the winners of the Russian Skating Championships 
(congratulations Anzhelka Krylova-Vladimir Fyodorov), and the complete NFL log. 
Thanks fellas, you're doing a great job.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cincinnati Bearcats hardly missed injured star Dontonio Wingfield, thanks 
to LaZelle Durden, playing only his fourth game since regaining eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior scored 39 points and tied his school record of eight three-pointers 
in rallying No. 18 Cincinnati past Austin Peay, 85-75, Friday night at 
Clarksville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally the first man off the bench, Durden started in place of freshman 
Wingfield, who broke a bone in his right foot Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bearcats (10-2) trailed, 50-41, early in the third quarter before going on 
a 15-0 run that gave them their biggest lead of the game at 56-50 on John 
Jacobs' basket with 13:04 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Governors are 1-8. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 16 Minnesota 73, James Madison 68 -- Voshon Lenard scored 17 points to 
lead the Gophers at at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Jayson Walton, making his first start since he underwent knee surgery Dec. 7, 
added 16 points and grabbed a game-high 15 rebounds to help Minnesota (8-3). 
</P>
<P>
 The Dukes are 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 11 Louisville 85, Hawaii 79 -- Clifford Rozier scored 21 points and Dwayne 
Morton added 20 as the Cardinals survived an upset bid by host Hawaii late 
Thursday night to win the title of the Rainbow Classic at Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor Ruffin made 10 of 11 three-point range attempts and scored a 
career-high 42 points for Hawaii (4-7). 
</P>
<P>
 OTHER GAMES 
</P>
<P>
 Kareem Anderson had career highs with 28 points and 10 rebounds to lead Oregon 
State (4-5) to an 82-78 come-from-behind victory over Portland (7-6) at 
Corvallis, Ore. The Beavers needed a 25-8 run in the second half to win their 
consecutive game. . . . Franklin Western and Dickey Simpkins scored 18 points 
each to lead Providence (6-2) to an 88-69 victory over South Carolina (3-5) at 
Providence, R.I. . . . Carter Long scored a career-high 27 points and Frank

TROJANS BARELY ESCAPE AT MISSOURI KANSAS CITY; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: MARTIN'S 
LATE JUMPER HELPS USC OVERCOME STUBBORN KANGAROOS, 67-66. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 USC Coach George Raveling led the Trojans' sprint off the court while Missouri 
Kansas City was left hoping for a last-second foul call. 
</P>
<P>
 None came, and USC got away with a 67-66 victory Friday on Brandon Martin's 
13-foot jumper with 27 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 USC took a 65-57 lead on a basket by Burt Harris with 6:23 remaining. Missouri 
Kansas City then went on a 9-0 run, taking the lead, 66-65, when Vinson Smith 
hit a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 With time running down, Martin, who finished with 11 points, made the 
game-winning basket for the Trojans (7-2). 
</P>
<P>
 After Missouri Kansas City (3-8) called time out with 15 seconds remaining, 
Tony Dumas, who had a game-high 19 points, missed an eight-footer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was in," Dumas said. "It looked like it was in. I figured I had 
about an 80% chance of hitting it when I shot it. But it was a heartbreaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Time expired after a scramble under the Missouri Kansas City basket. Smith, 
who came up with the rebound of Dumas' miss, thought he was fouled as he tried 
to put up a final shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "No excuses for us losing this game," Smith said. "But there were two of those 
guys on my back. My shot was altered because somebody was all over me." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling said: "Our kids reacted pretty good. As soon as one of our kids heard 
an official say 'no foul,' we ran off. You don't wait for an explanation." 
</P>
<P>
 USC led, 33-29, at halftime when Harris hit a three-pointer at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenzo Orr had 17 points and a game-high 10 rebounds for USC. Mark Boyd added 
10 points.

VIEWPOINT / LETTERS; SUBJECT OF SLAUGHTER TOUCHES A NERVE FOR MANY READERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article, "They're Dying at the Finish" (Dec. 23) by Jody Berger, was a 
finely written piece which addressed a subject that deserves recognition. There 
is no excuse for the inhumane conditions referred to in the article. However, 
to place this as part of a series entitled, "The Business of Horse Racing," is 
misleading and deceptive. The clear implication is that thoroughbred owners and 
trainers are callous, uncaring individuals with no compassion whatsoever for 
the animals that perform in their sport. 
</P>
<P>
 I was the managing partner of Ten Star Stable who claimed Proud Duke on June 
18, 1983, and proudly raced him for approximately one year. Unfortunately, he 
suffered a crippling injury and we sent him to a local farm for recuperation, 
even though we knew he would never race again. He was still hobbling, so I had 
him shipped to a lady who owned a ranch in Malibu who felt she could better 
care for him. He responded magnificently to her care. I ran into the lady 1 1/2 
years ago and she informed me that Proud Duke was doing wonderfully. 
</P>
<P>
 I was totally sickened to find his name at the forefront of your article. What 
the article fails to mention, however, is the fact that there was over seven 
years of good care from the time that Proud Duke's racing career ended until he 
met his demise.

 * I am a thoroughbred owner and breeder in addition to being a horseman with 
several riding horses. I read in complete disgust the so-called "Second in a 
Series" on The Business of Horse Racing (Dec. 23). I guess I just don't 
understand the point. What does the slaughter of livestock through the USDA 
have to do with the business of horse racing? Moreover, what does the actual 
subject matter have to do with sports? 
</P>
<P>
 I have never met anyone in the sport of thoroughbred racing that does not 
truly love the animal above anything else. I assure you a very strong bonding 
with the animal is achieved. At the end of its career, the absolute effort is 
made to find the animal a permanent home to enjoy the rest of its life.

 The article, "They're Dying at the Finish," made me sick. It's a sad excuse 
when people justify destruction of animals with the bottom line of a balance 
sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 The description of how these beautiful horses are herded into trucks and 
brought to the slaughterhouse should have a familiar ring to anyone who has any 
knowledge of the Holocaust of World War II. Is it any wonder that our society 
is seemingly inured to the violence that is inflicted upon others all over the 
world? It seems the perpetration of cruelty will always be tolerated as long as 
too many people don't make too much noise about it. Whether it's unspeakable 
acts against animals or humans, it's just another form of "the final solution," 
isn't it?

 I found your Dec. 23 article entitled, "They're Dying at the Finish," 
appalling and heartbreaking. Why doesn't the state intervene and stop such 
cruelties? After all, it receives a double bonanza in revenues, first from the 
racing industry and later from the subsequent slaughter of these animals. It's 
ironic to see how these majestic creatures are exploited both in life and death 
by the state and the racing industry. Why is the state looking the other way 
pretending like nothing is happening?

 The article about the slaughtering of horses disgusted me. Why are humans so 
inhumane to all species? They are cruel to themselves as well as all animals. 
All that race horses, which are so ignominiously carted to meat-packing plants, 
have ever done is serve at the whim of their masters.

 Contrary to the impression given by the article, "They're Dying at the 
Finish," there are many people involved in thoroughbred racing doing whatever 
they can to keep thoroughbreds from slaughter. The author erred in stating that 
California Thoroughbred Sales (CTS) has a baseline price of $500 -- the fact is 
that CTS' parent company, the California Thoroughbred Breeders Assn. (CTBA), in 
an attempt to keep race horses from being sold for slaughter, early in 1993 
raised its baseline price to $1,000.

ROSE BOWL: IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With all the college bowl games coming up, I just want to know if there is a 
company or corporation that does not have a bowl game as a corporate 
sponsorship? 
</P>
<P>
 In Jim Hodges' article on the Rose Bowl (Dec. 27), he asks Terry Donahue about 
the critics who question if Rose Bowl officials would open the game to the top 
teams in the country instead of the Pac-10/Big Ten champions.I agree with Mr. 
Donahue. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The Rose Bowl is the only game left 
where we don't have grotesque corporate sponsorship. Thank God the Rose Bowl 
game has not lowered itself to the depths of becoming the Blockbuster Rose 
Bowl, Robinson's May Rose Bowl, or the Pep Boys Rose Bowl.

SALARY CAP? HOW ABOUT A CELEBRATION CAP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is an open letter to all players in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 There seems to be too many multimillion-dollar, egotistical yahoos determined 
to transform football stadiums into three-ring circuses. As a football player 
it's your job to sack the quarterback, catch 40-yard touchdown passes and block 
potential game-winning field goals. Don't worry, we know who you guys are 
without you jumping up and down like a bunch of screaming banshees! 
</P>
<P>
 Please save your celebrating for the appropriate time, after the game.

MCMAHON LIFTS VIKINGS INTO PLAYOFFS; PRO FOOTBALL: HE SPARKS 14-9 VICTORY OVER 
REDSKINS TO REACH POSTSEASON PLAY WITH HIS THIRD TEAM.

 Jim McMahon is back in the NFL playoffs. And this time it's the Minnesota 
Vikings he's taking with him. 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon's 11-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Carter was just enough to beat the 
Washington Redskins, 14-9, Friday and assure the Vikings a playoff spot for the 
second consecutive year under Coach Dennis Green. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim is the guy who somehow finds the way to get the job done," Green said. 
"They did a great deal of blitzing. When they're pressuring you a lot, you're 
not going to make a lot of great plays, but he had some nice throws." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (9-7) will likely face the loser of Sunday's Dallas-New York 
Giants game in a wild-card matchup. A loss Friday would have given New Orleans 
or Philadelphia a chance of taking the berth away from Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 The 34-year-old quarterback, who took Chicago to the playoffs three times in 
the '80s and went there with Philadelphia three years ago, was 19 of 32 for 225 
yards, enabling the Vikings to close the regular season with three consecutive 
victories for the first time since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good feeling, a lot of people counted us out," Carter said. "You want 
to play your best football in December. Hopefully, we can keep this going." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Redskins (4-12), it was a sorry end to their most dismal season in 
three decades. For the third time in four games, they failed to score a 
touchdown. The only question left is whether rookie Coach Richie Petitbon will 
keep his job a second year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins' only scores were on field goals of 37, 35 and 34 yards by Chip 
Lohmiller, who missed on two other attempts from 35 and 53 yards. The sole 
bright note for Washington was rookie running back Reggie Brooks, who rushed 
for 68 yards, giving him 1,063 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon found Carter open in the end zone with less than a minute remaining in 
the third quarter for what proved to be the winning touchdown after putting the 
Vikings into scoring position four plays earlier with a 30-yard pass to Cris 
Carter at the Redskin one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed some open guys . . . . but I really felt like we made the big plays 
when we had to," McMahon said. "Of course they had eight or nine guys on the 
line every play. Now it's a one-game season and anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The two Carters combined with McMahon for a total of 176 yards on 13 
completions after the Redskins shut down the Vikings' running game, holding 
Scottie Graham to 37 yards in 20 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to have him back there," Cris Carter said of McMahon, who has 
thrown six touchdown passes in the Vikings' last three games. "He doesn't get 
flustered. He came out in the third quarter and put together a good drive that 
put us up by more than a touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 Cris Carter caught a 24-yard pass at Washington's one in the second quarter to 
set up Minnesota's first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings went into a hurry-up offense 90 seconds before the half, but it 
backfired when McMahon, throwing from his 33 for Steve Jordan, was intercepted 
by Redskin linebacker Monte Coleman. A 14-yard return by Coleman set up 
Lohmiller's first field goal.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; SHELL FINDS PLUS IN LOSS TO GREEN BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only thing Coach Art Shell was happy about after Sunday's 28-0 loss to the 
Green Bay Packers was the Raiders being penalized only three times for 15 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an accomplishment for a team that had been on course to break the NFL 
record for most penalties and penalty yardage in a season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always keep track of penalties, and it was good that we didn't have many 
(in Green Bay)" Shell said Friday at the Raiders' El Segundo practice site. 
"That was the plus in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 With Sunday's game at the Coliseum against the Denver Broncos remaining, the 
Raiders have a league-leading 139 penalties for 1,121 yards. The league record 
for penalties in a year is 149 by the Houston Oilers in 1989, and the record 
for yardage is 1,274, set by the Raiders in 1969, when they played in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A telling sign about the Raiders' up-and-down season is that despite being a 
victory away from clinching a playoff berth, they have been outscored by 
opponents, 296 to 273. Denver, which has the same 9-6 record as the Raiders, 
has outscored opponents, 343 to 251. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve tight end Andrew Glover was placed on injured reserve because of a 
knee injury, and John Duff was activated from the practice roster. Defensive 
back Bryan Addison, who was released in training camp, was added to the 
practice roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jeff Hostetler (concussion) practiced this week and will play 
Sunday, as will fullback Steve Smith (ankle). Rookie defensive backs Patrick 
Bates (quadriceps) and James Trapp (groin) are questionable. LONNIE WHITE

PRO FOOTBALL / BILL PLASCHKE; NFL GOES BOWLING IN ITS OWN WAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 And you thought the only professionals competing in bowl games this weekend 
were on college football teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL has caught the spirit. For the first time since the AFL-NFL merger in 
1970, two divisional titles will be decided in final-weekend faceoffs Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Other showdowns will decide coaching careers, rushing titles and draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing missing in each game will be some sponsor with five 
unintelligible names or initials and a jowly guy standing at midfield handing 
out plaques. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 NFC EAST BOWL: Dallas Cowboys at New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 How big is a game where the winner earns the division championship, a 
first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 "To get that advantage . . . that is tremendous," Giant quarterback Phil Simms 
said. "And that is an understatement." 
</P>
<P>
 Simms and the Giants had better duck. And that is an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 In their earlier meeting in Dallas, Cowboy receiver Alvin Harper threw one 
more touchdown pass than Simms. The Dallas defense sacked Simms five times, 
equaling the worst beating he has received this year. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so Rodney Hampton didn't play for the Giants then. Replacement Lewis 
Tillman gained 82 yards and they still lost, 31-9. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know if we pull this off, everybody has to come to us," Cowboy guard Nate 
Newton said. "And it can get ugly in Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NFC CENTRAL BOWL: Green Bay Packers at Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of this game will become the division champion and probably play 
host to the loser in a first-round game next week. Hope the Lions have made 
flight arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 The erratic Packers, playing hard together every down for the first time, have 
even added that last, important act to their repertoire -- a swagger. 
</P>
<P>
 "For three years, the kids in the neighborhood have asked me what I was doing 
home in January," safety Leroy Butler said. "I'm going to send all those kids a 
telegram that says, 'This January, you can watch us on television.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers outgained the Lions, 404-205, in their previous meeting, a 26-17 
victory that was not that close. But this was before Coach Wayne Fontes dumped 
offensive coordinator Dan Henning and quarterback Rodney Peete in favor of Dave 
Levy and Erik Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions will miss Barry Sanders but are quick to tell you that in four 
games, replacements Derrick Moore and Eric Lynch have averaged 142 yards of 
offense, 22 yards more than Sanders was averaging. 
</P>
<P>
 Big deal. Reggie White said he hasn't played this well in several years. The 
Lions will see why. 
</P>
<P>
 UNEMPLOYMENT BOWL: Phoenix Cardinals at Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 When we say the loser here goes home, we mean it. There is a chance either 
Falcon Coach Jerry Glanville or Cardinal Coach Joe Bugel will be fired next 
week. Or both.  
</P>
<P>
 But both guys would agree, the end couldn't be more fitting. Glanville and 
Bugel, you see, shared an unheated log cabin as assistant coaches at Western 
Kentucky in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one bed, and they flipped a coin to see who slept there. The 
loser slept on stack of newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to wake up in the morning, and the comics were imprinted on my back," 
Glanville told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. "Maybe that is why I never got 
to close to newspaper guys." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 4.8-YARDS-AND-A-CLOUD-OF-DUST BOWL: Chicago Bears at Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Bettis of the Rams is 35 yards behind Cowboy Emmitt Smith in the NFL 
rushing race. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Worley of the Bears is 114 yards from reaching a clause that will force 
the Bears to owe the Steelers a fourth-round draft pick instead of a 
fifth-rounder as part of their earlier trade. Under today's system, that's a 
big leap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys sound like they are ready to concede Smith's title to Bettis -- 
"The Rams could give that young guy the ball 40-50 times, they have nothing to 
live for," Newton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears are conceding nothing with Worley, who hasn't gained more than 104 
yards in one game in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 THE WHY-IN-THE-HECK-DID-WE-SPEND-ALL-THIS-MONEY? BOWL: Seattle Seahawks at 
Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Chiefs lose, they will finish the season 10-6, their record last season 
before signing quarterback Joe Montana and running back Marcus Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 THE LEVERAGE BOWL: Cincinnati Bengals at New Orleans Saints 
</P>
<P>
 If the Bengals should win this game, it would prove they are completely out of 
their minds because it would put them at risk of losing the first pick in next 
spring's draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other teams, including the Rams, could tie the Bengals for the worst 
record. The "winner" would be the team that played the easiest schedule, a 
position currently shared by the Bengals and New England Patriots (120-120). 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals, happy with David Klingler, still claim they will not trade the 
top selection to a team that would take either of the likely top choices, Trent 
Dilfer of Fresno State and Heath Shuler of Tennessee, both quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't believe it. That first pick means too much to the quarterback-desperate 
Rams or Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem impossible, and foolish, for the Bengals to stick with running 
back Marshall Faulk of San Diego State and ignore the plethora of draft picks 
that will be offered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 BOOMER BOWL: New York Jets at Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 If Boomer Esiason of the Jets throws for more than 200 yards and a couple of 
touchdowns, he has a chance to increase his quarterback rating from 87.1 to the 
magic 89.0 figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic, because if he reaches that number, the Bengals would be awarded the 
Jets' second-round pick in next year's draft as a conditional part of last 
spring's trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: If the Jets are eliminated by Sunday night, with draft picks being 
so important these days, would he even play? 
</P>
<P>
 Said Esiason: "I'm really not allowed to discuss that subject." GO FIGURE 
</P>
<P>
 -- If nothing else, the union dues flap in Washington this week formalized 
what many have known since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most players did not know what they were signing when they agreed to the new 
union contract. Now that they do know, they hate it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why is the NFC East championship game Sunday attracting so much more 
attention than the NFC Central title bout? Easy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 16 years, an NFC Central team has won the conference championship 
only once -- the Bears in 1985. Only three teams -- the Bears, Rams and San 
Francisco 49ers -- from outside the NFC East during that span have advanced to 
the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Since 1984, who is the winningest quarterback in the NFL? Montana? Dan 
Marino? Steve Young? 
</P>
<P>
 Try the Denver Broncos' John Elway, who will bring his 101-57-1 record to the 
Coliseum against the Raiders on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Everybody knows about Elway's 32 fourth-quarter comeback drives. The NFL 
even made a best-selling video about them. 
</P>
<P>
 But an even more impressive number is that during 1,784 career drives, he has 
left the field only six times because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
 -- NFL players, more than any other pro athletes, take care of their own. This 
was evidenced when Cowboy center Mark Stepnoski was voted to the starting 
lineup in the Pro Bowl even though Stepnoski suffered a season-ending knee 
injury three weeks ago against the Vikings in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 A clause in Stepnoski's contract allows him to become a free agent this season 
if he makes the Pro Bowl. Thanks to his friends, he will soon become very rich.

<P>
 The Rams wrapped up their final full-scale practice of the season Friday, and 
the year ended as it began -- with players getting hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Rams opened training camp in July at Cal State Fullerton, linebacker 
Shane Conlan injured his knee on the first day of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sign of what was to come as the Rams experienced injury after injury 
throughout the season. The team presently has nine players on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final practice, linebacker Roman Phifer hurt his shoulder while 
reaching up to knock down a pass. In addition, defensive tackle Sean Gilbert 
reported to Rams Park limping. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert injured his ankle in Thursday's practice but didn't experience any 
real discomfort until the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said he still expects Phifer, who is the team's leading tackler, and 
Gilbert, a Pro Bowl selection, to start against the Chicago Bears on Sunday at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams placed guard Keith Loneker, who has an injured knee, on injured 
reserve to make room for tight end Kelly Blackwell. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-1, 255-pound Blackwell will not be in uniform for Sunday's game, 
but has been signed in preparation for next season because tight ends Pat 
Carter and Travis McNeal will be free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackwell signed with the Bears as a free agent a year ago and played in 16 
games. He was traded to Dallas last summer, played in two games and was 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also put wide receiver Fred Montgomery through a tryout. Montgomery, 
brother of the Raiders' Tyrone Montgomery and former Philadelphia running back 
Wilbert Montgomery, had been on Kansas City's practice squad before being 
released. The team made no immediate move to sign him. T.J. SIMERS

 The Atlanta Falcons' disappointing season has Deion Sanders thinking about 
giving up football for awhile. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, a cornerback with the Falcons and outfielder with the Atlanta Braves, 
said next season it might be baseball only. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's time to put all my focus on baseball and give that everything I've 
got so that I really have a great season," Sanders said. "They've taken away 
some of my love for the game (football) with the things they've done this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders said Falcon officials showed a lack of commitment to winning last week 
when they failed to work out contract extensions for several key players, 
including guard Chris Hinton and wide receiver Michael Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons (6-9) close the NFL season Sunday against Phoenix. They were 0-5 
before Sanders joined them immediately after the Braves lost in the National 
League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons were eliminated from the playoffs with losses to the Washington 
Redskins and Cincinnati Bengals the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott and inside linebacker Michael Brooks will start 
Sunday in the New York Giants' showdown with the Dallas Cowboys despite 
injuries that would keep them sidelined in a lesser contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott's back, which knocked him out of five of the last six games, is so 
tender that Coach Dan Reeves wouldn't predict how long he would last. Elliott 
will be replaced by Eric Moore if necessary, but Moore isn't in much better 
shape, having sprained his right ankle last week against Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks is nursing a sprained right foot, which has kept him out the last three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Elliott and Moore prove ineffective, seldom-used Clarence Jones might 
play his first major role of the season at left tackle.

 The first of the eight New Year's Day bowl games will be the Hall of Fame Bowl 
at Tampa, Fla. North Carolina State (7-4) takes on favored Michigan (7-4) in 
the game to be televised by ESPN at 8 a.m. The matchup in Tampa Stadium pits 
the size and strength of Michigan against the speed and quickness of North 
Carolina State. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Florida bowl game, the Carquest Bowl in Miami's Joe Robbie Stadium, 
has Boston College (8-3) facing Virginia (7-4), a team that lost four of its 
last six games. Channel 2 will televise the Carquest Bowl at 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to this game may be the performance of Virginia quarterback Symmion 
Willis, a first-year starter. Willis threw for 13 touchdowns and had just three 
interceptions in the Cavaliers' first five games. He was picked off 11 times 
and threw for only six touchdowns in the last six games.

 In the only other meeting between the teams, West Virginia upset Florida, 
26-6, in the 1981 Peach Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Gator Coach Charley Pell burned film of the game and later buried 
it in a corner of the Florida practice field and erected a small monument as a 
reminder to the embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Spurrier said he noticed the monument when he took over as Florida coach 
before the 1990 season, and had it removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "West Virginia is not a part of our practice field anymore," Spurrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia Coach Don Nehlen used the film-burning anecdote to make a 
not-so-subtle plea for a new practice field. Nehlen said there isn't enough 
room to bury anything on the Mountaineers' field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to find a hundred yards of field that is flat in West Virginia," 
Nehlen said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Jon Jones, who missed most of the season after breaking his leg in 
the season opener, will play a lot against Florida, Nehlen said. Jones was the 
starter until the injury and was replaced by sophomore Robert Walker, who 
gained 1,304 yards. 
</P>

 Jones returned late in the season but had not healed completely. Nehlen said 
the month off before the Sugar Bowl has helped. 
</P>

 "Jon Jones, going into the season, in my opinion, was a big league running 
back," Nehlen said. "Jon Jones (now) looks like Jon Jones. If he is Jon Jones, 
he's going to play."

 Nehlen may or may not celebrate his 58th birthday today. "After the game, I'll 
probably feel a helluva lot older or a helluva lot younger," he said. . . . The 
Mountaineers left rowdy New Orleans to spend Friday night before the game day 
at a remote, undisclosed location in Mississippi. "The noise is a factor," 
Nehlen said. "I'm glad we're leaving. I know they won't get into trouble where 
they're going because I've never heard of it." . . . Florida is looking for its 
first Sugar Bowl victory in the school's fourth appearance. CHRIS DUFRESNE

PREP BASKETBALL / COAST HOLIDAY CLASSIC; HUNTINGTON BEACH HOLDS OFF NEWPORT 
HARBOR, WINS TITLE 
</P>

<P>
 After surviving five Newport Harbor rallies, Huntington Beach pulled away down 
the stretch to beat the Sailors, 78-73, in the championship game of the Coast 
Holiday Classic Friday night at Estancia High School. 
</P>
<P>
 With tournament MVP Tony Gonzalez on the bench after drawing his fifth foul 
and a 73-70 lead with 47 seconds remaining, Huntington Beach (6-6) got some 
clutch free-throw shooting from Josh Holland and Vasili Hatzirias, who hit two 
with 35 seconds remaining for a 76-70 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach had leads of eight, nine and 10 points four times only to see 
the Sailors come fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it would be that type of game," Huntington Beach Coach Roy Miller 
said. "They have a number of weapons. You think you're comfortable and someone 
hits a 22-footer and they're back in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez contributed 30 points, eight rebounds and five assists, but he got in 
trouble when he lost his cool after being called for his third foul and drawing 
a technical with 1:34 remaining. Newport's Paul Tayyar, who had just hit a 
three-point basket, hit both free throws to narrow the Sailors' deficit to 
70-68. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatzirias, who had 16 points and four assists, hit a free throw with 1:18 
remaining and Matt Jones hit both ends of a one-and-one with 57 seconds left 
for a 73-68 lead before Gonzalez fouled out and center Ramy Shoukry made two 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor (7-5) was led in scoring by Danny Pulido with 23 points and 
Tayyar with 18 points, including three three-point field goals. Matt Malmquist 
added 13 points for Huntington Beach, which is 5-3 since Gonzalez rejoined team 
after the football playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 Edison 54, Long Beach Jordan 51 -- Micah Kroeger scored 23 points for Edison 
(7-1). Edison led, 17-6, after one quarter but the teams were tied, 26-26, at 
the half. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In the fifth-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia 60, Corona del Mar 59 -- Estancia led, 59-51, with a minute left and 
hung on. Corona del Mar's Dan MacMillan made a three-pointer as time ran out to 
make it a one-point game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Pierson had 17 points and Clay Frenz added 15 for Estancia (7-7). Frenz, 
a senior guard, scored 11 points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 MacMillan had 10 of his 12 points in the fourth quarter for Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In the seventh-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 64, Santa Maria Righetti 53 -- Greg Foster scored a game-high 23 points 
for Irvine (4-7), the defending tournament champion. Foster showed balance in 
the entire game, scoring six in the first quarter, five each in the second and 
third and seven in the forth quarter. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In the consolation championship: 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills 56, Napa Vintage 54 (OT) -- Donald Myers (six points) of Dana Hills 
scored the only basket of overtime. Dana Hills led, 27-26, at the half but 
needed a strong second half from Bob Hefty, a senior forward, to reach 
overtime.

O.C. DEPUTY EULOGIZED AS DEDICATED LAWMAN; FUNERAL: CONTROVERSY IS SET ASIDE AS 
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS, FRIENDS AND FAMILY HONOR DARRYN LEROY ROBINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The controversy surrounding the Christmas Day shooting death of Orange County 
Sheriff's Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins was momentarily forgotten Friday during a 
funeral service that celebrated the life of an outstanding lawman, a fun-loving 
prankster and a dedicated husband and father. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,200 law enforcement officials in full dress and friends and family 
gathered for a wrenching, two-hour eulogy at First Church of God to honor the 
30-year-old deputy. Robins' widow, Rosemary, sat with their 18-month-old 
daughter, Melissa, who fidgeted with her bonnet and drank from her bottle, too 
young to understand the sadness at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 During one of her husband's favorite Hawaiian folk songs, Rosemary Robins, who 
is from Hawaii, rocked in her seat and cried softly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Goodby, partner," said Deputy Duane Turner, whose voice cracked as he 
recounted Robins' dedication to steering south Orange County youths away from 
drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rest in peace. A job well done. We will never forget you," said Orange County 
Sheriff Brad Gates, who along with many others praised Robins' accomplishments 
during his eight years with the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, more than 150 gleaming patrol cars from police agencies from 
throughout Southern California lined Crenshaw Boulevard. A procession of more 
than 200 vehicles, led by 70 officers on motorcycles, wended their way to Green 
Hills Memorial Park in Rancho Palos Verdes as a testament to Robins' popularity 
and the pain that every officer feels when one of their own falls in the line 
of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins was laid to rest with full honors, including a 21-gun salute and a 
"missing man" formation helicopter flyover. As many in the crowd looked on and 
wept, the deputy's colleagues handed Rosemary Robins the folded American flag 
that had covered her husband's casket. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular officer was shot by fellow Deputy Brian P. Scanlan as they were 
re-enacting an earlier traffic stop in a deserted parking lot behind a Lake 
Forest movie theater on Christmas Day. Scanlan had a loaded gun during the 
drill and shot Robins in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery surrounding the shooting has raised some concerns that race may 
have played a role. Robins is black and Scanlan is white. Those close to Robins 
say they believe the shooting was unintentional but said they want details 
about what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe it was a black-white thing at all," said Harold Griffin, 31, 
of Los Angeles, who grew up with Robins. "But I would like to see some answers 
to some questions before we can put this behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting was referred to only once during the funeral service by a pastor 
who termed it an "accident." 
</P>
<P>
 After the church ceremony, Gates and other Orange County officials again 
declined to provide details on the shooting, which is being investigated by the 
Orange County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Supervisor William G. Steiner, who attended the ceremony, said 
he could provide no further details. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we help matters at this point by speculation," Steiner said. 
"The family has shown such strength and forgiveness, we should learn a lesson 
from them." Friends said Rosemary Robins has expressed no animosity toward 
Scanlan, who was invited to the funeral but did not attend. Scanlan's family 
said he is devastated. 
</P>
<P>
 While any police killing drives home the difficult job facing law enforcement 
officers, the circumstances of Robins' shooting only worsens the grief, said 
Deputy Gary Byerley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's harder for us because it was an accident, you really can't blame 
anyone," said Byerley, who worked with Robins for two years in Lake Forest. "I 
think that's what Darryn would say. They (Robins and Scanlan) were very good 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Robins, who lived in Torrance, was the kind of man who enjoyed making others 
smile -- usually through a joke or good-natured prank, Byerley said. Friends 
say Robins lived for his work and his family but especially for his daughter, 
who he often referred to as his "bag of diamonds." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just always a joker, always happy," Byerley said. "He didn't like 
crooks, but he was very fair. He'd cut somebody a break if he thought they 
deserved it." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the open-casket ceremony, legions of officers stood at attention in 
the main fellowship hall and an adjacent overflow room, listening to many 
eulogies of the man described as "upbeat" and "an inspiration" to his family 
and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates described Robbins as "an outstanding deputy who was always striving to 
improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Just days before his death, Robins had addressed more than 1,400 
schoolchildren through the department's outreach program, telling them that he 
would always be available if they ever needed his advice, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed to be a calling for Robins, who would reinvigorate drug and gang 
talks by setting them to rap music, earning him the nickname Deputy "Rappin' " 
Robins. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will never be another one like him," Turner said.

SALUTING O.C. FOLKS WHO MADE DIFFERENCE FOR OTHERS; HEROES: THEY RANGE FROM THE 
MEN WHO TURNED IN A SUSPECTED KILLER TO THOSE WHO TRIED TO SAVE A BABY WHALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The year that ended Friday -- a year that brought Orange County devastating 
wildfires, damaging mudslides and record-breaking crime -- surely tested the 
physical endurance and emotional resilience of county residents. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, these 12 months of misfortune, disaster and catastrophe couldn't end 
soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
 But for at least a few, 1993 provided opportunities to demonstrate courage, 
compassion and simple human decency in ways that made a major difference in the 
lives of others. 
</P>
<P>
 In one notable case, lives may have been saved by the quick action of two men 
who thought they had spotted a suspected killer in a Huntington Beach sports 
bar and then refused to be dissuaded. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, fired postal worker Mark Richard Hilbun, allegedly had already killed 
two people and wounded five others in a two-day spree of violence across Orange 
County. After the bar patrons called police, Hilbun was arrested without 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Less dramatic but no less significant, a Santa Ana police officer worked with 
infectious enthusiasm throughout the year to ease the lot of needy students and 
hungry families. And a Laguna Beach couple volunteered long hours in 1993's 
final months to organize a coalition aimed at helping those left homeless in 
the Oct. 27 fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In another uplifting effort, more than 100 people, led by the manager of a 
Costa Mesa radio station, labored tirelessly one July day to lessen the 
suffering of an emaciated baby minke whale that had become lodged against a 
jetty off Newport Beach. The whale died the next day, but the man who led the 
effort was touched by its struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 These are their stories, a brief respite from the onslaught of troubling 
events that marked so much of 1993. Making the Call 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, Humberto Ochoa and Demy Mourani are happy they were there, 
hoisting a few in their neighborhood pub, the Centerfield Sports Bar and Grill 
on Beach Boulevard in the small hours of Saturday, May 8. And, they add 
delicately, they are also glad they were not entirely sober. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, we'd had a few beers," Ochoa, known as "Bear," said thoughtfully. 
"I don't think we could have been so calm if we hadn't had those." 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa, 25, and Mourani, 26, had just finished watching the Los Angeles Kings' 
playoff victory on television when they noticed a man they hadn't seen at the 
bar before. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bar is like 'Cheers' for us," Ochoa said, referring to the now-defunct 
TV series about regulars in a neighborhood bar. "So when this guy comes in -- 
he's small, he's wearing this lame Hawaiian shirt and just looks kind of goofy 
-- you kind of notice him." 
</P>
<P>
 Mourani, a mail sorter for United Parcel Service, says Ochoa was the first to 
spot the man's resemblance to the fired letter carrier whom police were seeking 
in connection with a bloody South County rampage that had begun the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they went out that night, Mourani and Ochoa had glanced at the news and 
had seen the computerized images of how the suspect would look if he changed 
his appearance, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Bear said it, I said: 'That couldn't be him,' " Mourani says. "But then 
I looked at him again and it was him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa, an out-of-work computer operator, and Mourani went to a bar employee 
they knew, excitedly telling him the suspected postal killer was there. The 
bartender "looked at us like we were just two drunk fools" and did nothing, 
Ochoa says. 
</P>
<P>
 So they acted on their own. First, they tried to call police from a noisy pay 
phone inside the bar. Then they split up, with Mourani heading outside to make 
the call and Ochoa staying inside to keep an eye on the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I forgot all about 911," Mourani says. "I called the operator, asked for 
police and just said: 'I've got a positive ID on the postal killer.' But I'm 
half-blitzed, stuttering; I thought they wouldn't believe me." 
</P>
<P>
 They did. The officers arrived within five minutes, quickly talked to the two 
men near the back door, then approached the suspect, who was arrested without 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun, 39, was charged with two counts of murder and seven counts of 
attempted murder. He is scheduled to appear in court Jan. 25 for a preliminary 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mourani and Ochoa were treated like heroes. Everyone wanted to buy them beers. 
People they did not know stopped to shake hands or slap them on the back. 
Uncles in Italy and cousins in Mexico saw them on the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, they say, radio personality Howard Stern called and interviewed 
them on the air for 45 minutes. "That was a trip, man," Ochoa says. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone even offered Ochoa a job after hearing of his role, but it didn't work 
out, he says. He is now trying to get work at the Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 If Hilbun is convicted, the two men hope to collect the $25,000 reward the 
U.S. Post Office offered in the case. They have made a formal application for 
the money but must wait for the trial's outcome. "If we get it, we'll just 
split it right down the middle," Ochoa says. "We didn't even know there was a 
reward for something like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, all we did was make a phone call." 'An Angel in Blue' 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Police Officer Peter Jensen would rather not talk about himself and 
what he does as a long-term community problem-solver at the central district 
substation on McFadden Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just kind of a middle man here," Jensen says in protest. "I hate the idea 
of all these other people helping so much and I'm going to get all the credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say Jensen, who has worked for the Police Department for six years, the 
last two as a community liaison officer, does not get credit often enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an angel in blue," says Helen Brown, who heads the Civic Center Barrio 
Housing Corp., a nonprofit organization that develops housing for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "His work is just outstanding," adds Lt. Jose Garcia, Jensen's supervisor. "I 
can't speak highly enough about him. He's got that genuine enthusiasm, that 
very, very positive outlook." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, when Jensen was ready to return to limited duty after being out 
several months because of a neck injury, it was Garcia who came up with the 
idea of using the young officer as a problem-solver. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to try to bring about solutions to situations that could develop 
into police problems if they weren't addressed," the supervisor says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen's first project, to bring an end to the problem of transients 
congregating near Chestnut Avenue and Center Street, won him a commendation 
from police and city officials, Garcia says. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer has also played a pivotal role in his district's Weed and Seed 
program, meeting frequently with local property owners, teaching them how to 
organize no-trespassing efforts to help reduce crime, and showing them how to 
cut through the city's red tape, Garcia says. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two years, Jensen has also "adopted" at least one class at nearby 
Pio Pico Elementary School at Christmastime, donating shoes, clothing, art 
supplies and classroom equipment for the students, the two men say. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his involvement with the Royal Vikings of Orange County, a Laguna 
Beach-based philanthropic group, Jensen this year arranged for the delivery of 
Christmas baskets to more than 200 needy families associated with two of his 
favorite projects: Pio Pico Elementary and the Civic Center Barrio Housing 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 And, with money left over from his collections from business associations and 
fellow officers, Jensen started a small fund for families that cannot afford to 
pay for the medical prescriptions that their children desperately need. 
</P>
<P>
 With a recent clearance from his doctor, Jensen will be leaving his special 
assignment in February to return to full-time patrol, but he is determined to 
continue his community work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regardless of where I am, I'm going to keep doing it," he says. "There's just 
too much that still needs to be done." Catalysts for Fire Aid 
</P>
<P>
 It was all a mistake, Ed Sauls says, joking. He and his wife, Lisa, wanted to 
do something to help Laguna Beach fire victims, but never had any intention of 
becoming quite so involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the fire, Ed Sauls had called the Laguna Presbyterian Church and 
left a message for its pastor, Dr. Jerry Tankersley. "We said we'd like to help 
people," he says. "We didn't know exactly what we could do, but we're 
self-starters and we wanted to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 That same afternoon, at the urging of Tankersley, another church member 
telephoned the Saulses at home. "We understand you're in charge of the relief 
effort," the church member told Ed Sauls. "What can we do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than back away from the challenge, the Saulses by the next morning had 
gathered a group of about 30 people at the church to start determining the most 
urgent needs of residents whose homes had been destroyed or damaged. A second 
meeting later that day drew nearly 60 people, including Laguna Beach's 
then-Mayor Lida Lenney, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, 
representatives of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Red Cross, 
churches and community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the committee has been incorporated as the Laguna Fire Relief 
Coalition, an umbrella group headed by Ed Sauls and made up of 26 organizations 
and churches. Its projects have included giving away clothing at the church in 
the first days after the fire, counseling survivors, filling thousands of 
sandbags to help prevent further damage from mudslides, helping survivors find 
rental housing and financial assistance, and establishing a communications 
network and a supply bank. 
</P>

 "Ed and Lisa have functioned as real catalysts here in pulling a group of 
people together in our own congregation and the community to form the 
coalition's basic organization," Tankersley says. "And they've done it not in 
an authoritarian style, but in a real participatory, inclusive style that has 
made everyone feel welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 While Ed Sauls' role has been leadership and administration -- keeping an 
extremely diverse coalition focused on its task -- Lisa Sauls has been in 
charge of the coalition's efforts to provide direct assistance to survivors, 
those involved say. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, she has established the communications network, using volunteers 
to help provide more than 370 families affected by the fire with the latest 
information about available financial assistance, counseling and merchant 
giveaways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through Lisa's efforts, a lot of rumors were controlled, especially early 
on," says Doug Landrum, a Laguna lawyer who is the coalition's secretary. "She 
has made sure that the survivors had an even, steady flow of information. She 
has just spent an unbelievable amount of time dedicating her life since the 
fire to easing the burden of recovery for the survivors." 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, two months after the fire, both are still spending many hours on the 
fire relief effort. Ed Sauls, who runs an environmental consulting firm out of 
the couple's home, estimates he spends at least 20 hours a week on coalition 
work. Lisa, who works part time as a certified public accountant, figures her 
fire-related hours total about 30 a week these days. The couple also have three 
young children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some wonderful friends and we have relied very heavily on them, 
especially for help with the children," Ed Sauls said. "They've been wonderful, 
helping us help the community right now and that's something we feel very 
strongly about." Bid to Save Rocky

 Just before 7 a.m. July 24, Don Crawford was making his way down the beach 
near his apartment in West Newport. Crawford, the manager of three Christian 
radio stations, was planning a leisurely Saturday of watching football and 
reading the Bible as soon as he finished his daily run. 
</P>
<P>
 But near 56th Street, he glanced over at a rock jetty and saw a large fin 
waving back and forth in the surf. 
</P>
<P>
 On closer look, Crawford discovered a 13 1/2-foot baby minke whale, 
disoriented, hundreds of pounds underweight and unable to keep itself from 
crashing again and again onto the rocks of the jetty. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford, who would end up spending the next seven hours trying to help the 
whale survive, says he was motivated by "all the death and violence out there 
in the world these days. You see something like this trying to live, and you 
just feel like you have to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, after an effort to return the animal to the sea failed, Crawford and as 
many as 200 others -- including lifeguards, beach-goers and city workers -- 
tried to keep the whale's skin moist, bathing it with water carried up in 
buckets from the waves. They petted it, tried to soothe it and dubbed it 
"Rocky" because of its battle against the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was really a pulling together of everyone out there that day," says Tom 
Goff, curator of mammals at the Sea World in San Diego, where the whale was 
eventually taken. "People were really working together to try to help this 
animal. It was wonderful to see." 
</P>
<P>
 While Goff and other experts on the scene quickly assessed the whale's chances 
of survival as minimal, they say they found the all-out effort on its behalf 
remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone out there was just working tremendously together," says John 
Heyning, curator of mammals at the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum, 
who helped direct the rescue effort. "If it had had any chance at all of making 
it, they were certainly all doing everything they could to help it along." 
</P>
<P>
 The whale, which was found to be suffering from an infection and severe 
malnutrition, died the next day. But Crawford, among others, says he will not 
forget having tried to save it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was about to go back and start watching football and then all of a sudden, 
I'm out there on the beach, trying to save a live being from dying," he says 
recently, marveling still. "It was not life-changing exactly, but still it was 
a very meaningful experience for me."

PLO GETS WARNING FROM RABIN; MIDEAST: THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER ACCUSES ARAFAT 
OF BACKING OFF FROM AUTONOMY ACCORD. HE ALSO THREATENS TO WITHDRAW CONCESSIONS 
IF PALESTINIAN TEAM FORCES NEW TALKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, increasing pressure on the Palestine 
Liberation Organization to compromise on terms for Palestinian self-government, 
warned Friday that if the PLO reopened the negotiations, everything would be on 
the table and previous Israeli concessions would be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin said that any PLO rejection of the package of compromises worked out 
during intensive talks this week in Cairo would return the negotiations on 
implementation of the autonomy agreement to their starting point. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as there is no approval from (PLO headquarters in) Tunis for the 
paper, which we view as a summing-up (of understandings), there is no approval 
from Jerusalem," Rabin said. "And if there will be no approval from Tunis, 
everything we say in the paper will be open to renewed examination." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin said in press interviews Friday that he is content to wait and will not 
be rushed into making further concessions out of fear that the current impasse 
in negotiations amounts to a deeper crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not suggest that anyone stand by with a stopwatch or even a calendar 
to count the days or even weeks," Rabin told the popular Israeli newspaper 
Yediot Aharonot when asked how long it might take to reach an agreement. 
"Israel can continue with the existing reality -- we are ruling the (occupied) 
territories." 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that he had received a message from PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat by fax 
Friday, Rabin accused Arafat of trying to back away from the agreement reached 
by Israeli and PLO negotiators in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The remarks of the chairman are far from anything that was discussed and 
agreed," Rabin told British journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel maintains that the negotiators for the two sides reached a series of 
basic compromises in lengthy negotiations this week in Cairo but that the PLO 
is now reneging in hopes of more concessions. The Palestinians assert that the 
draft joint statement reflected Israeli proposals and that, in any event, the 
agreement was to refer it to Tunis and Jerusalem for review and comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "To start now to argue about what was reached -- and some of the Palestinians 
try to present the paper as an Israeli proposal -- is total nonsense," Rabin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two faxes from the PLO, one from Arafat on Friday and the other from a top 
negotiator Thursday, reportedly put forward fundamental changes on three of the 
four points that have delayed the beginning of an Israeli troop withdrawal from 
the Gaza Strip and Jericho, originally scheduled for Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The three still-contentious issues and the objections raised by the PLO: 
</P>
<P>
 * Control -- Israeli, Palestinian or joint -- of border crossings from Egypt 
into the Gaza Strip and from Jordan into the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO wants separate border control points to check everyone entering and 
leaving its self-rule areas, with only "invisible" Israeli monitoring by 
cameras and electronic sensors. 
</P>
<P>
 It rejected an Israeli proposal for one border terminal with an Israeli window 
and a Palestinian window separated by a glass partition, saying that those 
arrangements would give Israeli officials the right to inspect -- and reject -- 
Palestinian travelers before Palestinian officials even see them. 
</P>
<P>
 * The size of the autonomous Jericho area. Israel has offered an area of about 
22 square miles running north, south and west of the town of Jericho; the PLO 
wants a larger area that would be linked to bridges across the Jordan River. 
</P>
<P>
 * Security for the 5,000 Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip. The PLO said the 
area connecting Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip should not exceed nine 
square miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO reportedly raised no objections on a fourth issue -- continued Israeli 
military deployments along the frontiers between Gaza and Egypt and Jericho and 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials dismissed as "unreasonable" the suggested changes, and Rabin 
indicated that he would take his time in replying to Arafat's message. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel sees the Palestinian demands for control of border crossings, a 
presence on the international frontiers and a large area around Jericho as an 
attempt to turn the autonomous region into a state. Palestinians feel that 
Israel is unable to move from the mentality of an occupier to that of a 
peaceful neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin said that Israel needs to maintain control of the crossings to protect 
its security and to prevent an influx of Palestinian refugees. "For me, the 
main issues on the crossings are security checks of people, checks of baggage 
and prevention of mass entrance of Palestinians who do not reside in the 
territories," he told Yediot. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin stressed his underlying confidence that a settlement will be reached 
and the accord on self-government will go into effect, though perhaps later 
than the timetable envisioned in the basic pact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sure in the long run, agreement will be reached and the Declaration of 
Principles will be implemented," he said. "Time is of great importance, but the 
substance of the agreement about phase No. 1, 'Gaza-Jericho First,' is the key 
for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not implement anything before an agreement satisfactory to the two 
sides will be reached and signed." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and the PLO agreed in Cairo to continue talks at the working level next 
week at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba, with a meeting of senior officials 
possible in Cairo late in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Further confirmation came, meanwhile, of exploratory talks between Israeli and 
Syrian political scientists and military specialists on formulas that would 
ensure Israeli security following troop pullbacks in the Golan Heights, and 
spelling out what kind of relationship the two countries would then have. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiated by the Search for Common Ground, a private Washington-based group, 
these talks apparently have been used by both countries as a way to get formal 
peace negotiations moving. 
</P>
<P>
 Gad Ben-Ari, a Rabin spokesman, said that it was not clear what significance 
the private discussions would have. In Damascus, a Syrian government spokesman 
denied reports of secret talks between Israeli and Syrian "officials," leaving 
open the possibility that the private meetings had been authorized. 
</P>
<P>
 Yossi Olmert, a former Israeli government official and a specialist on Syria, 
said the unofficial meetings took place between May and October in Switzerland, 
Germany, Turkey and Norway and that a working paper was developed outlining 
steps in a pullback in the Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Olmert, a former Israeli negotiator at Arab-Israeli peace talks in Washington, 
said the Syrians showed more flexibility regarding Israeli withdrawal and the 
status of Jewish settlements in the Golan Heights than they had in formal 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not elaborate on the proposals, calling them only "trial balloons, 
but very specific trial balloons because the questions discussed were the same 
as those by the decision-makers." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel captured the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau on its northeastern 
border, from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War and effectively annexed it in 
1981. Syria, Israel's strongest Arab adversary, wants the territory back as a 
condition for making peace.

EURO DISNEY MAY HAVE TO CLOSE, EISNER WARNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The beleaguered Euro Disney theme park outside Paris is doing so poorly it 
might have to close unless it gets help soon from its lenders, the chairman of 
Walt Disney Co. said in an interview published Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael D. Eisner, in his strongest remarks yet about the troubled 
20-month-old park, was quoted in the French weekly magazine Le Point as saying 
"everything is possible" concerning Euro Disney's future, "including closure," 
if efforts to improve the park's financial health fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner's comments surfaced a few days after he termed Euro Disney's 
performance "dreadful." Disney owns 49% of Euro Disney SCA, the park's 
operating company; the rest is held by private investors. Disney also manages 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The debt-laden attraction lost $920 million in its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 
which led to a $78-million fourth-quarter loss for Burbank-based Disney in the 
same fiscal year -- the entertainment giant's first quarterly loss in nine 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those problems, analysts say it is unlikely that Disney will close the 
park, 20 miles east of the French capital. The company's reputation -- not to 
mention hundreds of millions of its dollars -- is at stake in the venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner's comments, and earlier tough talk about the park's future by Disney 
executives, are seen by many observers as an effort to pressure Euro Disney's 
bank lenders and other creditors to quickly reach agreement on a plan to ease 
the park's debt burden. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more of a negotiating tactic than anything else," one trader in Paris 
told the Reuters news agency Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by Le Point if he had threatened Euro Disney's lenders with the 
withdrawal of Disney's support, Eisner replied: "The word threaten doesn't seem 
fair to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always said we would support Euro Disney until March 31," Eisner 
said. "If a fair accord is found from now until then between the Walt Disney 
Co. and all the banks and investors, then Euro Disney continues. That would be 
a happy end in the tradition of the Disney universe." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Eisner's refusal to rule out the park's closure triggered an 8% slide 
in Euro Disney's stock price Friday, to 30.4 francs ($5.14) a share in Paris 
trading. Shares in Walt Disney Co. fell $1.125, to $42.625, in New York Stock 
Exchange composite trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's corporate offices were closed Friday, and Eisner and other officials 
could not be reached for comment on the French article. 
</P>
<P>
 Since opening in April, 1992, Euro Disney has been plagued by Europe's 
recession, a strong French franc relative to other European currencies (which 
makes it more expensive for foreign tourists), bad weather and interest costs 
on the park's debt, which is more than $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of souvenirs and meals at the park are also below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Disney has noted that by drawing 17 million guests in its first 1 1/2 
years of business, Euro Disney has become the leading vacation resort on the 
European continent. For that reason, and because Disney has so much pride 
wrapped up in the venture, Disney watchers do not expect Euro Disney to close. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney does have some other options. Besides a financial reorganization of the 
park, the company might close some of Euro Disney's six hotels to cut costs, or 
might keep the park open only eight months a year to avoid the cold rainy 
season, analysts have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney itself has been coy about discussing which options it prefers, or how 
much more it is willing to invest to prop up the park. 
</P>
<P>
 In the company's fiscal 1993 annual report, released earlier this week, Eisner 
did say that despite Euro Disney's "dreadful" showing, Disney is "committed to 
exploring all reasonable alternatives toward helping to put Euro Disney on a 
sound financial footing." 
</P>
<P>
 But he also warned that "we will take no action to endanger the health of 
Disney itself." 
</P>
<P>
 When Euro Disney's financial results were announced last week, they included a 
warning from the company's auditors that the park might go broke unless its 
gets financial breathing room this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not so stupid that we didn't weigh the seriousness of these losses," Le 
Point quoted Eisner as saying. "Disney is injured, it's a serious injury, but 
it's neither death nor the end."

STATE CANDIDATES FACE A JADED ELECTORATE IN '94 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The beginning of this crucial election year finds scores of office-seekers 
getting ready to unleash the rhetoric of optimism and hope on a distinctly 
unreceptive audience -- a California electorate battered by economic trauma, 
wrenching social change, waves of natural disaster and shocking violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a voting public that has become, perhaps more than ever, caustically 
skeptical about the government's ability to do its job, pollsters who measure 
such things say. 
</P>
<P>
 Against that backdrop, more than 30 potential candidates for eight major 
statewide offices -- headed by the governorship -- are preparing speeches and 
position papers that they hope will persuade voters that each has the secret 
for reviving the California dream. For most, the formula will include promises 
to lock up violent criminals longer. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Californians vote in the general election Nov. 8, the winners are 
likely to be those survivors who managed to spend the most millions to persuade 
jaded voters that their opponents are slightly worse scoundrels than they are. 
</P>
<P>
 The public mood is at or near record low levels in opinion polls gauging how 
people feel about the direction California is going, how the state stacks up as 
a place to live, and what sort of job the governor and Legislature are doing, 
said Mark DiCamillo of the Field Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty dismal, depressing view," DiCamillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy and unemployment remain key issues, as they were in the 1992 
presidential election, Los Angeles Times Poll Director John Brennan said. But 
in the past year, they have been joined by crime and illegal immigration, "and 
(those) will affect the character of this year's races," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that the major issues are tailor-made for negative campaigns that 
could radiate more heat than light about issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners will not necessarily be the ones who have the best fix for 
California -- if there is such a thing -- but those who are the most adept at 
fixing blame, veteran pollsters and political analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not good for an incumbent, and Gov. Pete Wilson is the incumbent," 
DiCamillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury is out on the blame game," Brennan said. "That is, will the voters 
blame Bill Clinton or Pete Wilson for the state's economic woes? Or, should the 
economy improve, who'll get the credit?" 
</P>
<P>
 Almost any election in California is pivotal in some sense, if only because it 
is the nation's one true superstate and is often viewed by national political 
experts as a caldron of political trends. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 1994 election has a number of unique aspects that will thrust it into 
the national limelight: 
</P>
<P>
 * Democrats hope to build on their major victories of 1992 by reclaiming the 
California governorship for the first time since Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. 
left office in January, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 * Republican Wilson, who has suffered the worst poll ratings of any modern 
California chief executive, will battle to avoid being the first incumbent 
governor to be denied a second term since Culbert L. Olson in 1942. If the 
60-year-old Wilson wins, it would be considered by many to be a comeback of 
mammoth proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 * If Democrat Kathleen Brown wins the governorship, she would become the third 
woman to occupy the state's top three electoral positions, joining Democratic 
U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. Feinstein also would have to win 
a full term in the Senate contest on the ballot in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Brown victory would re-establish what has become something of a Brown 
family political dynasty in California. The last two Democratic governors were 
her brother Jerry, 1975-83, and her father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., 1959-67. 
The last Democratic governor who was not a Brown was Olson half a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Kathleen Brown, 48, the incumbent state treasurer, can claim that 
prize, she will have to defeat state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, 48, 
in the June 7 Democratic primary. Although Brown has far outdistanced Garamendi 
in fund raising, he is a veteran former legislator and campaigner who experts 
say is capable of giving Brown a tough fight for their party's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the voters in a foul mood, there is no lack of contenders for 
statewide offices. One reason is that only two incumbents are expected to seek 
reelection to the positions they hold: Wilson and GOP Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
 Other top officials are retiring or seeking other posts, creating 
opportunities for a new wave of political aspirants. Brown and Garamendi have 
to give up their jobs to run for governor, and Democratic Controller Gray Davis 
is running for lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
 A second reason is that members of the Legislature are approaching the term 
limits written into law by voters in Proposition 140 in 1990. With their 
legislative futures cut short, at least a dozen state senators and Assembly 
members have declared for statewide office or are strongly considering it. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the statewide offices, Californians will also choose 52 members 
of the House of Representatives, all 80 members of the state Assembly and 20 of 
40 state senators. Also on the ballot will be an assortment of county officials 
and four members of the State Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Senate elections could be particularly crucial because this is where 
the Republicans have, on paper, the best opportunity to control one of the two 
legislative houses for the first time in two decades. After a series of GOP 
victories in special elections, offset only by Democrat Steve Peace's victory 
in San Diego County this week, the Democratic margin in the Senate has been 
trimmed to 22 to 16 plus two independents. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes 21 votes to control organization of the Senate and to pass most 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring a series of upsets, Democrats are expected to maintain control of the 
Assembly under Speaker Willie Brown of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Brown or Garamendi wins the governorship, a GOP-controlled Senate could 
stymie her or his programs, or at least be in a position to negotiate 
significant concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, the real prize for both parties is the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is not expected to have any significant opposition in the Republican 
primary in June when he asks renomination for a second term, even though he has 
been stigmatized by the worst poll ratings of any modern governor and is 
disliked by the most conservative members of his party for raising taxes and 
his moderate views on abortion, gay rights and some environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Early polls indicate that either Brown or Garamendi would run ahead of Wilson 
if they were matched at this point. But the pollsters caution that such surveys 
mean little at this stage because most voters know little about Brown or 
Garamendi, each serving their first terms in state offices. 
</P>
<P>
 How the campaigns are conducted could prove decisive, DiCamillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the challenger has to do is to keep the spotlight on the incumbent and to 
not become the issue themselves," he said. "The issue is Pete Wilson and the 
state of California -- a vote yes or no on the incumbent. . . . The best Wilson 
can hope for is that both (Brown and Garamendi) are seen negatively, that both 
are not viewed as living up to their high expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll's Brennan said that some of the "Democratic tail wind" that 
helped President Clinton carry California in 1992, and that elected Feinstein 
and Boxer, has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into the 1992 election, Democrats led Republicans 46% to 32% when 
California residents were asked which party could do a better job of handling 
the state's problems, Brennan said. A year later, it was 33% for the GOP and 
29% for the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is good, but not great, news for the GOP," Brennan said. "The change is 
in the decline of the Democratic number. The Republicans have gained little on 
the question." 
</P>
<P>
 The big increase was in the number of respondents who had no faith in either 
party to do the job, up from 14% in 1992 to 30% one year later. 
</P>
<P>
 On crime and illegal immigration, Wilson sought to get a jump on his likely 
opponents by calling for major crackdowns on both issues last summer and fall. 
Since then, Brown and Garamendi have announced programs that differ from 
Wilson's mostly in the details. 
</P>
<P>
 The upswing in crime as a key issue would seem to help Wilson because crime 
traditionally has been considered a Republican issue and Wilson campaigns have 
always had a strong anti-crime theme, DiCamillo said. The Wilson posture is 
this, he added: "I'm going to outflank whoever challenges me as tough on 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Wilson has boasted of a new spirit of cooperation with 
legislative leaders, passage of a state budget on time and approval of tax 
incentives to help revive the business economy. California is on the road back, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Wilson narrowly defeated Feinstein by campaigning as a compassionate 
conservative, who was tough on crime and fiscally conservative but sympathetic 
to environmentalists and social moderates on other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 That year, with the economy not yet in the doldrums, both Feinstein and Wilson 
talked of maintaining the California lifestyle, protecting the environment and 
of converting the state's defense machine to peacetime production. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Wilson took office, the slump was in full swing, the budget plunged 
into the red and he was forced to join the Legislature in boosting taxes by $7 
billion in his first year.

 California also suffered a succession of costly natural disasters including 
earthquakes, floods and fires, along with the Los Angeles riots. Wilson became 
embroiled in bitter fights with the Legislature, leading to a prolonged budget 
deadlock in 1992 that caused Sacramento's credibility with the voting public to 
plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson could be helped by signs that the economy has hit bottom, if it is 
not yet beginning to revive, DiCamillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If those (economic indicators) start to change, then the incumbents have some 
greater hope," he said. "That's really what you need (as an incumbent). You 
need to improve perceptions about the future." Happy New Political Year

RACIAL RAGE CLAIMS 4 MORE LIVES IN S. AFRICA; VIOLENCE: RADICAL BLACK GROUPS 
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ATTACK. INCIDENT SHOWS CAPE TOWN IS NOT IMMUNE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Welder Roland Palm decided it was time to take his 22-year-old daughter, 
Rolanda, who had graduated recently from college, out for "a good 
father-daughter chat" Thursday night at his favorite local pub. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the surrounding neighborhood, the Heidelberg bar was filled with mostly 
white students and young professionals. To avoid the crush, the Palms sat 
drinking near the door when five black youths walked in shortly before midnight 
and, without a word, fired a rifle grenade and began shooting from the hip with 
assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the first burst, I pulled her down," said Palm, sobbing as he spoke. "But 
she just ducked her head. That's when she got hit." 
</P>
<P>
 When the shooting and screaming stopped, three women, including Rolanda Palm, 
lay dead inside the bar and a fourth victim lay on the street outside. Five 
others were wounded. Dozens of bullets had scarred the wooden walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the death toll would have been far worse, but the grenade, which 
the killers had packed with nails, failed to explode. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that grenade had gone off, it would have killed us all," survivor Steve 
Hamilton said. He said he "hit the deck" when the shooting began, and watched 
in horror as the three women "jerked like puppets" when they were hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The South African Press Assn. reported that men claiming to represent two 
radical black organizations that violently oppose sharing power with whites -- 
the Azanian People's Liberation Army and the Azanian National Liberation Army 
-- telephoned separately to claim responsibility for the massacre. Neither 
claim could be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest deadly racial attack did confirm that Cape Town, a seaside 
resort that prides itself as a bastion of liberal politics and traditions in a 
country of conservatives, is not immune to the explosive rage that still 
seethes in South Africa's black township slums as the nation moves away from 
apartheid and toward majority rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, this gracious city of colonial buildings, leafy public gardens, busy 
outdoor cafes and a spectacular setting on the slopes of cloud-shrouded Table 
Mountain has seen the country's worst black-on-white violence of the last year. 
And many fear more is yet to come in the run-up to democratic elections in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clearly political extremists trying to unsettle the people, to terrorize 
them, to derail everything we have all worked for," said Ian Iversen, a city 
councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, for example, Cape Town suffered the country's bloodiest and most 
destructive race riots after the assassination of popular black leader Chris 
Hani. Rampaging mobs attacked white passersby, shopkeepers and even white 
officials of Nelson Mandela's African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, several black gunmen armed with assault rifles and hand grenades 
killed 11 people and wounded more than 50 others in an attack on a multiracial 
congregation at a suburban church. A 17-year-old youth is due to stand trial 
for the massacre in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in August, a chanting crowd of black youths in Guguletu township stabbed 
and beat to death Amy Biehl, a 26-year-old Fulbright scholar from Newport 
Beach, Calif., simply because she was white. Her death capped a campaign in 
which white visitors to the township were openly stoned and attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the others, the Heidelberg bar massacre drew quick denunciations from 
political and religious leaders around the country. Police offered a $60,000 
reward for help in arresting the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just very deeply shocked, really shattered, because somehow one was 
thinking that this kind of carnage was a thing of the past," Anglican 
Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu told reporters here. 
</P>
<P>
 Black-on-white violence remains the exception in South Africa. More than 4,000 
people died in political violence in 1993, and the vast majority were blacks 
killed by other blacks in mostly anonymous attacks on hostels, homes and trains 
inside the townships. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, the ANC noted that most of the deaths go unreported and 
unremarked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is regrettable that there seems to be a different response when such 
attacks occur in townships as compared with those that occur where whites are 
victims," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most township violence, the ANC added, is "virtually dismissed as routine." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Cape Town has seen itself as distinct from the rest of the country. It 
is the only city to consistently send members of the anti-apartheid white 
Democratic Party to Parliament, and the only one to boast of its racial 
tolerance in a country ruled by white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city's liberal credentials have always been part illusion. Most whites 
were sheltered from the brutal reality of apartheid. Back behind Table 
Mountain, hidden from the crowded beaches and fancy French restaurants, are 
some of the country's most impoverished slums -- and blacks with some of the 
most bitter memories of white rule. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the only part of the country where blacks are not in the majority. 
They are outnumbered by people of mixed race, classified as "Colored." To keep 
it that way, the white government ruled during the apartheid years that blacks 
could stay only if they had a job -- and the only way to get a job was to prove 
that both a white and a Colored person had turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a brutal campaign of forced removals -- and fierce resistance. 
Since most blacks were not supposed to be there, few hospitals, schools or 
other basic services were built for the more than half a million people who 
crowded into bleak townships and squatter areas that grew on the city's 
outskirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the desolate warrens of tin-roofed shacks and garbage-strewn lanes 
outside Cape Town are home to some of the country's most militant and 
marginalized black youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pan-Africanist Congress, with its notorious anti-white slogan of "One 
settler, one bullet," considers the Cape townships a key stronghold. Those 
accused of Biehl's murder and the church massacre were members of the PAC or 
its student wing. And the APLA, one of the two groups claiming responsibility 
for the Heidelberg bar attack, is the armed wing of the PAC. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Des Segal, chief police investigator, said those who attacked the church 
and the bar used similar weapons, ammunition and tactics. "There are obvious 
similarities," he said, examining the bullet-riddled bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Less clear is why the gunmen would attack Observatory, a fashionable, 
multiracial suburb that has a history of anti-apartheid activism. Blacks and 
whites mingle easily on streets lined with elegant Victorian homes, trendy 
boutiques and art galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a complete state of shock here," said Stefanie Hefer, 30, a local 
resident. "This suburb is so cool. Everyone thought it was the last place for a 
racial attack." 
</P>
<P>
 Anguished friends and neighbors placed dozens of bouquets of flowers along a 
curb near the Heidelberg bar Friday, and several hundred area residents 
gathered for a brief afternoon memorial service on the wind-swept street. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebrahim Adams, 27, wept quietly after placing a spray of flowers on the curb. 
He had survived the attack but was still in a state of shock, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You come here to have an enjoyment, and you can't even do that anymore," he 
said. "You're bloody scared to go out tonight. You don't know what to expect."

COLUMN ONE; DREAMS DIE ON MEXICO'S 2ND BORDER; THE COUNTRY'S CRACKDOWN ON 
IMMIGRATION HAS THWARTED CENTRAL AMERICANS HOPING TO CROSS THROUGH TO THE U.S. 
THEY SIT IN GUATEMALAN FRONTIER TOWNS, SOME TURNING TO CRIME IN THEIR 
DESPERATION.

<P>
 Like so many of Central America's down and out, Leticia saved money, hitched 
rides and finagled her way from a home in El Salvador, across international 
borders and toward the certain opportunities of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 And like so many, Leticia was stopped, caught by Mexican immigration agents 
and bused back to this squalid and bustling town on Guatemala's northwestern 
edge. Now the 28-year-old mother of two works as a prostitute to make enough 
money to try the journey again. She does not tell relatives awaiting her in Los 
Angeles, or her husband in Canada, the true nature of her current job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine, driven to this, just to be able to go north again," she said, seated 
in front of one of the dozens of brothels that operate round-the-clock here. 
"You do it out of necessity." 
</P>
<P>
 Leticia is among tens of thousands of Salvadorans, Hondurans and Nicaraguans 
who have been stranded on the way north, not along the Rio Grande but further 
south, along Guatemala's Rio Suchiate. Guatemala has long been the trampoline 
for Central Americans -- and others from as far away as China and India -- 
positioning themselves to cross Mexico and enter the United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Mexican authorities crack down on illegal immigration across their 
southern border, thousands of would-be immigrants are being caught and deported 
back to Guatemalan frontier towns like Tecun Uman. 
</P>
<P>
 Guatemalans and others are starting to speak of a new border, where the line 
that divides Guatemala and Mexico now represents what the line between Mexico 
and the United States has for decades -- the gateway for the daring and lucky, 
the ultimate barrier for the frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The border has moved south. It is no longer between Mexico and the United 
States but between Guatemala and Mexico," said Raul Hernandez, who handles 
refugee and related issues for the Roman Catholic Church's Episcopal Conference 
in Guatemala. "For the large majority of people trying to go to the United 
States, the biggest obstacle they now face is here." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially as the North American Free Trade Agreement relaxes barriers and 
transforms this continent into a more unified, single bloc, Mexico's border to 
Central America is expected to become the rear guard in the U.S.-backed fight 
against illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the enhanced role Guatemala may soon have in stopping illegal 
immigration, a team from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service spent 
a month this fall training Guatemalan police and immigration agents. Although 
brief training courses have been offered previously, this was the first 
extensive program. 
</P>
<P>
 Guatemalan towns like Tecun Uman are feeling the brunt of the increased number 
of deportations, which church officials say could be as many as 500 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Tecun Uman is an anarchic spot where life is as hard as it is cheap, where 
abandoned children sleep in the streets and furtive men and women cower in 
flophouses, waiting for contact from a smuggler. 
</P>
<P>
 The desperation of stranded immigrants forces many into crime or other seedy 
forms of survival. It's big business for those who traffic in human contraband. 
But it frightens and worries the longtime residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last decade, the permanent population of Tecun Uman has doubled; it 
more than doubles again if one counts the transient or "floating" population. 
Permanent residents are now outnumbered by floaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Named for a Mayan warrior who was ultimately slain by a Spanish conquistador, 
Tecun Uman had one brothel 15 years ago; today, residents estimate, it has 35, 
plus dozens more striptease bars and 24-hour honky-tonks. There is one church 
and no hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tecun Uman has been converted into a hell, where everything you can imagine 
is permitted," Hernandez said. "There is prostitution, alcoholism, drug 
addiction, money laundering. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of so many rootless people has had a destabilizing effect on Tecun 
Uman, says the city's lone Catholic priest, Father Jesus Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a population that is illegal, undocumented, foreign . . . without a 
sense of community identity," said Rodriguez, a Spaniard who has ministered to 
Tecun Uman and the surrounding villages for about 15 years. "Each day there is 
a loss of community relationship. There is no love for the town or the 
community, no joining together to defend the town's interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez frets that the people of Tecun Uman are sinking in a mire of 
spiritual disintegration. Few people, he says, are willing to take "honest 
work" in factories or farms; they prefer the quick cash from illicit businesses 
spawned by illegal immigration, from the running of cheap boardinghouses to 
thriving coyote (immigrant smuggling) operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Buses spewing noxious black smoke rumble in and out of Tecun Uman constantly, 
snaking through the maze of dusty crowded streets and vying for space with 
hundreds of rickshaw-like taxis that pass by in swarms. The buses bring people 
who will wait for their chance to head north, usually by crossing the narrow, 
shallow stretch of the Rio Suchiate that skirts Tecun Uman. 
</P>
<P>
 Guatemala attracts would-be illegal immigrants for several reasons. First and 
most obvious, its location makes it a natural jumping-off point. Second, most 
Central Americans do not need visas to enter Guatemala, a privilege made 
possible by a new spirit of regional integration. And, according to many who 
make the trip, Guatemalan authorities are willing to look the other way, or are 
easy to bribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Just outside Tecun Uman, customers are ferried across the Rio Suchiate on 
inner tubes strapped together under planks. The makeshift rafts glide back and 
forth in open view of anyone who cares to notice but are never impeded by 
authorities, according to the men who pilot them. A one-way trip costs about 35 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in Mexico, Central Americans are often ripped off and abandoned by their 
illegal guides or coyotes. They are preyed upon by roving bands of robbers and 
rapists, shaken down by corrupt Mexican cops and ultimately caught by 
immigration agents and thrown out. The undocumented are routinely deported to 
the nearest country -- Guatemala -- regardless of their nationality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deportees come in busloads, and we do not have the means to handle them," 
said Eduardo Paz, a Guatemalan immigration official in Tecun Uman. "Most of 
them don't have any money, so they stay in Tecun. Most of the Guatemalans find 
their way home, but the Salvadorans, the Hondurans, the Nicaraguans, they all 
stay here." 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews with more than a dozen people in Tecun Uman reflected a widely held 
perception that Mexican immigration authorities have made it even tougher for 
Central Americans to cross in just the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, 1993 was a record year for deportations from Mexico, according to the 
Mexican government. About 130,000 people, the vast majority Central Americans, 
were ejected, Secretary of Government Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco Garrido said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez denied that Mexico is cracking down specifically on Central 
Americans. But there has been a shift in government attitudes, with officials 
becoming increasingly vocal in recent months on the need to stop illegal 
entries into Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 While attacking U.S. policies and practices that keep undocumented Mexicans 
out of the United States, the Mexican government has in turn become less 
tolerant of illegal Central Americans, most of whom are regarded as economic 
refugees now that the wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador have formally ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexico will attempt to stop whatever migratory flow that is on the margin of 
the law," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we are complying with the law; before it was something that was enforced" 
with discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Guatemalans believe the Mexicans are acting at the behest of the U.S. 
government, while U.S. immigration officials say the Mexican government is 
acting to protect its own economic interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Central Americans who cross into Mexico or the United States represent 
competition with Mexican workers for jobs. The economic development that NAFTA 
is supposed to spawn in Mexico makes it increasingly attractive to Central 
Americans, these officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexico has more to lose now," said an official familiar with immigration 
issues. "Twenty years ago, Central Americans did not perceive El Norte as 
Mexico. The U.S. was El Norte. With NAFTA, that could change. El Norte becomes 
closer." 
</P>
<P>
 While denying it would ever serve as an arm of U.S. immigration policy, the 
Mexican government for several years quietly accepted hundreds of thousands of 
dollars from the U.S. government to assist in deportation of illegal 
immigrants, most of whom were Central Americans. Gonzalez said he ended use of 
the special U.S. fund when he took office a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, regardless of who pays for it, deportees like Leticia, the prostitute, 
end up back here in Tecun Uman. 
</P>
<P>
 Lounging in wooden slat chairs on the front porch of the "The Babes" brothel, 
Leticia and two Honduran women dressed in pink spandex insisted their work was 
temporary, something to do for quick cash before moving on. Leticia figures she 
can earn $35 to $70 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried on the border when they caught me," said Leticia, who has tried to 
reach California several times in the last year. "I support my kids, my mother, 
I'm all alone. We all know why we're here, the necessity, that's the way it is. 
But I still have my intentions . . . to go to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road, outside the Lord of Three Falls Catholic Church on Tecun Uman's 
central plaza, three young children slept in a doorway. They left Honduras four 
months ago but were stopped in Mexico and deported. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to get back to Honduras," said one of the children, a 13-year-old 
boy with matted hair and raspy voice, "but I don't have the bus fare." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Guillen, a Salvadoran who says he lived in the United States for 15 
years before being caught during a trip in Mexico and deported, was hanging out 
in the plaza, about to give up on what he said was an increasingly difficult 
trip north. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of stuff happens," Guillen said in street-toughened English. "People 
get robbed, people get killed. Two women with me (in Mexico), they were taken 
and got raped (by a gang of bandits)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican authorities, he said, "detain you for three days and they don't 
give you no food, not even tortillas and frijoles , man, they don't give you 
nothing. The hardest part is getting from here to Mexico City. To get into the 
U.S. then is easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Guillen, who said he has a wife and U.S.-born daughter in Santa Monica, said 
he has been trying to return to California since April. "But I'm getting tired, 
spending money and spending money," he said. "I'll try again after Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 The sympathy that many longtime Guatemalan residents may have had for the 
deportees has been eroded by what they see as the deterioration of their town 
and lives. The few remaining families worry about their children's safety. 
Merchants complain of having to sweep their sidewalks constantly to clear trash 
left by the homeless immigrants and of having to fend off beggars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The townspeople are very resentful," said resident Maria Lilian Perez, 33, a 
mother of six. "Every time something bad happens, they say, 'Oh, it's the 
Hondurans,' or 'It's the Salvadorans.' Many of the people who stay here don't 
want to work honorably. They make it bad for everybody. The trip used to be 
better for them, but lately many have been failing, and they stay here, waiting 
in limbo." 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Bamaca, who runs a boardinghouse, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They talk about having no money, then they sell their belongings, mortgage 
their house and pay a coyote $2,000, $3,000 to take them north," he said, 
shaking his head. "Then they get cheated, ripped off and end up back here -- 
with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me sad, but it also makes me angry. The women prostitute themselves, 
the men steal. . . . They talk about better futures, but what kind of future is 
this?" 
</P>

ISRAELI OFFICIAL MAPS NEXT STEPS ON LONG ROAD TO PEACE; STRATEGY: BEILIN, 'BIG 
PICTURE' MAN FOR RABIN, IS OUTSPOKEN AND CONTROVERSIAL IN LOOKING TO FUTURE. 
</P>

<P>
 Even as negotiators for Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization 
struggle with tough, detailed planning for the first stage of Palestinian 
self-government, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin is moving fast 
down the road toward resolution of the whole Middle East conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilin sees a peace for Israel with all its neighbors, an emerging 
confederation of Palestine and Jordan, a new regional economy and much more. He 
draws verbal lines on the map to highlight Israel's true security concerns, not 
to say its future borders. He tells Jewish settlers in the West Bank that they 
may be able to remain only under Arab sovereignty. He envisions a functional 
division within Jerusalem. And he warns there will not be peace with Syria, or 
the Arab world, while Israel remains in the Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Want to know where (Prime Minister) Yitzhak Rabin is taking Israel?" goes one 
political commentary common here. "Just listen to Yossi Beilin." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilin, in fact, is one of the long-term strategists of Rabin's government, 
the man who even before the Labor Party won the June, 1992, parliamentary 
elections set up the "Oslo connection" for talking with the PLO and who oversaw 
the negotiations on Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'morning after,' the next step, is what I try to focus on," Beilin said 
in an interview in his Foreign Ministry office. "The next step in the 
negotiations for a comprehensive peace, the next step in a new Middle East and 
the next step, too, in a new agenda for Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 This long-range focus has him looking at the impasse in peace negotiations 
with Syria, at negotiations with the Palestinians over the long-term future of 
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and on realistic prospects for regional 
cooperation. These involve fundamental questions such as Israel's retreat to 
borders approaching those it had before the 1967 Middle East War and 
establishment of a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is also looking at such practical matters as linking electrical grids, 
instituting cross-border environmental protection, sharing water resources and 
building networks of railroads, highways and pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
 For most Israelis, Beilin has been maddeningly frank on what it will take to 
achieve peace and almost utopian on where it will lead. "The first reaction to 
what Beilin says is usually anger, but in the end the government is pulled 
along after him," said Yoel Marcus, a leading political commentator. "This is 
not because he is a prophet but because the line he has advocated reveals 
itself as the only operational path that a government that wants to be 
different from the (opposition) Likud can take. . . . Believe him -- in the 
end, all will form along his line." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilin himself is characteristically frank about what he calls his role. "My 
job is to speak out and to tell you the truth without any coating," he told 
members of Israel's kibbutz movement recently. "I participate in making 
decisions, but I also define (the issues). There is nothing more gravely wrong, 
as I see it, than keeping quiet at this time. A public figure who remains 
silent now betrays his post." 
</P>
<P>
 But in his outspokenness and role as a political strategist, Beilin is one of 
the most controversial figures in the Rabin government. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabinet colleagues have called on the prime minister to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
 "One statement by Beilin, not even 10 ministers can fix," Economics Minister 
Shimon Shetreet declared after Beilin commented on the future of West Bank 
settlements and Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 A vice president of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the 
hard-edged, pro-Israel lobbying group in Washington, called him "a little slime 
ball" last summer after Beilin told visiting congressmen that Israel would 
withdraw extensively from the West Bank in a peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rabin once called him "Peres' poodle," alluding to Beilin's long 
association -- now almost 17 years -- with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, a 
Rabin rival within the Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Beilin stays, and political insiders believe it is precisely because Rabin 
knows that Beilin can plot the path the government must follow if it is to 
achieve peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilin's critics "can scream to the stars," said Marcus, long a Rabin 
confidant, but "the logic of Yossi Beilin will be victorious. Not because he 
created this logic, but rather because he breaks into the intellectual vacuum 
of the government. . . . Beilin knows exactly what the next steps of the 
government must be but is not sure whether Rabin is clear about where he is 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, Marcus added, is that "one cannot buy half of Beilin's strategy" 
for the Palestinian issue. "Either you adopt it fully, that is go all the way, 
or you do not go anywhere and start to lose control over the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Now 45, Beilin was a journalist with the Labor Party newspaper Davar when 
Peres, then the party leader, asked him to become party spokesman a few months 
after Labor's loss to Likud in 1977; with a doctorate in political science from 
Tel Aviv University, Beilin moved into policy planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past decade, he has served as Cabinet secretary, director general of 
the Foreign Ministry, deputy finance minister and deputy foreign minister -- 
always as Peres' idea and point man, one of "The Blazers," the bright young men 
Peres gathered around him who wore uniform dark blue jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 When Labor was campaigning against Likud in the 1992 elections, Beilin was 
already planning for "the morning after," in this case the first 100 days of 
the new government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everyone needs to be involved in the campaign," he said. "That would not 
be a proper division of labor. Some should be thinking about what to do if we 
win . . . because it's important to retain the momentum of the victory. We lose 
time dealing with issues bit by bit." 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp attacks on him do hurt, Beilin acknowledged. But after urging direct 
negotiations with the PLO and establishment of a Palestinian state in "Gaza 
first" and taking other avant-garde stands in the late 1980s, he is accustomed 
to criticism. If there were no controversy about the positions he took, Beilin 
said, he would worry more. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I am saying something and there is a consensus, I worry that it's wrong," 
he said. "There is nothing worse than 'group think,' and if I am not 
challenging the conventional, then I am not doing my job. . . . In the work I 
do, if I am not forced to defend my positions, I worry that I may, in fact, be 
wrong. I am used to a staff that objects, not a group of yes men. If I can 
convince my colleagues, the ideas are really tested." 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulties in concluding an agreement with the PLO on implementing the 
accord on self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho 
has allowed many "we-told-you-so" Israelis to blame Beilin -- but he is already 
moving on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that there will be a compromise over the size of Jericho, say, and on 
the other issues," he said. "If I am negotiating, I strive to do my best. If I 
am not, then I focus elsewhere. . . . Once the Declaration of Principles was 
signed and the agreement reached on mutual recognition, there was a need to 
look ahead two or three more steps." 
</P>
<P>
 This is what has plunged Beilin into so much controversy recently, because it 
means thinking about what comes after the five years of Palestinian autonomy 
and how not only to safeguard Israel's interests but to ensure a stable 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even with present difficulties, I believe we can have a comprehensive peace 
in a matter of months, not years, in the Middle East," Beilin said. "There has 
never been a better opportunity to make peace in this part of the world, but it 
might be a relatively short opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 He envisions a Palestinian-Jordanian confederation following the transitional, 
five-year period in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Borders would have to be 
negotiated, arrangements worked out for the security of Jewish communities that 
remain after Israel's withdrawal from the territories and the status of 
Jerusalem resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 All are difficult issues, and Beilin resorts to rare blandness in an interview 
to avoid generating further criticism. "Not useful right now, not useful," he 
replied when pressed on the future of Jerusalem, declared by Israel to be the 
"united and eternal capital of the Jewish people" but claimed in part by 
Palestinians as their capital too. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a timetable, Beilin noted, for settling these issues because 
Israel is committed to discussing them all in two years and reaching an 
agreement within five. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations with Syria will be "very tough indeed," he said, adding that 
there had been little progress in the past year and a half and much would 
depend on the ability of the Clinton Administration to coax Syrian President 
Hafez Assad into real discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on Assad's commitment to peace, Israel is prepared to negotiate its 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights in terms of geographical extent, time, 
security measures, international observers and demilitarization. "The solution 
is not very obscure if there is a will on both sides," Beilin said. "I know we 
have the will on our side, and I hope there is a similar will on theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations with Jordan and Lebanon can proceed whenever those countries 
wish, Beilin said, but they appear to be waiting to see how Israel and the 
Palestinians proceed on the autonomy plan and whether Syria pursues real peace 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 After peace treaties will come another "morning after," Beilin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is peace and nothing changes in people's lives, then there will be 
even greater frustrations," he said. "Expectations are very high. People refer 
to peace as a kind of redemption from all the problems in the world. We have to 
think, separately and together, about how to meet these expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Beilin's leadership, Israel has begun pushing other countries in the 
multilateral Mideast negotiations to look at practical cooperation, such as 
building a common infrastructure, to lay the foundation in time for regional 
economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite all the talk, I don't think we will see an common market in the 
Middle East very soon, if ever," he said. "Our economies, not just Arab and 
Israeli but among the Arabs, are far too diverse for that. There are other ways 
to cooperate, and we will need to look at them realistically." 
</P>
<P>
 The "morning after" peace will also mean a new agenda for Israel, he said. 
"Security is now No. 1 for us, and so much so there is no real No. 2," he said. 
"If we are so blessed that we have no enemies -- that's the goal of peace -- 
what is No. 1? 
</P>
<P>
 "In a target-oriented society like Israel, it is important that we have an 
agenda, something to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilin has items of his own for that agenda: relations between Israel and the 
rapidly assimilating Jews of the Diaspora, particularly in North America; a 
restructuring of outmoded Israeli institutions such as the Jewish Agency, the 
trade union federation and the Labor Party itself; a role for Israel in 
international human rights and peacekeeping organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israel, freed of its necessary obsession with security, will evolve rapidly 
into a liberal social democracy, much like the Nordic countries," Beilin 
predicted. "We need to start planning for that 'morning after' even while we 
deal with today's, tomorrow's and even yesterday's problems."

VALLEY CRIME FELL LAST YEAR, BUT RESIDENTS' FEARS SOARED; POLICE: DESPITE 
IMPROVED STATISTICS, MANY FEEL VIOLENCE HAS BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD AND LESS 
PREDICTABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The victims' list is like a snapshot of the San Fernando Valley -- the place 
they lived, the place they were killed. They were white, black, Asian and 
Latino. One was a 2-year-old child, another a 74-year-old man. One homeless 
woman was killed on the Pacoima street where she lived. A man was shot to death 
in Chatsworth because someone wanted his gold-colored Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
 While they dreamed of Hollywood stardom, athletic careers or quiet motherhood, 
they died doing the banal: pumping gas, walking home from school, withdrawing 
money from a bank ATM. Two men were shot and killed as they slept inside their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics from early December, the latest available, showed there had been 
128 homicides in the San Fernando Valley in 1993, down 7% from 137 at the same 
point in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Robberies, burglaries and aggravated assaults also had decreased in the last 
year and, of the five crimes classified as major by the Los Angeles Police 
Department, only the number of rapes has gone up. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Valley's crime rate of about 80 major crimes per 1,000 people is 
significantly lower than the city's overall rate of 98.5 incidents and also 
below rates in Seattle and San Diego, which generally are regarded as safe 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the San Fernando Valley, once America's prototypal safe suburb, where 
explosive growth during the past 30 years can be traced to those seeking refuge 
from crime somewhere else, fears about random and rampant violence were fueled 
this past year by a series of cold-blooded and arbitrary killings, where the 
innocent were gunned down in places previously immune from such violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the improving statistics, to many Valley residents crime seems more 
and more widespread, less predictable and closer to home. Perhaps most 
tellingly, it has taken a place as a conversation icebreaker alongside small 
talk about sports and the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "At every party I've been to lately, the only thing people talked about was 
crime," said Mark Little, a writer who lives in Encino. "It's just eating away 
at everyone. It's strange because it also seems to bring people together, gives 
strangers something to say to each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The police officers paid to patrol the Valley's 250 square miles and 1.3 
million people are well aware that they are battling public perception about 
crime almost as much as they are fighting crime itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception is based on the reported incidents of violent crime, not just 
here, but all over the country," said Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy, who took 
over command of the LAPD's five Valley divisions two months ago. "Really, the 
only thing we can do is continue to work closely with the people in the 
community and let them know that with community involvement we can reduce crime 
even more." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, it was a spate of killings in places regarded as safe havens, or 
areas believed to be safe because they were public and open, that ignited the 
public's fears -- and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the year's first murders was the shooting death of a 12-year-old girl 
outside the Boys & Girls Club in Pacoima. For 27 years, the Glenoaks Boulevard 
club had been an island for children, a world apart from the violence that 
often holds the area's residents prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, guns, alcohol and drugs were verboten . Warring gangs coexisted 
peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Jan. 9, 1993, at about 12:30 a.m., as Tiffany Dozier was waiting 
outside the club for her mother to give her a ride home, a burst of gunfire 
erupted from a passing car and a bullet struck the girl in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're living under a blanket of fear," Leroy Chase, executive director of the 
club, said after Tiffany's death. "If you can't have activities at a Boys & 
Girls Club, where can you have them?" 
</P>
<P>
 A seventh-grader at Maclay Middle School, Tiffany had been among 170 young 
people attending a dance organized by parents to keep their children off the 
street and out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged shooters had apparently been aiming at rival gang members in a 
crowd, although police said Tiffany was not a gang member. Later, two 
teen-agers and a 20-year-old were charged in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Just five days after Tiffany died, on the opposite end of the Valley in Porter 
Ranch -- a wealthy community so safe authorities were unable to remember the 
last time a person was murdered there -- another young person was gunned down. 
</P>
<P>
 This time the victim was 19-year-old John Michael Holden, an assistant manager 
at Ameci's In & Out Pizza & Pasta shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he had once sucked down eight-ounce bottles of Robitussin cough syrup 
when he couldn't find a better high, and served a stint in jail for a series of 
residential burglaries, Holden had turned his life around. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a job, was taking art classes at a local junior college, and counseled 
young people who had also had brushes with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The night he was working, Holden was only there as a favor for a co-worker who 
couldn't make his shift. When the two men came into the restaurant, Holden, 
apparently sensing trouble, stepped in front of his counter crew to help them. 
</P>
<P>
 The men ordered a pizza, then one drew a gun and demanded money. Holden 
complied, quickly handing over $450 from the register. The man shot anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old were arrested on suspicion 
of killing Holden. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the year, homicides in the Valley dropped about 6.5%, robberies fell 5%, 
and burglaries declined 8.5% from the year before. The rates of auto theft, 
thefts from vehicles and traffic accidents also were down. But reported rapes 
shot up 20% -- from 388 in 1992 to 467 in 1993 -- an increase police officials 
were unable to explain, aside from mentioning several repeat rapists who 
inflated the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 During a rape and robbery spree in late May, for example, four men terrorized 
several neighborhood parks in the West Valley, leading police to issue warnings 
to residents not to use parks near their homes at night. Before they were 
captured during a police stakeout, the men -- whom authorities described as 
transients -- had allegedly raped two teen-age girls and one woman and robbed 
at least 10 people in parks in West Hills and Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not rape but murder, those seemingly arbitrary slayings where there 
appeared to be a clear distinction between good and evil, on which the media 
and public became fixated -- sometimes blurring the line between perception and 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-nine-year-old Sherri Janine Foreman was happy, pregnant with her first 
child -- a woman family and friends said had everything to live for. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 10, after Foreman had withdrawn $40 from a bank automated teller 
machine in Sherman Oaks and was walking back to her car, a man attempted to rob 
her, but ended up plunging a knife into her abdomen. Both Foreman and her 
13-week-old fetus were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder sent a shock wave across the Valley, as yet another safe place and 
time -- daylight hours in an area busy with street traffic, under constant 
surveillance by a security camera -- had been violated. 
</P>
<P>
 Although ATM robberies are relatively rare, with just 499 statewide in 1992, 
according to a California Bankers Assn. survey, some swore never to use the 
machines again, day or night. After Foreman's murder, the public perception was 
that using ATMs was akin to walking into an ambush. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to those fears, two ATMs were placed inside Valley police stations 
and the Sherman Oaks bank tore down a wall behind which police believe 
Foreman's killer, 43-year-old Robert Glen Jones, had hid for more than an hour 
before the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, another innocent victim in a public place, Laurie Myles, was 
sitting in her car in Northridge with her 9-year-old son, waiting to pick up 
her teen-age daughter from a Bible study class. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men pulled up and demanded her purse. The 34-year-old woman gave it up, 
but one of the men shot her through the heart anyway as her son watched 
helplessly from the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite rewards totaling more than $32,500, Myles' killers have not been 
caught. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of outrage," Detective Tom Broad said after her slaying. "You 
have a woman who is an innocent victim who was in the process of conducting her 
daily business. . . . I think the public has the right to be outraged." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was one of the most shocking, Myles' slaying was just one of more 
than a dozen high-profile crimes that sparked widespread outrage and fear 
during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 No part of the San Fernando Valley went untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Chatsworth, during one of dozens of Valley carjackings, Naghi Ghoraishy, 
74, was fatally shot after he pulled into a gas station to fill his 1989 
Mercedes-Benz. Police were so desperate to find his killer that they re-enacted 
the March crime on videotape a la "Unsolved Mysteries" and persuaded local 
television stations to play the tape during newscasts. Still, there have been 
no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the same February day, Micheal Shean Ensley, 17, was shot and killed by a 
fellow student during a midmorning snack break at Reseda High School, and Rocio 
Delgado, 16, was killed by a stray bullet as she walked home from Cleveland 
High School in Northridge. After the shooting, Micheal's 15-year-old alleged 
killer was arrested at a nearby bakery where he was eating a doughnut and 
drinking a lemon drink. Three teen-agers have been charged with Rocio's 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eight-year-old Nicole Parker was sodomized and apparently choked to death in 
November before her body was stuffed into a suitcase. She had been kidnaped 
outside her father's Woodland Hills apartment while playing with a ball. Her 
nude body was found inside a suitcase, in the closet of a neighbor, Hooman 
Ashkan Panah, 22, who has been charged with the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * A serial molester preying on schoolchildren and young adults across the San 
Fernando Valley is believed responsible for raping a 9-year-old girl and 
fondling and grabbing at 31 others in a spree that dates back to last February. 
Despite the largest LAPD manhunt in recent memory, the man eluded police and 
led many frightened parents to escort their children to and from school. 
</P>
<P>
 * In April, a former employee of MCA opened fire on the company's world 
headquarters, a Universal City high-rise known as the "black tower." The most 
seriously wounded were two secretaries on the 14th floor. Five others 
throughout the building were cut by flying glass. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Easter Sunday, a 2-year-old boy was killed in cross-fire when a gunfight 
broke out after an Easter egg hunt and picnic in Encino's Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 There also were extreme responses to some of the violence, not all of them 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, over the objections of the ACLU, the city won a sweeping court 
order barring gang members from 112 square blocks between Van Nuys and 
Sepulveda boulevards. The injunction prohibited otherwise legal activities, 
such as possessing portable telephones, in the area around Blythe Street. Three 
gang members had been convicted for violating the injunction by year's end, but 
some residents continue to fear leaving their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, members of the South Winnetka Neighborhood Watch cleared a section 
of railroad tracks of cardboard box homes, sleeping bags, clothes and food that 
belonged to two homeless men who had adopted the area. Residents feared that 
the men might accidentally ignite the overgrown brush in the area and start a 
fire that would burn down their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors also planted bougainvillea, which they called "green barbed 
wire," hoping the prickly vine would discourage other transients from sleeping 
along the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 When the two men -- Jose Aleman Menjivar, 47, and Ismael Rodriguez, 42 -- 
returned, they became upset that their few belongings were gone. In search of 
their possessions, including a wallet and passport, the men entered the 
adjacent home of Raymond John Komoorian. 
</P>
<P>
 Komoorian surprised the two in his bedroom, who he said were stuffing a 
pillowcase with his clothing and jewelry, and then, he later told police, they 
came toward him. He opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Menjivar was killed. Rodriguez was hit twice in the chest and, though neither 
transient was armed, Rodriguez later was charged with murder as well as grand 
theft and residential burglary. Komoorian, a 47-year-old air conditioning 
mechanic, was not arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussing the violent encounter later, then-Deputy Police Chief Mark Kroeker 
summed up the mood of many crime-weary Valley residents: "I sympathize with 
Neighborhood Watch people. I don't see it as a vigilante mentality. They're 
trying to (protect) a quality of life. People aren't going to take it. They're 
at this stage in the city."

EURO DISNEY MAY HAVE TO CLOSE, EISNER WARNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The beleaguered Euro Disney theme park outside Paris is doing so poorly it 
might have to close unless it gets help soon from its lenders, the chairman of 
Walt Disney Co. said in an interview published Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael D. Eisner, in his strongest remarks yet about the troubled 
20-month-old park, was quoted in the French weekly magazine Le Point as saying 
"everything is possible" concerning Euro Disney's future, "including closure," 
if efforts to improve the park's financial health fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner's comments surfaced a few days after he termed Euro Disney's 
performance "dreadful." Disney owns 49% of Euro Disney SCA, the park's 
operating company; the rest is held by private investors. Disney also manages 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The remarks echo the pessimism that Eisner sounded in a recent interview with 
the Orange County edition of The Times about the proposed $3-billion Disneyland 
Resort in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner indicated that the future is uncertain for the resort, which would 
include a theme park called Westcot and about 5,600 hotel rooms, all in the 
shadow of the existing Disneyland park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even know if there's going to be Westcot. We're at a real 
crossroads," Eisner said. "It's whether we can afford the investment in the 
project. We had a very big investment in Europe, and it's difficult to deal 
with. This is an equally big investment. I don't know whether a private company 
can ever spend this kind of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Humbled by Euro Disney and facing costs on a similar scale if it expands in 
Anaheim, Disney has proposed a more modest project: an American history theme 
park outside Washington that could be built at a fraction of the cost of 
Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 Even that development could be hampered by the revenue drain of the French 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Debt-laden Euro Disney lost $920 million for its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 
which led to a $78-million fourth-quarter loss for Burbank-based Disney in the 
same fiscal year -- the entertainment giant's first quarterly loss in nine 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those problems, analysts say it is unlikely that Disney will close the 
park, 20 miles east of the French capital. The company's reputation -- not to 
mention hundreds of millions of its dollars -- is at stake in the venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner's comments, and earlier tough talk about the park's future by Disney 
executives, are seen by many observers as an effort to pressure Euro Disney's 
bank lenders and other creditors to quickly reach agreement on a plan to ease 
the park's debt burden. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more of a negotiating tactic than anything else," one trader in Paris 
told the Reuters news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by Le Point if he had threatened Euro Disney's lenders with the 
withdrawal of Disney's support, Eisner replied: "The word threaten doesn't seem 
fair to me." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always said we would support Euro Disney until March 31," Eisner 
said. "If a fair accord is found from now until then between the Walt Disney 
Co. and all the banks and investors, then Euro Disney continues. That would be 
a happy end in the tradition of the Disney universe." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Eisner's refusal to rule out the park's closure triggered an 8% slide 
in Euro Disney's stock price Friday, to 30.4 francs ($5.14) a share in Paris 
trading. Shares in Walt Disney Co. fell $1.125, to $42.625, in New York Stock 
Exchange composite trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's corporate offices were closed Friday, and Eisner and other officials 
could not be reached for comment on the French article. 
</P>
<P>
 Since opening in April, 1992, Euro Disney has been plagued by Europe's 
recession, a strong French franc relative to other European currencies (which 
makes it more expensive for foreign tourists), bad weather and interest costs 
on the park's debt, which is more than $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of souvenirs and meals at the park are also below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Disney has noted that by drawing 17 million guests in its first 1 1/2 
years of business, Euro Disney has become the leading vacation resort on the 
European continent. For that reason, and because Disney has so much pride 
wrapped up in the venture, Disney watchers do not expect Euro Disney to close. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney does have some other options. Besides a financial reorganization of the 
park, the company might close some of Euro Disney's six hotels to cut costs, or 
might keep the park open only eight months a year to avoid the cold rainy 
season, analysts have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney itself has been coy about discussing which options it prefers, or how 
much more it is willing to invest to prop up the park. 
</P>
<P>
 In the company's fiscal 1993 annual report, released earlier this week, Eisner 
did say that despite Euro Disney's "dreadful" showing, Disney is "committed to 
exploring all reasonable alternatives toward helping to put Euro Disney on a 
sound financial footing." 
</P>
<P>
 But he also warned that "we will take no action to endanger the health of 
Disney itself."

TRADE WINDS ARE BLOWING ACROSS AMERICAS; FORGET NAFTA. THE SOUTH'S 'SAFTA' HAS 
ALREADY BEEN FREEING UP MARKETS FOR TWO YEARS. AND SMALLER BLOCS ARE FORMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What once seemed like ivory tower daydreaming is now reality in the making: 
Huge trade blocs are forming up and down the Americas to let goods and services 
pass freely across international borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is there a NAFTA -- the North American Free Trade Agreement, 
stretching from the Yukon to the Yucatan. There is also a SAFTA -- a South 
American free-trade area that extends from Amazonia to Patagonia. 
</P>
<P>
 The South American bloc, officially known as Mercosur, unites Brazil, 
Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay in a promising market of 200 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 As of today, Mercosur gives a discount of 82% on customs duties in trade among 
the partners. It will be 100% duty-free by Jan. 1, 1995. That will make 
Mercosur a full-fledged free-trade zone many years before North America is. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Mercosur boast that their 1991 pact has already boosted intra-bloc 
trade by billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mercosur is 2 years old," said Hector Gambarotta, the Argentine Foreign 
Ministry's secretary for international economic relations. "If this had 
happened in countries of the north, we would be talking about the most 
spectacular success of the century." 
</P>
<P>
 Mercosur countries have agreed to set common tariffs for many goods imported 
from other countries, something NAFTA has not done. That means the South 
American bloc will soon be a "customs union," a major step toward status as a 
complete common market like the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are irreversible processes that you can't stop," said Jorge Lucangeli, 
an adviser to the Argentine Foreign Ministry. "This is a project that advances 
almost by itself." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of South America, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia 
are forming an Andean free-trade area. In Central America and the Caribbean, 
smaller trade blocs are emerging. And many countries are entering bilateral or 
trilateral pacts outside the main blocs. 
</P>
<P>
 The integration movement is happening so fast, in fact, that free-trade 
agreements between countries are beginning to overlap in a crazy-quilt fashion 
that some economists fear may be difficult to sort out and manage. 
</P>
<P>
 As free trade spreads through Latin America, almost all the countries involved 
are interested in joining the colossal NAFTA to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, former President George Bush's idea of one hemispheric free-trade area, 
from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, is gathering force. 
</P>
<P>
 Although President Clinton has not promoted the idea by the name Bush gave it 
in 1990 -- Enterprise for the Americas Initiative -- he has brought it closer 
to realization by pushing for congressional passage of NAFTA and by promising 
free-trade negotiations with other Latin American countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside NAFTA, by far the biggest free-trade group in the Americas is 
Mercosur. 
</P>
<P>
 Its four countries produce goods and services worth $630 billion a year, far 
greater than Mexico's gross domestic product and about half the Latin American 
total. 
</P>
<P>
 Incremental reductions in customs duties among members have shown dramatic 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, trade within the bloc has more than doubled, surpassing $9 billion 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Although progress has been rapid, it has not always been easy. In recent 
negotiations, the four countries have deadlocked on the issue of setting a 
common level of tariffs on select products imported from non-member countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials agreed on duties ranging from nothing to 20% for more than 
four-fifths of products. But Brazil balked on lowering tariffs that protect 
computer equipment makers and capital goods such as factory machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina wants no duties on such products so it can modernize its industries 
with high-tech equipment from Europe, the United States and Asia. But Brazil 
fears that competition from such imports will undermine its own computer and 
capital goods industries. 
</P>
<P>
 A summit of Mercosur presidents, scheduled for December, was delayed until 
Jan. 17, partly because of that unresolved issue. 
</P>
<P>
 At that Uruguay meeting, the presidents are expected to announce that common 
external tariffs for those products must be worked out over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the presidents will reaffirm their determination to end all internal 
duties at the end of 1994 as scheduled, Brazilian and Argentine officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentine industrialists have urged the swift elimination of tariffs. They say 
that Brazilian subsidies and "unfair" trade practices put Argentine producers 
at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Gaibisso of the Argentine Industrial Union said his main concern is that 
Brazil's galloping inflation and economic confusion camouflage the real cost of 
industrial production. This makes it possible for Brazilians to make exports 
more competitive by unfairly manipulating prices, Gaibisso said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic point here is that Brazil is in a chaotic economic situation," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentine industrialists want to postpone final free-trade measures for two 
years "so that Brazil can put itself in order," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina and Brazil, like most Latin American countries, have protected their 
industries with high trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim was to foster industrial growth through "import substitution" -- 
replacing imports with as many locally produced products as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy seemed to work from the 1950s through the 1970s. But then protected 
industries began falling behind in efficiency and technology. 
</P>
<P>
 As their stagnation became evident, economies began dropping commercial 
barriers, opening up to foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, most Latin economies operate on the theory that they will do best by 
importing goods they cannot produce competitively. To pay for imports, they 
seek to increase exports they can produce with a competitive advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Other changes also have helped. The transition from military dictatorships to 
democracy in many Latin American countries in the 1980s gave the region a 
common denominator of civilian government, easing trade negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the countries also have recovered from staggering foreign debt crises, 
coupled with high inflation and recession; those factors discouraged free-trade 
efforts in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 But problems still abound. Brazilian inflation, more than 2,200% in 1993, is a 
worrisome element of instability for Mercosur. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina's overvalued peso, which the government has frozen in a one-to-one 
exchange rate with the U.S. dollar, also causes trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Progress in free trade between Brazil and Argentina is expected to require at 
least some coordination of sensitive national policies that influence fair 
competition: monetary controls; exchange rates; taxes, agricultural and 
industrial incentives, and labor regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite difficulties, even critics admit that the South American free-trade 
agreement is starting to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the end of the road," said Marcos Azambuja, Brazil's ambassador to 
Argentina. "It's our first gas station." Emerging Blocs 
</P>
<P>
 Although residents of the United States, Mexico and Canada have been fixated 
on prospects for their nations' new trade pact -- the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA) -- several Latin American countries have leaped ahead in 
efforts to boost regional cooperation. Here's a look at their emerging economic 
blocs: 
</P>
<P>
 MERCOSUR 
</P>
<P>
 1. BRAZIL 
</P>
<P>
 Pop: 157.2 million 
</P>
<P>

 Pop.: 33.5 million 
</P>
<P>
 GNP: $186 billion

</P>
<P>
 Pop.: 4.6 million 
</P>
<P>
 GNP: $8.7 billion

VA HOSPITALS INCLUDED IN NUCLEAR EXPERIMENTS PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Department of Veterans Affairs said Friday that it is opening an 
investigation to learn whether patients at VA hospitals in the 1940s and 1950s 
were used improperly in nuclear medicine research projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe, announced by Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown, follows 
decisions by the Defense Department and the Energy Department to review files 
to learn the scope of such experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan to leave no stone unturned in our review of this research," Brown 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the investigation will examine the circumstances surrounding 
nuclear medicine research at VA facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we find that veterans were subjected to improper research, that would be 
morally and ethically unacceptable to me," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to look at all the facts, and if we determine that VA was 
engaged in any inappropriate research, we will disclose that finding to the 
American people, notify veterans involved and take appropriate action," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the VA is asking veterans' service organizations to make their 
members aware of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans who are concerned should call the VA toll free at 1-800-827-1000, 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has summoned officials from the departments of Defense, 
Veterans Affairs and Energy and from the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration to meet with Clinton Administration officials Monday in order to 
coordinate a review of files on the experiments.

JAPAN'S TRADITIONAL NEW YEAR'S FEAST TAKES ON WESTERN FLAVOR; CULTURE: THE 15 
ITEMS OF THE OSECHI MEAL ARE RICH IN MEANING. THE MEAT BALLS AREN'T. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atsuko Iizuka spent the last two days of December doing what generations of 
Japanese women before her have done to ring in the New Year: simmering, 
boiling, baking and broiling 15 separate items for an elaborate feast called 
osechi . 
</P>
<P>
 A highlight of the three-day holiday season that begins today, the New Year's 
feast is a dazzling array of colors and tastes with meaning imbued in each of 
the main elements. ( Osechi can also be dazzlingly expensive. Iizuka spent $180 
for the ingredients alone, but the spread sells for as much as $900 if 
custom-ordered from the finest Japanese restaurants.) 
</P>
<P>
 Fish eggs symbolize the hope for many offspring. The yellow of the sweet 
potato and chestnuts is meant to ward off bad spirits. The seasoned dried fish, 
written with Chinese ideograms that mean 50,000 grains of rice, is a wish for 
bountiful harvests. 
</P>
<P>
 The rolled egg symbolizes the wisdom of the ages handed down in Japanese 
scrolls. The black beans signify the desire for the health to work hard enough 
to soil the face with sweat and dirt, explained Iizuka's husband, Masao. 
</P>
<P>
 The red and white of the fish cakes are congratulatory, and the rounded rice 
cakes symbolize the dawning sun of the new year. Traditionally, five flavors, 
colors and cooking styles are used; the food is seasoned to keep for a week to 
give women their only vacation from the kitchen all year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Japanese don't actually think about these meanings," Iizuka said. "And 
young people nowadays don't even like to eat osechi much." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, international influences are permeating even the deepest traditions 
here and changing the tastes of modern Japanese. The Tokyu Department Store, 
for instance, offered sets of Chinese and Western osechi alongside the 
traditional Japanese spreads. Never mind that roast beef, smoked salmon and 
meat balls utterly lack any cultural meaning. To scores of Tokyoites, the 
international offerings taste better -- and were sold out by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Older folks go for the Japanese sets, but the younger people buy the Chinese 
and Western," Tokyu's osechi vendor said. 
</P>
<P>
 New Year's arrangements of pine, bamboo and plum -- all good luck symbols -- 
also showed Western influences: Snoopy and Woodstock sat perched in some of 
them and graced the children's kites that traditionally portray scenes of sumo 
wrestlers or geisha. 
</P>
<P>
 If modern tastes are eroding tradition, so is the recession. Tokyu's sales of 
the osechi sets, which average about $250, fell to about 700 this year, 
compared to 1,200 during the era of the economic "bubble" four years ago, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daijin Yoshikawa, who has sold New Year's wreathlike arrangements for the last 
15 years, said his sales have been down for the past three years. During the 
boom days, he could sell some arrangements for $135; now he's lucky to move the 
ones priced at $35. 
</P>
<P>
 To counteract the recession, the famous Ameyoko fish market in Tokyo's Ueno 
district dropped prices by 30% and managed to pull in the same number of 
customers as last year -- about 740,000 on Wednesday, with projections of 
900,000 for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most crowded place in Tokyo on New Year's Day will be Meiji Shrine, 
where an estimated 3.5 million people are expected to visit over the three-day 
period, police predict. Nationally, 87.5 million people are expected to visit 
shrines -- the highest number in history. Police say that clear weather and a 
heightened desire to appeal to the gods for relief from the recession and 
rice-crop failure are reasons for the surge. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides feasting and praying, many Japanese will spend time reading postcards, 
called nengajo , from friends, relatives and business associates delivered on 
New Year's Day. This year, the cards will be embossed with a pooch: 1994, 
according to the cycle of zodiac symbols based on the Chinese lunar calendar, 
is the Year of the Dog. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog year, which comes around every 12 years, has not been particularly 
fortuitous for Japan. The dubious hits list includes the annexation of Korea in 
1910, grabbing Manchukuo through a puppet emperor in 1934, the cutoff of trade 
ties with China in 1958 and the Lockheed bribery trials in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 This year also projects gloom: The Japanese economy is still going to the 
dogs, and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will face a dogfight getting his 
reform bills passed.

'ALIVE!' SURVIVOR WINS $2.5 MILLION IN LOTTERY

<P>
 Jose Luis Inciarte has twice beaten the odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one years ago, he was one of 16 rugby players and fans who survived a 
plane crash and 70 days of freezing weather in the high Andes.Late Thursday, he 
told a radio station he had won a $2.5-million New Year's lottery prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Inciarte's wife, Soledad, said Friday that 11 family members who pitched in 
1,500 pesos ($450) for lottery tickets will share the jackpot. Each will 
receive the equivalent of about $160,000 after taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "For now, we're just planning to make a nice trip abroad with our kids," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inciarte, 45, who is now a dairy farmer, was one of 45 rugby players and fans 
flying home from Chile in October, 1972, aboard a Uruguayan air force plane 
that crashed in the Andes. Only 16 survived, staying alive by eating the flesh 
of those who had died. 
</P>
<P>
 The story was told in the 1993 film "Alive!" based on the earlier book by 
Piers Paul Read.

CASTRO KIN ARE REUNITED IN ATLANTA

<TEXT>
<P>
 A granddaughter of Fidel Castro was reunited Friday with her mother, who 
defected from Cuba last week and then pleaded that the girl be allowed to join 
her in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to meet a lot of new people.I have to learn the language. And I 
want to study a lot, something I could not do in Cuba," Alina-Maria 
Salgado-Fernandez, 16, said during a news conference Friday night in this west 
Georgia city. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl and her mother, Alina Fernandez Revuelta, then toasted the new year 
with champagne. Joining them was Elena Amos, the wealthy Cuban-American who 
helped Fernandez sneak out of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Alina-Maria left Havana on Friday morning for Miami. There she was whisked 
aboard a jet to Atlanta, where she met her mother in private. Then the two came 
to Columbus, where Fernandez has been staying with Amos. 
</P>
<P>
 Reminded by reporters that there are many Cuban Americans who want to be 
reunited with Cuban relatives, Alina-Maria said through an interpreter: "My 
mother and I feel for everyone who doesn't have their mother. I can't explain 
why they let me go and don't let others go." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, an outspoken critic of her father's regime, said she now can speak 
more freely about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "From now on I will say what I want to say," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cuba, Fernandez was under virtual house arrest and under constant 
surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to her mother's clandestine departure from Cuba, when she was 
disguised in a wig and used a fake passport, the daughter left the country with 
the approval of the government.

PROSECUTION BARRED IN U.N. OFFICIAL'S DEATH; CHILE: MILITARY INTELLIGENCE 
AGENTS WILL NOT BE TRIED IN MURDER OF SPANIARD. FAMILY'S LAWYER PLANS AN 
APPEAL, BUT COURT IS UNLIKELY TO ACT FURTHER.

<P>
 A Supreme Court justice has ruled against the prosecution of military 
intelligence agents for the abduction and murder of Carmen Soria, a U.N. 
official and Spanish citizen killed here in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thursday ruling confirmed an earlier decision by a military court to close 
the Soria case, a notorious emblem of unredressed human rights violations under 
Chile's former dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who headed that military government, turned over power 
to an elected civilian government in 1990 but remains commander of the army. 
</P>
<P>
 Many laws decreed during the dictatorship remain in force, and hundreds of 
cases of human rights violations under the regime have yet to be resolved by 
the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Without naming agents responsible for Soria's death, a military judge ruled in 
early December that they were eligible for amnesty under a 1978 decree. Soria's 
family appealed that decision to the civilian Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 After Madrid called its ambassador in Santiago back to Spain for 
consultations, the Supreme Court appointed one of its members, Marcos 
Libedinsky, to investigate the military court's decision. Libedinsky announced 
Thursday that he had found no legal grounds for reopening the Soria case. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the family and civilian government officials have argued that the amnesty 
law does not apply in cases that affect the country's relations with foreign 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 EFE, the Spanish news agency, said that a spokesman for Spain's Foreign 
Ministry expressed "deep disappointment" over Libedinsky's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso Insunza, a Chilean lawyer representing Soria's family, said he will 
appeal the decision to the full Supreme Court. Insunza said the amnesty is 
unconstitutional in this case because Chile has ratified an international 
treaty that requires it to prosecute cases of homicide against international 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative Supreme Court has rarely ruled against military officers in 
human rights cases. It was the Supreme Court that transferred the Soria case 
from civilian to military jurisdiction in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "Libedinsky virtually brings an end to a case that caused recent diplomatic 
tension with the Spanish government," said a front-page report Friday in the 
Santiago newspaper El Mercurio. 
</P>
<P>
 Libedinsky's decision, published Friday, cites evidence that Soria was 
detained by a group of military men working for the Directorate of National 
Intelligence, the political police agency formed after Chile's 1973 military 
coup. The agency, known as DINA, has been charged with hunting down and killing 
hundreds of leftists. 
</P>
<P>
 Soria was taken to the Santiago home of Michael Townley, an American 
expatriate who worked for DINA. 
</P>
<P>
 There, "he was subjected to interrogation, physical force and, finally, was 
killed," Libedinsky wrote in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Soria's body, with a broken neck, was found later in an irrigation canal. 
</P>
<P>
 Soria, who fled Francisco Franco's regime in Spain, had both Spanish and 
Chilean citizenship. In 1976 he headed the editorial department of the Latin 
American Demographic Center, part of the Santiago-based U.N. Economic 
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilean newspapers have reported that DINA was investigating him for helping 
Communists escape secretly from Chile to avoid persecution by the military 
regime.

FUEL SHORTAGES CUT OFF FOOD AID TO NORTH HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fuel shortages caused by a U.N. embargo have halted food aid shipments to 
northern Haiti, threatening hundreds of thousands of the nation's poorest and 
youngest people with severe hunger or even starvation. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti's biggest food aid provider, U.S.-based CARE, had already dropped 
115,000 people, mainly children, from a hot-food program because of previous 
delivery problems.On Thursday, it distributed its last grain and cooking oil 
supplies for another program that targeted 300,000 more people. 
</P>
<P>
 Warehouses in this central port are nearly empty. Supplies are dwindling for 
hundreds of CARE feeding centers now providing the main daily meal for 185,000 
people, relief officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The week-old halt in shipments to CARE has political overtones. The fuel 
embargo was imposed on Haiti to pressure its repressive army to yield power to 
elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ousted in a 1991 coup. 
</P>
<P>
 But the army's rightist allies hope the suffering will instead weaken the 
international community's resolve, while Aristide and some U.N. nations argue 
that only tougher sanctions, albeit painful, will force the army from power.

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE GROUP SUES LEADERS OVER DEBT

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Christian Science Church members has sued church leaders, accusing 
them of mismanaging funds and leaving the church $83 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The group alleges that church directors and trustees attempted to conceal the 
church's deteriorating financial condition after spending about $450 million on 
a cable television channel and other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The group sued 14 current and former church directors and trustees of the 
Christian Science Publishing Society. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Suffolk 
Superior Court, seeks to enforce church bylaws calling for financial oversight 
of the sect's top officers. The church itself was not named as a defendant.

AIR CANADA AGREES TO STOP SERVING PATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Air Canada has agreed to stop serving French pate to its first-class 
passengers, and an animal rights group claimed victory for the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Pate de foie gras is produced by force-feeding ducks and geese to expand their 
livers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many birds die as a result, said the Washington-based animal rights group 
People for Ethical Treatment of Animals, which has urged major airlines to stop 
serving pate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Montreal-based airline has agreed to ban the delicacy on its flights 
starting in May, PETA spokesman Dan Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Canada officials confirmed the decision on Friday but did not provide 
details on why it was made.

FIGHTING ON 2 FRONTS: INTIFADA AND SEXISM; PALESTINIANS: LONGTIME ACTIVIST 
TAKES ON BOTH YASSER ARAFAT AND WIFE-BEATERS IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At 42, Nama Haloul wears her scars like medals won in the Palestinians' long 
fight for freedom -- and as inspirations for the tough political struggle she 
sees ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Her right hand is plastic, installed by Israeli doctors when they amputated 
the mangled remains of her own after an attempt to bomb an Israeli army camp 
here more than 21 years ago. She extended it without a flinch to greet a recent 
visitor at her refugee home. 
</P>
<P>
 Her left eye is glass -- hers was destroyed, she explained, by dozens of 
brutal interrogations during the 14 years she spent as a convicted terrorist in 
Israeli prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Her face is creased, her hair gone gray -- the premature aging of a committed 
women's rights activist who is fighting as hard now against her own leaders as 
she did against the Israeli army that has occupied her native Gaza Strip for 
more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Without even a trace of bitterness, Haloul -- whose entire family now consists 
of just two adopted orphans of the Palestinian intifada (uprising) -- reflected 
on the past, present and future of the struggle for a now-emerging Palestinian 
entity. 
</P>
<P>
 She has come to symbolize that fight for many Palestinians in the 
Israeli-occupied lands since her release two months ago from an Israeli 
military jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe I made a great sacrifice," Haloul said. "I must do much more. 
At this time, the need is greater than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
 But Haloul is more than a symbol. She is emblematic of the character of 
potential leaders who are emerging around a shared hope to help shape the 
autonomous Palestinian government to which Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 
and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat agreed, beginning 
in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 As negotiators for Arafat and Rabin continue to haggle over implementation of 
that agreement -- months after their historic signing ceremony in Washington in 
September -- Haloul has established herself as an outspoken, articulate critic 
of a process of nation-creation that many Palestinians fear is flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of that criticism is Arafat himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am most worried now that our new government will be a dictatorship and not 
a democracy," Haloul said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I feel now is the impression that Mr. Arafat is giving to many people 
here that he will be a dictator," she said. "I respect him. I am not against 
him. But he is taking so many decisions by himself, without listening to or 
considering the ideas of many who have fought so hard for what we are about to 
achieve." 
</P>
<P>
 Haloul uses herself as a prime example. She petitioned Arafat after her 
release from prison to head a government department for women's affairs in 
Gaza. Haloul established the Union of Women Workers there more than a decade 
ago and has since used it as a powerful vehicle to defend and promote women's 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat refused. Instead, he gave the post to the wife of a prominent member of 
his Fatah faction in Gaza, a doctor with little experience in the Palestinian 
women's movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am against the way Mr. Arafat works, but I am not against him," Haloul 
repeated, adding she has appealed the appointment and remains hopeful that 
Arafat will reconsider. "These are difficult times. We must be careful with our 
words and our deeds. We don't want to go the way of Islamic dictatorship, 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 Haloul said her campaign for a democratic Palestine is a struggle on two 
fronts. Of the two, she said that it is the fundamentalist Islamic groups, 
which enjoy wide popular support in Gaza, that pose the tougher challenge for 
the women of Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a big difference between Arafat and Hamas," Haloul said, referring 
to the Palestinians' largest Islamic movement. "Arafat at least thinks it will 
be a democratic country. Maybe he is starting wrongly. But the people will 
demand democracy. And he promised democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hamas is different," she said. "What has Hamas done for the Palestinian 
woman? When they needed her, they used her. They put her on the street to throw 
bombs and stones. When they get independence, they will order her to sit at 
home. If we go the way of these bad habits and closed minds, we will go back a 
hundred years. Is this what we fought for all these many years?" 
</P>
<P>
 For Haloul, Palestinian women have suffered most through the decades of 
Israeli occupation and the six-year Palestinian intifada.  
</P>
<P>
 "The women suffered much more than the men. Why, you ask?" Haloul said. "It 
was like this: When a clash would take place with the Israelis, the men sent 
the women to throw stones and fight. It wasn't because the men did not want to 
fight but because the soldiers would hesitate to shoot the women. Instead, they 
beat them. 
</P>
<P>
 "And in our society, the woman is stronger against these beatings than the 
man," she added. "She is used to it. It is now in our culture that women are 
beaten by their husbands. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of women have complained 
to our women's union about this. And these are the wives of well-educated men." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Eyad Sarraj, a psychiatrist in Gaza, confirmed that wife-beating has 
become widespread in the occupied territories. It is, he said, a direct result 
of occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 "A victim identifies with his attacker," he asserted. "Here, most of the men 
have been beaten by soldiers, and that's why many of them go home and beat 
their wives or their children." 
</P>
<P>
 Haloul said she has had not personally experienced spousal abuse; she never 
married. She never had time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason I am not married is because of my work," she said. "I have 
given all my life to my work, and to my adopted children." 
</P>
<P>
 With such sacrifices behind her and challenges ahead, Haloul still smiled 
broadly and nodded when asked whether she remains optimistic about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, for sure," she said. "Of course I want a democratic state, and I want a 
democratic voice. I want all my people back here from exile. I want all other 
prisoners released. And I want full rights for women. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if the Israelis leave here as promised," she said, "this will be the 
beginning for us. We will be rid of the occupation that has left us with so 
many of these problems. And we will be left with the strength it has given us 
-- especially our women, who fought, who raised her children, who lost her 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are waiting a long time for this. We are patient. And we have learned how 
to fight."

NEW YEAR, OLD MISERIES FOR SARAJEVO; BALKANS: FIVE ARE KILLED AND 38 ARE 
WOUNDED AS SERBIAN SHELLS RAIN ON THE BOSNIAN CAPITAL ONCE AGAIN.

<P>
 For Sarajevans, 1993 ended pretty much as it began: Serbian gunners shelled 
the city, killing at least five people, hospital officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
 During a brief respite from the worst shelling in two months, people had 
crowded the meager markets for last-minute New Year's Eve shopping, looking for 
a little something special they could afford. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, mortars rained from the sky. The toll, in addition to the five dead: 
38 wounded and most of what little holiday spirit had been mustered destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 The strain was obvious for these people, for whom the new year means more of 
the death, blood and tears they have endured for nearly 21 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Lejla Buturovic, 22, recalled how she and some friends managed to put together 
a New Year's Eve party last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bought some liquor on the black market," she said. "Girls prepared 
hamburgers and sandwiches out of canned beef we got as humanitarian aid. We had 
a tape recorder running on a car battery. 
</P>
<P>
 "That New Year's party was a kind of resistance to this horrible war. This 
year, I don't have any strength to resist anymore. I am not going to celebrate 
anything -- not even that I am still alive in this hell." 
</P>
<P>
 In a bleak year-end report, a U.N. aid official blamed Bosnian political and 
military leaders for leaving people cold and hungry this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no reason for any person to be hungry or cold in Bosnia this 
winter," said Tony Land, a representative of the Office of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees. "It is completely political and military." 
</P>
<P>
 Land said there is enough food and fuel for millions of needy people in Bosnia 
but the problem is getting it to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs, Croats and the Muslim-led government have made no effort to 
separate humanitarian concerns from military ones during the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief officials estimate that more than half of Bosnia-Herzegovina's prewar 
population of 4.3 million is dependent on international aid. The three sides 
have said they would not impede aid convoys. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.N. officials said that a Russian convoy of aid for the besieged eastern 
Bosnian town of Gorazde turned back because Serbs would not give clearance to 
French U.N. soldiers escorting it.

BOMBERS USED FALSE IDS, AUTHORITIES SAY

<P>
 Two men charged in a wave of fatal bombings used false birth certificates to 
obtain Vermont driver's licenses later used in buying dynamite, authorities 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael T. Stevens, 53, and Earl Figley, 56, were jailed on charges of 
transporting across state lines explosives that were used to kill. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the pair sent bombs to relatives of Brenda Lazore Chevere, 
Stevens' girlfriend. Stevens sought vengeance against the family because he 
thought they were to blame for troubles in his relationship with Chevere, law 
enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the six bombs went off across New York state within two hours Tuesday, 
killing Chevere's mother, stepfather and sister. Two men who were not relatives 
also died in the blasts, and Chevere's uncle was injured by an explosion.

THE MOTHER OF ALL LISTS OF MISUSED WORDS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Words and phrases such as politically correct , mother of all . . . and 
dysfunctional ought to be banished, says a list compiled annually by Lake 
Superior State University. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1976, the school has accepted nominations for its unofficial "List of 
Words Banished From the Queen's English for Misuse, Overuse, or General 
Uselessness." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 29 words and phrases recommended for banishment are dysfunctional 
(whose family isn't?) and mother of all . . . (translated from Arabic and worn 
out). 
</P>
<P>
 Politically correct came under fire, on the widespread belief that politicians 
are so often wrong.

TIMES SQUARE HAS ITS MOMENT, OTHERS REVEL IN SOBRIETY THEME

<TEXT>
<P>
 A quarter of a million revelers gathered in New York's Times Square for a 
traditional welcome to the New Year, while a round of alcohol-free festivities 
called First Night set a theme of sobriety in New York and other cities across 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Square celebrants watching a 200-pound, bulb-covered ball drop into 
1994 -- an event in its 86th year -- were showered with 3,000 pounds of 
confetti from the tops of surrounding buildings as 22 colored spotlights 
streaked across the square. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great, I love it! It's better than Paris!" exclaimed 14-year-old Bo Ehlers, 
of Copenhagen, Denmark, who accompanied his mother to the New York celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Night observances were supplemented by the annual offers of free 
rides home for imbibers. 
</P>
<P>
 First Night should "encourage people to celebrate collectively together 
without drugs and alcohol," said Doris Stephens, executive director of the 
celebration in Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, "it allows people to enjoy entertainment and performing arts that they 
might otherwise not take the time to see," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Providence's First Night opened early, at 1 p.m. Friday. People were invited 
to nearly 200 entertainment events with more than 800 performers in 32 
locations across the city, Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of First Night in New York City sold admission for events ranging 
from a petting zoo to ballroom dancing in the huge central room of Grand 
Central Terminal, which is usually filled with harried commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 Families were invited to a similar event in Oklahoma City, called Opening 
Night and featuring storytellers, clowns, magicians and musicians performing 
everything from jazz to country. 
</P>
<P>
 Bus rides for revelers in Portland, Ore., were free after 6 p.m. Speed's 
Towing offered free tows throughout the holiday season, along with a promise to 
see that the driver also gets home safely.

NATION IN BRIEF; MONTANA; AVALANCHE KILLS 4 SNOWMOBILERS

 A group of snowmobilers was caught in an avalanche on a mountain ridge near 
Kalispell, Mont., and at least four were killed, authorities said.Two others 
were rescued with minor injuries, and another person, a child, was missing. 
Rescuers using floodlights fired by portable generators worked into the night 
trying to find the missing boy. A spokeswoman for the Flathead County sheriff's 
department said the avalanche occurred on Peter's Ridge, about 6,000 feet up in 
the Swan Range some 15 miles east of Kalispell. It is a popular snowmobile 
riding area and had up to a foot of new snow over the previous 24 hours.

GUNFIRE KILLED 72 OFFICERS IN '93, DATA SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seventy-two police officers were killed by gunfire in 1993, more than half of 
all those who have died in the line of duty, the National Assn. of Chiefs of 
Police reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings, based on preliminary figures for the year, add to 2,278 shooting 
deaths of law enforcement officers recorded by the association since it began 
maintaining records on line-of-duty deaths in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 The association said it expects the 1993 fatality list of 139 law enforcement 
officers, including the 72 killed by firearms, to grow as final reports are 
received from the nation's 21,000 law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regretfully, we can expect that, when all this year's tragedies are 
tabulated, the total deaths for 1993 will exceed the 1992 figure and surpass 
the recent mark set in 1991," said Dennis R. Martin, the police association's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Final figures for 1992 showed 160 line-of-duty deaths, including 70 from 
gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, there were 143 such deaths, and 75 officers were felled by gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 While police work has become increasingly dangerous in recent years, the 
record for line-of-duty and gunshot deaths was set in 1974 when there were 206 
deaths, including 95 firearms fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, in 1960, a total of 95 police officers died in the line of duty, 
including 29 from gunshots.

STREISAND SINGS FOR 13,105 IN LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sellout crowd waited impatiently for an hour, then roared its approval as 
Barbra Streisand opened her first paid concert in 22 years with "Everything's 
as If We Never Said Goodbye." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little nervous.Forgive me," she told the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Year's Eve show was delayed nearly an hour, mainly because the crowd 
of 13,105 ticket holders had to pass through airport-style metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand last performed in a paid concert in 1971, at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand noted that it had been 30 years since she was an opening act for 
Liberace a few blocks away at the Riviera Hotel. The audience applauded as a 
photo of a younger Streisand and the late pianist were flashed on screens 
around the MGM Grand Garden.

PHOTOS' RELEASE LEADS POLICE TO SUSPECT IN MOLESTATION; CRIME: TWO HOURS AFTER 
BROADCAST OF YOUNG VICTIM'S PICTURE, TIPS GUIDE AUTHORITIES TO ROWLAND HEIGHTS 
MAN. GIRL IS BELIEVED TO BE SAFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just two hours after TV stations broadcast photos of an unknown child 
molestation victim Friday afternoon, a flurry of phone tips guided police to a 
suspect in Rowland Heights. The victim is believed to be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual case began Thursday when Whittier police received an envelope of 
snapshots that showed a girl, apparently between the ages of 4 and 6, being 
sexually molested by a man. The photos were found by a resident of a Whittier 
motel who was going through the motel's trash bin looking for cigarette 
coupons. 
</P>
<P>
 Police sought permission to release a photo of the girl to help the 
investigation. But at first a Los Angeles County Juvenile Court judge refused, 
out of concern for the child's privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 After police exhausted all available leads, Judge Marcus O. Tucker decided 
Friday to allow release of a photograph of the girl, cropped to reveal only her 
face. Police also released cropped photos of the room where the molestation 
took place, in hopes that distinctive items there, including a collection of 
alligator-themed pictures and knickknacks, might help in identifying the 
location. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the dozen photos found showed the face of the perpetrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcast of the photos on TV news at 4 p.m. brought a deluge of calls, police 
said. Within 20 minutes they received the first of three phone calls 
identifying the girl and her home, said Whittier Police Lt. Steve Milakovich. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, described as a man who rents a room to the girl and her mother, 
was detained about 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, Paul Loe, 46, had been arrested earlier in December and charged 
with sex crimes against a child, but was released Dec. 28 pending trial, a 
sheriff's spokesman said. If the photos are found to depict a different crime, 
the spokesman said, Loe will be rearrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Milakovich said broadcast of the photograph was crucial to finding the 
suspect. "It was extremely important to reveal the evidence," he said. "The 
community responded quite well." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies took over the investigation Friday night because the crime 
allegedly occurred in unincorporated Rowland Heights, in southeastern Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Friday evening, police had not talked to the girl, but said she 
apparently was safe and in the custody of her mother, although they were not at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, the release of a photograph in a similar case led to the arrest 
of two suspects. Photographs found on a street in Koreatown showed a 
3-year-old-girl apparently being molested by a man and a woman. Within days of 
the release of photos showing the faces of the two suspects, they were 
apprehended. They are now awaiting trial in San Bernardino County.

PARADE FANS BRAVE OVERNIGHT CHILL FOR CHOICEST SPOTS; PASADENA: TOTING SLEEPING 
BAGS AND BARBECUE GRILLS, HARDY REVELERS STAKE OUT THEIR TURF ALONG COLORADO 
BOULEVARD. 
</P>

<P>
 Like swallows returning to Capistrano, the early birds flocked to Pasadena's 
Colorado Boulevard on Friday for their annual rite: staking out the finest 
curbside viewing spots for today's 105th annual Tournament of Roses Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd began forming along the parade route by 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got my sweat suit in the bag, my hot chocolate in the thermos and my 
propane heater here on the curb," said 21-year-old JJ Lewandowski as she 
stretched out in a patio chaise lounge and pulled the top of her sleeping bag 
around her neck. "I'm ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewandowski, a clothing sales clerk from Simi Valley, arrived shortly after 
noon with a friend, Tom Iavello, 26, to stake out space at the northeast corner 
of Colorado Boulevard and Hudson Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't planning on getting much sleep before today's parade. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, as passersby stuck in slow-moving boulevard traffic honked their 
horns and other early arrivals set up folding chairs and barbecue grills around 
her, the parade seemed almost like an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people-watching is the best part," Lewandowski said. "This is my third 
year here in a row, so I knew what to bring. People who come out here and spend 
the night are friendly. It's just plain fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, Leticia Cabezas and Erin Jackson, both 22, relaxed on a 
blanket as they played a slow-moving game of Monopoly. The two college students 
live in Pasadena and were hoping to reserve space for a dozen others coming 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Panhandler Rich Roy Bizzle, 54, stopped to watch the game's progress. He told 
the pair that he spends every night on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on the street for five years, ever since I got to California," he 
said. When he asked for spare change, he went away empty-handed, however. All 
Cabezas and Jackson had was play money. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the corner, businessman Jeff Oronzo was standing guard at his record 
shop parking lot, shooing away parade parkers. Cars left there would be towed, 
he warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never go to the parade. I deal with this for 48 hours every New Year's, so 
that's enough," said Oronzo, manager of Canterbury Records. 
</P>
<P>
 After the parade comes the football. UCLA will play the University of 
Wisconsin, which is making its first Rose Bowl appearance in 31 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Parade-watchers spending the night on the boulevard were in for a cold time. 
But once again this year, the forecast for parade day was good -- mostly sunny 
skies, light winds, highs in the 70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Flynn, a spokesman for the Tournament of Roses, said it was possible that 
this year's crowd would exceed 1993's 750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly have a lot of people in town from Wisconsin," Flynn said. 
"They've brought as many people as any other team. I think the (parade) crowd 
would be at least as large as the past. The fact that the weather is good could 
mean an even larger crowd. Warm weather brings a lot of people out." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5 1/2-mile parade, themed "Fantastic Adventure," will boast 56 floats, 21 
marching bands and 30 equestrian units. William Shatner of "Star Trek" fame is 
grand marshal for the extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, work on most of the floats had been completed, Flynn said. 
He said about 20 floats that were constructed in Azusa were headed to Pasadena 
in midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining floats, which were built in Pasadena, were to be brought to the 
parade route starting at 6 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the decoration of a few floats that feature particularly delicate 
flowers will be finished this morning. Tournament of Roses Parade Route 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena's annual Tournament of Roses Parade, to be held today, draws hundreds 
of thousands of spectators. The two-hour parade begins at 8:05 a.m., followed 
by the Rose Bowl game at 1:50 p.m. The 5.5-mile parade route begins on South 
Orange Grove Boulevard, turning east on Colorado Boulevard and north on Sierra 
Madre Boulevard. It ends near Victory Park, where post-parade viewing opens at 
1:30 p.m. Grandstand seats can be reserved for the parade, but most viewers 
choose to claim a spot on the sidewalk. Police say those wishing to park within 
easy walking distance should arrive about 6:30 a.m. Spectators should be seated 
in the grandstands by 7 a.m.

REVELRY RECOVERY; LOS ANGELES' DIVERSE CULTURE DISHES UP A RICH MENU OF 
REMEDIES FOR THE COMMON HANGOVER

 It was more than 12 hours before midnight, but Sergio Valdivia was already 
preparing for the inevitable aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdivia, who runs Tacos Delta on Sunset Boulevard, stood at a stainless-steel 
sink soaking 125 pounds of cow intestines in water and vinegar shortly before 
noon Friday. That's the first step, he said, in cooking 35 gallons of menudo 
for all those bleary-eyed customers who begin gathering outside his Silver Lake 
eatery as early as 6 a.m. on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come by and say: 'Hey, you open?' and then they buy big bowls to go," 
Valdivia said. "The hot sauce helps them recover from all that drinking." 
</P>
<P>
 A bit under the weather this morning? 
</P>
<P>
 Do the words on this page seem to be jumping? 
</P>
<P>
 Is a bowl of beefy broth more alluring than today's plethora of bowl games? 
</P>
<P>
 In a city with as rich a cultural panorama as Los Angeles, the menu of 
hangover remedies is as lengthy as the list of ingredients on the side of your 
breakfast carton of Cap'n Crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "A glass of good warm milk, or mix Jello powder with hot water and drink it 
slowly, preferably with a spoon," suggested Gloria Leon, an Ecuadorean 
immigrant, as she sat in a German restaurant, the Lowenbrou Keller, sipping a 
French water, Perrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Hungary," differed waitress Elizabeth Busak, "we have a special soup made 
with sauerkraut and with a hot dog cut in pieces. It's called Hangover Soup." 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant's manager, Renata Eder, cited sour fish as the last resort in 
her homeland, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just take aspirin, sleep, and wish it would go away," Eder said. "Or 
they eat herring." 
</P>
<P>
 Name a culture, discover a cure. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to eat bananas or biscuits or drink a lot of water," said bartender 
Max Lopez at the Bayanihan restaurant, a Filipino nightclub hosting a New 
Year's Eve countdown party featuring disco music and San Miguel beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Name a cure and discover a contrary opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though menudo may be the most popular ethnic remedy in Los Angeles, 
Armenian-born chef Andre Asassian says it's just plain tripe to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ugh, it's too heavy," Asassian said as he puffed a cigarette during a break 
at the Black Sea Russian Restaurant Cabaret on Fairfax Avenue. "Strong tea or 
strong coffee always makes you better." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Black Sea, the New Year's Eve fare included chicken Kiev, lamb chops 
and unlimited vodka. 
</P>
<P>
 "In America, when we get drunk we go looking for a party," said the owner, Yan 
Moyseyev, who left Odessa before the fall of Communism. "In Russia, when you 
drank a little bit, the Party came looking for you." 
</P>
<P>
 At Tom Bergin's, an Irish pub on Fairfax, owner Mike Mandekic suggested that 
those suffering from cottonmouth sit in front of their TV sets and watch Notre 
Dame in the Cotton Bowl this morning -- while sipping a Bloody Mary, an Irish 
coffee or, for those in particular distress, "coffee without the Irish in it." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the Tiki-Ti on Sunset, longtime owner Ray Buhen said that coffee is 
simply a mistake. "No coffee. I think the best thing is fruit juices of any 
kind. Or V-8 juice." 
</P>
<P>
 Some remedies appear to transcend specific cultures -- aspirin, V-8 juice and 
Bloody Marys, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, at the Kibitz Room bar within Canter's Deli, the latter remedy is 
favored even above the fabled "Jewish penicillin." 
</P>
<P>
 "A good Bloody Mary beats chicken soup any day," said bartender Phil Bock. 
"Who eats chicken soup in the morning anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
 Several other bartenders (perhaps not surprisingly) also suggested that most 
un-medical of solutions -- another shot of whatever you were drinking (if you 
recall) on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually if you take another drink it cures you. Really," said Etsuko 
Takemoto, manager of the Koma Cocktail Bar in Little Tokyo. "But a lot of 
people are too sick to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Takemoto pooh-poohed a suggestion by Victor Barone, bartender at the Father's 
Office in Santa Monica, to drop quail eggs in your sake as a precaution against 
hangovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way, no way," she said. "If people have a cold or fever they can make warm 
sake and then beat a regular egg and put it in the sake and drink it slowly. 
But that's for sick people, not for a hangover." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet what is arguably the most practical idea of all came from a part-time 
bartender at the House of Lee in Pacific Palisades, where Zombies, Scorpions 
and Fogcutters grace the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best way to stop a hangover?" asked James Fong. "Just don't drink."

GIVING '93 THE BOOT; NEW YEAR'S EVE CELEBRATIONS GET A BIT OF SOLE FROM A JOLLY 
OLD TRADITION OF HEAVING RUBBER FOOTWEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Some people couldn't wait until the stroke of midnight to ring in the New 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
 They lined up Friday afternoon in Pasadena to throw out the old year. 
</P>
<P>
 More precisely, to boot it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a Wellie-wanging," explained London-born Edmund Fry. "You throw the 
boot and try to hit me." 
</P>
<P>
 Fry, wearing a bowler hat and tails, sat in front of his California Boulevard 
tea and curio shop, eyeing a small pile of green rubber boots 30 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 Wellingtons, he called them. The kind the royals wear in sloppy weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go ahead. Give it a try," he said. "This is a tradition that goes back . . . 
to the Battle of Waterloo, when Wellington took off his boot and threw it at 
the French." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a New Year's tradition in Pasadena with sole. 
</P>
<P>
 Fry, 53, has celebrated the end of the last 15 years with Wellie-wangings. He 
portrays the "lord of the manor" who lets his servants, family members and 
friends heave rubber boots at him. Those who hit him win prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, I'll do it. But I don't want to hit you," said a worried Le Lanza of San 
Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're supposed to hit me," Fry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The footwear was flying fast and furiously across the sidewalk now. Tea shop 
customer Peggy Boultinghouse approached warily. "I'm going to sneak across 
before another one comes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. A whizzing galosh hit her in the right side with a loud thud. "I got 
wangled, huh?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Chinen of Pasadena ordered 7-year-old twins Megan and Erin to duck: "Watch 
it, girls; they're throwing boots!" 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Romero, 16, of Pasadena gave it a try but missed Fry. "I'm not British," 
she explained. "I'm Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all Brits mark the end of the year with flying boots. At the John Bull 
English Pub nearby, pints of ale were being hoisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Ashcroft, 34, of San Gabriel said they call the tradition 
"Wellie-throwing" where he's from -- Watford, England. "They have contests and 
judge you on distance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the tea shop, Cindy Line of South Pasadena skidded a boot over the 
lawn, skimming Fry's left leg. She had come for tea and scones to serve today 
to guests watching the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Husband Barry Line promised to sip tea at the kickoff. But he acknowledged 
that his tastes -- like those at the John Bull Pub -- might give way to ale as 
the game progressed. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, he picked up a boot and let fly, hitting Fry right below the belt. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've just won the grand prize," Fry said with a sputter. 
</P>
<P>
 The year wasn't quite over. But the year's Wellie-wanging was.

S.F. MINT MUSEUM SHUTS ITS DOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The granite and sandstone Old Mint -- a south of Market landmark since 1874 -- 
closed its doors Thursday, a victim of cost-cutting and fears that its 
$4-million display of gold bars was too tempting a target. 
</P>
<P>
 The gold, 10,000 ounces of it, was removed last week from the building, which 
was declared a national landmark in 1961."This was a surprise, even for us," 
said Herby Lam, curator at the mint, which has been a museum since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 An announcement by the U.S. Treasury Department said the gold, the museum's 
main attraction, "imposed a significant security risk." The unprofitable sales 
center at the museum, which attracted about 83,000 visitors a year, was also a 
major factor in the government's decision to close it. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, one of the finest examples of federal classic revival 
architecture in the West, was left intact and virtually alone after the 1906 
earthquake and fire. Photos of the fortress-like mint standing amid the rubble 
are among San Francisco's most famous. 
</P>
<P>
 No decision has been reached on the building's future, a department 
spokeswoman said. She added that its landmark status ensures it will not be 
razed.

GILL NET FISHERMEN SEEK REPRIEVE FROM BAN; ENVIRONMENT: THE LAW APPROVED THREE 
YEARS AGO TAKES EFFECT TODAY, PUTTING SOME OUT OF WORK. A GROUP IS SEEKING THE 
INJUNCTION UNTIL A LAWSUIT IS HEARD IN APRIL. 
</P>

<P>
 Andy Rasmussen will be out of work starting today. 
</P>
<P>
 He has not quit his job, nor has he been fired. Rasmussen, a gill net 
fisherman, lost his job by public vote. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, 55% of Californians voted to ban gill net fishing in a three-mile 
zone along the California coast. The law goes into effect today. 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of environmentalists and sportfishermen backed the proposition 
because they said gill nets, which are anchored to the ocean floor and 
stretched like volleyball nets to trap fish, pose a threat to many marine 
mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rasmussen and about 50 other fishermen who set their nets between 
Oxnard and Santa Barbara have had three years to prepare for their last catch, 
most cannot fathom what they will do when their fishery is closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea what's next," Rasmussen said. "About 80% of my income is 
destroyed. My business is pretty much gone. I'll probably be in an unemployment 
line on the first of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 The gill-netters are staking their hopes on a lawsuit that challenges the 
proposition on constitutional grounds. A San Diego Superior Court judge is 
expected to rule Thursday on the gill-netters' request for an injunction that 
could let them continue fishing, at least until the lawsuit is heard in April. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the judge rules against them they will be devastated, the gill-netters 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem for the gill-netters is that they cannot make an easy transition 
to another method of fishing, said Tony West, president of the California 
Gillnetters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Many, such as Hank Hubble, one of about a dozen gill-netters based in Ventura 
Harbor, built their boats specifically for gill-netting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put $60,000 into that boat, and this would basically make it useless," 
Hubble said. "I couldn't use it, and no one would want to buy it. It would be a 
total loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Although gill-netting will be permitted outside the three-mile limit, most of 
the boats are too small to safely operate that far from shore during harsh 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Gill-netters will find it difficult to switch to another type of gear because 
the state has imposed limits on the number of fishermen who can enter other 
fisheries, West said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what these guys are going to do next year," West said. "They're 
going to go broke." 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the proposition argued during the 1990 campaign that benefits of 
the ban far outweighed the harm that would come to the state's gill net 
fishermen. The proposition's author, Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), 
said during the campaign that gill nets were the equivalent of strip-mining the 
sea or clear-cutting the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Gill nets, she said "are referred to as 'walls of death' because they entangle 
and painfully kill thousands of mammals such as whales, dolphins, sea otters 
and sea lions. More than 100 species of sea life are affected." 
</P>
<P>
 To help the fishermen recover from the loss of their industry, Allen created a 
fund that is to pay gill-netters to switch to less destructive gear. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, only eight of the 136 fishermen who applied for compensation have 
collected money from the fund, and the gill-netters argue that many who deserve 
money will never receive it. That, West said, is because the proposition was 
worded so that compensation for gill-netters would be based on the average 
annual income they earned from 1983 through 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that there are a number of the fishermen who didn't work all 
five of those years," West said. "Nobody is going to come out of this with what 
they are supposed to be getting. . . . If they started fishing in 1988, they 
don't get a dime." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Barnes, the Department of Fish and Game officer responsible for doling out 
compensation, said he has had no choice in how the money was rationed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going by the letter of the law," Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who have received money through the fund, which was established by 
adding a $3.15 stamp required on sportfishing licenses, say the amounts have 
been inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 The average amount given out has been $18,000, Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the earnings of the fishermen vary greatly, West said, the average 
yearly income for a gill-netter is $80,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason compensation is so low, West said, is that Fish and Game is only 
compensating fishermen for fish that they can prove were caught in the 
three-mile coastal zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubble said the fishermen are just one link in a chain of people who will be 
hurt by the loss of business. 
</P>
<P>
 The gill-netters, who fish mainly for halibut, angel shark and other bottom 
fish, sell primarily to local markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the proposition argued at the time that the loss of the 
gill-netters' catch was not substantial -- they said it made up less than 2% of 
the fish sold in California. 
</P>
<P>
 But each catch, Hubble said, goes through a seafood distributor and several 
truckers and markets before it lands on someone's dinner table. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are probably 10 different people who handle my fish once it leaves my 
boat," Hubble said. "All of them are going to be hurt by this." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, consumers will be buying the same types of fish from different 
sources, said Steve Rebuck, vice president of the American Seafood Harvesters 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are just going to have to pay more to get the same fish from other 
countries," Rebuck said. "It really doesn't make much sense."

<P>
 A 9-year-old girl was on her way back to Washington state by airline Friday 
night and her grandfather, a cleric, was in jail on suspicion of kidnaping 
after he was arrested in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitsap County, Wash., authorities said the grandfather, Frederick Aylward, 
took the girl on a church errand Wednesday, then faked an auto accident.The 
pair drove down the coast in rental cars until they checked into a Cerritos 
hotel, where Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested Aylward on Friday 
and took the girl to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Jim Valdez of the Lakewood sheriff's station said the girl was "fine, just 
a little tired and scared and wants to go home." 
</P>
<P>
 Aylward, 51, is pastor of St. Mary's Orthodox Catholic Church, Kitsap County 
Sheriff Pat Jones said. He said family members told him that Aylward had a 
fascination with his granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said Aylward had been charged with kidnaping in 1978 when he disappeared 
for several months with his then-wife's 12-year old daughter, but the charges 
were dropped.

CONTROVERSY SET ASIDE AS DEPUTY IS EULOGIZED; FUNERAL: DARRYN LEROY ROBINS, WHO 
WAS FATALLY SHOT IN AN APPARENT TRAINING ACCIDENT, IS REMEMBERED AS FUN-LOVING 
AND DEDICATED.

<P>
 The controversy surrounding the Christmas Day shooting death of Orange County 
Sheriff's Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins was momentarily forgotten Friday during a 
funeral service that celebrated him as an outstanding lawman, a fun-loving 
prankster and a dedicated husband and father. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,200 law enforcement officials in full dress uniform, friends and 
family members gathered for a wrenching, two-hour eulogy at First Church of God 
in Inglewood to honor the 30-year-old deputy from Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins' widow, Rosemary, sat with their 18-month-old daughter, Melissa, who 
fidgeted with her bonnet and drank from her bottle, too young to understand the 
sadness at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 During one of her husband's favorite Hawaiian folk songs, Rosemary Robins, who 
is from Hawaii, rocked in her seat and cried softly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Goodby partner," Deputy Duane Turner said after he recounted Robins' 
dedication to steering Orange County youths away from drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rest in Peace. A job well done. We will never forget you," said Orange County 
Sheriff Brad Gates, who along with many others praised Robins' accomplishments 
during his eight years with the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, several dozen motorcycles and more than a 100 gleaming patrol cars 
from police agencies across Southern California lined Crenshaw Boulevard. A 
procession of more than 200 vehicles, led by 70 officers on motorcycles, wended 
its way to Green Hills Memorial Park in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins was shot last week by fellow Deputy Brian P. Scanlan as they were 
re-enacting a traffic stop in a deserted parking lot behind an Orange County 
movie theater. Scanlan had a loaded gun during the drill and shot Robins in the 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting was referred to only once during the funeral service by a pastor 
who termed it an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery surrounding the shooting has raised some concerns that race may 
have played a role. Robins was black. Those close to Robins say they think the 
shooting was an accident, but they said they will not be able to recover from 
the deputy's death until they get details about what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe it was a black-white thing at all," said Harold Griffin, 31, 
of Los Angeles, who grew up with Robins. "But I would like to see some answers 
to some questions before we can put this behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said Rosemary Robins has expressed no animosity toward Scanlan, who 
was invited to the funeral but did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
 After the church ceremony, Gates and other Orange County officials again 
declined to provide details on the shooting, which is being investigated by the 
Orange County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we help matters at this point by speculation," said Orange 
County Supervisor William G. Steiner, who attended the service. "The family has 
shown such strength and forgiveness, we should learn a lesson from them." Just 
days before his death, Robins had addressed more than 1,400 schoolchildren 
through the department's outreach program, telling them that he would always be 
available if they ever needed his advice, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a calling that earned him the nickname Deputy Rappin' Robins among 
youths for whom Robins would spice up drug and gang talks with a language and 
music they understood, Turner said.

ANOREXIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Gene Wojciechowski's article about Stacey Asbury (Dec. 18) and the tragedy 
of anorexia went a long way toward helping dispel some of the misunderstanding 
about this disease. Like many ailments, early detection increases the chances 
of successful treatment of anorexia.It's crucial that parents and friends know 
the warning signs, so they can intervene quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who consistently refuses food or denies that they are hungry is 
suspect. Other warning signs include abnormal weight loss, recurring complaints 
of nausea or bloating after eating normal amounts of food and excessive 
exercise. Physical symptoms include the appearance of fine, downy hair on the 
arms. Like Stacey, anorexics will often complain of being fat even though they 
are dangerously thin. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom and Carlie Asbury obviously did everything they could for their daughter. 
However, early detection and team treatment -- including medical care, 
psychotherapy, nutrition counseling and family therapy -- can cure many 
anorexics and spare their families the loss suffered by the Asburys.

BOSTON HARBOR CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Melissa Healy's article "Boston Harbor Cleanup Runs Afoul of Nature" (Dec. 
14) misses several key points in the harbor cleanup story. Today, Boston's 
outdated and undersized treatment plants pour 400 million gallons of 
inadequately treated sewage into the shallow waters of Boston Harbor. This 
obvious violation of the Federal Clean Water Act must end, and with the cleanup 
project under way, it will. 
</P>
<P>
 The new outfall tunnel is part of a multibillion-dollar project to improve 
environmental conditions in Boston Harbor and Massachusetts Bay. A secondary 
treatment plant under construction will be operational in 1996 and discharges 
from combined sewer overflows will be controlled. 
</P>
<P>
 Two major project milestones have already been met: In 1991 sewage sludge 
discharges stopped, and 1989 saw an end to the dumping of scum. The amount of 
pollutants discharged into both Boston Harbor and Massachusetts Bay will be 
significantly reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the effluent discharged from the treatment plant will be far cleaner 
than the current discharge into Boston Harbor, it's no surprise that endangered 
whales will be protected. Even so, the EPA relied on expertise from numerous 
marine scientists, and hundreds of studies by leading experts, before reaching 
that conclusion. The independent scientists also concluded that the outfall 
will not lead to significant changes in nutrient concentrations, the food web 
or the incidence of red tide in Massachusetts Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, through research and technology, endangered species will be 
protected, and water quality standards will be met. The ongoing work in Boston 
Harbor is one of the nation's most important environmental success stories. The 
science and technologies applied to this resource will serve as a model 
worldwide.

DROP IN CRIME STATISTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * For several months now I have observed that your own reports of crimes 
committed in Los Angeles show a consistent decline from 1992's numbers. Despite 
this your reporters persist in telling readers that crime is growing, exploding 
or out of control. Mostly this seemed a curiosity, probably due to indifferent 
background researches. 
</P>
<P>
 However, your article on the latest FBI Crime Index report (Dec. 6) is beyond 
curious. If one persists in reading to the end of the report, he or she might 
learn that there has been a substantial reduction in crime. This good news, is, 
however, apparently so unpalatable to those who make careers out of crime (and 
I'm not talking about "criminals") that they can't face the possibility that 
crime is declining. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI director denies his bureau's own reports and suspects underreporting; 
politicians announce that any decline is not enough; those jockeying for 
positions for future candidacies warn that the decline is temporary. Worst, 
your reporter buries the good news behind this barrage of pessimism and 
nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell people the truth. Both the FBI Index and the Census Bureau survey 
demonstrate a significant decline in crime and victimization, including violent 
crime. If these statistics are viewed over a longer run the public would 
understand that crime is not out of control nor is our present situation that 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, most of the alleged increase in violent crime is the result of 
legislative re-categorization of domestic violence rather than of any true 
increase in violent acts. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime lobby (law enforcement, politicians, prosecutors, correctional 
officers and others who make a pretty good living off of crime) will not easily 
give up the nice sinecure they enjoy. They will fan public hysteria and we will 
end up going bankrupt out of unfounded fear. 
</P>
<P>
 This is nothing new. On Feb. 8, 1775, the Pennsylvania Gazette ran the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
 "Lost is our old simplicity of times, 
</P>
<P>
 The world abounds with laws, and teems with crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 The author was probably running for city council.

TICKET BROKERS DESERVE A LEGAL SLAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many University of Wisconsin football fans who paid dearly to attend today's 
Rose Bowl game will watch it on television because ticket brokers ripped them 
off. They are justifiably angry -- and that should lead to stricter regulation 
of an industry that all too often exploits sports fans and concert-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin hasn't been to the big game in Pasadena for 31 years. That long 
hiatus translated into a huge demand for tickets that was badly underestimated 
by agencies that purchase then resell tickets to entertainment events. Although 
many of them advertised tickets for sale and took money from eager customers, 
they wound up falling short when not enough tickets were available. The 
agencies must refund the money, of course, but nevertheless the result is 
unhappy visitors to a state that is trying mightily to revive tourism. 
California must not let such irresponsible business practices go unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket brokers have so far escaped stronger regulation by the Legislature by 
arguing that they resell luxuries, not necessities like food or shelter. But 
this latest outrage is a black eye for all California businesses, so Sacramento 
must revisit the ticket-brokering issue. 
</P>
<P>
 How about at least making any broker who violates a contract to provide a 
ticket pay both his customer and the state a hefty penalty for every ticket not 
delivered? That won't stop brokers from charging outrageous markups, but it may 
prevent them from making promises they can't keep, thereby smudging the state's 
business reputation.

A TALE OF TWO SORRY TRUCES; IRA VIOLENCE PALES NEXT TO THE AWFULNESS OF 
BOSNIA'S FAILED CEASE-FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1993-94 holiday season is proving to be, among other things, a tale of two 
truces. Neither truce makes for a happy tale, but the difference between them 
is instructive. 
</P>
<P>
 The first truce is the Bosnian one that, running from Dec. 23 to Jan. 15, was 
to include both the Croats' Roman Catholic and the Serbs' Eastern Orthodox 
Christmas. What the interval has become, instead, is a ferocious push for 
territory in the last days before a perhaps fateful round of negotiations 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
 On Christmas Day alone, the Serbs pumped 689 artillery shells into Sarajevo, 
including several that landed near Kosevo Hospital, according to monitors from 
the United Nations. The Sarajevo toll for the Dec. 23-26 period was 11 dead and 
99 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Another U.N. monitor reported 100 Croat shells fired into Muslim eastern 
Mostar on Christmas Day. The religious element in this quasi-religious war has 
never shown an uglier face. 
</P>
<P>
 The second truce was the traditional 72-hour Christmas truce of the Irish 
Republican Army in Northern Ireland. The IRA observed the truce but, 16 minutes 
after its expiration, fired a mortar shell at a police station in a village 
west of Belfast. Further attacks then came in quick succession, including 
Thursday's slaying of a British soldier, hit by a single sniper bullet as he 
patrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent Anglo-Irish Joint Declaration on Northern Ireland had been fueled 
by a hope that the IRA, showing the way to the "men of violence" on the other 
side, might be ready to call a halt to arms. Those who from the start scoffed 
at this hope can only seem vindicated by these holiday season attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the calculated mockery by the IRA means infinitely less than the 
superficially comparable actions in Bosnia, for the Anglo-Irish Joint 
Declaration represents a harmony among ancestral enemies in the British Isles 
that has no counterpart in the Balkans. Northern Ireland was once as Bosnia now 
is. Once, alleged outlaws actually did the bidding of legitimate governments. 
Now, the outlaws on either side are without official support and with a 
steadily shrinking base of unofficial support. In isolation and with their 
number declining, they can still kill, but they cannot win; in time they will 
see this. The joint declaration rests on a consensus that no sniper can bring 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 A comparable reconciliation in the Balkans is no doubt years or decades away, 
and yet let no one declare it impossible. The post-Cold War world may seem 
fissiparous and seething with new antipathies, but in a longer look back, 
forgotten reconciliations return to memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Reconciliation between the Castilians and the Catalans in Spain once seemed 
impossible, but despite as many as a million deaths it was achieved. 
Reconciliation will come in Ireland too and someday -- however unimaginable 
this seems as 1994 opens -- even in South Slavia.

FOR A TURNAROUND IN 1994, THE KEY WORD IS COOPERATION ; SOME ADVICE TO OUR 
LEADERS ON GETTING THE CALIFORNIA ENGINE CHUGGING AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New Year's Day is a time for review and resolution. But Californians emerge 
from 1993 with little to cheer. It was a tough year, marred by a continuing 
recession, deadly violence -- primarily caused by guns -- in both cities and 
suburbs, no relief from state and local budget woes, and raging brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not to say there was no progress on longstanding problems. A year ago, 
we encouraged the Legislature to set aside partisan politics to get some work 
done in 1993. It did complete the state budget on time for a change. And the 
state's deficit didn't worsen in 1993. Sacramento finally managed as well to 
enact reforms of the state's dysfunctional workers' compensation system. Gov. 
Pete Wilson and Speaker Willie Brown cooperated more, even if they succumbed to 
undue partisanship when it came to filling the important post of state schools 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 This year promises new and equally difficult challenges for our state and 
local leaders and for each of us. Economic recovery still eludes California 
even as the rest of the nation appears slowly headed out of the recession. 
Local governments continue to grapple with diminishing resources and escalating 
needs. The unrelenting pressures will force all to work harder, smarter and, 
most of all, together. To that end, we suggest the following resolutions for 
people and groups likely to be key players in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mayor Richard Riordan: You showed laudable backbone in the airport 
landing-fee battle and are off to a good start with the City Council. Now keep 
pushing to make the streets safe again and to bring new jobs and more 
affordable housing to the city. And put some resources into luring back 
tourists and conventions scared away by the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 For LAPD Chief Willie L. Williams: The 54 new officers to be hired with a 
$4-million infusion of federal funds announced two weeks ago by President 
Clinton will help. But the LAPD is still far, far short of the money and 
resources needed to put enough officers on the street to expand community 
policing. But don't be discouraged. Get the mayor and council to help you in 
another effort to encourage city voters to approve bonds to build up the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 For RLA: Keep at it. RLA, formerly known as Rebuild L.A., got off to an uneven 
start, but it has become a significant public-private partnership to revitalize 
a city racked by riots. With virtually no government help, it has already 
helped to bring new markets and other businesses, job training and important 
alternative financing into South-Central Los Angeles. A major change in 
leadership has been promised. Name that new chairperson as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 For the L.A. School Board and United Teachers-Los Angeles: The recent defeat 
of the school voucher initiative should not mean you can rest on your laurels. 
School reform, such as the charter schools experiment and LEARN, must continue 
apace. And schools must be made safer because no learning can occur where 
students and teachers fear for their lives. Confidence in the system still 
lags. 
</P>
<P>
 For partisans in Orange County's El Toro Marine Corps Air Station debate: Put 
aside your preconceived ideas about the future of the base and work in harmony 
to develop a plan that truly will benefit the region. 
</P>
<P>
 For the city of Anaheim: Try to keep the Rams football team in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gov. Wilson and potential rivals for his job like State Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi: We may be guilty of naivete 
but please conduct a civil and positive campaign this year. Cool the negative 
and bombastic political rhetoric. Avoid demagoguery on complex and volatile 
issues such as crime and immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Legislature: Being a legislator is a killer of a job because it is 
really two jobs: lawmaker and fund-raiser. But you can make it easier and 
restore public confidence in state government at a stroke if you pass AB 1993. 
This campaign finance reform bill would not do everything but it would do 
enough to make a big difference. Also, a major bipartisan effort on crime, 
including tough new limits on the private possession of handguns, is a must. 
</P>
<P>
 For our Washington delegation -- Stay united when it comes to promoting 
California's interests in Congress. We still need more federal aid to help pay 
for all the immigrants we have absorbed. And as universal health care and 
welfare reform come before Congress, a big state like ours is sure to feel the 
impact of the President's proposed reforms in a big way.

JIM MURRAY: NEW YEAR'S DAY BOWL GAMES; RIVETING 1963 GAME WAS GRANDEST DADDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a way, it may have been the best of the Rose Bowls, the granddaddy of them 
all, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin won it, 37-42. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute! you exclaim. Wisconsin never won a Rose Bowl! 
</P>
<P>
 That's what you think. Never mind the score. An irrelevancy. Trust me on this. 
</P>
<P>
 You have often heard a beaten team growl, "We didn't lose -- time just ran out 
on us"? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Wisconsin could say this with a perfectly straight face. 
</P>
<P>
 The time was New Year's Day 1963. The game was a rout. Wisconsin quickly fell 
behind, 21-7. Then, 28-7, then, 42-14 with only 14 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came The Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-quarter heroics had been commonplace in Rose Bowl history. Doyle Nave 
coming off the bench as a third-stringer in 1939 to throw for the only 
touchdown scored against the Duke defense all year; Charles White (a la Art 
Murakowski) going into the end zone with or without the football in the closing 
mnutes in 1979, and UCLA's Bob Stiles, 5 feet 9 and 160 pounds, stopping 
Michigan State's Bob Apisa, 6-2 and 220, at the goal line on a two-point try 
that would have tied the game in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 But the greatest one-man show in any Rose Bowl fourth quarter was On 
Wisconsin's. It was put on by a young man with the uptown name of Ronald 
VanderKelen, a native of Green Bay, and came on the gloomy first afternoon in 
the Year of Our Lord 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin had come into the game ranked No. 2 in the country. USC was No. 1. 
"I think that was the first time in the history of the Rose Bowl that had 
happened, that teams ranked 1 and 2 came in," Ron VanderKelen remembered the 
other day, as he was getting ready for Wisconsin's first return to a Rose Bowl 
since that afternoon. He will be a spectator this time, attending with a 
daughter who is now a freshman at his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKelen electrified the Rose Bowl that distant afternoon. But before he 
could, he had to run the risk of summary ejection from the game. "As we fell 
further and further behind, (Wisconsin Coach Milt Bruhn) was within an eyelash 
of yanking me out of that game and going with a younger, fresher player to give 
him experience," VanderKelen recalled. "But then he decided to give me one more 
series." 
</P>
<P>
 The score was 42-14 at the time. "We were really embarrassed," VanderKelen 
said. "I called the guys around me. I said, 'Hey! We're a good football team! 
Let's score a couple of times, get respectable here. If we lose, let's lose 
with our flags flying.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we scored a couple of quick touchdowns to make it 42-28. As you know, 
football is a game of momentum. And we had momentum. Everything came together. 
We ran the Trojans ragged." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKelen completed 18 of 21 passes in that fourth quarter, which was being 
contested in such Stygian blackness of inadequate lighting that it looked as if 
they were playing by kerosene lamp. It was the longest game in Rose Bowl 
history. "The halftime show that year went on almost as long as the game," 
VanderKelen said. "We almost had to be reintroduced." 
</P>
<P>
 One result was that the Trojans seemed to have very little idea where the ball 
was, or even if there was one, and they spent the whole quarter running around 
like Keystone Kops or characters in a Tom and Jerry cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end, the Trojans were almost praying for the clock to run out. They 
looked for all the world like a fighter on the ropes with his ear torn, nose 
bleeding, mouthpiece gone and the referee looking at him quizzically. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just waiting for the clock to run out," VanderKelen said. "I can 
remember (USC Coach) John McKay practically lying down on all fours on the 
ground watching the plays. He looked like he was seeing a ghost." 
</P>
<P>
 The strangest part of the scenario was that before the season, VanderKelen, 
who looked like a Heisman Trophy candidate that day, had not played quarterback 
since 1958. The Badger coaching staff had tried him at several other positions, 
including defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Milt let me call the plays and run the offense when I got there," 
VanderKelen said. "So I knew where everyone was that day and what they were 
capable of." 
</P>
<P>
 Like every man, he remembers the might-have-been. "It was just before the 
half," he said. "I found Louis Holland in the end zone for a touchdown. But the 
officials said we had an ineligible man downfield and they called it back. You 
can't help thinking that would have been a big touchdown. We were behind, 21-7, 
at the time. I remember Bruhn running out on the field and arguing the call 
with the officials at the half." 
</P>
<P>
 All USC won was the game. At Trojan banquets all winter long, the question 
persisted: "What happened?" After one such instance, the blocking back, Ken Del 
Conte, was moved to protest: "Hey, you'd think we lost the game! We won by 
five!" But Wisconsin had outgained the Trojans, 486 yards to 367, 
out-first-downed them, 32-15, outscored them, 23-0, in the final quarter and 
had the ball as the game ended. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wisconsin, which had been the first Big Ten team to lose in the pact with 
the Pacific Coast schools and had suffered the worst Big Ten loss to 
Washington, 44-8, a few years earlier, the game was redemptive. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ron VanderKelen, it was to be a career climax. Even though he led the 
College All-Stars to victory over the Green Bay Packers the next summer, the 
last game the collegians were to win in that series, his pro career was a 
frustration. Drafted by the Minnesota Vikings, he played behind Fran Tarkenton 
for four years, and when Tarkenton was traded, Joe Kapp stepped in. "Your 
uniform stays pretty clean playing behind those guys," he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now vice president in charge of sales for Fitness Quest, an aerobic exercise 
product company, VanderKelen is philosophical about his day in the sun (and 
gloom) of Pasadena. Now that Wisconsin is in the Rose Bowl for the first time 
since his epic performance (33 completions and one 17-yard touchdown run), do 
the memories stay evergreen? 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKelen laughed: "Well, when you get to the Rose Bowl only once in 31 
years, the subject doesn't come up too often." 
</P>
<P>
 But for everyone who was there that day, the lasting image is of Ron 
VanderKelen filling the murky air with footballs while USC seemed to be running 
around looking for a bed to hide under.

NEW YEAR'S DAY BOWL GAMES; PUTTING IT ALL ON THE LINE; ORANGE BOWL: EITHER 
FLORIDA STATE OR NEBRASKA WILL PROBABLY EARN AT LEAST A SHARE OF NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the moment, Nebraska's Tom Osborne and Florida State's Bobby Bowden are 
linked by a single coincidence: Neither coach, despite their 444 combined 
victories, has won what Bowden mockingly calls "the big-un." In layman's terms, 
a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight that changes. The winner of the Orange Bowl will probably walk away 
with at least half of a national title and, with it, a sense of relief. The 
long wait will be over and so will the prying. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've about beat this thing to death," Osborne told reporters. "It means a 
lot to win a national championship. . . . OK, that knocks off one question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two points? Yeah, I'll do it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the two-point question. The question that still haunts Osborne like 
Marley haunted Scrooge. No matter how hard Osborne tries, it won't go away. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, at this same Orange Bowl, Osborne's No. 1-ranked Cornhuskers cut 
Miami's lead to 31-30 with 48 seconds to play in the New Year's game. An extra 
point ties the score and, as it would have turned out, ensures Nebraska of a 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne and his staff didn't think twice about it. They wanted the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they got heartache. Quarterback Turner Gill's pass was knocked down, 
and that was that. Ten years later, Osborne is pestered by a game of what-ifs. 
He wants no part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'defining moment,' " he said of the 1984 game. "It's the latest 
catchword. I hope not. You do something for 30 years, you hope it doesn't come 
down to one game." 
</P>
<P>
 For Bowden, who is suffering from a cold, there is also the memory of the 
Hurricanes. Strange how one team could cost two coaches those lug-nut-sized 
championship rings. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami ended Florida State's undefeated season in 1991 and again in '92. In 
each of those games, the Seminoles were victims of field-goal attempts that 
slipped just out of reach of the right upright. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the Seminoles lost one game. To Miami. The same thing happened in 
1987. Like Osborne, Bowden had become a coach whose overall record was 
sometimes obscured by a single failure. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you go through your profession, especially when you get down to the end of 
your profession like I am," said Bowden, 64, "you hate to have blurs. You hate 
to get this close to something and still have a stigma about you. A lot of it, 
my own personal thing, is to get that off." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, win or lose tonight, Bowden said he can live without holding the trophy 
above his head. In his mind, his career doesn't need to be validated by a poll. 
"I don't think that has anything to do with my coaching," he said. "If 
someone's going to put my career on one game, well, it goes deeper than that." 
</P>
<P>
 But one game is what the Seminoles (11-1) and the Cornhuskers (11-0) are left 
with. Florida State has been made a 17-point favorite, a remarkable spread 
considering the rankings. Nebraska historians couldn't remember the last time 
their team had been such an underdog. As expected, the Cornhuskers are rallying 
around the slight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically it's our team against the rest of the world," Nebraska linebacker 
Mike Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 All-American linebacker Trev Alberts added: "I feel somewhat disrespected." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait until Alberts hears what Florida State cornerback Clifton Abraham had to 
say about the Cornhuskers. Asked to describe your typical Nebraska player, 
Abraham was happy to oblige. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big boy," he said. "Probably drives an old pickup truck, a '76, a little 
rust. He's not going to wear a suit. He's going to wear overalls, probably a 
hat, straw in his mouth. Chewing his chaw." 
</P>
<P>
 And a Cornhusker's choice of music? 
</P>
<P>
 "Boxcar Willie," Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
 And teeth. Will a Cornhusker have all his teeth? "I'll give him that," Abraham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's about all the Seminoles are giving Nebraska these days. Even the 
usually diplomatic Charlie Ward, who is also nursing a cold, said the point 
spread should be adjusted only slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "About seven," the Florida State quarterback said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the final score, the winner will earn at least half a national 
championship. As for the rest of it, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular scenarios: 
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 3 West Virginia (11-0) beats No. 8 Florida (10-2) in the Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mountaineer victory, combined with a Florida State victory would probably 
result in a split vote. West Virginia would win the coaches' poll, the 
Seminoles would win the Associated Press voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Things get more interesting if West Virginia and Nebraska earn victories. Then 
what? Given the Cornhuskers' standing and quality of opponent, they would 
probably win both polls. 
</P>
<P>
 -- West Virginia loses to Florida, No. 4 Notre Dame (10-1) loses to No. 7 
Texas A&M (10-1), Nebraska loses to Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 Dueling Bowdens? Not likely. Terry Bowden, who coached Auburn (currently on 
NCAA probation and ineligible for postseason play) to an undefeated season, 
would see his dad win both polls. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Florida State wins, Notre Dame wins, West Virginia loses. 
</P>
<P>
 Hear that noise? That's Irish Coach Lou Holtz rehearsing his closing arguments 
for a share of the national championship. Notre Dame beat Florida State during 
the regular season -- not that Holtz will let anyone forget it if Scenario No. 
3 takes place. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this bothers Bowden. All he wants is a victory, however ugly. "I'd 
take one point today and take my chances on you voters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And then he paused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me . . . us voters. My mind's made up."

NEW YEAR'S DAY BOWL GAMES; NOT THE REMATCH EVERYONE WANTED; COTTON BOWL: IN 
REPEAT OF GAME PLAYED LAST JAN. 1, NO. 4 NOTRE DAME FACES NO. 7 TEXAS A&M. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a last-second field goal by Boston College's David Gordon five days 
before Thanksgiving, the rematch that virtually everyone wanted to see today, 
Notre Dame vs. Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl, became the rematch that almost 
no one wanted to see, Notre Dame vs. Texas A&M, in the Mobil Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly unenthusiastic when they arrived in Dallas on Christmas Day were 
the Irish, who bruised the Aggies' egos, 28-3, here last New Year's Day and 
would seem to have little motivation to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 So Notre Dame's coaches and players have tried this week to create some, 
talking up the national championship that they say should belong to them if 
they, ranked No. 4 in the nation at 10-1, defeat No. 7 Texas A&M, also 10-1, 
and No. 2 Florida State beats No. 1 Nebraska in the Orange Bowl and No. 8 
Florida beats No. 3 West Virginia in the Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 That, the Irish contend, would leave voters in the AP and the USA Today/CNN 
polls with a clear choice between Notre Dame and Florida State, and they are 
not too bashful to boast about their 31-24 victory over the Seminoles on Nov. 
13. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a logical argument, one that Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz rejected four 
years ago, when he campaigned for his team after an Orange Bowl victory over 
No. 1 Colorado despite the late-season Irish loss to Miami. The voters 
disagreed, crowning Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll admit, I was wrong then," Holtz said. "The voters were right. 
Absolutely, it should come down to head-to-head competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Leave it to Holtz to manipulate the circumstances for his benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 In a playful wrestling match after a workout one day this week, quarterback 
Kevin McDougal, 6 feet 2, 194 pounds, lifted the 5-5, 155-pound Holtz and spun 
him over his head like a pizza chef does dough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be careful, Kevin," Holtz warned. "I don't want to hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
 But even with all the discussion of the national championship implications, 
the Irish have given the impression in interviews that their hearts are not 
into this game. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they left them on the field at South Bend, Ind., on Nov. 20, when 
Gordon's 41-yard field goal as time expired gave Boston College a stunning 
41-39 victory and dropped the Irish from No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're coming in after a downer," Holtz said. "This is the first game since 
the Michigan game (in the season's second week) that we don't have the momentum 
and enthusiasm that kept us on a roll." 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame linebacker Pete Bercich, who dropped a potential interception that 
would have ended Boston College's game-winning drive, said he does not believe 
the Irish will ever live down that loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if everything works out in our favor and we're voted No. 1 unanimously," 
he said, "two weeks later, people are going to be asking us, 'What happened 
against Boston College?' " 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just one hell of a goofy day," he said. "I don't know if the stars 
were lined up funny or something." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Irish find themselves once again star-crossed, Texas A&M is capable of 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies lost only to Oklahoma, 44-14, at Norman, Okla., but that came 
during a week in which they were distracted by the revelation that the NCAA was 
investigating their football program again. The results of that probe are 
expected to be announced next week. 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA sanctions might be the only way to keep the Aggies out of the Cotton 
Bowl, where they have represented the host Southwest Conference in six of the 
last nine seasons, including three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 It is primarily because of their weak sisters in that conference, however, 
that the Aggies receive little national respect, despite a 32-4 record in the 
last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz, who coached in the SWC when Arkansas was a member, defended Texas A&M. 
"The Southwest Conference might be down," he said. "Texas A&M is not." 
</P>
<P>
 But some damage to the Aggies' reputation has been self-inflicted. When they 
have had an opportunity to prove they belong among the national powers in 
recent years, they have failed. They didn't score a touchdown in the last two 
Cotton Bowls, a 10-2 loss to Florida State and the 28-3 loss to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M Coach R.C. Slocum admitted that his players were embarrassed after 
they were manhandled by the Irish, but he has decided in retrospect that a team 
with quarterback Rick Mirer and running backs Jerome Bettis and Reggie Brooks, 
starters this season as NFL rookies, would have humbled a lot of opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were analyzing our program and deciding that we had to get bigger and 
stronger guys because Brooks and Bettis ran all over us," Slocum said. "It's 
kind of amusing now that Bettis had 240 yards against the New Orleans Saints. I 
noticed that until last weekend he was the leading rusher in the whole NFL. So 
I guess the whole NFL will have to evaluate their programs because Bettis is 
running on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Slocum, however, realizes that his protestations fall on deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can make some arguments, but people don't often talk themselves out of 
their predicaments," he said. "For us to get out of it, we're going to have to 
play our way out." 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz fears the Aggies will begin today. He gives them the edge in 
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to argue after a conversation with Texas A&M defensive end Sam 
Adams, who said: "When I pass away in many, many years, I'll be able to lay my 
soul to rest if I can say I beat the University of Notre Dame."

NEW YEAR'S DAY BOWL GAMES; MOUNTAINEERS HOPE TO AVOID LANDSLIDE; SUGAR BOWL: A 
FLORIDA VICTORY WOULD MEAN NO SHOT AT NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP FOR WEST VIRGINIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, let's get right to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Is West Virginia worthy? Are the Mountaineers (11-0) deserving of our 
attention? Has Team Salt-of-the-Earth been shunned as it hemmed and clawed its 
way up the polls while no one was looking? 
</P>
<P>
 Or are the Mountaineers the Beverly Hillbillies in cleats, country bumpkins 
run amok in a sea of city folk. Should beating up on football road kill -- i.e. 
Rutgers, Temple -- qualify you for the national championship of anything? 
</P>
<P>
 The debate may or may not be settled tonight in the Louisiana Superdome when 
the No. 3-ranked Mountaineers face No. 8 Florida in the USF&G Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 If, as some suspect, the high-powered Gators (10-2) pass and run the 
Mountaineers back to the high country, the question will be moot. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida is favored by almost a touchdown. (See what these Mountaineers mean 
about respect?) 
</P>
<P>
 But should West Virginia pull off the upset while undefeated Nebraska loses to 
Florida State in the Orange Bowl, the Mountaineers will be demanding their 
share of the national title. West Virginia could hope for a split in the polls. 
The Associated Press title will no doubt go to the Nebraska-FSU winner. But the 
Mountaineers rank second in the CNN/USA Today coaches' poll behind Nebraska and 
could rightly stake a claim with a Sugar Bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia Coach Don Nehlen has backed off the hue-and-cry tone of 
defending his team and respectfully offers: "If we win the football game, in my 
opinion, we'll get a share of the national championship. In my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Florida Coach Steve Spurrier agrees. Any undefeated team that beats his Gators 
should not be denied. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they go 12-0, certainly they deserve to be a national champion," he said 
this week. "Anybody that goes 12-0, at the level of play they've played, 
deserves a share." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, anyone who has studied Spurrier knows the thought of losing this 
game hasn't really crossed his mind this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mountaineers have stated their case, noting that they were picked to 
finish fourth in the Big East and were not ranked before the season; that they 
did not enter the coalition poll until Sept. 27, and that contrary to reports 
of their schedule being a breeze, they defeated three teams ranked in the final 
coalition poll -- No. 10 Miami, No. 15 Boston College and No. 22 Virginia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Mountaineers believe the poll deck was stacked from the start and that 
not pitting West Virginia against Nebraska is nothing less than an injustice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't lie," said Ed Hill, a West Virginia receiver. "We think the two 
undefeated teams should be facing each other. Let's go out and see who is the 
best undefeated team. Everybody wants to see Florida State win, and Bobby 
Bowden win his first (national title). 
</P>
<P>
 "If we win, it's going to be, 'Oh, West Virginia hasn't played anybody.' If we 
lose, everyone will say, 'See, we told you they weren't any good.' So we're 
going to go out and win for ourselves.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Baiting the Mountaineers all week has been Jack Jackson, one of Florida's many 
star receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 He had 51 catches and 11 touchdowns this season and figures he might get about 
half those totals against a soft Mountaineer defense. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about West Virginia's boast of winning the Big East Conference? 
</P>
<P>
 "We say, 'Yeah, you all won the Big Easy . . .' like they have the best 
conference, with Rutgers? I don't even know if West Virginia will be the best 
team we've played this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just beat us, then you'll have my respect. They measure their team on a win 
over Miami (17-14). I don't see how much that means against a team that's been 
struggling this year. When we see the film of Miami-West Virginia, we're not 
looking at Miami of the late 1980s. And they only beat them by three points at 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason Jackson is licking his chops: Florida's offense averaged 476 yards 
this season, including 339 passing. The Gators have a bona fide star at 
tailback in Errict Rhett, the first player in Division I history to rush for 
4,100 yards and catch 140 passes, and four receivers -- Jack Jackson, Willie 
Jackson, Harrison Houston and Aubrey Hill -- who have combined for 6,257 and 68 
touchdowns in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, the Mountaineer defense has not been of national championship 
caliber, giving up an average of 230 passing yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
 An 11-0 secondary? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all," Jack Jackson said. "I didn't realize they give up that many 
yards passing. But so be it. What do we average passing -- 330? Someone's in 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 What Jackson doesn't mention is that his own defense is no great shakes 
either, having given up an average of 225 passing yards, as it faces a 
formidable 1-2 pair of West Virginia quarterbacks, Jake Kelchner and Darren 
Studstill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to improve in that area, we all know that," Spurrier said of his 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurrier's offense, too, will be at a disadvantage without freshman 
quarterback Danny Wuerffel, who injured his right knee in the Florida State 
game and will not play. 
</P>
<P>
 Wuerffel and junior Terry Dean had been sharing the position most of the 
season, but it was Wuerffel who led the Gators in passing with 2,230 yards and 
22 touchdowns.

<P>
 College football's bowl runneth over today with eight games, culminating in 
the bowl 
</P>
<P>
 coalition's version of a national championship game, the meeting of Florida 
State and Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. As many as three of the bowl

implications, and the other five, well, they might make for good theater . . . 
and plenty of it. The following is a look at some of the facts and figures for

PRO FOOTBALL / BILL PLASCHKE; NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BILL PLASCHKE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 WE RESOLVE NEVER TO BELIEVE IN FIVE-YEAR, $5-MILLION CONTRACTS: Despite Jimmy 
Johnson's ironclad pact with owner Jerry Jones, sources say the Dallas Cowboys' 
coach will be contacted by the Jacksonville Jaguars after the season in hopes 
of tempting him back to his favorite state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is no secret that Jimmy and Jerry do not get along, and that Jimmy wants 
to coach in Florida again," said one source close to the situation. "Rumors are 
sure to be flying. We'll have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a feeling that if Johnson wins another Super Bowl, he will want to 
move to a place where he can start from scratch and run the entire show as 
coach and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Deron Cherry, part-owner of the Jaguars, wonders if one man can do it 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The league is getting to the point where it is hard to handle both of those 
roles and still get the contract situations worked out," Cherry said. "We may 
be talking about two people here." 
</P>
<P>
 WE RESOLVE TO ALWAYS WEAR OUR LONGJOHNS: Don't laugh when watching fans 
cavorting bare-chested through the stands in sub-zero temperatures during 
January playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 You may be watching somebody about to die. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, with exposure of that kind for any length of time, a life is in 
danger," said Dr. Robert Stevens, a family physician in Green Bay. "Hypothermia 
is sure to set in, particularly if the person is exposed during an entire 
football game." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens, however, said it is perfectly acceptable for clothed fans to sit 
through a three-hour game in the same weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as you layer your clothes -- and protect your nose, fingers, ears, 
cheeks and chin -- you will be fine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens said smart fans put vaseline on their faces to keep the cold air from 
burning their skin. And even smarter fans don't drink. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alcohol dulls your senses to where you don't notice things like your ears 
hurting," he said. "And without alcohol, you are less likely to take off your 
shirt when the TV cameras are on you." 
</P>
<P>
 WE RESOLVE TO WORK UNTIL QUITTING TIME: Besides all the usual gripes, the 
biggest question involving the Pro Bowl selections is this: Will Troy Aikman 
stay for the whole game this time? 
</P>
<P>
 "This time we will padlock him to the bench," said Leigh Steinberg, the Cowboy 
quarterback's agent. "This time, we plan to hire Mr. T to keep him there." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Aikman left the Honolulu game at halftime without informing 
anybody and was fined $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 WE RESOLVE TO WATCH OUR WEIGHT: How bad is it going for the New Orleans 
Saints? In early December, a truck pulled up to the Saints' headquarters and 
unloaded 100 cases of chocolate-covered raisins containing more than 120,000 
goodies. 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner had employees started digging in when they realized the cases had 
been sent to the wrong address. They eventually returned the delivery . . . 
minus one case.

MAIN EVENT TURNS INTO WARM-UP ACT; FIESTA BOWL: INSTEAD OF NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIP REMATCH BETWEEN NOTRE DAME AND FLORIDA STATE, IT'S MIAMI VS. 
ARIZONA.

<P>
 Sadly for those who work so hard to put it on, this year's Fiesta Bowl seems 
to have become the forgotten bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the game is a matchup between two nationally ranked 9-2 powers, No. 
10 Miami and No. 16 Arizona, and does carry the prestige of being a New Year's 
Day game (10 a.m., Channel 4), it also has the feel of a consolation prize for 
two programs that had illusions of grandeur, i.e. a national championship, late 
in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami had lost on Oct. 9 at Florida State, but had climbed back up the 
rankings. Arizona had won its first seven games and had risen to No. 7 going 
into its game against UCLA on Oct. 30 in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the Bruins stomped on the vaunted Wildcat defense, 37-17, the second 
shoe dropped on Arizona in a 24-20 stunner at Cal on Nov. 13. A week after 
that, Nov. 20, No. 4 Miami lost again, 17-14, at West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Fiesta Bowl, which seemed for so long this season to be the likely 
landing spot for such things as a national championship rematch between Florida 
State and Notre Dame, or some sort of battle for No. 1 involving unbeaten West 
Virginia, is pretty much reduced to an NBC warm-up act for later higher-profile 
matchups on the network between Notre Dame and Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl and 
Florida State and Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Fiesta Bowl officials got the 1987 No. 1 vs. No. 2 game in Miami 
and Penn State and the '89 No. 1 vs. No. 3 game in Notre Dame and West 
Virginia, the bowl gods have not smiled on the game in the Valley of the Sun. 
As recently as two years ago, that noted football powerhouse Louisville played 
here. Moreover, it won, beating a terrible Alabama team that was ranked No. 25 
coming in and nowhere afterward. That game drew a TV rating of 6.2, tiny for a 
New Year's Day bowl outing. 
</P>
<P>
 The local promoters have tried their best. The game slogan is "The Desert 
Storm Meets the Hurricane Swarm." But even such hyperbole about the respective 
Arizona and Miami defensive prowess has apparently not prompted even much 
home-team enthusiasm for this one. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Arizona Daily Star columnist Jack McGruder, Miami has turned over 
about one-third of its 12,500 ticket allotment to Arizona. And while Tucson is 
just down the road a couple of hours from Tempe, the game is being played in 
Sun Devil Stadium, home of Arizona's archrival, Arizona State. Those ASU fans 
who are not particularly civic-minded are greeting this one with yawns. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not difficult to understand a certain degree of ambivalence by Miami 
fans over this one, because the game will mark the first time since 1990 that 
their Hurricanes ha ve n't been playing on New Year's Day with a shot at the 
national title. Entering this season, Miami had been ranked in the top three 
the last seven years and had won four national titles in that time. So other 
than the fact that a victory over Arizona would give Coach Dennis Erickson and 
his Hurricanes the school's ninth consecutive 10-victory season, huge incentive 
is lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 The incentive for Coach Dick Tomey's Arizona team might be larger. The 
Wildcats have been in bowl games four of the last five years, but the last time 
they were in a New Year's Day bowl was 1949 at the Salad Bowl, where they lost 
to Drake, 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the rematch angle is the best thing this game has going for it. In 
1992, a high-flying Miami team squeaked past a rugged defensive unit from 
Arizona in a memorable 8-7 game at Miami. From that stemmed the "Desert Swarm" 
label for Arizona's defense, and the result, despite being a victory, knocked 
the Hurricanes from No. 1 to No. 2 in the national polls. Arizona's Steve 
McLaughlin, then a sophomore, barely missed a 51-yard field goal at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Something will have to give in this game -- Miami's high-powered offense or 
Arizona's rugged defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami scored 30 or more points in all but four of its games and ran up an 
average of 431 yards a game. It has two productive quarterbacks in sophomore 
Ryan Collins, the projected starter today, and junior Frank Costa, who lost his 
job to Collins in the sixth game of the season but still played enough to pass 
for 1,324 yards. Collins passed for 1,555. Miami has three running backs 
capable of big games -- James Stewart gained 649 yards, Donnell Bennett 594 and 
Larry Jones 428. 
</P>
<P>
 For Arizona, All-American nose guard Rob Waldrop and flamboyant defensive end 
Tedy Bruschi lead a unit that was tops in the country with a rushing yield of 
only 30 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's offense is led by tailback Chuck Levy, who rushed for 567 yards and 
nine touchdowns, piled up 1,032 all-purpose yards and also stepped in at 
quarterback a couple of times when starter Dan White was injured.

TENNESSEE'S SHULER TO PLAY, BUT WILL HE STAY?; CITRUS BOWL: JUNIOR QUARTERBACK 
WILL LEAD VOLUNTEERS AGAINST NITTANY LIONS, BUT HE IS THINKING ABOUT MAKING 
HIMSELF AVAILABLE FOR NFL DRAFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA, TIMES DEPUTY SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The question being asked these days around here is not who will win today's 
Florida Citrus Bowl -- it's a foregone conclusion that Tennessee is better than 
Penn State -- but how good will the Volunteers be next season? 
</P>
<P>
 And conversely, how good will the L.A. Rams be? 
</P>
<P>
 These seeming non sequiturs of playing performance are inexorably tied to one 
individual, Tennessee's junior quarterback, Heath Shuler. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuler is contemplating skipping his senior year and making himself available 
for the NFL draft. He plans to make his decision known on Jan. 9, the day 
before he would have to apply. Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer asked Shuler to 
make only one statement about the subject to avoid distractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it would be a distraction only if Shuler were not coming back, 
leading many to believe that Shuler's last college game is today. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Rams, can you think of a position where they -- to put it 
delicately -- stink? Did you say quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' season of bumbling and stumbling leaves them with a draft pick no 
worse than fifth, and that's if they win Sunday. More realistically, the Rams 
will probably settle around second or third. Cincinnati will most likely draft 
first, but the Bengals already have a young quarterback in David Klingler. It 
leaves the Rams in an enviable spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuler said the factors for him staying in school would be Tennessee's chance 
at a national championship and playing another season with his brother, 
freshman receiver Benjie. Shuler also has his eye on the Heisman Trophy. He 
finished second in the balloting this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, there is the excitement of playing in the NFL," Shuler 
said before taking his Christmas Eve vow of silence on this subject. "The money 
would likely be about the same from one year to the next. But there is the 
injury factor (if he stays in college). People talk about insurance, but I 
don't know how well that would work when it comes to a quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 Fulmer said he will support Shuler in whatever decision he makes. Any guess 
which way Fulmer wants it to turn out? 
</P>
<P>
 Shuler's credentials are impressive. He threw a school-record 25 touchdown 
passes, led the Southeastern Conference in passing with 2,354 yards and 
completed 184 of 285 passes for a remarkable 64.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's his size, at 6 feet 3 and 212 pounds, that makes him attractive to 
the pros. He is projected to be the first quarterback taken, if not the first 
player taken. 
</P>
<P>
 As for today's game (10 a.m., Channel 7), Tennessee (9-1-1) arguably is the 
best team in the SEC. It is ranked sixth, ahead of Florida (eighth) and Alabama 
(18th). But those were the teams the Volunteers couldn't beat, losing at 
Gainesville, 41-34, and tying Alabama at Birmingham, 17-17. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were unfortunate not to win the (Florida) game," Shuler said. "But we came 
away from that knowing that we could play with any team in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 But is Tennessee the best in the SEC? 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's just say, I'm sure they wouldn't want to play us again," Shuler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, 13th-ranked Penn State (9-2) comes in a big underdog. It lost at 
home to Michigan, 21-13, and at Ohio State, 24-6. The Nittany Lions did beat 
USC, 21-20, but didn't play Big Ten champion Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those credentials, the Penn State coaching staff is clearly uptight 
about what could happen today.  
</P>
<P>
 The first sign came when Coach Joe Paterno decided to bring his team to 
Florida on Dec. 20 and conduct three days of intense workouts about 40 miles 
from here in Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the team got to Orlando, Paterno groused about the number of amusement 
parks the team had to attend. He picked a Tuesday barbecue party for 
disadvantaged children to spout off about the rigors of local attractions. 
Reporters here did their best say-it-ain't-so-Joe routine, indicating that he 
was missing the point of the bowl game. He apologized the next day. And the day 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Paterno's record in Florida bowls has been horrible. In 1985, he lost to 
Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl, in 1987 to Clemson in the Citrus Bowl, in 1990 to 
Florida State in the Blockbuster Bowl, and last season his team played a 
pathetic game against Stanford in the Blockbuster Bowl, losing, 24-3. 
</P>
<P>
 If stopping Tennessee's offense wasn't tough enough, there is the Volunteer 
defense, which has given up only 27 points in the last four games. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're probably as good a group on defense as anyone we played all season, 
and I'm not Lou Holtzing you," said Fran Ganter, the Penn State offensive 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, there is the Nittany Lions' quarterback, Kerry Collins. He 
replaced John Sacca, the Penn State starter who was benched after disagreements 
with Paterno. Sacca subsequently left school. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins threw for 1,605 yards and 13 touchdowns and is most remembered for 
rallying his team for 21 points in five minutes to beat Michigan State, 38-37. 
But his play has been erratic. 
</P>
<P>
 At one of those nettlesome local functions Penn State had to attend -- the 
annual kickoff luncheon -- Collins was called upon to throw two footballs into 
the audience as prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 He did so, then Paterno jumped to the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have just seen something historic," Paterno said. "You have just seen 
Penn State hit two passes back-to-back. . . . Right, Kerry?" 
</P>
<P>
 Paterno was kidding. Well, maybe.

WISCONSIN TACKLES POOR PAST IN BOWL; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: BADGERS HOPING TO WIPE 
OUT MEMORIES OF HUMILIATING DEFEATS IN 1953 AND 1960. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WOLF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wisconsin's first two visits to the Rose Bowl resulted in frustration, 
humiliation and embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1953, Coach Ivy Williamson's Badgers piled up a big statistical advantage 
over USC, but blew chance after chance and lost, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1960, things went wrong for Coach Milt Bruhn's Badgers from the coin flip 
to the final gun. They took a 44-8 pasting from lightly regarded Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Wisconsin losses broke six-game winning streaks for the Big Ten in its 
Rose Bowl rivalry with the Pacific Coast Conference, now the Pac-10. Big Ten 
schools won every game from 1947, the first year of the interconference 
agreement, through 1952 and from 1954 through 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 The embarrassment caused by being the goat of the Big Ten was eased 
considerably in 1963 when Wisconsin staged the most stirring comeback in Rose 
Bowl history before losing to USC, 42-37. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the frustration of 1953 and the humiliation of 1960 still kindle 
unpleasant memories among Wisconsin followers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1953, the Badgers outgained USC, 353 yards to 233, including 211 to 48 on 
the ground, and ran 87 plays to USC's 65. They began drives on the Trojans' 
35-yard line or closer seven times without scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a 54-yard run by fullback Alan Ameche, who gained 133 yards and two years 
later became Wisconsin's only Heisman Trophy winner, didn't produce anything. 
</P>
<P>
 The final blow to the Badgers came with 1 1/2 minutes to play when a pass by 
quarterback Jim Haluska into the end zone was tipped by Trojan safety Harry 
Welch and squirted off the fingertips of halfback Harland Carl. 
</P>
<P>
 USC ran the single wing in those days under Coach Jess Hill, and All-American 
Jim Sears was its do-everything tailback. But Sears suffered a leg injury in 
the opening minutes, and his replacement, Rudy Bukich, wound up as the game's 
most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 Bukich, who was drafted by the Rams and once led the NFL in passing for the 
Chicago Bears, completed 12 of 20 passes for 137 yards and the only score of 
the game, a 22-yard play to wingback Al Carmichael in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they got a break when Sears got hurt," Wisconsin's Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bukich was so impressive that R.G. Lynch, sports editor of the Milwaukee 
Journal, wrote: "He was Annie Oakley with a rifle and little David with a 
slingshot." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, Bukich, now retired and living in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, said: 
"We won, No. 1, because we had a great defensive team. And I was fortunate to 
have three receivers like Ron Miller, Don Stillwell and Tom Nickoloff. They 
caught everything I put in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had all we could handle, though. No one has ever given a very good 
Wisconsin team enough credit." 
</P>
<P>
 The touchdown pass capped a 73-yard drive, and Bukich said, "Carmichael was 
split out at flanker. He ran a deep hook and I hit him in the face with the 
ball. If he didn't catch the ball, he'd still be sorry (since players didn't 
wear facemasks in those days)." 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin was weakened late in the second quarter when its best pass rusher, 
All-American defensive end Don Voss, suffered a career-ending knee injury. With 
Voss out, Bukich was seldom under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Voss, who now operates a travel agency in Milwaukee and is running tours to 
this Rose Bowl, recalls that the Badgers considered themselves the better team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have won," Voss said. "We moved the ball well, but something always 
happened. On defense, we hadn't faced much single wing, only UCLA, and they 
beat us, too." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the 1960 game, the Badgers were simply awful. They won the toss, but 
Bruhn chose to kick off, and the rout was on. Coach Jim Owens' Huskies scored a 
quick 17 points, and after fullback Tom Wiesner's touchdown averted a shutout, 
Washington ran off 27 more. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Schloredt, a run-oriented quarterback with sight in only one eye, was the 
MVP. He rushed for 81 yards and passed for 102, including a 65-yard play with 
halfback George Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, reporters and fans ripped the badly beaten Badgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Melvin Durslag of the Los Angeles Examiner, later of The Times, wrote: "The 
men from Wisconsin couldn't play football for sour apples, or for that matter, 
sauerbraten." 
</P>
<P>
 Even a cab driver got into the act, unknowingly at the expense of Williamson, 
who was then Wisconsin's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a bunch of bums," the cabbie said to Williamson. "I lost $100 on them 
Wisconsin guys seven years ago and another $100 on them today. They can keep 
Wisconsin." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Bakken, who backed up Wisconsin quarterback Dale Hackbart and is now 
director of community relations in the school's athletic department, said the 
Badgers were overconfident. Like Bukich, Bakken was drafted by the Rams and 
became a star elsewhere, once kicking a record seven field goals in a game for 
the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a conservative offense, not the type to come back from such a 
deficit," Bakken said. "Once they jumped on us, it was like a big snowball."

ROSE BOWL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; COOK TRIES SOME LAST-MINUTE CURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA quarterback Wayne Cook reportedly has changed medication and is being 
treated with a steroid derivative in an attempt to cure his sore throat and 
allow him to call signals over the noise of a crowd of 100,000-plus in today's 
Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, out with flu for three days, has been unable to call out plays and snap 
counts since his return Wednesday, but Coach Terry Donahue said that he 
expected Cook's voice to be strong enough to carry out his assignments against 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 The family agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he'll be OK," said Wayne's father, Ken Cook, who will be seeing his 
first Rose Bowl since 1963, which was the last time Wisconsin played in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 If not, hand signals and other options will be used. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure you can hear anything over 100,000 people anyway," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he had any advice for Wisconsin's Barry Alvarez, in his first bowl 
game as a head coach after nine as an assistant, Donahue said: "Well, I hope he 
does the same thing I did in my first bowl game as head coach." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the 1976 Liberty Bowl, in which Donahue's Bruins lost to Alabama, 
36-6. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between coming to town and playing in the Rose Bowl, as opposed 
to being from Southern California and playing in the game? 
</P>
<P>
 "When you come to a different city and play, there is a thrill in all of the 
events before the game," Donahue said. "We enjoyed things like going to 
Disneyland, but I think all of our players have been there before. When you're 
in the city, like we are for the Rose Bowl, you tend to say this isn't as much 
fun, and the thrill is the game itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our players don't know it yet, but the thrill is the game and game day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parking alternatives are available for those who don't want to deal with a mob 
scene around the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the Ralph Parsons Company parking lot, at 100 W. Walnut in Pasadena, 
where the cost is $15 before 9 a.m. and $10 afterward. Shuttle transportation 
will be provided for $1.10 each way, with buses boarding at Raymond Avenue and 
Union Street after the Rose Parade and operating until game time. The buses 
return to the Parsons lot immediately after the game. JIM HODGES

ROSE BOWL / DAILY REPORT; WISCONSIN; CONGRESSMAN WANTS TICKET PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Disgruntled Wisconsin fans who paid for Rose Bowl tickets only to be told by 
ticket agencies that they were unavailable scrambled Friday for seats to the 
New Year's Day game. 
</P>
<P>
 The debacle prompted Rep. Scott Klug, R-Wis., to ask U.S. Attorney General 
Janet Reno to investigate the possible fraudulent sale of Rose Bowl tickets and 
decide whether federal laws were broken. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation would be too late to help out-of-luck Wisconsin fans. 
Several in the Biltmore were discussing filing lawsuits against tour operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 24 hours before ninth-ranked Wisconsin was to play No. 14 UCLA in 
college football's oldest bowl game, hundreds of Wisconsin fans hit the streets 
and combed newspaper classified ads looking for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for Rose Bowl tickets has driven prices up as much as 13 times the $46 
face value. Seats were being advertised Friday for as much as $475 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fans gathered in hotel lobbies to swap news about possible ticket sources 
and to commiserate. 
</P>
<P>
 The concierge desk at the Biltmore Hotel was swamped with fans pleading for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin, of the Big Ten, received 18,000 tickets, less than half the 40,000 
that Pac-10 champion UCLA was allotted for its fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem has taken the California attorney general's office by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something that we've had in regard to the Rose Bowl before, so it's 
not an issue we were even prepared for," said Herschel Elkins, head of the 
California consumer law division of the attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 There is very little regulation of the ticket brokerage industry in 
California. However, it is a misdemeanor to sell tickets on the grounds of the 
venue in excess of the face value without permission from the venue. That law 
is heavily enforced on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin fans are discouraged. "I looked at the T-shirts in the gift shop and 
I thought, 'I don't want anything to remind me of Los Angeles or the Rose 
Bowl,' " said Dorothy Grubb of Madison. "My sincere hope is that Wisconsin 
makes it next year and no one goes. They can keep their tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Gustof Peterson and his wife also lacked tickets promised by Southtown Travel, 
and were planning to watch Saturday's game on TV after traveling from Las 
Cruces, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't underestimate Wisconsin fans," Peterson said. "They may tear this place 
down before it's over."

<P>
 Alvarez has heard more than he cares to hear about the Badgers' 0-3 record in 
the Rose Bowl, but he considers it meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez and Donahue parried reporters' questions Friday in the final interview 
session before today's showdown in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had to deal with that kind of talk all year," Alvarez said. "Stuff like 
we've never won on grass, we've never won on the road in so-many years, we 
haven't won at Purdue in 90 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes on and on. We've talked about it all along, and we've wiped out all 
those records except the last one. Now comes the big one, and we're ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez was asked how he thought his players would feel when they waited in 
the tunnel in the huge Pasadena stadium, with more than 100,000 fans in the 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've told my kids about it," he said. "I'm sure there will be a lot of 
butterflies." 
</P>
<P>
 The Badgers had a light workout at the Rose Bowl earlier Friday, and Alvarez 
said: "They were scared, because everybody was yelling at them to stay off the 
paint (on the field)." 
</P>
<P>
 Before taking the Wisconsin job, Alvarez was assistant head coach under Lou 
Holtz at Notre Dame. He was asked if he had sought any advice from Holtz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, he sent me a new option offense," Alvarez said. "No, I'm kidding. But 
yes, he has been a sounding board for me, and I visited with him before we 
started our Rose Bowl practice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver J.C. Dawkins doubtless spoke for all of his Wisconsin teammates 
when the subject of the Pac-10's Rose Bowl domination came up.

 "Our guys haven't had anything to do with that," Dawkins said. "We've had 
distractions all season, about having to go to Tokyo to play a home game 
against Michigan State. That's the reason this team is like it is. We can cope 
with anything."

 Fullback Mark Montgomery was not among the Wisconsin players who made all-Big 
Ten teams, yet he could be their hottest prospect for a career in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery, 6-feet-1 and 220 pounds, is a devastating blocker for the Badgers' 
alternating tailbacks, Brent Moss and Terrell Fletcher. He also has 4.4-second 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they see him in the combine workouts, he'll blow their socks off," 
Alvarez said. "Guys with his combination of speed and blocking ability don't 
come along very often." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery is from St. Paul, but chose Wisconsin over Minnesota because the 
Gophers wanted to make him a linebacker. BOB WOLF

ALAMO BOWL; BARR IS SHARP AS CAL GETS A 37-3 VICTORY TO REMEMBER 
</P>

 Dave Barr threw three touchdown passes and Jerrott Willard had three sacks and 
returned an interception 61 yards for a score as California routed Iowa, 37-3, 
Friday night in the inaugural Alamo Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr led the Golden Bears on time-consuming drives and repeatedly picked Iowa 
apart on third down, ripping holes in the seams of the Hawkeyes' zone defense 
with precision passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard and his band of blitzing defenders, meanwhile, held Iowa to 20 yards 
in 21 rushes. 
</P>
<P>
 California (9-4) won its third bowl game in four years. Iowa (6-6) barely 
managed to get into a bowl after finishing eighth in the Big Ten without 
beating a team with a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Bears scored on four of their first five possessions, including 
field goals by Doug Brien of 37, 20 and 30 yards, and led, 23-0, at 
intermission. Barr, who was 21 of 28 for 266 yards, also hit Mike Caldwell with 
a 6-yard touchdown pass in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa's only score came on a 42-yard field goal by Brion Hurley with 10 minutes 
left in the third quarter after Bo Porter shook the ball loose from Barr on a 
sack and Matt Hilliard recovered at Cal's 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawkeyes' Matt Burmeister, who was six of 17 for 70 yards with one 
interception, never got going against a Cal defense that pressured him most of 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears' knockout punch came on the first half's final play when Regan 
Upshaw pressured Burmeister into throwing a weak pass that was picked off by 
Willard, who lumbered 61 yards untouched for the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal had the ball for 21 minutes, 14 seconds of the first half and limited Iowa 
to only 69 yards, six in the first quarter. The Hawkeyes' deepest penetration 
in the first quarter was their 29. 
</P>
<P>
 On four of Cal's scoring drives, Barr faced third-and-long situations and each 
time converted, including a scrambling 11-yard pass to Damien Semien on 
third-and-10 that gave the Bears a first down at Iowa's 42 midway through the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Five plays later, Barr hit Iheanyi Uwaezuoke with a 34-yard touchdown pass, 
giving Cal a 30-3 lead with 4:05 left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr also hit Brian Remington with a 12-yard touchdown pass on third-and-4, 
which put Cal up, 37-3, with 7:59 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa appeared to be closing in for a score in the second quarter as it crossed 
midfield for the first time. A 33-yard strike from Burmeister to Harold Jasper 
put the Hawkeyes at Cal's 28. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kent Kahl ran for no gain, Burmeister threw an incomplete pass and Willard 
rocked the Iowa quarterback for a 12-yard loss, pushing the Hawkeyes out of 
field goal range.

GATOR BOWL; BURGDORF LEADS ALABAMA TO 24-10 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Burgdorf has been a quarterback struggling for acceptance. He might have 
found it in the Gator Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 In only his fourth college start, Burgdorf threw for two touchdowns and ran 33 
yards for a score as No. 18 Alabama finally looked like the defending national 
champion, rolling past No. 12 North Carolina, 24-10, on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great confidence builder for me," Burgdorf said. "It's a 
steppingstone to next year. We won nine games and that was something we needed 
to do. It was a great year for us." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the kind of game Alabama Coach Gene Stallings loves: methodical on 
offense, stingy on defense, no turnovers. And this time there was no 
quarterback controversy for the Crimson Tide. Burgdorf got the start in place 
of injured Jay Barker and took every snap until victory was assured for Alabama 
(9-3-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Stallings had assured everyone that his players were over the disappointment 
of losing three of their final four games to fall from championship contention. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned out to be right. There wasn't the letdown that might have been 
expected when a team is forced to settle for the Gator Bowl a year after 
winning the national title. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgdorf completed 15 of 23 passes for 166 yards. He threw an eight-yard 
touchdown to Tarrant Lynch that broke a 10-10 tie early in the third quarter, 
then added a 10-yarder to Chad Key with 6:34 to play that sealed the victory 
over North Carolina (10-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Burgdorf also ran 33 yards on a quarterback draw for Alabama's first 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a far cry from the Southeastern Conference championship game, when 
Alabama lost to Florida, 28-13, and Burgdorf was yanked in favor of receiver 
David Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday night, Burgdorf came out only after Alabama had built a 
two-touchdown lead in the final minutes. And then it was for freshman Freddie 
Kitchens, not Palmer, who may have been playing his last college game as he 
ponders whether to skip his final year and make himself available for the NFL 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer declined to be interviewed after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 For North Carolina, it was a disappointing end to a fine season. The Tar 
Heels, who had won three in a row and seven of eight, were hoping for their 
first 11-victory season since 1980 and their first top-10 final ranking in 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 They fell short on both counts mainly because the option-oriented running 
game, which ranked seventh nationally with 253 yards per game, gained only 42 
yards against Alabama. North Carolina's two 1,000-yard tailbacks, Curtis 
Johnson and Leon Johnson, were held to 27 and 24 yards, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a great job stopping the run," said North Carolina receiver Corey 
Holliday, who had nine catches for 125 yards, both school records for a bowl 
game. "They put eight men around the ball, they were aggressive and we had to 
throw the ball more than we wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
 The game was tied, 10-10, at halftime, but Alabama dominated the final two 
quarters. The Crimson Tide came out on its first possession of the second half 
and went 65 yards in 12 plays for Burgdorf's touchdown pass to Lynch. It was 
the first pass of the drive after 11 runs.

INDEPENDENCE BOWL; VIRGINIA TECH GETS ALL THE BREAKS AND A 45-20 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The last 23 seconds of the first half made it a freaky Friday for Indiana 
Coach Bill Mallory. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Tech safety Antonio Banks recovered a fumble, intercepted a pass and 
returned a partially blocked field goal 80 yards for a touchdown as the 
22nd-ranked Hokies defeated No. 21 Indiana, 45-20, Friday in the Independence 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks was voted top defensive player in a game that featured defense. Virginia 
Tech (9-3) forced four turnovers, setting up one touchdown and scoring two -- 
both in the last 23 seconds of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The two quick scores "really cut our throats," Mallory said. "You take those 
two plays out of there, and I think our defense played well enough to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana (8-4) trailed 14-13 before the Hokies' defense broke open the game on 
two freak plays. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first, John Paci took the snap at the Virginia Tech 49 and soon the 
entire defensive line joined him in the backfield. Two players hit Paci as he 
was trying to throw and he fumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 J.C. Price tried to sweep the ball up, but wound up hitting it toward the 
Indiana goal line. The ball bounced into Lawrence Lewis' hands as he trailed 
the play. Lewis caught it in stride and scored to make it 21-13 with 23 seconds 
to play in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to get to the goal line," Lewis said. "If it had been five more 
yards, I don't think I would have made it." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Hoosiers got the ball back, Paci completed a nine-yard pass to Eddie 
Baety, who did not get out of bounds. The clock ran out, but the official ruled 
that Indiana had called timeout with one second left. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Hokies were called back from the locker room, Bill Manolopoulos came 
on to try a 51-yard field goal. The kick, partially blocked by Jeff Holland, 
was caught by Banks at the 20 and he ran it back for a touchdown to make it 
28-13. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never, ever seen a half end that way," Lewis said. "They wanted the 
extra second, so they got the extra second, and look what happened. They should 
have just went on and took it as it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice DeShazo found Antonio Freeman for a 42-yard touchdown pass to make it 
35-13 with 9:37 to play. On the next series, Price and Waverly Jackson sacked 
Chris Dittoe inside the Indiana five and Banks came up with the ball again. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Edwards ran five yards for a touchdown on the next play to make it 
42-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Lewis, who had six catches for 177 yards, scored Indiana's touchdowns 
on a 75-yard pass from Paci in the first quarter and a 42-yarder from Dittoe in 
the fourth.

BEAUREGARD JOINED MATES AND WRITER PURGED QUOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As dawn broke on a chilly fall morning, two buses carrying the Cal State 
Northridge football team left the North Campus Stadium parking lot and headed 
for Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, one of the buses pulled to the side of the road. Its door swung open 
and out stepped a very defiant young man. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a week, Jon Beauregard had been a human wishbone in a tug of war 
of will. Finally, he had snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard paused as his feet hit the sidewalk, but the door closed quickly 
behind him and the bus drove off. 
</P>
<P>
 Until that moment, he had been the starting right guard on the Matadors' 
offensive line.  
</P>
<P>
 As he started his climb back up the long blacktop path of the stadium 
driveway, a celebration began among a group of two dozen men and women who had 
been left behind in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Beauregard's action, they were able to claim victory. 
</P>
<P>
 They identified themselves as members of the Northridge Black Student Union, 
an organization that in previous weeks had led a rebellion against the school's 
athletic program. The football team had been a prime target. 
</P>
<P>
 The group claimed that some Northridge athletes were living in poverty while 
the school reaped a windfall profit from guarantees, advertising and gate 
receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 They showed up at one home football game toting signs and shouting slogans, 
comparing the work of athletic program leaders and coaches with acts of 
slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 And they had gathered that morning to encourage players to protest their 
plight by boycotting Northridge's game the following night in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues ripped at the heart of several football players, some of whom had 
missed meals and fallen into debt because their financial aid packages failed 
to cover expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard was one player among many who believed the cause was a noble one. 
Yet, with a single act of defiance, he had become the one and only martyr. 
</P>
<P>
 He was asked how he felt. "Like a man," he responded, among cheers. He also 
had some scathing comments about Northridge administrators, coaches and 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 I wondered how Bob Burt, the football team's coach, would respond. And I 
thought back to a conversation I had a few years before with former Northridge 
President James Cleary. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleary believed strongly that athletics had its place in a university's 
academic curriculum. He said he admired athletes because they were immediately 
held responsible for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 They were forced to make choices, act on those choices, and were then held 
accountable by the armchair quarterbacks of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard certainly would be held accountable for his action -- probably at 
the expense of his scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 He said, in so many words, that he was prepared to make the sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that evening, I phoned Burt in his room at the hotel where the team was 
staying in Las Vegas. By my count, three starters would not be suited for the 
game, a fact I wanted to confirm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who are the three?" Burt asked. 
</P>
<P>
 So I listed them: Vincent Johnson, a cornerback who was serving a one-game 
suspension for a related matter, Gerald Ponder, a safety who did not show up to 
board the bus, and Beauregard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beauregard is here, or at least on his way here," Burt said. "I have a coach 
picking him up at the airport." 
</P>
<P>
 It was true. After hours of soul-searching, Beauregard had phoned Burt in Las 
Vegas and asked to rejoin the team. In fact, he had paid for his airline 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 The following night, Beauregard stood by himself off to the side of the 
Northridge bench, holding his helmet under his arm and watching his teammates 
upset Nevada Las Vegas in what was the proudest moment in the Matadors' 
tumultuous season. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not play. He did not look happy. But he remained a member of the team 
and, in the course of the next couple of weeks, won back his starting spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The following week I approached Beauregard after practice. I wanted him to 
know that his previous comments would not be seen in print. What is said in the 
heat of the moment often makes great newspaper copy. It also can engender deep 
regret. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard seemed to appreciate the gesture. But mostly he seemed emotionally 
spent. He said he still took issue with the school's treatment of athletes, but 
he added that he felt an overwhelming responsibility to his teammates and 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people bag groceries to pay their way through college. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard plays football. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not a traitor, or a hero. Never was. 
</P>
<P>
 He's just another 21-year-old student who occasionally finds it difficult to 
separate fact and fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 I can relate. It's the most difficult part of the job.

ALLEN NEAR THE END, NOT THE END ZONE; UCLA TIGHT END HOPES TO CLOSE CAREER ON 
HIGH NOTE IN ROSE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The countdown to the Rose Bowl hit four days and UCLA tight end Brian Allen 
momentarily appeared to be the focus of the Bruin offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-team offense lined up for a two-point conversion against the 
scout-team defense. Backup quarterback Rob Walker, filling in while starter 
Wayne Cook was sidelined with flu, spotted Allen running an out pattern and 
delivered the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, the sure-handed, 6-foot-3, 230-pound veteran, grabbed it and trotted 
across the goal line untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 The offense backed up for another series. After a few running plays, Walker 
again found his tight end wide open, this time along the sideline. Allen had 
sprinted past the safety, then made a seemingly effortless catch of what would 
have been a 30-yard touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good play, especially if the defensive back bites," said Allen, a 
senior from Hart High. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen doesn't hold his breath for such opportunities in today's Rose Bowl game 
against Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, during practice in front of a large contingent of media, he stopped 
short of the end zone after his long reception from Walker, turned around and 
flipped the ball back to a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he didn't want to waste valuable practice time by running the extra 
five yards. Or perhaps Allen's maneuver was meant to be symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
 After catching 109 passes in two seasons at Hart -- 25 of them for touchdowns 
-- Allen expected to do more at UCLA than score in practice. But for all 
intents and purposes, he hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth-year senior who became a starter this season but saw plenty of 
action the previous two has caught 25 passes at UCLA, only two for touchdowns, 
and none since the middle of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a few plays that are designed for me -- things we've had but haven't 
really used," he said. "I don't get the ball a lot during games." 
</P>
<P>
 After being one of the nation's most sought-after tight ends in 1988, Allen 
has little to show for his half-decade at UCLA. Facing him now is the biggest 
-- and last -- game of his college career, and one last chance to make good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want a long run," said Allen, who averages 9.5 yards per reception. 
"I've never had a long touchdown run or a long run, period, at UCLA. A 55-60 
yarder for a touchdown would be nice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I catch the ball here, I've never had time to do anything. The 
defenses are always on me. It seems like I'm always the secondary receiver. 
Running the ball after the catch is something that I've missed. It would be 
nice if I could get a real good ball that I could work with and maybe do 
something with." 
</P>
<P>
 Time is running out on Allen, if it hasn't already. Even his own expectations 
have dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen could dream of being the game's most valuable player today, but instead 
his Rose Bowl fantasy is simple. Just once he'd like to break loose in the open 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 He had 1,620 yards receiving in two seasons at Hart, averaging 15 yards per 
catch. But at UCLA, he has 238 receiving yards. Bruin All-American wide 
receiver J.J. Stokes accounted for more yards than that in one game (263 vs. 
USC in 1992). 
</P>
<P>
 "At Hart, I had a lot of long runs," said Allen, whose career long reception 
at UCLA is 23 yards against Oregon State in 1991. "My junior year (at Hart), we 
had a couple of good receivers and the defense would sag back on them and I 
would catch the ball underneath and have 20 yards in front of me. But it's not 
like that in college." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents feared the sight of Allen in his high school days -- both on offense 
and defense. Hart foes usually ran away from Allen's outside linebacker 
position. Still, he registered 120 tackles in two seasons. He intercepted six 
passes, returning two for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 He dominated. 
</P>
<P>
 The resume Allen brought to Westwood included first-team all-state honors by 
California Football magazine and first-team All-Southern Section two years in a 
row. The UCLA media guide claims Allen was "one of the nation's top tight ends 
in 1988 . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened? Why have the Bruins called on Allen only in short-yardage 
situations? Why has his best season (1993) produced only 15 receptions? 
</P>
<P>
 There are many factors. 
</P>
<P>
 1) After redshirting his first season, then spending his second as an 
understudy to Charles Arbuckle (now with the Indianapolis Colts), Allen saw 
Rick Daly step in as UCLA's starting tight end, taking the job Allen thought 
would be his. 
</P>
<P>
 2) A chronic lower back problem has limited Allen as a blocker, forcing the 
Bruins to platoon him. 
</P>
<P>
 3) With a recent history of big-play receivers (Mike Sherrard, Flipper 
Anderson, Scott Miller, Sean LaChapelle and Stokes), UCLA has not thrown to the 
tight end in several years. The fleet, sure-handed wide receivers make the big 
catches or spread defenses to set up the run. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest reason, said UCLA receivers coach Rick Neuheisel, is Allen's 
lack of size. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of high school, he was a terrific player, but he hasn't grown into what 
the Pac-10 tight end prototype is: 250 to 255 pounds," Neuheisel said. "Brian, 
at max, is 238 -- and that's probably too heavy. His natural weight would be 
225, 227. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's, in coaching vernacular, a tweener (small for a tight end, big for a 
split end). He's somewhere in between, and you have to design an offense around 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 But UCLA still saw enough potential in Allen to do just that last spring. Not 
only would the Bruins look to the veteran to pick up first downs, Allen was to 
become a go-to receiver in UCLA's hurry-up offense. Big receptions, long runs 
and touchdowns could result. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came Allen's worst setback: minor knee surgery in fall practice. 
Allen missed the first two games and didn't catch a pass until the fourth game 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "On top of everything, I guess you could say he's had some misfortune, too," 
Neuheisel said. "Brian, as a receiver, is very gifted. But he really just 
wasn't ever himself. It has not been the kind of senior year he had hoped for 
and that we had hoped for from him." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Allen: "(The injury) was minor, but it affected me a lot. I don't think I 
had my full strength until the USC game. The rest of the games I was going more 
on adrenalin." 
</P>
<P>
 In the final days of his career, Allen catches his touchdown passes at 
Spaulding Field while trying to block out the disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Allen's first reception at UCLA went for a touchdown against San 
Diego State. His second catch was the 23-yarder against Oregon State in '91. 
His most memorable score came later that season when he recovered a fumble in 
the end zone in UCLA's 24-21 victory over USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really satisfied with my career here," Allen said. "It hasn't been 
anything special. I envisioned myself really getting involved with the offense 
my last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I can't always wish for everything to go my way. I just play hard." 
</P>
<P>
 If Allen needs inspiration, he can turn to Neuheisel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, Neuheisel, a walk-on quarterback, emerged in his final season 
to lead the Bruins to the Rose Bowl, where he engineered UCLA's 45-9 victory 
over Illinois, passing for 298 yards and four touchdowns, and was named player 
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played one year at quarterback here," Neuheisel said. "I was here five 
years. People don't remember the first four -- they remember how the thing 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "So if Brian could have a great game Saturday, I think he'll look back and say 
it was a great career." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Allen: "I just want to catch all my passes and make sure I block solidly. 
</P>
<P>
 "A touchdown would be nice. I haven't had one in a while."

 Second baseman Roberto Alomar of the Toronto Blue Jays does not need surgery 
on his broken right leg and will probably be able to start spring training on 
time, team officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alomar, who broke the fibula during a winter league game in Puerto Rico on 
Wednesday, will be re-examined Monday to verify that an operation will not be 
required. 
</P>
<P>
 With no surgery, Alomar should be ready to work out in late February or early 
March.

 Lenny Dykstra, Philadelphia Phillie outfielder, and Pennsylvania state Sen. 
Earl Baker, of Chester County, got into a shouting match last week at a 
suburban restaurant and nearly came to blows over Dykstra's alleged use of foul 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker was having lunch on Dec. 22 with his wife, his secretary and an aide 
when two "scruffy" young men sat at the next table, according to Baker, who 
added: 
</P>
<P>
 "We started hearing these loud four-letter words." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said he turned to the men and said "in a loud and stern voice, 'Would 
you please watch your language?' So his (Dykstra's) reaction was to keep it up, 
even louder. So I turned to him again and said, 'I'm asking you again to please 
watch your language.' " 
</P>
<P>
 They then stood up and faced each other, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to come into a place like this, you owe it to other people to 
clean up your language," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to drop you, dude," Dykstra said, according to Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 The maitre d' stepped in and restrained both men. Jurisprudence

NADEAU AMAZES ON A LEAP OF FAITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a devout track and field fan for the past 20 years, I have attended 
numerous major meets and witnessed dozens of great performances at the Olympic 
and national championship level. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's hard to admit that one of my most indelible track memories is from a 
high school meet. On May 13, Jeff Nadeau of Monroe cleared a City Section high 
jump record of 7 feet 2 1/4 inches in the Valley Pac-8 Conference finals at 
Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadeau's mark hardly compares to some of the accomplishments I have witnessed, 
such as Steve Williams tying the world record of 9.9 seconds in the 100-meter 
dash in 1974 or Edwin Moses lowering the world record to 47.45 in the 400 
intermediate hurdles in 1977. Nor can it compare to Craig Virgin running a U.S. 
record of 27 minutes 39.4 seconds in the 10,000 meters in 1979 or to Carl Lewis 
winning four gold medals in the 1984 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
 But for sheer shock value, Nadeau's effort was superior to those performances. 
</P>
<P>
 A high school kid with a personal best of 6-8 -- and a season best of 6-6 -- 
isn't supposed to raise that mark by six-plus inches in one meet, but Nadeau 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 A high jumper of Nadeau's caliber measures his improvement an inch or so at a 
time, not in half-foot increments. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, no high jumper should be able to produce his best jumps after 
taking more than 15 attempts in the competition, yet Nadeau cleared his record 
height on his 24th jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing that Nadeau did early in the competition prepared me for what lay 
ahead as he began jumping at the relatively low height of 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 After clearing 6-0 on his first attempt, he did likewise at 6-1, 6-2, 6-4, 6-6 
and 6-8. 
</P>
<P>
 When it took him the maximum allotment of three tries to negotiate 6-9, I 
figured Nadeau would conclude the competition with three misses at 6-10, but 
things got interesting when he cleared that height on his third attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd began to direct its full attention to the high jump area, and the 
gregarious Nadeau fed off the electricity. When the crowd exploded in applause 
after he cleared 6-11 on his third try, Nadeau beamed. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7-0, 7-1 1/4 and 7-2 1/4, he continued a pattern that began at 6-9. In his 
first attempt, he didn't come close to clearing the bar, knocking it off on the 
way up. His second effort would be solid, however. He would lay himself out 
over the top of the bar before knocking it off with his thighs or calves. 
</P>
<P>
 His third attempt was so clean it looked as though he had been jumping at the 
7-foot level all season. "I guess I got kind of lucky," said Nadeau, who missed 
three times at 7-3 1/4. "I'm not sure what to say. I mean, I felt good today, 
but I would have been happy just to clear 6-9 or 6-10." 
</P>
<P>
 Although over the next month, Nadeau won the City (7-0), Golden West 
invitational (6-10) and state (7-2) titles, those efforts must take a back seat 
to what he accomplished in the Valley Pac-8 Conference meet that warm 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth is, it's hard to imagine Nadeau ever doing something that stunning 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless of course, he ends up competing for the Arizona track team -- Nadeau, a 
defensive back, is attending the school on a football scholarship -- and raises 
his personal best from 7-2 1/4 to 7-7 or 7-8 in a single meet. 
</P>
<P>
 I know what you're thinking. Ortega has lost his mind. How can someone who 
considers himself a track expert seriously pose such a far-fetched scenario? 
</P>
<P>
 And I have to admit, there's no way Nadeau could do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there?

NINETY-EIGHT DAYS OF LEGWORK WASTED, BUT AT LEAST HE WASN'T SCOOPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I knew I was in trouble when I started having dreams -- no, nightmares -- 
about Brad Fullmer. 
</P>
<P>
 They went something like this: I pick up a copy of the Daily News, read a 
headline that says, "Fullmer signs with Expos." The subhead: "Fletcher gets 
smoked." 
</P>
<P>
 I would wake up in a cold sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 Sick, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 We in the news-gathering business fear nothing more than the competition 
gathering more news. The reason the Brad Fullmer negotiations were such a 
headache to me was because the story seemed to last forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety-eight days, to be exact. One quarter of my year spent hanging on the 
whim of an 18-year-old kid. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullmer was a standout hitter last spring at Montclair Prep. Despite a strong 
commitment to play college baseball at Stanford and valid questions about the 
infielder's defensive abilities -- or lack thereof -- the Montreal Expos 
selected him in the second round of the June amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the fun began. 
</P>
<P>
 The three other area players drafted in the second round -- Hoover's Nate 
Dishington, Crespi's Jeff Suppan, and Newbury Park's David Lamb -- all signed 
by the end of the July, but Fullmer lingered.  
</P>
<P>
 And lingered. And lingered. 
</P>
<P>
 I talked to his father, Marv, about once a week. Conversations went something 
like this: 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff: "Hi, Marv, how's it going?"  
</P>
<P>
 Marv: "Fine. How about yourself?"  
</P>
<P>
 Jeff: "Oh, great. . . . Any news with Brad?"  
</P>
<P>
 Marv: "Nope. Nothing. We're in no hurry, you know."  
</P>
<P>
 Jeff: "I noticed."  
</P>
<P>
 This went on for months. There were rumors that he'd signed several times, but 
none were true. The talk was that the Fullmer family was asking for something 
in the $400,000 range, about twice what second-round picks can reasonably 
expect. 
</P>
<P>
 By late August, Fullmer had neither signed nor ended the negotiations. I went 
to San Diego to write a feature on the Area Code Games, a baseball drool-a-thon 
in which about 200 professional scouts show up to evaluate some of the West's 
best high school players, Class of 1994. Somewhere in the crowd was Scott 
Stanley, the Expos' scout who had been dealing with the Fullmers. 
</P>
<P>
 When I finally found Stanley -- and finding a particular scout at the Area 
Code Games is like finding a particular cornflake in a box of cereal -- I asked 
him about the Fullmer negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're close," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Close, it turned out, was a relative term. Three more weeks passed before 
anything happened. On Wednesday, Sept. 8, Stanley told me he was going to the 
Fullmers that night to present the Expos' final offer. 
</P>
<P>
 I called the Fullmer home several times that evening. "Sorry," they said, 
"we're still negotiating." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you reach an agreement by 10 o'clock," I said, "give me a call." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the latest we could have slipped the news under our deadline for the 
next day's paper. At 10 I had heard nothing, so I made a final call to the 
house. No answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out Fullmer had signed moments earlier. He didn't pick up his 
call-waiting to talk to me because he was on the phone making arrangements to 
go to West Palm Beach, Fla., where the Expos' instructional league team plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullmer had signed for $417,500 cash, plus about $100,000 for college. He 
proudly announced it the next day to me and the Daily News and anyone else who 
cared. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months of legwork had gone down the drain. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullmer probably didn't care about my problems, and I don't really blame him. 
He, after all, was rich, having just accepted the largest bonus ever paid to a 
second-round pick. The wait was obviously worthwhile to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "So," I asked Fullmer the day after he signed, "are you glad this is all 
over?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yep," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That made two of us, except I didn't have $417,500.

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; IT WAS A YEAR TRACKS WILL EASILY FORGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Racing's year ended with a seven-alarm fire in New Orleans at the Fair 
Grounds, the third-oldest track, and then there were a couple of media Eclipse 
Awards endemic of the sport: The best photograph was of Greenwood, a Toronto 
track that has been shuttered after 119 years; and the best local television 
reporting was about Longacres, a suburban Seattle track that's also no more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fair Grounds will re-open soon, but there will be more Greenwoods and 
Longacreses in racing's future. Stepping into this industry chasm later this 
month will be a newly appointed commissioner of racetracks, who will be no more 
a commissioner than Fay Vincent now is. The new Thoroughbred Racing Assns. 
commissioner, reportedly someone with an Olympic background, will have an 
office in New York City. The president of the TRA has an office in Oklahoma 
City, Okla., and the executive vice president has an office in Elkton, Md. And 
if the new commissioner comes in with a three-year contract, he may spend the 
first two merely learning what organizations such as the HBPA, AHC, ARCI and 
TOBA actually are. 
</P>
<P>
 He will not have to research ACRS, the American Championship Racing Series, 
which was one of 1993's casualties. Cause of death: bailouts by some of the 
biggest tracks, including Santa Anita and Oaklawn Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a quick look at the rest of the year that was: 
</P>
<P>
 January -- Santa Anita had its rainiest season in 15 years, and because of an 
outmoded state law wound up under-promoting its races to remain in a more 
favorable tax bracket. . . . Steve Cauthen rejected a pay cut from the holder 
of his English riding contract, Sheik Mohammed, and then retired. . . . Kent 
Desormeaux, after suffering serious injuries in a spill at Hollywood Park six 
weeks before, returned to action with two victories at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 February -- Getting 237 of 278 votes, A.P. Indy was elected horse of the year 
for 1992. . . . Nine days after being hospitalized with a heart attack, Gary

trainer Bill Shoemaker and his family between $1 million and $2.5 million in a 
settlement of a lawsuit. Shoemaker was left paralyzed from the neck down in a 
1991 auto accident. . . . Dennis Hutcheson was fired as executive secretary of 
the California Horse Racing Board, charged with mishandling three 
horse-drugging cases in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 March -- Gilded Time was eliminated from the Kentucky Derby because of a hoof 
injury. . . . Sir Beaufort won the Santa Anita Handicap, giving trainer Charlie 
Whittingham his ninth victory in the stake. . . . Bull Inthe Heather, at 29-1, 
won the Florida Derby. . . . Eddie Delahoussaye rode his 5,000th career winner. 
. . . Hall of Fame jockey Eric Guerin died at 69. . . . River Special was taken 
out of the Kentucky Derby because of a leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
 April -- Personal Hope won the Santa Anita Derby. . . . Kotashaan won the San 
Juan Capistrano Handicap in track-record time. . . . Charlie Whittingham turned 
80 and said that he's saving the big celebration for No. 100. . . . Prairie 
Bayou won the Blue Grass Stakes. . . . Rockamundo, at 108-1, won the Arkansas 
Derby. . . . Jockey Eddie Delahoussaye, trainer Tommy Kelly and horses 
Alysheba, Personal Ensign and Cavalcade were elected into the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 May -- Sea Hero won the Kentucky Derby for owner Paul Mellon, 85, and trainer 
Mack Miller, 71. . . . Bob Strub, 74, died after a battle with Lou Gehrig's 
disease. . . . On the same day that Prairie Bayou won the Preakness, Genuine 
Risk, winner of the 1980 Kentucky Derby, delivered her first foal, a colt sired 
by Rahy who was named Genuine Reward . . . . Union City was destroyed after 
breaking down in the Preakness. . . . Maryland trainer King Leatherbury saddled 
his 5,000th winner. 
</P>
<P>
 June -- Julie Krone, riding Colonial Affair, became the first female jockey to 
win the Belmont Stakes. . . . Prairie Bayou suffered fatal injuries in the 
race. . . . Strike the Gold, winner of the 1991 Kentucky Derby, was retired to 
stud. 
</P>
<P>
 July -- Best Pal won the Hollywood Gold Cup. . . . Personal Hope was injured 
at Hollywood Park and retired. . . . Riding at Hollywood, Gary Stevens went

and Colonial Affair. 
</P>
<P>
 October -- Jockey Ron Hansen was missing after his abandoned car was found 
following an accident on the San Mateo Bridge. . . . Trainer Shug McGaughey had 
a record day, winning five stakes at Belmont Park, one of them with Miner's 
Mark in the Jockey Club Gold Cup.  
</P>
<P>
 November -- Arcangues, the French horse at 133-1, won the Classic, and the 
other Breeders' Cup winners before 55,130 at Santa Anita were Kotashaan, Lure, 
Hollywood Wildcat, Brocco, Phone Chatter and Cardmania. . . . Hall of Fame 
trainer Mesh Tenney died at 85. . . . Legacy World won the Japan Cup, with Kent 
Desormeaux, riding runner-up Kotashaan, misjudging the finish line.  
</P>
<P>
 December -- Mike Smith, riding at Aqueduct, registered his 61st stakes

BURDETT'S CANDOR MAKES TAP-DANCE UNNECESSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I remember the waiter standing at our table, pad and pencil poised, just as 
Steve Burdett was breaking the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all," Burdett said with only the hint of a shrug, "I'm gay." 
</P>
<P>
 I turned to our server: "We'll need a couple of minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, I was floored by Burdett's candor. I considered this a sensitive 
subject. And I had entered the interview uneasily, knowing the conversation 
would focus on a man's sexual orientation -- uncharted territory, as far as my 
reporting experience was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdett wasn't trying to shock anyone; he was just being himself. But that was 
something new to him. Just as this story was new to me. 
</P>
<P>
 In an open letter in the Saugus Speedway racing program in August, Burdett, a 
30-year-old driver in the track's Sportsman division, had revealed that he had 
tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. And although it was not 
mentioned in the letter, Burdett had begun to admit to his racing competitors 
that he is homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdett desperately wanted to tell his story. And I was eager to listen. This 
was a belt-high fastball of a story and I wanted to knock it out of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 When I spotted Burdett's letter, I recalled a conversation at a staff meeting 
months earlier in which we discussed the prospect of one day encountering this 
kind of story: a homosexual athlete trapped in the macho world of sports. 
Should he stand up and be accepted for who he is or remain huddled in secrecy? 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the numerous stories we write about high school quarterbacks who 
can fling a football 60 yards, this one would require a soft touch, a bit of 
tap-dancing around sensitive subject matter. Or so I thought. 
</P>
<P>
 What I will remember most about Burdett -- even more than his courage -- is 
his refreshingly forthright attitude. In this business, getting a source to 
speak candidly, especially about personal matters, can be about as easy as 
pulling a molar. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparing for the interview, worrying about how I might phrase certain 
questions, I completely missed Burdett's point: Be honest and straightforward. 
He wanted me to tell it like it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdett casually sipped cold beer from a bottle as he recounted how he 
believed he had contracted the virus, how he had feared going public with his 
homosexuality and how his life had changed in the 2 1/2 years since he first 
became ill. Burdett does not have AIDS but he often is fatigued by the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's OK," he said. "I am who I am. I'm not going to continue my life 
pretending I'm someone I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
 For most of his life, Burdett could not admit to himself that he was gay. And 
no one had reason to suspect that he was. He worked as a mechanic and drove a 
fast car. "Being a race-car driver," he said, "was a good cover." 
</P>
<P>
 All that began to change when he contracted the HIV virus. He slowly came to 
terms with his sexual identity. But that was only part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 When rumors about Burdett began to swirl, he was faced with a challenge. The 
racing world is "pretty much made up of a bunch of rednecks," said Pat Mintey 
Jr., one of Burdett's friends and competitors. Burdett, the son of a race-car 
driver, knew that all too well. He wasn't about to confide in his peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the weight on his shoulders was enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdett became so depressed he began to take evening drives to the beach, 
where he would stand atop a cliff and contemplate jumping. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one would miss me," he would say softly to himself. What made him want to 
live? 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked myself, 'What do I want to do with the rest of my life?' " Burdett 
said. "And I decided the biggest thing I could do is stand up and come forward. 
Let's get rid of the hiding from (AIDS), the it-can't-happen-to-me attitude. 
All that is what's causing this epidemic to spread. I'm not trying to be a 
celebrity. I just think that (promoting) openness is the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 For that, I admired Burdett, and I told him so. I also thanked him for making 
my job easier. 
</P>
<P>
 The reporting and writing went more smoothly than I could have imagined. And I 
basked in compliments when the story was reprinted in the Times' Washington, 
D.C., edition. 
</P>
<P>
 But my satisfaction was nothing compared to Burdett's. 
</P>
<P>
 His phone began to ring. Another publication wanted his story. A local news 
station featured him during its nightly newscast. Mail poured in. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdett phoned me to offer his appreciation. "Gee, I'm on the front page," he 
said. "Wait till my family sees this." 
</P>
<P>
 He sounded like a kid about to dash home with the best report card of his 
life. He didn't have to carry that burden any longer.

SAVANNA WRESTLERS PULL TOGETHER IN HARD TIMES; HIGH SCHOOL: AFTER TOM CASPARI 
RESIGNED AS COACH, KEN STEGALL LEADS THE REBELS TO A 9-0 START. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's trying to decide what it wants to be when it grows up. The hitch is that 
it hasn't much time, the course of the 1993-94 wrestling season, to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is a season of transition for the Savanna wrestling team. The program 
features a new coach, new attitude, and, over the summer, a new low. 
</P>
<P>
 When former Savanna Coach Tom Caspari resigned suddenly in June, the program 
lost a huge part of its identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the summer, we didn't know what was happening, we were all confused," 
said senior Randy Bowers, Savanna's 125-pound wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Danny Torres, who has compiled a 13-2 record at 103, was convinced the 
Rebels wouldn't even field a wrestling team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we'd break up. I thought everyone would just give up on each 
other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If they didn't give up, they might as well have quit, was the early contention 
of senior tri-captain Teak Sato, who felt the team would be so bad it would 
embarrass itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we'd be terrible, just so awful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps in the most unsettling change of all, the Rebels are under a new and 
uncomfortable scrutiny. They feel they're being watched for all the wrong 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the season, coaches around the county believed Savanna would be a 
contender, if . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally Savanna's good, it just depends on how they respond to the 
coaching changes," coaches echoed before the season. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the response has been mixed. Savanna, although undefeated (9-0), with 
victories over Kennedy and a championship effort in the Rio Mesa Tournament, is 
unranked. The wrestlers said they're on a mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people said because of the Caspari thing, we wouldn't be focused," 
Torres said. "I had my doubts in the beginning how good we'd be, but people are 
going hard. I'm pumped up." As is Bowers: "A lot of people lost faith in us, so 
we're out to prove ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Problem is, they aren't sure how to accomplish that mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Sato said the team lacks unity and a strong work ethic. Sato has agonized over 
whether he should focus on himself or on the team and is considering a team 
meeting to discuss ways to bring the Rebels closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year everyone liked each other and no one argued," he said. "This year 
you don't think about the team as much as you think about yourself. Some days 
we're real disciplined and some days we're not. We know we have potential, but 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ken Stegall, who wrestled at Cypress College and won a State title at 
191 in 1990, and second-year assistant James Lopez, are doing their best to 
mold the talent successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some floaters," said Lopez, "but most people have been stepping it 
up. We were a little disjointed when the season first started, but after we 
beat Kennedy, that gave everyone a lot of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 That confidence was earned the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
 Caspari had coached Savanna for six years and was well-respected by the 
wrestling community and by his team. The Rebels' won the Southern Section 
Division 3-A title in 1991 and won or shared four consecutive Orange League 
championships under his auspices. 
</P>
<P>
 Caspari's sudden resignation caught the team off guard and hit it hard. 
Wrestlers said they were confused and angered over the episode: confused about 
how they should answer their own questions and those of curious opponents, and 
angered at the accusers and at Caspari, who they said never said goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 Sato, a State finalist at 130 and recent weight-class winner of the Orange 
County Holiday Classic, said several teammates have yet to come to grips about 
what happened and admitted they might never. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people felt he dogged us, 'cause one day he left in his car and that 
was the last we saw of him," Sato said. "But he couldn't tell us anything. We 
can't say what he should or shouldn't have done. Guys on the team have 
different views (of what happened), but it doesn't divide us, probably because 
no one will ever know the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 School counselors met with the team to talk about Caspari and to help them 
sort their feelings. But counseling couldn't replace what Caspari left behind. 
For some, he was much more than a coach. For Sato, he was a confidant and a 
counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he left, I got scared," Sato said. "He was the guy that told us what our 
goals could be, what our priorities should be. He helped us with everything, 
like picking the classes we needed for college. He talked to us about getting 
along with our girlfriends and family. Things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The process of replacing Caspari was almost as traumatic as losing him. 
Applicants came and went. One coach accepted then declined the job. Finally, 
Stegall filled the position only a month before the season began. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ken saw how good (Caspari) was," Sato said. "But you can't take over 
someone's job and be better right away." 
</P>
<P>
 Stegall, 23, doesn't expect to replace or do better than Caspari, not 
immediately anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I worried about was getting the kids ready for this season," Stegall 
said. "They seemed a little rebellious at first, but now that the season's 
coming along, it's getting better. They know what to expect from me and I know 
what to expect from them." 
</P>
<P>
 And in the process, everyone's growing up.

BLAIR GETS A BOOST FROM THE STANDS; SPEEDSKATING: SHE CITES PRESENCE OF 
ADVERSARY AS INCENTIVE AND POSTS IMPRESSIVE RESULTS IN OLYMPIC QUALIFYING 
EVENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Her recent times in the 500-meter sprint weren't up to her standards, and in 
general, three-time Olympic gold medalist Bonnie Blair simply had the blahs. 
</P>
<P>
 All it took to cure her was knowing that Qiabo Ye of China, who had edged her 
out of the world sprint championship last February, was watching her from the 
stands Friday in the first day of the U.S. long-track speedskating trials at 
the Pettit National Ice Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for the most part that anytime I get into an area where I have very 
strong competitors, it makes me compete harder," Blair said after winning the 
first 500 heat in a track-record 39.92 seconds. "If anything, her being here is 
going to be a benefit to me instead of the opposite." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair also skated the 1,500 meters in a track-record 2:06.50.  
</P>
<P>
 Dan Jansen, world record-holder in the 500, tied a record at the year-old 
track with a time of 36.42, but was sluggish in his 1,500 heat and was third at 
1:57.47. Brian Wanek had the day's fastest time, 1:57.28. 
</P>
<P>
 Each race is repeated at least once, with the slowest result discarded. Times 
are converted into points to determine who will qualify for the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair, the only woman to win consecutive Olympic gold medals in the 500, 
openly disapproves of Ye, who tested positive for steroids at the 1988 world 
sprint championships and was sent home from the '88 Calgary Olympics. Although 
Ye maintains that she took the drugs unknowingly, on the advice of the team 
doctor, Blair has said she believes Ye still takes performance-enhancing 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
 They were never the best of friends, said Ye, who is in Milwaukee to train for 
a World Cup event this month, "but we would say, 'Hello, good race,' if she won 
or if I won." They no longer speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bonnie said I still use doping. I was angry," said Ye, who was second to 
Blair in the 500 and 1,000 at the 1992 Albertville Winter Olympics. "After 
that, I don't like her anymore. She is a very good skater, even now. Such a 
long time she has had successful seasons, and I was proud of her, too. . . . I 
don't like people to recall such bad things. It makes you sad again." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Blair: "I've never been in favor of what she has done. As (for) being 
friends with her, I look at it as a situation that if somebody does something I 
don't approve of, I don't go overboard to associate myself with them because 
that makes me look bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair's coach, Nick Thometz, credited Ye's presence with spurring Blair to her 
best performance in weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "She might not want to go out and not skate well in front of one of her main 
competitors," Thometz said. "There's not a whole lot of women in the world who 
can skate (the 500 meters) under 40, so for her to do it here sends a real 
message." 
</P>
<P>
 Ye has yet to regain full strength in her left knee after an operation in 
August to repair damaged ligaments and cartilage. "This is my last season, so I 
will do my very, very best," Ye said, "but if I do very bad, if I just get 
fifth or sixth in the World Cup and sprint (championships) in Calgary, I don't 
think I go to the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen and his coach, Peter Mueller, complained that the brittle ice 
conditions hurt Jansen's ability to accelerate coming out of turns in the 
1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't skate very well today -- my 500 was OK," said Jansen, who set the 
world record of 35.92 last month. "I've been having trouble getting healthy. I 
had a fever Wednesday night. It is time to get into racing mode, and I think 
that will happen naturally with the World Cup coming. I need to skate well and 
feel good during these races for my confidence. If I skate a first turn like I 
did today, it's not going to help my head."

HUFFMAN-TITAN CASE ENTERS NEW ARENA; JURISPRUDENCE: BOTH SIDES OFFERING 
NUMEROUS DEPOSITIONS TO SUPPORT ARGUMENTS IN FORMER COACH'S WRONGFUL 
TERMINATION SUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Jim Huffman's wrongful termination suit against Cal State Fullerton goes 
to trial, the school will argue he was fired as Titan women's volleyball coach 
because he didn't do his job very well. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffman's attorneys will rely heavily on depositions that are seen as 
supporting their contention that he was terminated simply because some 
administrators considered him a pain in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is scheduled to begin Monday in Orange County Superior Court. The 
$1.2-million suit alleges Huffman was fired March 23, 1992, in retaliation 
"because he spoke out about illegalities in the CSUF athletic department and 
initiated successful legal proceedings, which resulted in negative publicity to 
the school and its administrators." 
</P>
<P>
 The firing came one working day after a judge signed a preliminary injunction 
blocking the school's attempt to drop volleyball Jan. 28, 1992. Huffman and his 
players had filed suit alleging the move violated state sex discrimination 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton permanently reinstated volleyball as part of a settlement the 
following May, but Huffman, whose teams were 25-80 during his three years as 
coach, was not rehired. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Gerry, state deputy attorney general who is representing the school, 
said in an interview the decision to fire Huffman was made in December, 1991, 
before Huffman and the team filed the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry listed the team's poor performance, both on the court and in the 
classroom, minor NCAA violations during Huffman's tenure and Huffman's 
substandard fund-raising as primary reasons Huffman's contract was not renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman's attorneys will contend evidence taken in depositions shows 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 In one, former Fullerton Associate Athletic Director Steve DiTolla said that 
at a March 20, 1992, meeting, Jack Bedell, the university's associate vice 
president for academic affairs, "made a recommendation that we terminate Jim 
immediately. And the termination was based upon the months of trouble that were 
caused by Jim." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to recall the exact words Bedell used, DiTolla said: "The gist was 
something along the lines of, 'We need to get rid of that so and so as quickly 
as possible.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Shumard, Titan athletic director, and Maryalyce Jeremiah, Titan associate 
athletic director, also were at that meeting but claim in depositions that they 
"didn't remember" Bedell making such a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the four people at that meeting, DiTolla is the only one who says anything 
at all like that took place," Gerry said. "Ironically, DiTolla is also a former 
Cal State Fullerton employee whose appointment was not renewed by Shumard." 
</P>
<P>
 In his deposition, Bedell claimed that "nobody ever in my presence, including 
myself, has ever expressed what I would consider anger about Mr. Huffman." 
</P>
<P>
 But asked what he thought of the decision to terminate Huffman at that time, 
Bedell said: "It was stupid . . . I thought the timing sucked, and that it 
could make the university look bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard said in depositions that the volleyball team's poor cumulative 
grade-point average (1.99) contributed to Huffman's firing. Jared Huffman, 
Jim's brother and San Francisco-based attorney, said fall semester grades 
weren't calculated until late December or early January of that school year, 
after the school says the decision was made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it true that you didn't know about this 1.99 team GPA until Jan. 29, 
1992?" Huffman asked Shumard in his deposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Replied Shumard: "That could have been. That could have been." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard went on to say that study hall reports and regular academic checks of 
volleyball players during the fall of 1991 had showed unsatisfactory progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "The actual GPA was not available until after the decision regarding Huffman 
had been made," Gerry said, "but there is a good amount of academic information 
available to both Shumard and Jeremiah during the course of that fall 
semester." 
</P>
<P>
 The last of Huffman's three one-year contracts officially expired Dec. 31, 
1991, but Huffman continued working through January under the assumption that, 
like the two previous years, his contract would be renewed in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman's suit alleges that, shortly before the announcement the program was 
being dropped, Shumard helped Huffman secure a long-term lease through a CSUF 
program that obtains donated or leased cars for coaches and chose Huffman as 
the "coaches representative" for an athletic department fund-raiser in May, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why send him to the NCAA (volleyball) Final Four in December to recruit and 
network, why let him recruit in January, schedule club and recreational 
volleyball activities for the rest of the year, why do all these things if 
you're going to fire him?" Jared Huffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key point is not a word was mentioned to anyone about firing Jim Huffman 
until March 20, the day the court granted the preliminary injunction. There's 
not a single thing in writing to support their claim that they made the 
decision to terminate in the fall of 1991." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gerry says the school determined at that time it would not offer Huffman a 
new contract, then delayed any announcement after deciding in late December to 
drop volleyball. It took about a month for that move to be approved, and Gerry 
said the school retained Huffman in an effort to help preserve his reputation 
and make it easier for him to find another coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a courtesy to the coach, his non-renewal was explained that since the 
program was being terminated, we don't have a position for you," Gerry said. 
"That would help the plaintiff move on in his career, land another job without 
having to explain a (firing). They wanted to handle it so the coach and 
university would come out in a positive light." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gerry said those intentions went awry when Huffman filed suit and won 
reinstatement of the volleyball team. The March 20 injunction did not require 
Fullerton to retain the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The following Monday, Huffman was fired. "Then, when they realized they would 
have a wrongful termination suit, they came up with all these reasons," Jared 
Huffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jared Huffman also claims the California State University system tried to 
cover up potentially damaging evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 While representing the National Organization for Women in its recent gender 
equity suit against the CSU system, Huffman received a copy of a Feb. 12, 1993, 
memo from Anne Padilla, assistant director of governmental affairs for the CSU 
Board of Trustees, to Scott Plotkin, director of governmental affairs, 
regarding gender equity. 
</P>
<P>
 But one paragraph of the memo was whited out. Huffman asked the court to order 
the defense to produce the original document, which Huffman received Dec. 24. 
The restored paragraph referred to a discussion between Padilla and Catherine 
Wynne, a Fullerton campus attorney, concerning the Fullerton situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The paragraph read, in part: "Catherine also said that we were very vulnerable 
on this court case, mostly because of the way the coach was fired. Catherine 
sees the issues as separable; the firing of the volleyball coach was 
justifiable because of the team's losing record. The abolishment of the 
volleyball team, however, left us open to the gender equity complaint. The fact 
that the team was cut before the coach was fired tied the two cases together 
and muddled the issue. We reinstated the team, but did not rehire the coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jared Huffman: "They blotted it out because they knew it was damaging." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gerry: "I respect their opinion and their right to make (this document) 
an issue, but in no way was there retaliation on account of Huffman having 
expressed his opinion regarding gender equity. From Cal State Fullerton's 
perspective, this is a job-performance decision not to renew the appointment of 
a temporary, part-time employee." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to $1.2 million in general and special damages, Huffman is seeking 
punitive damages and attorneys fees, which have risen above $100,000. Bedell, 
Shumard, CSUF President Milton Gordon, CSU Chancellor Barry Munitz and the CSU 
Board of Trustees are listed as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Jared Huffman said he made an offer this past fall to settle the case for 
"less than $500,000." The defense, he said, countered with an offer "that was 
frankly an insult."

AN OPEN LETTER TO L.A.; TRIAL BY FIRE; THE COURTROOMS WERE THE CENTERS OF 
ATTENTION FOR MUCH OF THE YEAR. BUT APOCALYPTIC FIRES AND THE ELECTION OF A NEW 
MAYOR ALSO GOT OUR ATTENTION. WE GOT OUR FIRST SUBWAY AND PROBABLY OUR LAST 
FREEWAY. AND A FIGHT TO SAVE THE VENICE DUCKS FAILED, BUT DISNEY GAVE US THE 
MIGHTY DUCKS.

<P>
 Dear Friends: 
</P>
<P>
 Happy Holidays and amen!!! 
</P>
<P>
 Can you believe how much we've accomplished this year? We held three really 
big trials, made an international celebrity out of an alleged madam, gave 
President Clinton the best haircut he'll ever see -- on the airport Tarmac, no 
less -- installed a new mayor for the first time in 20 years, elected an openly 
gay City Council member for the first time and snuffed out apocalyptic fires 
(with the help of firefighters from across the Western states. Thanks guys and 
gals!) 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers really stunk up the place (at least until season's end, when they 
played spoiler to the hated San Francisco Giants); in fact, the biggest story 
out of Dodger Stadium involved a New York Met who threw a firecracker at a 
little kid. But how about those Kings! They advanced to the Stanley Cup 
championships for the first time after 909 losses in 26 years. (That's right, 
the same Los Angeles Kings who are now, only months later, stinking up the 
place.) 
</P>
<P>
 It really has been quite a busy year for us, what with running back and forth 
between courtrooms -- the second Rodney G. King beating trial, the Reginald O. 
Denny beating trial and those Menendez boys! Shotgun murders, confessions to a 
psychiatrist, emotional abuse at a tennis match -- so many mysteries to 
unravel. But what we're really wondering is, where did Lyle get that toupee? 
We're not sure if they're guilty or innocent, but we thought we could spot a 
rug a mile off. Who knows what to believe anymore? 
</P>
<P>
 The jury is still sorting that case out. But we closed the book on the King 
beating trial. The jury rendered its verdicts -- two police officers convicted 
and two acquitted -- and the city took the news in stride as ex-officers Stacey 
Koon and Laurence Powell headed to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Denny beating trial also came to a close. The case of that trucker pulled 
from his rig at the outset of the 1992 riots became a symbol of that scary time 
of unrest. The whole episode left us with lasting memories. It turned out that 
one of the defense attorneys listed on his resume a trip to Mars. (Fortunately 
for his client, he was replaced before the trial got started.) But what a 
moment it was when Denny leaned across a courtroom pew and hugged the mother of 
the man accused of beating him. 
</P>
<P>
 Who says we're all trying to kill each other out here? Of course, the 
sequestered jurors almost did kill each other before convicting Damian Williams 
and Henry Keith Watson. (The other two defendants pleaded guilty.) One juror 
was dismissed when the forewoman decided she was in "the Twilight Zone" and 
another ran down the corridor screaming for the boyfriend she hadn't seen in 
days. Somehow, we all knew how she felt. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, the city was infested with several uninvited pests, 
including Medflies and more mayoral candidates than Baskin-Robbins has flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Bradley bowed out after five terms as mayor of Los Angeles and 52 people 
lined up to take his place, including frizzy-haired street corner dancer 
Melrose Larry Green and a lawyer so desperate for publicity that he held an 
underwater news conference and nearly drowned. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a dizzying campaign but in the end, mega-rich attorney/businessman 
Richard Riordan bested them all. In his scant six months in office, he is 
clearly heading in the right direction, particularly when it comes to LAX, 
where he envisions Starbucks-style coffee and a public address system that 
features Frank Sinatra singing "Come Fly With Me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hizzoner, an avid cyclist, is really not in bad shape for 63, although he 
tried jogging with President Clinton in Washington and pooped out before the 
first mile. It might have been embarrassing had he not hopped a Secret Service 
van and caught up with the commander-in-chief just in time to have his picture 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
 There were plenty of other beginnings and endings around L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 The beloved Central Library reopened, more glorious than ever, seven years 
after a disastrous fire nearly destroyed it. We threw a weeklong block party to 
celebrate! 
</P>
<P>
 We got our first subway -- the Red Line -- and probably our last freeway -- 
the Century. A Museum of Tolerance opened along with the renovated Venice 
Canals and the Colorado Street Bridge in Pasadena. But in a league of its own 
is our newly expanded Convention Center -- with 24-foot-high doors big enough 
for tractor-trailers to drive right onto the floor! 
</P>
<P>
 But alas, we also lost an Art Deco retail landmark, the Bullocks Wilshire 
department store (the one where William Randolph Hearst used to buy his 
swimwear). Across the street, the Sheraton-Town House also closed (the one 
where Howard Hughes and Elizabeth Taylor used to stay -- not together, though. 
Liz was there with Nicky Hilton.) 
</P>
<P>
 And the chandelier fell for the last time on "Phantom of the Opera," our most 
commercially successful theatrical presentation ever. It closed after 1,772 
shows. (Almost as many games as the Dodgers lost! Just kidding.) 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and the drought also ended. Did it ever! We got 27 inches of rain -- 
double the usual amount. 
</P>
<P>
 But not even the rain could clean up Hollywood, which had quite a year what 
with deaths, lawsuits and a couple of sex scandals. The year began badly enough 
when the glamour capital of the world lost its landmark neon Coke sign. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an off year for Pepsi, too. (And we don't mean those wild claims of 
needles in the cans.) No doubt you've heard -- who hasn't? -- that the 
company's celebrity spokesman, Michael Jackson, has been caught up in a child 
molestation investigation that has turned into an international incident. The 
Jackson family remains as close as ever -- OK, his sister and his ex-maid seem 
to have turned on him. But the inquiry continues. Stay tuned for next year's 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a jury soaked Kim Basinger for $8.9 million after she reneged on an 
oral agreement to appear in the film "Boxing Helena." (Who could blame her? The 
movie was about a woman injured in a car accident who is rescued by a surgeon 
who amputates her arms and legs and puts her in a box hoping she will fall in 
love with him.) 
</P>
<P>
 Another jury put an end to that nine-year tiff between Elke Sommer and Zsa Zsa 
Gabor. It started when Zsa Zsa suggested that Elke was a bald-headed Hollywood 
has-been who hangs out in seedy bars and has to sell hand-knitted sweaters to 
eke out a living. Elke countered that Zsa Zsa's derriere was so fat that it 
would take three or four strong men to lift her onto a horse. The jury sided 
with Elke, awarding her $3.2 million. Guess she won't need to be knitting any 
sweaters for awhile! 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, you gotta love this town. Where else could a 115-pound alleged madam to 
the stars get arrested for pandering while taking out the trash and wind up 
with her own line of lingerie? In between, Heidi Fleiss had 
gazillion-dollar-a-year studio executives quaking in their BMWs over whether or 
not their names were in her little black book (which, by the way, was not a 
black book at all but a collection of Gucci day planners). 
</P>
<P>
 We don't want to brag, but there were other momentous developments around 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Practically the whole town of Venice turned out to keep the state from killing 
a bunch of poor diseased ducks. They lost the crusade, unfortunately for the 
ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 But we have more ducks to take their place. Disney hatched a new hockey team, 
the Mighty Ducks (home arena: The Pond in Anaheim), and L.A. County Supervisor 
Ed Edelman retired after five terms, rendering himself a lame duck. Ha-ha! 
</P>
<P>
 So, as '93 comes to a close, we are all breathing a little easier. Turns out 
we met the federal standard for nitrogen dioxide for the first time! Or was it 
carbon monoxide? Or was it ozone? Oh well. Our City Council also cleaned up the 
air by banning smoking in restaurants! 
</P>
<P>
 And we can all be thankful that the killer bees have not arrived. Yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope the holidays find you and yours out of debt and out of jail . . . we're 
out of news! 
</P>
<P>
 Until next year, 
</P>
<P>
 Your pals in the City of the Angels

YEAR IN REVIEW; A HELL OF A PLACE TO HAVE A HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Autumn firestorms swept across Southern California, burning an epic path of 
destruction in less than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a single day, Oct. 27, separate fires raged in Thousand Oaks, Chatsworth, 
the hills of Altadena and the balmy palm-lined streets of Laguna Beach. Less 
than a week later, on Nov. 2, a fire blazed from the rolling hills of Calabasas 
and Malibu to Topanga Canyon and over to Pacific Coast Highway, flinging 
golf-ball-size embers across the road toward oceanfront homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of natural disaster is part of the unwritten contract of living 
here, but in many cases it was an unholy alliance of dry winds and arson that 
set the region ablaze. The two largest fires, those in Malibu and Laguna Beach, 
were determined to have been set. In total, as many as 19 of the 26 fires that 
struck six Southern California counties are believed to be of suspicious origin 
or arson. On the second day of the Calabasas-Malibu fire, Gov. Pete Wilson 
stood on Pacific Coast Highway, with fires still burning in Topanga Canyon, and 
was moved to compare arson to child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhoods and the names varied but the stories were the same: 
residents watching in alarm as fires advanced on their neighborhoods, then 
rushing to pack up loved ones, treasured belongings and animals. In one 
Altadena neighborhood full of stables, people hurried down the smoke-filled 
street with their horses, bridles in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 As fire swept across Malibu and into Topanga Canyon, it turned Pacific Coast 
Highway, virtually the only road out, into a panicked gridlock of cars as 
residents either fled with possessions and loved ones or raced home to retrieve 
them.  
</P>
<P>
 And there were residents, like townspeople holding off an avenging army, who 
stood their ground -- to the dismay of many firefighters -- as if they could 
wrestle the flames into extinction. They hopped onto their roofs and turned 
water hoses on their homes and those of their neighbors, refusing to leave 
until the fire was upon them and, even then, they did not always leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Some claimed success. Others did not. Screenwriter Duncan Gibbins, fleeing his 
home in Topanga Canyon, went back into the inferno frantically searching for 
his beloved Siamese cat, Elsa. Gibbins suffered severe burns and died the next 
day, the same day that Elsa was found singed but alive. Hundreds of people 
called offering to adopt the cat.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of the firestorms, legions of firefighters -- nearly 10,000 -- 
fought the blazes, sometimes in 24-hour shifts. Joining city and county 
firefighters were others from across the state and the West, some of whom drove 
hours on their rigs to get here. Residents showered them with their gratitude 
in the form of food, coffee, a place on a beachfront deck to rest -- and 
occasionally a shower. 
</P>
<P>
 When the fires were finally contained, 1,241 structures were lost, 197,225 
acres had burned, and $1 billion worth of damage had been done. Three people, 
all from Topanga Canyon, lost their lives. Movie star Sean Penn was left with 
one less house and the homeless who camped out under cover of shrubs in Malibu 
were worse off than before. 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks, residents were forced to turn their attention to protecting 
their hillsides from the threat of rain-triggered mudslides. But the hills are 
being reseeded, and before neighborhoods had stopped smoldering, people were 
remaking their lives and their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at this property!" said Frank Morgan as he stood in the ashes of his 
Carbon Mesa Road home two days after it had burned and as he surveyed the 
spectacular view, the only thing left that the fire did not take. "If this 
isn't a place to have a house I don't know where is."

NUMBER OF CHURCH-GOING TEEN-AGERS ON THE RISE; POLL: IN REVERSAL OF TREND, MORE 
THAN HALF OF GROUP ATTENDED WEEKLY WORSHIP SERVICES THIS YEAR. BUT THE INCREASE 
STILL LEAVES A BIG GAP WITH 1989 FIGURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE GALLUP JR. and ROBERT BEZILLA, PRINCETON RELIGION RESEARCH CENTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On any given weekend this past year, half of America's teen-agers could be 
found in a house of worship. That signals a reverse of a short-term trend -- a 
drop in churchgoing by teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallup youth polls show that attendance dropped to 48% of teen-agers in 1991, 
and then decreased even more, to 45%, in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the new gain leaves a wide gap between the numbers of churchgoing 
teen-agers this year and in 1989, when attendance levels for the age group 
reached a record high of 57% in a typical week. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance has averaged slightly higher than 50% since 1977, the year the 
Gallup Youth Survey began taking measurements. During the same period, 41% of 
adults reported going to a church or synagogue in a given week. 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear that church attendance is one of those areas in which adults tell 
teen-agers, "Do as I say, not as I do." Undoubtedly, some worship is heavily 
influenced, if not demanded, by parents. 
</P>
<P>
 But a 1988 study found that a majority (61%) of teen-agers said they went to 
church solely because they wanted to. Twenty-four percent reported a dual 
reason: They wanted to go, and they knew it would please their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 As teen-agers grow older, they have a tendency to attend church less. Church 
attendance is a part of life for 54% of those between 13 and 15, but only for 
44% of those 16 and older. A 1988 Gallup study of the religious practices of 
college students found that 34% attended church weekly. An additional 18% went 
at least monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, young people have tended to attend church less frequently during 
their later teen-age years, college years and early adulthood. But attendance 
and membership revives quickly among young adults raising families. 
</P>
<P>
 Among teen-agers, as among adults, women are somewhat more likely than men to 
attend church, by a margin of 53% to 47%. 
</P>
<P>
 Black teen-agers are far more likely than whites -- 68% to 48% -- to report 
attendance during a given week. Young Protestants are more likely to go to 
church than young Roman Catholics, by a margin of 61% to 43%. 
</P>
<P>
 The high concentrations of young blacks and Protestants in the South may 
account for higher than average attendance in that region, with 60% of Southern 
teen-agers reporting that they go to church. Attendance in the Midwest is 49%, 
about the national average. Lowest attendance is found in the East and West, 
where 43% of teen-agers report going to church. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings for 1993 are based on telephone interviews conducted by the 
Gallup Youth Survey between March and October. The margin of error is 3 
percentage points in either direction.

NEW ERA BETWEEN HOLY CITY, ETERNAL CITY; DIPLOMACY: ESTABLISHMENT OF FORMAL 
RELATIONS BRINGS TOGETHER THE SHARED HISTORY OF TWO ANCIENT FAITHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES RUDIN, RELIGIOUS NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The establishment of diplomatic relations between the Vatican and the state of 
Israel is a momentous event because it normalizes relations between the Roman 
Catholic Church and the Jewish people after 2,000 years. It brings together the 
spiritual children of Rome, the Eternal City, and the spiritual children of 
Jerusalem, the Holy City, in an extraordinary way. 
</P>
<P>
 In AD 70, the Roman Empire ended Jewish sovereignty in the land of Israel by 
destroying Jerusalem's Holy Temple. After that catastrophe, many Jews were 
expelled from their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Jews, few in number, remained in the Holy Land during the centuries 
of invasions and wars that followed. Their constant hope was that an 
independent Jewish state would someday be reborn. It was a long and painful 
wait that finally ended with the birth of modern Israel in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 During those centuries, Christianity, deeply rooted in Judaism, grew in size 
and influence. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new religion's relationship with its parent was strained and sometimes 
bloody. And because Jesus was a Jew from the land of Israel, and because 
Christianity had made the Hebrew Bible and much of Jewish teaching and liturgy 
its own, Jews and Christians shared a unique but deeply troubled relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Jews became victims of Christian fury that included the Crusades, the 
Inquisition, expulsions, bigotry and persistent persecution. Because of this 
shameful reality, many Jews viewed Christians, and especially Roman Catholics, 
with deep suspicion and fear. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in some lands and during some centuries, the Christian-Jewish 
relationship was filled with light, though mostly it was a history of dark, 
ominous shadows. For nearly 20 centuries Christians and Jews lived an uneasy 
coexistence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nazi Holocaust, the mass murder of 6 million Jews in the heart of 
Christian Europe between 1933 and 1945, shattered that fragile relationship. 
Systemic, radical evil and genocidal anti-Semitism required a new relationship 
between Christian and Jew. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Jewish people, the state of Israel became the symbol and reality of 
survival after Auschwitz. The Jewish state was the answer to homelessness and 
powerlessness, but it remained officially unrecognized by the Roman Catholic 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1965 Second Vatican Council declaration, "Nostra Aetate," ushered in a 
positive era for Catholics and Jews, but it made no mention of the state of 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Vatican leaders have long had conflicting views about a reborn Jewish 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1904, Theodor Herzl, modern Zionism's founder, was hopeful he could obtain 
the Holy See's support, but his hopes were dashed when Pope Pius X responded 
negatively to Herzl's request: "We cannot approve of the Zionist movement. . . 
. We could never sanction it. The Hebrews have not recognized our Lord, 
therefore we cannot recognize the Hebrew people." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Herzl met with the Vatican secretary of state two weeks later, the 
tone was different: "If the Jews believe they might greatly ease their lot by 
being admitted to the land of their ancestors, then we would regard it as a 
humanitarian question. We shall never forget that without Jerusalem (Judaism), 
we (Catholics) would have been nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 At last the ambivalence has ended, and diplomatic relations mean that the 
Vatican, led by Pope John Paul II, now joins 133 other nation-states in fully 
recognizing the legitimacy and permanence of the Jewish state within the family 
of nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Vatican-Israel diplomatic relations could not have been established without 
nearly 30 years of dynamic and constructive Catholic-Jewish relations, much of 
it in the United States. Nor could it have happened without the leadership of 
many Catholic clergy and lay people. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the chief advocates for formal ties is Cardinal John O'Connor of New 
York. Wherever he traveled throughout the world, the cardinal consistently 
called for full diplomatic relations, and I strongly believe he reflected the 
beliefs of millions of Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Will Vatican-Israel relations mean the end of anti-Semitism? No. But they will 
aid in the eternal struggle against that deadly social pathology. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Vatican-Israel relations mean the end of theological differences between 
Catholics and Jews? Of course not. But relations will release fresh energy in 
both communities, and the dialogue will move into new areas and with increased 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Vatican-Israel relations mean the end of flash points between Catholics 
and Jews? No. But relations will provide a firm foundation to face future 
crises in a spirit of cooperation and not confrontation. The establishment of 
diplomatic relations between the Vatican and Israel is not a 
once-in-a-generation event, nor is it even a once-in-a-lifetime happening. 
Rather, it is a once-and-for-all moment in the shared history of two ancient 
faith communities. A Past Full of Conflict Major events of religious or 
political importance in Roman Catholic relations with Judaism and the State of 
Israel: 
</P>

Jerusalem will remain Israel's united capital. 
</P>
<P>

BRANCH DAVIDIAN SIEGE NAMED TOP STORY OF '93 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Religion news specialists say the top religion story of 1993 was the 
government's prolonged, deadly siege of the Branch Davidians, which scholars 
saw as a dangerous precedent for dealing with peculiar faiths. 
</P>
<P>
 In the government's initial raid on Feb. 28, four officers and six Davidians 
were slain in the exchange of gunfire. Eighty-six members of the Davidian cult 
later perished in the fire that swept the group's compound near Waco, Tex., 
when federal officers mounted a paramilitary assault after a 51-day standoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The affair was rated the year's prime religion news by members of the Religion 
Newswriters Assn. The survey was taken before this week's historic accord 
between the Vatican and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranked second was the swelling upheaval over sexual charges against clergy. 
Chicago's widely esteemed Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph Bernardin firmly 
denied charges that he sexually abused a seminary student years ago. In an 
unrelated development, American bishops asked the Vatican to change church law 
to make it easier to dismiss priests found guilty of molesting children. 
</P>
<P>
 Ex-priest James Porter was sentenced to 18 to 20 years in prison for abusing 
dozens of boys. Robert Sanchez, accused of having sex with five women, resigned 
as archbishop of Santa Fe. And an inquiry found that 11 Franciscan friars at a 
now-closed California seminary sexually molested dozens of students over 20 
years.  
</P>
<P>
 The remaining top 10 1993 religion stories were: 
</P>
<P>
 * Pope John Paul II's visit to World Youth Day in August in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 * The peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization.  
</P>
<P>
 * The World Parliament of Religions meeting in Chicago, where 250 leaders of 
various religions signed a "Declaration of Global Ethic."  
</P>
<P>
 * The bombing of New York's World Trade Center, in which defendants were 
linked to a Jersey City, N.J., mosque, and identified as followers of a radical 
Muslim cleric. 
</P>
<P>
 * Adoption by Congress of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which 
overturned a 1991 Supreme Court decision restricting some religious practices.  
</P>
<P>
 * A firestorm of protests hitting the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America 
on its release of a human sexuality study draft which would bless same-sex 
relationships based on loving, permanent commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Destruction of mosques by Hindu militants in India followed by waves of 
deadly violence against Muslims.  
</P>
<P>
 * A new encyclical from Pope John Paul II, "The Splendor of Truth," which 
asserted a basic morality to which Catholics must adhere. NEWS MEDIA

 "Womanist" theologian Toinette M. Eugene, an expert on the African American 
family and feminist issues in the church and society, will deliver a public 
lecture at 7 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 13, and teach a weekend course Jan. 14-16 as 
part of a Martin Luther King Jr. birthday observance at Immaculate Heart 
College Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Novelist Alice Walker coined the term "womanist" in 1983 and it is often used 
to mean black feminist or feminist woman of color. Womanist thinking, says 
Sarah S. Forth, director of Immaculate Heart's program in feminist 
spirituality, considers both individual liberation and social and economic 
transformation necessary for social change and supports Afrocentric models of 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene, an associate professor of Christian Social Ethics at 
Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary in Evanston, Ill., draws on the 
humanist ideals of self-actualization, self-definition and self-determination 
through a shared community. According to Forth, Eugene's writings on power 
emphasize Afrocentric models of community, which stress connectedness, caring 
and personal accountability. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene believes this concept parallels the "call and response" tradition of 
African vocal music, in which power dynamics are fluid: Everyone has a voice, 
but everyone must listen and respond to other voices in order to remain in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lecture is titled "Two Heads are Better Than One: Womanist and Feminist 
Theologies in Tandem." Admission is $10, $5 for seniors, students and 
low-income persons. Immaculate Heart College Center is an independent 
educational and research organization that provides resources in global and 
multicultural education. It is located at 425 Shatto Place, Suite 401, Los 
Angeles. Lecture reservations and information about her weekend course are 
available by phoning (213) 386-3116.

CRIME; EVEN WITH 6 SLAYINGS A DAY, SOME KILLINGS STUNNED THE SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles' 1993 homicide tally stood at 999 and counting as of Dec. 7. Even 
though that represents a slight drop over last year's rate, it still works out 
to nearly three murders every day in this city. Countywide, the total through 
the end of November was 2,076, an average of nearly six homicides a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Even here, some crimes stand out -- often because they represent intrusions 
into seemingly secure places such as schools, hospital emergency rooms or a 
street filled with trick-or-treaters on Halloween. Here are some of the 
incidents that shocked Los Angeles and surrounding communities in 1993: 
</P>
<P>
 Campus shootings: A 15-year-old youth was shot and killed at Fairfax High 
School on Jan. 21 when the .357-caliber magnum a classmate was carrying in his 
backpack accidentally fired. A second student was injured and recovered. One 
month later, on Feb. 22, another 15-year-old student was shot to death at 
Reseda High School by a classmate who was said to be a member of a rival 
graffiti tagging crew. The shootings were a numbing revelation of the presence 
of guns on school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency room rampage: Three doctors were wounded in a Feb. 8 shooting 
rampage by a patient inside the emergency room at County-USC Medical Center. 
The gunman allegedly came to complain about his medical care and was angry that 
he had to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Bike shop shooting: A 12-year-old boy was convicted of first-degree murder in 
the March 11 shooting death of a popular Monrovia bicycle shop owner. The 
victim was shot down from the back without provocation; the child expressed no 
remorse, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 ATM holdup: A pregnant Toluca Lake woman was stabbed to death during a March 
30 robbery at an automated teller machine outside a Sherman Oaks bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Crossing guard killed: Two high school students, one of them an ROTC cadet, 
were charged with kidnaping and shooting to death Long Beach crossing guard 
Catherine Tucker as she sat in her car at her post on the morning of Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Father killed after dog is shot: Transito Velado was shot down Sept. 24 
outside his Los Angeles home after he confronted a gunman who had just wounded 
his dog. Five children were left fatherless. Neighbors, shocked by the family's 
tragedy, sent donations totaling about $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Decapitation: A 32-year-old tailor, incensed that friends doubted his claim 
that he had murdered a man, allegedly cut off the victim's head, put it in a 
roasting pan and displayed it next to the pastry case at a Pico-Union 
neighborhood market Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Halloween homicides: Five members of a Pasadena gang were charged with killing 
three teen-agers Halloween night because a member of the suspects' gang had 
been shot earlier that evening. More than 80 Pasadena activists were moved to 
create the Coalition for a Nonviolent Pasadena, dedicated to improving 
educational and recreational opportunities for youths and to lobbying for gun 
control laws.

WALL STREET SCORES WELL FOR 1993, A SURPRISING END; WINNING AGAINST THE ODDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wall Street clawed its way to a third straight winning year in 1993, 
overcoming early doubts about the economy, later fears of higher interest rates 
and a growing diversion of U.S. investors' cash to red-hot foreign markets. The 
Dow Jones industrial average jumped 13.7% for the year and closed just under 
its all-time high. The Dow began the year at 3,301.11 and ended at 3,754.09, 
for a 452.98-point gain. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue-chip index hit a record 3,794.33 on Wednesday but slid a total of 
40.24 points in the last two trading sessions, undermined by fresh bond market 
jitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, analysts said the market's performance was impressive. While many 
experts had been expecting a broad market pullback of at least 10% during 1993, 
it never came. 
</P>
<P>
 "The things that fooled everyone were the mood, the money flow and the 
momentum," said Alan Ackerman, investment strategist at Reich & Co. in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors' mood improved as the year wore on and the economy finally built a 
head of steam. At the same time, interest rates remained near 20- to 30-year 
lows for much of the year, encouraging investors to draw record sums out of 
bank CDs and other short-term accounts and funnel the money into stock and bond 
mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Those trends fed on themselves, Ackerman said, giving stock prices the 
momentum needed to overcome numerous potentially crippling worries -- from 
Russia's right-wingers to rising gold and commodity prices to the expectation 
that the Federal Reserve will eventually be forced to push interest rates 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
 For a third consecutive year, small-company stocks were the U.S. market's 
stars. The Russell 2,000 index, the purest benchmark of small-stock 
performance, rose 17% for the year, bolstered by a rally this past week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq Stock Market's composite index, which is mostly made up of smaller 
stocks, gained 14.8% in price in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street has been touting smaller companies as being better able to cope 
with the rapidly changing economy. Investors appear to believe the story -- and 
that small companies' earnings growth will continue to outpace bigger 
companies' growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The market's major disappointment in 1993, relatively speaking, was the 
blue-chip Standard & Poor's 500 index, the most widely used benchmark for 
mutual funds that attempt to match the market's performance. The S&P gained 
7.1% for the year. With dividend income, however, the total return is estimated 
at just above 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 While a 10% return still handily beat the 2.7% that investors would have 
earned by sitting in a money market fund for the whole year, Wall Streeters say 
the S&P's results since 1991 show that the U.S. market overall is becoming a 
tougher place to eke out attractive returns. The bull market, after all, now is 
38 months old. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. stock gains might have been better in 1993 but for the avalanche of cash 
Americans opted to instead pour into foreign stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most foreign markets turned in spectacular gains, as interest rates fell 
overseas (especially in Europe) and as investors worldwide bet on a stronger 
global economy in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hong Kong market, for example, leaped 115.7% for the year, with the Hang 
Seng stock index shooting from 5,512.39 at the start of the year to 11,888.39 
at the close. Taiwanese stocks soared an average 79.8%, German stocks 46.7% and 
British shares 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage of new world trade accords in December, after seven years of 
international wrangling, boosted optimism about overseas markets, sparking an 
explosion of buying during the month. Indeed, the list of markets at or near 
new highs at year's end extended from Karachi, Pakistan, to Kuala Lumpur, 
Malaysia, to Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 But some veteran investors now warn that foreign markets have become 
overheated and are vulnerable to a selloff. "The intensity of the investor 
craziness about emerging markets suggests to me that a cold bath is in the 
offing," warns Barton Biggs, investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Co. in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Wall Streeters fear the same about U.S. stocks, though the doubters admit 
they are beginning to sound like broken records. "Nobody thinks the market can 
go down next year," complains a worried David Shulman, investment strategist at 
Salomon Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Revived fears of higher interest rates could be the catalyst for at least a 
short-term pullback early in 1994, analysts say. Rates have been creeping 
higher in recent months as the economy has surged. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year Treasury bond yield, the benchmark for long-term interest rates, 
hit a 20-year low of about 5.8% in the fall, after starting the year at 7.40%. 
The yield now stands at 6.35%, and a jump late in the week is what tripped the 
Dow industrials. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulls argue that interest rates needn't move up significantly so long as 
inflation stays low. What's more, even a rise from the current 2.7% money 
market fund yields to 3.7% probably won't be enough to destroy investors' 
hunger for stocks, some say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The country's demographics are such that baby boomers are starting to step up 
their savings rates," says Charles Albers, a veteran investor who manages the 
Guardian Park Avenue stock fund in New York. "Common stocks are the natural 
thing for the boomers to emphasize." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, that still appears to be the case. A Fidelity Investments survey of 
small investors in December found that 52% of them plan on making new purchases 
of stock mutual funds soon. That's down just slightly from 55% in November, a 
high that had been reached only once before (last February) since the Fidelity 
surveys began in 1990. The Bull Market Chugs On * U.S. STOCKS PUSH AHEAD...

INFINITY COULD LOSE MILLIONS ON FCC'S DELAY OF RADIO PURCHASES; BROADCASTING: 
COMPLAINTS AGAINST DEEJAY HOWARD STERN HAVE BEEN CITED. KRTH IN LOS ANGELES IS 
AMONG DEALS PENDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Infinity Broadcasting Corp., the employer of radio shock jock Howard Stern, 
may start out the New Year several million dollars poorer because federal 
regulators, peeved at Stern's controversial on-air remarks, have not yet 
approved Infinity's purchase of three radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Federal Communications Commission had set no timetable for 
reviewing the estimated $170 million in pending radio deals, failure to close 
the transactions before Sunday could cost Infinity several million dollars.  
</P>
<P>
 That's because Infinity's reported $110-million purchase agreement for the 
largest of the stations, KRTH-FM in Los Angeles, pegs the price to the 
station's financial performance in the year of the deal. A deal in 1994 would 
open the door to an improved performance by the station and thus a higher 
price. Infinity shares fell $3 on Friday to close at $30.25 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Andrew Barrett said the agency informally discussed the proposal 
about a week ago but has not acted because commissioners have been out of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Barrett and fellow Commissioners James H. Quello and Ervin S. 
Duggan have indicated they favor delaying the transactions until the FCC 
reviews at least two formal indecency complaints filed against Stern with the 
agency in recent months. FCC officials say the review could take weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's new chairman, Reed E. Hundt, has removed himself, at least 
for now, from deciding whether to approve Infinity's radio acquisitions because 
his former law firm, Latham & Watkins, has represented the company selling the 
Los Angeles station. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how vigorously the FCC will pursue the indecency complaints, 
because the Clinton Administration has been championing less federal regulation 
of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based Infinity, which with 20 stations is the nation's third-largest 
broadcast holding company, has been under fire since 1990, when the FCC levied 
the first of what has grown into $1.2 million in fines. The fines were levied 
for purportedly indecent remarks Stern made on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern has built a career on remarks about matters of race, ethnicity and 
sexuality that some critics say go beyond the bounds of good taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern once said, for example that he wanted to "strip and rape" male deejays 
at a Los Angeles radio station. He also drew the ire of commissioners when he 
said in 1992 that he hoped former FCC Commissioner Alfred E. Sikes' prostate 
cancer would spread. 
</P>
<P>
 As offensive as Stern's program is to some listeners, his commentary has been 
a hit with audiences in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and several other 
large cities, and his provocative autobiography, "Private Parts," has sold more 
than a million copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are signs Stern has begun to tone down his radio remarks as a 
result of tighter monitoring by Infinity, the controversy he has ignited has 
focused new attention on the conflict between the right to free speech, which 
is guaranteed by the Constitution, and the legal responsibilities of 
broadcasters, who must obtain government-issued licenses to use the public 
airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC has had the power to regulate indecent speech since a 1978 Supreme 
Court ruling that arose from on-air comedy routines by comedian George Carlin. 
But the agency rarely invoked that power until the mid-1980s, when Reagan 
Administration appointees initiated a crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 But recent federal court decisions could curb the FCC's power. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, for example, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington overturned 
FCC rules that prohibited radio or television stations from broadcasting 
sexually explicit material between 6 a.m. and midnight. The court ruled that 
the ban covered too many hours of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC has since adopted a policy of banning indecent material during hours 
when the greatest number of children might be expected to listen to radio, from 
6 a.m. to 8 p.m.

AMERICA WEST REPLACES CEO TO CLEAR AIR FOR INVESTORS; AIRLINES: CONFLICT IN 
EXECUTIVE SUITE HAD COMPLICATED THE COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO EMERGE FROM CHAPTER 11 
PROTECTION. 
</P>

<P>
 Michael Conway, one of the founders of America West Airlines, was ousted 
Friday as president and chief executive of the carrier after a yearlong power 
struggle with Chairman William Franke. 
</P>
<P>
 The directors of the Phoenix-based airline, which is operating under Chapter 
11 bankruptcy protection, named airline executive A. Maurice Myers to replace 
Conway, giving Myers the titles of president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers, 53, had been president and chief executive of Aloha Airgroup, which 
operates Honolulu-based Aloha Airlines, since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Conway, 48, and Franke, 56, had been at odds since Franke, a Phoenix 
investment banker, was named chairman last year after raising funds to keep the 
carrier aloft. Since then, both men reportedly have sought to line up 
investment groups that would help America West emerge from bankruptcy and 
support their leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had different visions of the future," Franke said. "We needed to speak 
with one voice and concentrate on the future without having to retrace the 
mistakes of the past, the issues of the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Franke said the board decided several months ago to begin searching for a new 
chief operating officer. While Myers will be in charge of day-to-day 
operations, Franke -- who has no previous airline experience -- said he will 
focus on strategic planning and completing the company's restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 Conway will remain on the airline's board. He could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute between the two executives apparently led an investment group 
headed by the Pritzker family of Chicago to withdraw a $150-million 
reorganization proposal two weeks ago. The group reportedly would have named 
Conway chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a New York investment firm, the Steinhardt Group, said it would 
invest up to $250 million in the carrier in return for an 80% stake. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of America West's effort to exit Chapter 11, it is seeking investors 
interested in taking control of the carrier. Bidders must submit proposals by 
Feb. 10. The airline's board will then have 30 days to select a bid, Franke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a number of potential bidders," Franke said. Myers' selection "will 
clear the air and permit us to energize the company." 
</P>
<P>
 America West began flying in 1983 after Conway and a small group of business 
people raised $500,000 -- some of it from second mortgages and cash advances on 
credit cards. The airline at one point flew to Japan and was a bidder for 
now-defunct Pan American World Airways' East Coast shuttle service. 
</P>
<P>
 But America West's expansion proved too costly.

BLUE-CHIPS DROP 21.79 AFTER RECORD WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. blue-chip stocks went out with a whimper Friday, ending 1993 by 
retreating sharply after a record-setting week. But smaller U.S. stocks posted 
gains, and the torrid Hong Kong stock market continued to set record highs. 
</P>
<P>
 On the interest rate front, long-term bond yields ended slightly higher amid 
continued worries of strong economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, in a late reversal after a day of gains, 
ended the last trading day of the year off 21.79 points to close at 3,754.09, 
down 3.63 points for the week. Blue-chips had a three-day run into record 
territory this past week until they posted an 18-point drop Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market Friday, advances beat declines 1,179 to 892. The Standard 
& Poor's 500 index dropped 2.19 to 466.45 and closed out the week 0.93 lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller stocks did better, ending a banner year with the Nasdaq composite 
index jumping 5.72 to 776.80, up 18.10 for the week. The American Stock 
Exchange market value index finished at 477.15, up 4.60 for the day and up 
11.83 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the market's moves Friday were merely window dressing and tax selling 
on thin volume, analysts said. Volume was a mere 171.4 million shares on the 
New York Stock Exchange, down from 193.66 million on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some stocks that have big moves have them because of the thin volume," one 
trader said. "It's pretty easy to muscle a stock up or down, because many 
people are out today." 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about higher interest rates could be a problem for stock prices next 
year, analysts said, considering the hefty gains achieved in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just a lot of yellow flags. You've got to be somewhat cautious," said 
James Kenney, trading manager at Prudential Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Long-distance phone company MCI Communications continued to gain, rising 
another 1 1/4 to 28 1/4 on word that it plans to build networks to sell local 
phone service. American Telephone & Telegraph fell 1/8 to 52 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Infinity Broadcasting dropped 3 to 30 1/4 after news that the federal 
government has delayed approval of three deals by the company because of furor 
over controversial radio talk show host Howard Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stone Container fell 1 3/8 to 9 5/8 after it announced a common stock and 
debt securities offering. One analyst said the market interpreted the offering 
as dilutive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Genentech gained 1 to 50 1/2, continuing a rally triggered Thursday when the 
Food and Drug Administration authorized the company to market its DNase drug, 
the first new treatment for cystic fibrosis in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Walt Disney lost 1 1/8 to 42 5/8 as the company's chairman said in an 
interview published Friday that he would not rule out closing its troubled Euro 
Disney theme park in France if the U.S. parent and creditor banks don't devise 
a restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Nasdaq market, citing the growth of its listed stocks, announced it will 
halve the value of its Nasdaq-100 index beginning Monday. The index, less 
widely followed than the Nasdaq composite, will be set at 400 when trading 
begins next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock markets in Frankfurt, Tokyo and Mexico City were closed for the New 
Year's holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the FTSE-100 index ended 10.4 points off at 3,418.4, up 6.1 points 
from last week. In Paris, the CAC 40-share index closed down 13.00 at 2,268.22, 
a rise of 16.74 from last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hong Kong, stocks eked out a closing record as last-minute bargain hunting 
erased opening losses. The blue-chip Hang Seng index rose 10.92 points to 
11,888.39, up 848.55 from last Friday. In Sydney, the All Ordinaries index 
closed up 19.1 points to 2,173.6, up 84.4 from a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond inched upward to close at 
6.35%, its highest level since mid-August and up from 6.34% at Thursday's 
close. Its yield soared Thursday after news of a startling pickup in November 
home sales and a drop in unemployment claims. Bond yields tend to rise on signs 
of economic growth, due to fear of interest rates rising. 
</P>
<P>
 In other market activity Friday, the dollar ended 1993 generally higher amid 
continued investor enthusiasm about the nation's economic outlook. In New York 
trading, the dollar settled at 111.85 yen, up from 111.83 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. oil, gold and silver futures markets were closed for New Year's Eve. In 
Zurich, gold fell to a late bid of $390.20 per troy ounce, off $1.80. Earlier 
in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.50 to close at $390.65.

PRUDENTIAL UNIT UNABLE TO SHED CLOUD OF SCANDAL; SECURITIES: U.S. ATTORNEY'S 
OFFICE IS APPARENTLY BUILDING CASES AGAINST THE BROKERAGE, ITS PARENT AND 
INDIVIDUALS. 
</P>

<P>
 Prudential Securities Inc.'s hopes for putting its limited partnership scandal 
rapidly behind it have faded amid a mushrooming federal criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers involved in the case said it appears the U.S. attorney's office in 
Manhattan is targeting both Prudential, the nation's fourth-largest brokerage, 
as well as its giant parent, Prudential Insurance Co. of America, for eventual 
criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are also building individual cases against current and former 
executives, and the investigation this week prompted the firm to remove its 
general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential Securities has long contended that the wrongdoing associated with 
its $8-billion limited partnership business ended with the 1980s and that all 
the senior executives involved had left. 
</P>
<P>
 When the firm agreed to a mammoth settlement of at least $371 million with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission in October, there was a wave of relief at 
the brokerage's Wall Street headquarters, as well as the expectation that the 
scandal would soon fade from public memory. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview at the time, Hardwick Simmons, chief executive of Prudential 
Securities, said optimistically, "The feeling of most of the organization would 
be one that says we think the beginning of the end is in sight for us." 
</P>
<P>
 But those hopes seemed dashed this week as word came that federal prosecutors 
were expected to issue subpoenas shortly and had recommended that individual 
executives get their own lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them was Loren Schechter, Prudential's general counsel since 1982, who 
also was on the brokerage's board and was a member of its senior management 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Simmons disclosed in a memo to the firm's staff that Schechter 
was stepping down from those positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons said he had decided to grant Schechter's request to be relieved "as a 
result of the unfortunate and unfair publicity and innuendo in the recent 
press." He said the attorney continues to be an executive vice president of 
Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm's problems center on limited partnerships sold heavily to small 
investors in the 1980s. The SEC has said Prudential used fraudulent sales 
techniques and gave customers false account statements that failed to reflect 
big losses. Prudential settled without admitting or denying the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan M. Cohen, Schechter's lawyer, strongly denied that Schechter had condoned 
any wrongdoing. "Loren Schechter intends to cooperate fully with the SEC and 
U.S. attorney's office in every way possible," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal sources also confirmed Friday that numerous current and former 
Prudential executives, including Schechter, had been invited to meetings at the 
U.S. attorney's office. At such sessions, potential witnesses or targets are 
asked to share what they know with prosecutors on the promise that anything 
they say will not be used against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those invited in were James Darr, former head of Prudential's limited 
partnership program. But Darr declined the invitation, sources said. Darr's 
lawyers have said they have received no indication that Darr himself is a 
target of any investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Vianale, the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the case, has 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Schechter was the lead negotiator for the firm in the SEC settlement talks. 
But he also had responsibility in the '80s for reviewing sales material that 
later was alleged to be false. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he was responsible for enforcing an earlier SEC settlement, 
reached in 1986, that required the firm to step up its internal monitoring. In 
October, the SEC said Prudential had never lived up to that agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Schechter, federal prosecutors have recommended that several other 
current Prudential executives get their own lawyers, including Frank Giordano, 
a former limited partnership executive who is now chief counsel for 
Prudential's mutual fund management, and James M. Kelso, current head of the 
firm's limited partnership division. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have said that the SEC is also continuing to investigate current and 
former executives and may bring civil charges against them.

 Steel Companies, Union Issue Dumping Charges: Five U.S. steel bar producers 
and the United Steelworkers of America asked the government to impose 
anti-dumping duties on exporters in Brazil, India, Italy, Japan and Spain.A 
petition filed with the Commerce Department and the International Trade 
Commission said stainless steel bar from those countries is being sold in the 
United States at less than fair value. The five countries accounted for about 
65% of total stainless steel bar imports in 1993, said a written statement 
released by the U.S. companies and their union. Steel companies in those 
countries are probably being motivated by recessions in their home markets, the 
statement said.

 TCI to Acquire Stake in British Firm: Flextech said it agreed to give 
Englewood, Colo.-based Tele-Communications Inc. a 60.4% stake valued at nearly 
$300 million in return for the European assets of a TCI programming unit. 
Following the transaction, which is subject to shareholder approval, Flextech 
will become one of Britain's largest suppliers of cable and satellite 
programming, with an interest in five of the 12 channels that make up the basic 
multichannel subscription package of Britain's only satellite TV broadcaster, 
BSkyB. TCI, the biggest cable operator in the United States, will hold the 
interest in Flextech through its United Artists unit.

SECOND PEST THREATENS STATE VINEYARDS; VITICULTURE: THE SHARPSHOOTER NOT ONLY 
FEEDS ON YOUNG VINES, BUT ALSO SERVES AS A CARRIER FOR A HARMFUL BACTERIUM. 
</P>

 California's wine industry, still hurting from the root-eating pest 
phylloxera, now faces a threat from a bug that is spreading a deadly microbe 
through vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
 The new pest is a quarter-inch-long insect called the sharpshooter, which is 
attacking vineyards in the wine country north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The insect feeds on many different plants, including young grapevines, sucking 
the sap. It does not kill the plants directly but carries xylella fastidiosa, a 
bacterium that causes many maladies, including the fatal Pierce's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce's disease, once called Anaheim disease, destroyed virtually all the 
vineyards in Orange County earlier in the century. In recent years it has 
affected vines in San Diego County, but this is apparently the first time it 
has hit Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the viticultural problem we have the highest anxiety about," said Mike 
Walsh, owner of Walsh Vineyard Management in Napa. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 acres of the 1,800 acres of vineyard he manages are seriously 
affected by Pierce's disease, and the problem may be more widespread than 
previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The especially disturbing thing is that the disease is particularly hard on 
young vines, and we have new vineyards in many of the most problematic areas," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharpshooter is the latest problem to hit California's wine industry. For 
the past 10 years, growers have had to cope with phylloxera, a tiny, aphid-like 
louse that has killed thousands of acres of vines. Increased competition, 
scarcity of credit and a drop in wine consumption have also harmed the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharpshooter is worrisome because it is impossible to kill all the insects 
in an area. It tends to affect vines next to brush and forests, so some growers 
are trying to control the pest by cutting back wild growth along the edges of 
their vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers hope to determine whether some rootstocks might resist Pierce's 
disease as they do phylloxera. There is some evidence that is the case, said 
Andrew Walker, a rootstock breeder and assistant professor of plant genetics at 
University of California, Davis. Walker is helping set up a series of rootstock 
experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very hard to get funding during periods of low Pierce's disease 
incidence for trials like this, but we're seeing lots of interest these days," 
he said.

 World Sales of New Securities Surged 29% in 1993: Sales climbed to a record 
$1.47 trillion, enriching Wall Street in the process. The lowest U.S. bond 
yields in 30 years, record stock prices and booming investor demand sparked the 
increase from 1992's $1.14 trillion, the previous record, according to 
information compiled by Securities Data Co.Last year was "a great year for Wall 
Street," said New York Stock Exchange Chairman William Donaldson. "An explosive 
growth in mutual funds," caused by investors seeking higher returns, drove 
securities higher, he said. Wall Street is not looking for a repeat in 1994. 
Companies that sold bonds last year to refinance older ones with higher 
interest coupons are unlikely to issue as much debt in the year ahead.

 CBL Medical Files for Chapter 11: Century City-based CBL Medical Inc. said it 
made the filing for bankruptcy protection after talks between a lender and 
CBL's Physician Groups affiliate broke down.CBL in September said it would 
close its 10 Physician Groups clinics and exit the workers' compensation 
rehabilitation business because of a slowdown in insurance reimbursement. The 
company said its market capitalization had shrunk to the point where it no 
longer qualified for listing on the Nasdaq National market. However, it will be 
listed on the Nasdaq SmallCap market. The stock closed at 41 cents a share, 
down 16 cents.

 Lloyd's Snares $1.3 Billion in Corporate Capital: Lloyd's of London said it 
has raised the capital since a financial crisis forced the insurance market to 
open its doors to corporate investors Oct. 22.The money will be used to back 
insurance policies written in the market. Lloyd's suffered cumulative pretax 
losses of $8.3 billion in its three most recent reported years of business. 
Although two large American groups had planned to invest in Lloyd's, both 
backed off when they were unable to attract many investors.

PILOT KILLED AS PLANE NOSE-DIVES AFTER TAKEOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard pilot died and his passenger was seriously injured Friday when a 
small plane they were flying lost power after takeoff from the Santa Paula 
Airport and crashed into the Santa Clara River as they tried to return to the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot of the two-seat Grumman airplane was a member of a reserve 
helicopter squadron at Point Mugu Naval Air Station. Witnesses said the craft 
appeared to be experiencing problems as it flew at a low altitude a mile west 
of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't right, the way the engine was going," said 11-year-old Jason Cook, 
who was playing in his family's back yard a half-mile away when he heard the 
scream of an accelerating engine and looked up. "It was only a few feet up -- 
25 or 30 feet -- then went into a spiral and hit." 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot was pinned in the craft and unconscious when the first person 
reached the site. He was later pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to get to the guy, but I couldn't lift the plane up myself," said 
Bernie Noriega, who drove the bulldozer he was operating across a 
three-foot-deep river channel to reach the crash site. Noriega said he doused a 
small fire that broke out after the plane nose-dived into the shallow river. 
</P>
<P>
 The passenger, identified as Peter Dirkers, 24, of Oxnard was flown to Ventura 
County Medical Center, where he was reported in guarded condition with a 
compound fracture to his hip and head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Another witness, Gonzalo Castaneda, said the men were apparently trying to 
turn back toward the Santa Paula Airport when the crash occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the pilot did a 180-degree turn, the plane went upside down and then -- 
boom -- he hit the water," Castaneda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescuers found the leased plane upside down, its cockpit submerged in about 
four feet of water. The injured passenger had managed to free himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The passenger was outside the plane, screaming in agonizing pain," said Santa 
Paula Police Agent Greg Guilin. "The pilot was trapped in the plane, his head 
under the water. We pulled him out and tried resuscitation, but unfortunately 
he had been under too long." 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot, a man in his mid-20s, whose name was not released pending 
notification of next of kin, was identified as a member in the Helicopter 
Combat Support Special Squadron Five at Point Mugu's Naval Air Station. The 
reserve unit, which is trained to search and rescue downed pilots, was deployed 
during operation Desert Storm. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash was the fourth fatal accident in the last three years at or near the 
Santa Paula Airport, a private airfield built by local ranchers in 1930. The 
tiny airport operates without a control tower because it has no commercial 
traffic that would require one. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1992, two planes collided while approaching the airport from the 
east, killing a pilot from the San Joaquin Valley town of Buttonwillow when his 
plane plunged into two houses on Santa Clara Street and burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous year, a helicopter carrying film actor Kirk Douglas strayed over 
the runway on takeoff and crashed into a small plane, killing two people and 
injuring three. Two months later, a veteran airline pilot and a passenger were 
killed when their hand-built plane lost power on takeoff and crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Cunningham, a pilot who has flown from Santa Paula Airport on many 
occasions, said at the scene of Friday's crash that the accident appeared to 
have resulted from an attempted turn without sufficient air speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a classic mistake," Cunningham said. "If he lost his engine after 
takeoff, it would explain why he dropped when he tried to turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration and National 
Transportation Safety Board are scheduled to arrive in Santa Paula this morning 
to begin piecing together what went wrong.

SITE OF RAMPAGE RETURNING TO NORMAL; AFTERMATH: OXNARD OFFICE WHERE GUNMAN WENT 
ON A SHOOTING SPREE IS NEWLY REMODELED, BUT SOME WORKERS HAVEN'T RETURNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Nearly a month after a gunman went on a deadly shooting spree at the Oxnard 
unemployment department, the newly remodeled office is slowly returning to 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen of the office's 50 full-time employees have returned to work, 
including some who hid under desks when gunfire erupted at the jobs office on 
Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployed computer engineer Alan Winterbourne shot three people to death and 
wounded four others inside the North C Street office. He later killed an Oxnard 
police detective before being shot dead himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "He shot anything that moved or made a noise," said Bobbie Espinoza, who 
crouched underneath her desk and only caught a glimpse of the gunman's long 
beard as he stalked through the office in search of victims. "I thought my 
heart was pumping too loud. I could hear his footsteps, the whole office was so 
still." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday -- two days shy of the one month anniversary of the deadliest 
shooting spree in Ventura County history -- the office showed obvious signs of 
the early December rampage. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulletproof glass was erected last weekend across a long wooden counter that 
had no barrier before. Full walls have replaced waist-high partitions that used 
to separate clients from employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Office doors, including the gate that Winterbourne kicked open when he started 
shooting, have been replaced and reinforced with steel. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, about two-thirds of the office's regular employees have not returned to 
work, state officials say. Four of the office workers are recovering from 
gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Others simply are not ready to return to the scene of the deadly rampage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the workers are still reliving some of the things that happened that 
day," said Mary Jane Reid, a counter supervisor at the office who was home with 
the flu the day of the shooting. "If you can make the first step through the 
front door, that's a big step." 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen of the employees have filed workers' compensation claims, indicating 
that they will be off work for an extended period of time, said Anita Grandrath 
Gore, spokeswoman for the state Employment Development Department in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has quit, but a handful of workers are pursuing transfers to other 
state offices, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because only 17 of the regular employees are back on the job, the office is 
being staffed by about 20 workers from other employment offices. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a half-dozen unpaid volunteers from a local job training program 
are doing clerical work and acting as Spanish-language interpreters at the 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Fuentes, a 24-year-old student at the Center for Employment Training in 
Oxnard, eagerly volunteered to help out at the jobs office. For the past two 
weeks, she has served as a link between Spanish-speaking clients and 
English-speaking employees recruited from other offices to pick up the 
workload. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she is doing secretarial work and learning how to operate the 
switchboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here miss the other employees, they miss their partners," Fuentes 
said. "It is very sad in here since the tragedy. You can feel the spirit; it is 
very quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 Added volunteer Jovita Zeppeiro of Camarillo: "I have heard that there are a 
lot of people who aren't coming back, at least not for a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Although short-staffed, the Oxnard office continues to offer a full range of 
services. Under the watch of armed security guards and state police, job 
seekers filled the office lobby Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before noon, Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez visited the office for the 
first time since the shooting. His wife, Irma, a 20-year EDD employee, was shot 
in the back while fleeing from the gunman. She is recovering at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees escorted the mayor around the office, retracing the gunman's steps. 
Thirteen employees were out sick that day, Lopez was told, and another dozen 
were away from the office for various reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he came here wanting to die," Lopez said. "He knew this was his day." 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing a promise made a week after the shootings, state employment 
officials said they are two to three weeks away from signing a lease at another 
office where they plan to relocate employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a lease is signed, Gore said it will take 30 to 90 days to move workers 
to the new location. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for the well-being of the staff we need to move," Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say they are unsure whether all of the office workers ever 
will return. One employee, visiting for the second time since the shooting, 
brought in her two daughters Friday in an effort to re-acclimate herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The worker told supervisors that perhaps she will return for good next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're waiting for employees to come back at their own pace," office manager 
Avelina Villalobos said. "I think that under the circumstances, the staff needs 
to feel safe and ready to come back."

CLEANUP OF SPILL COULD COST FIRM $10 MILLION; ENVIRONMENT: BERRY PETROLEUM MUST 
PAY FOR CLEANING CREWS, MATERIALS AND THE WORK OF VARIOUS PUBLIC AGENCIES. 
</P>

<P>
 The massive cleanup of the 84,000-gallon oil spill at McGrath State Beach 
could cost Berry Petroleum Co. $10 million and last for months, a state 
official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be in the high seven digits or the low eight digits," the official, 
who requested anonymity, said about the cleanup costs. "This spill will be to 
Berry Petroleum what the Exxon Valdez spill was to Exxon." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to paying for cleaning crews to work on the spill, Berry will be 
responsible for the cost of materials used in the effort and for the work of 
public agencies responding to the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Coast Guard alone, the cost after just five days had reached $53,000. 
"As time goes on, it will be much, much larger," said Chief Warrant Officer 
John Hollis, a Coast Guard spokesman. "Each day the costs skyrocket." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Berry, the parent company of pipeline operator Bush Oil, said 
they would not confirm the cleanup costs but have said they are covered by 
insurance for such incidents. Officials from Berry's insurance carrier were not 
available for comment Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Talk of the cleanup's cost came as a Berry spokesman acknowledged the company 
does have information about when the spill occurred and why it was not 
detected, but will not discuss its findings because of the ongoing 
investigation.  
</P>
<P>
 "That information will all come out," said Ray Hatch, Berry's spokesman. "But 
we feel there will be nothing served by giving any of that information out at 
this time."  
</P>
<P>
 Officials investigating the spill have said that oil may have been seeping 
from a ruptured transfer pipe for as many as three days before the leak was 
discovered.  
</P>
<P>
 Until Friday, Berry officials said repeatedly they did not know why it took so 
long to detect the leak. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans to excavate the pipe so that investigators could learn more about what 
caused the break were postponed Friday. Officials said that two to three other 
pipelines run through the same plot of land and must be accurately located 
before digging could begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the pipe is removed from the ground, investigators said they would be 
able to move forward with their investigation at a more rapid pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really the key piece of information that we're missing right now," 
said Petty Officer Tom Haug, one of two U.S. Coast Guard investigators. "I'm 
not comfortable looking at the records alone." 
</P>
<P>
 As investigators from the Coast Guard and the state Department of Fish and 
Game waited for clearance to begin excavation of the pipe, more than 200 
workers continued to remove oil from the beach and wetlands near McGrath Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday, officials at the scene said 1,747 barrels of oil had been 
recovered from the 2,000-barrel spill. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of skimmers on the lake was reduced from three to one, and the 
emphasis turned to the marshland around the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the process of transition," said Cmdr. Jim Rutkovsky, the incident 
commander for the Coast Guard. "We're going from an immersion stage to the 
point where we're being more deliberate." 
</P>
<P>
 The oil that crews are collecting now is more difficult to pick up because 
some of it is in thin layers and some of it is stuck to reeds and other plants 
around the lake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're doing now is going in there on foot and cutting away the brush by 
hand," said Capt. Joe Pecsi, the Fish and Game's operation coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any of the vegetation that's been soaked by oil needs to be removed," Pecsi 
said. "Fortunately, because the crude was pretty solid at the lake's surface 
and the vegetation was very dense, the oil only penetrated about a yard into 
the marsh." 
</P>
<P>
 Workers also continued the meticulous process of raking small beads of oil 
from the beach as they wash in with the tide. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a process that's going to take several days," Pecsi said. "It's very 
tedious work." 
</P>
<P>
 The beach from Channel Islands Harbor to the Santa Clara River mouth will 
remain closed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials continued to find birds either killed or injured by the oil 
spill. The count of birds killed in the oil-stained wetlands rose from 122 to 
133 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're continuing our wildlife rehabilitation efforts, and we're still 
monitoring the impacts this spill has had on the wildlife," Pecsi said. "And 
we're making some headway with the cleanup, but the hard part has just begun."

THE BIKE HELMET MAY BE 'DOOFY,' BUT IT'S THE LAW; SAFETY: STARTING TODAY, 
PROTECTIVE HEADGEAR IS REQUIRED FOR THOSE UNDER 18. BUT MANY DON'T LIKE THEM, 
AND THEY'RE EXPENSIVE. 
</P>

<P>
 As far as 14-year-old Kenny Harms is concerned, wearing a bike helmet "looks 
doofy" and he doesn't want any part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, however, hauled Kenny to a bicycle shop in Newbury Park Friday and 
made him select a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's either this or he's not going to ride his bike," said Wayne Harms, who 
hovered nearby as his son reluctantly tried on bike helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 A state law requiring child bicycle riders to wear protective helmets takes 
effect today, much to the delight of bike shop owners, who say helmet sales 
have increased as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're experiencing a sharp increase in sales -- over 30%," said John Jeffers, 
a salesman at Newbury Park Bicycle Shop. "We're seeing mostly parents, and 
parents dragging in kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Foss, owner of Bicycle Doctor in Ojai, said his helmet sales have 
doubled from about 10 a month to about 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of helmets at Cycle Scene in Ventura have gone up dramatically because 
of the law, said Gary Klein, the store's owner. "We're selling 80 a weekend, 
where before we would sell 15 to 20 on a good weekend. They keep going out the 
door." 
</P>
<P>
 The law applies to bicycle riders under age 18. Violators will receive only 
warnings from police during a one-year grace period. But beginning in 1995, 
those cited will be subject to fines of up to $25 per offense. 
</P>
<P>
 At a bike shop in Ventura, Sue Sturnick was already using the threat of 
citations to force her 14-year-old son to wear a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 But her son, Greg Pike, pleaded, "These things are dumb. I don't want one." 
</P>
<P>
 He picked one up, frowned, and set it back down. 
</P>
<P>
 Sturnick rolled her eyes and declared, "Gregory, I'm not going to pay for your 
bike tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Bicycle store owners say many youngsters are reluctant to wear the helmets 
because they're afraid they will look funny or be teased by friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bicycle helmets all look like turtle shells," said Phil Carpenter, owner of 
Matt's Cycling Center in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents are also unhappy about the new law, saying that bike helmets are 
expensive and children may not wear them anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like a high price to force someone to do something," said Julie 
Wood, as she watched her daughter, Courtney, 13, try on a $30 helmet. "I grew 
up without a helmet, and I'm still here. It's a good idea, but I wish it wasn't 
so expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Donovan, a salesman at Open Air Bicycles in Port Hueneme, said he has 
lost some sales because parents balked at the prices. Helmets range from $20 to 
more than $100, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lady in here the other day, and she didn't want to buy a helmet for 
her daughter because it was 35 bucks," Donovan said. "But then she bragged 
about spending $800 in veterinarian bills on her cat. I thought, 'Lady, eat 
your cat. Your kid's more important.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of the law argue that helmets will save lives and millions of 
dollars in emergency room medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 According to backers of the measure, nearly 18,000 children were admitted to 
California emergency rooms in 1991 for bicycle-related head injuries. State 
figures show that 138 people died in hospitals that year because of bike 
injuries, more than half of them children. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks resident Dan Monaco, who has been riding bikes for nearly 20 
years, said he required his 11-year-old son, Tom, to wear a helmet as soon as 
he learned how to ride a bike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen firsthand what a helmet can do," Monaco said. "It's too easy to get 
hurt badly without one."

GIVING SHELTER; NEEDY FIND FOOD, A WARM BED AND HOPE IN SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last spring, pregnant and penniless, Paula Palos camped out in a tent with her 
2-year-old daughter in the hills above Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she discovered PADS -- Public Action to Deliver Shelter -- a coalition of 
Simi Valley churches that provides shelter and assistance to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 With their help, Palos, 29, was able to apply for government aid and move into 
a modest, two-bedroom apartment in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In winter, the 4-year-old PADS program offers up to two dozen residents a 
warm, safe place to sleep each night, serving as many as 300 homeless people 
between November and March. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers say the program also gives people who find themselves suddenly 
without a home a chance to apply for government assistance or to save enough 
money to pay a security deposit on an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 And next spring, organizers of the PADS program will open the Samaritan 
Center, Simi Valley's first drop-in facility for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Situated in the old St. Francis of Assisi Church on Royal Avenue near Madera 
Road, the center will provide storage space, mail service, voice mail, a jobs 
board, laundry facilities and showers for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible how easy to is to lose your job, your last dollar, and become 
homeless," said Ken Constable, an accountant who volunteers for PADS. "These 
services that we're finally going to be able to offer are things most people 
take for granted, things you need in order to function in this society." 
</P>
<P>
 Palos said she is planning to take nursing classes in the spring. She still 
depends on church charity to feed herself and her two young daughters, but she 
credits PADS with helping her get off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "PADS is a stepping ground," Palos said. "It helped me get out of being 
homeless, which is the first step toward getting off welfare and living like 
everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Samaritan Center is scheduled to open at the end of March, when the 
shelter program closes for the summer. A companion meals program, however, 
operates year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 Started nine years ago as a way to pool community resources to feed the 
hungry, the volunteer-driven meals program operates seven nights a week, 
rotating among six churches around Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent evening, about 100 people crowded into the community room at Grace 
Brethren Church for fried chicken, mashed potatoes and pumpkin pie. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer Doris Lembeck said many of those who come to the meals program are 
the formerly homeless who cannot afford to feed themselves and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't just feed the homeless," she said. "We feed the homeless and the 
needy, and nobody goes away hungry." 
</P>
<P>
 As she sat at a long, cafeteria-style table drinking coffee and eating pie, 
Lexie Troupe, 44, said she has been coming in for a free meal each day for the 
past year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 Troupe, a soft-spoken woman with a ready smile, said she has acute cirrhosis 
of the liver and lives on disability income, which barely pays her rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been rough going for me," she said. "But it makes it easier to get 
through, knowing I can come here each day, see people I know, and fill my 
stomach with something good." 
</P>
<P>
 Lifelong Simi Valley resident Steve Latham, 42, agreed. "Three years ago I hit 
the bottom," said Latham. "Now I'm ready to get back on my feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Latham said he is training to be a computer technician. "If it wasn't for PADS 
and the meals program, I don't think I could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Another man said he turned to PADS after leaving home several weeks ago 
because of family problems. He said he appreciated the supportive environment 
created by volunteers and program participants.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody here judges you or looks down on you," he said. "They treat you with 
dignity, not like you're a failure." 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-year-old man, who said he works with disabled people, asked that his 
name not be used because he feared that if his employer found out he was 
homeless he would lose his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing wire-rimmed glasses, a tweed blazer and blue Oxford shirt, the man 
looked more like a college student than a homeless wanderer who spent Christmas 
day at the park with the ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have all these ideas about what homeless people are like," he said. 
"They don't know that anybody without a lot of friends or family support can 
become homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 As the diners finished their meal, most left the church and headed home, laden 
with extra peanut butter sandwiches and apple pie donated by a local bakery for 
the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen people remained at the church, lining up at a card table to sign up 
for shelter for the night. PADS employee Geoffrey Kasule registered 
participants with the courtesy of a desk clerk at a fine hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 'Are you sleeping with us tonight?" he asked. "You must be tired. Let me put 
you down here, so you can rest your head." 
</P>
<P>
 New participants were given an application to fill out and a contract to sign, 
asking them to agree not to fight, use drugs or alcohol, or leave the shelter 
during the night. 
</P>
<P>
 They also received a mini-lecture from Kasule about using the shelter: 
"Please, I request, don't get hooked on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Kasule reached into a tattered straw bag with "Mexico" woven on the side 
and pulled out the three items each shelter user would need: a pink index card 
that serves as a shelter pass, a map to the site for the evening and a bus pass 
to get them there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We eat in one place and sleep in another," Kasule said. "It's very 
cumbersome, especially on Sundays when the buses don't run." 
</P>
<P>
 PADS organizers say there are no plans to build a permanent homeless shelter 
and dining facility in Simi Valley. But they are trying to find someone willing 
to donate a van to the program, which would simplify the task of getting the 
needy from the food site to the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter passes in hand, the two dozen homeless people scrambled to hitch a 
ride or catch a bus across town to St. Francis of Assisi, the shelter host for 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter veterans knew the first ones arriving at the site would get the 
warmest sleeping bags and the best spots on the linoleum-covered concrete floor 
-- the semiprivate nooks and crannies in the church's community room. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sleeping room was cozy and homelike. A piano occupied one corner, next to 
a stack of brightly colored plastic children's chairs. A pot of steaming coffee 
brewed on a table by the door as a small group gathered around the television 
set to watch a football game. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the shelter seekers immediately turned in for the night. But most 
gathered and socialized until the lights went out at 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 On this night, the shelter would be monitored by volunteer Kevin Bett, a Simi 
Valley resident who is an auto theft detective for the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The homeless here are different from some of the ones I see in L.A.," Bett 
said. "We have a few chronic street people here, but most are seasonal laborers 
who can't make ends meet in the down times." 
</P>
<P>
 Bett said that, as shelter monitor, he would sleep alongside the homeless on a 
flimsy cot covered with a sleeping bag. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ought to be here at night for the chorus of snores," he said. "One really 
has to be tired to sleep through that."

VENTURA COUNTY HOMICIDE RATE JUMPED IN '93; CRIME: THE 47 REPORTED KILLINGS FAR 
EXCEED THE REGION'S AVERAGE. BUT THE RECORD IS 59 IN BOTH 1979 AND 1974. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With 47 homicides in 1993, Ventura County's death toll climbed to the second 
highest in 14 years and the fourth highest since such records were kept. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities agree that it was an unusually violent 12 months -- the average 
for the previous 17 years was 33.6 slayings -- but it was lower than the 48 
killings in 1991 and the record-setting 59 in both 1979 and 1974. In 1992, the 
county had 32 homicides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see this as an indicator of a major rise in crime," said Craig 
Stevens, a senior deputy coroner. "It's just part of the roller coaster. This 
happened to be a worse year than some others." 
</P>
<P>
 Causes for the killings ranged deep and wide. Robberies, drugs, the economy, 
poisoned relationships, mental illness and gang loyalties all spurred people to 
take the lives of others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's human emotion gone awry, and someone ends up dead because there's a 
weapon around," said Todd Howeth, a deputy public defender. "Small things that 
used to be solved with fists -- people pull out guns and start blasting away." 
</P>
<P>
 Some killings erupted out of petty arguments when words escalated to weapons. 
Still other homicides simply defy explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting more and more cases where it's a very trivial issue that 
someone has died over," said Ventura Police Sgt. Bob Anderson. "I don't think 
the average citizen out there has a clue how much violence has become a part of 
our standard of living in this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Among this year's 47 homicides, two husbands killed their wives, two workers 
killed their bosses and, in the worst shooting rampage in county history, an 
unemployed computer engineer slaughtered four people and wounded four others in 
less than 15 minutes. Four people died at the hands of police, up from two 
officer-involved shootings last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-four percent of the victims (30 people) died of bullet wounds -- roughly 
reflecting a 1988 U.S. Department of Justice study finding that 60% of the 
nation's homicides involved a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 11 victims were stabbed, four were strangled -- all women -- and two 
were bludgeoned. 
</P>
<P>
 The homicides took place just about everywhere in the county, with the 
exception of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were not evenly distributed. Eighty-five percent occurred in the 
western part of the county and 40% of all the slayings occurred in Oxnard. 
Ventura and Port Hueneme also had a higher number than in previous years. 
Ventura had 10 homicides, up from an average of three. And Port Hueneme had 
five, including the unsolved stranglings of two women and the stabbing of an 
87-year-old deaf woman in an apartment complex for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most sensational of the county's killings were those in which the 
victims seemed to have been selected at random. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 2, about 11:40 a.m., Alan Winterbourne walked into the Oxnard 
unemployment office -- familiar to him from seven years of job searching -- and 
opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Terror-filled employees scrambled for cover under their desks, barricaded 
themselves in offices or ran for their lives out the front door. By the time 
Winterbourne straightened his jacket and calmly walked out the door, he had 
fatally wounded Anna Velasco, 42, Phillip Villegas, 43, and Richard Bateman, 
65, and injured four others. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was methodically going between the aisles firing, emptying shell casings, 
reloading and firing as he marched through the place," said Sgt. Chuck Dunham 
of the Oxnard Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 After fleeing in his car and killing Oxnard Police Detective James O'Brien 
with a scope-fitted, high-powered rifle, Winterbourne was fatally shot by 
police outside the Ventura unemployment office. 
</P>
<P>
 Another case that captured public attention was the kidnaping and slaying of 
Kellie O'Sullivan, a 34-year-old Westlake nurse who disappeared while running 
afternoon errands. Hundreds of volunteers combed the Santa Monica Mountains 
searching for clues before O'Sullivan's body was found in a brush-covered 
canyon 12 days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Scott Thornton, 19, is now facing charges of murder, kidnaping, robbery 
and a special allegation that could send him to the gas chamber for 
O'Sullivan's slaying.  
</P>
<P>
 (The county coroner's office does not count O'Sullivan's death among the 
county's homicides because her body was found in Los Angeles County, although 
the investigation and prosecution are being handled by Ventura County 
authorities.) 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these high-profile cases, police say the majority of the county's 
homicide victims died in crimes of passion in which they knew their killers, or 
in otherwise familiar circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Paula, Adriana Meza Alamillo, 21, and her boyfriend, Armando Antonio 
Cauich, 22, were shot to death in bed allegedly by her estranged husband, 
Everardo Meza Alamillo. Police believe the husband drank beer in his car while 
waiting for the boyfriend to come over, then snuck in the back door of the tiny 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies were discovered when a housemate heard Adriana's young daughter 
crying hours later. Police now believe the husband may be out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 In another brutal case of domestic violence, JoAnn Linkenauger, 40, was 
severely beaten and then strangled by her husband, James Michael Linkenauger. 
He dumped her body in a muddy ravine near Somis. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators found blood spattered throughout three rooms of the home the 
Linkenaugers shared. Many of the bloodstains had been covered with bleach in a 
futile attempt to wash them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Linkenauger was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to 25 years 
to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the rest of the killings that occurred in Ventura County: 
</P>
<P>
 * After robbing the Popeye's Chicken Restaurant in Oxnard, Stephen Gutierrez, 
26, was shot to death Jan. 7 by an off-duty Ventura County sheriff's deputy. 
Prosecutors said Deputy Roland Ogawa was justified in firing at Gutierrez 
because he identified himself and because Gutierrez fired at him first. 
</P>
<P>
 * Santa Paula resident Alfonso Garza Sanchez, 24, was shot dead in a west 
Ventura alleyway just before midnight Jan. 29. The investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a killing that stunned the city of Ventura, 17-year-old Jesse Owen Martin 
Strobel was fatally stabbed in the chest shortly before midnight Jan. 29 as he 
walked home from a part-time job at his father's pizzeria. He was found lying 
on the porch of a house on residential North Catalina Street. Police said in 
April they had identified a prime suspect, but did not have enough information 
to make an arrest. A reward fund failed to draw out individuals who knew of the 
attack first-hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * Timothy Morrison, 23, was fatally shot in the chest Feb. 13 after stealing a 
bottle of wine from a Port Hueneme liquor store. The owner, Shin Ung Kang, 
followed Morrison from the store, then shot him when he pulled out a knife and 
lunged at him. Authorities ruled it was self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 * Raul Castillo Nunez, 44, was gunned down the morning of March 13 at the 
dirt-removal business where he worked in Moorpark. No arrests have been made 
and the investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 * An argument in a south Oxnard carport erupted into the fatal shooting of 
22-year-old Jesus Manriquez Lopez, a seasonal strawberry picker. The 
investigation is continuing, but police say they have had a difficult time 
finding suspects or anyone who knew the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 * Abel Rodriguez Arjon, 37, bled to death April 24 after Julio Escobar 
Gonzales, 19, accidentally shot him in the leg with a sawed-off shotgun. The 
victim, Escobar and several acquaintances had been drinking and passing around 
the shotgun in a south Oxnard garage. Authorities ruled the shooting 
accidental. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jasper Fitzgerald, 19, died May 14 after being stabbed in the liver and 
heart with an ice pick outside a party in Ojai. Ryan Dale Burchell, 19, was 
sentenced to 12 years in prison for the slaying. The two men barely knew each 
other, if they were acquainted at all, and it is unclear what prompted the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 * That same day, Rosario De La Cruz, 47, was shot four times in the chest at 
his Santa Paula home by a former employee. Just before dying, De La Cruz told 
his wife that Jose Luis Gonzalez, a 23-year-old transient with a history of 
mental illness, had shot him. Gonzalez is now scheduled to appear in court for 
a hearing to determine if he is mentally competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tyrone Baker, 24, of Chino was driving home to Los Angeles on May 15 from a 
concert in Santa Maria when he got into an argument with an acquaintance, 
24-year-old Melvin Lamont Braddock of Pasadena. The pair pulled off the freeway 
in Ventura, where Braddock allegedly shot Baker and left his body on South 
Garden Street near the Ventura County Fairgrounds. Braddock was arrested, but 
has since been released. The investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rodolfo Macias, 25, a busboy, was bludgeoned with a crowbar May 25 in his 
Newbury Park home after arguing with Raul Paul Urquidi about a woman. Urquidi, 
who lived part-time in the same house with Macias, pleaded guilty to 
first-degree murder and was sentenced to 27 years to life in prison.

 * Norma Rodriguez, a 32-year-old mother of two young boys, was strangled to 
death June 1 in the living room of her small home in Port Hueneme. Police have

that are being reviewed by a high-tech unit of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation to see whether they bear similarities to other unsolved crimes. 
</P>

from the scene when Rodriguez began striking the victim's car with a tire iron. 
</P>

<P>
 * Hillario Urriza Corpuz, 44, a security guard, died of a heart attack June 20

major injuries, but were not fatal. Police have no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 * Frank Kish, 32, of Newbury Park was shot in the head and abdomen by his 
girlfriend's brother, Todd Richard Love, 27, during an argument June 20. In a

</P>
<P>
 * James Vleck, a 23-year-old drifter, was shot to death Aug. 9 inside a 
Victorian-style home on Thompson Avenue in Ventura. Police said Vleck had 
sexually assaulted a 21-year-old woman at knife point earlier in the day, then

</P>
<P>
 * Robert Allen Foster, 41, an El io businessman, was fatally shot at 
point-blank range Sept. 5 by his employee, Charles W. Bothwell, 23, inside 
Foster's Ventura thrift store. Authorities said Foster abused his family and 
employees under his control. In a plea bargain, Bothwell was convicted of 
voluntary manslaughter, which would have allowed him to receive probation. But 
Judge Lawrence Storch sentenced Bothwell to three years in prison, saying 
prosecutors had already been too lenient by striking a plea bargain that would 
have allowed him to get probation instead of a prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 * Miguel Ortiz died Sept. 11 after being stabbed in the shoulder in front of a 
south Oxnard junior high school during a roadside fight that apparently spilled 
over from a nearby party. Police later obtained an arrest warrant for Oscar

been made. 
</P>
<P>
 * Michael Wayne Mansir, 24, died after being shot in the chest at close range 
inside his family's home in a canal-lined Oxnard neighborhood. Police later 
arrested Hector Garcia II for the Sept. 28 killing. They believe the motive was 
tied to an armed robbery, in which Garcia is also the suspect, or to ill 
feelings over a woman Garcia was dating. Garcia, described as a longtime friend 
of Mansir's, has been charged with murder and robbery and is awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rene Ramirez, 19, died in a drive-by shooting Oct. 4 at an Oxnard coin 
laundry. Police say it is possible Ramirez was killed in a pay-back for the 
killing of Ruben Hernandez two weeks earlier. Ramirez and Hernandez belonged to 
rival gangs. Police are still investigating Ramirez's death and have made no 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 * Four Oxnard police officers shot and killed Nicholas Paul Partee, 35, the 
night of Oct. 1, after chasing him from Oxnard to Camarillo. Partee allegedly 
showed up at his estranged wife's house, in violation of a temporary 
restraining order, then took off when police tried to stop him at a nearby 
convenience store. The district attorney's office is reviewing the police 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Michael Eugene Carter, 36, was stabbed to death on Oct. 27 during a fracas

case is under review by the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gerardo Dima, 22, was fatally stabbed when he was swept into a violent 
Oxnard street brawl he had nothing to do with. Police said Dima had walked 
outside, barefoot and shirtless on Oct. 31, when someone ran up and stabbed 
him. Four men, all related to each other but not to the victim, were arrested 
for the slaying, but all have been released. Police have been unable to prove 
who killed Dima. 
</P>
<P>
 * The remains of Nancy Huter, a Thousand Oaks woman who disappeared more than 
a year and a half ago, were uncovered Nov. 3 when fire swept across Mugu 
Lagoon, burning off old brush. Coroner's officials have ruled her death a 
homicide, but they have not determined how she died. Huter was reported missing 
from Malibu Creek State Park when she failed to report to work and missed a 
Bible study class. The Sheriff's Department is continuing to investigate her 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Nov. 11, Oxnard and Port Hueneme officers fatally shot Santos Anderson 
Arias, 23, at a gas station at the corner of Pleasant Valley and Ventura roads. 
As light rain fell, Arias dared officers to shoot him, then ignored police 
commands, reached for a shotgun and began to raise it. The incident began when 
Arias got into a disagreement at a nearby bar, then fired several shotgun 
blasts at the bar's back door. The case is still under review by the district 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thurman Lamar Jackson's body was discovered by his girlfriend Nov. 16. He 
had been shot once in the head. There was no sign of a struggle or break-in to

</P>
<P>
 * Roberto Victor Cardenas Jr., a citizen of Argentina, was fatally shot Nov. 
19 outside the El Bohemio Bar in Oxnard's La Colonia neighborhood. Police 
believe Cardenas's own gun may have been used against him. Police have 
questioned several people, but have made no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jose Villanueva, 17, was fatally shot Dec. 10 as he allegedly tried to rob 
an Oxnard western-wear store. The store owner, Jose L. Morales, shot Villanueva 
when the youth allegedly confronted him with a semiautomatic handgun and 
demanded cash from the register. The case will be reviewed by the district 
attorney, but police say it appears to have been self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rodolfo Molina Mora, 27, died of stab wounds to the heart and lung Dec. 11 
after fighting with a 16-year-old boy in Fillmore. The youth has been charged 
with murder. Police will not comment on the motive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paul Martinez, a 21-year-old Whittier man, died after being shot Dec. 18 at 
the Motel 6 on Johnson Drive in Ventura. Police said the shooting broke out, 
unexpectedly, after words were exchanged between two groups of people having a 
party there. Investigators have questioned several people from Oxnard, but no 
arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 * Police in Ventura are puzzled by the death of Erasmo Moro, a 48-year-old 
Italian national fatally shot during an argument in a carport near his 
apartment on Scandia Avenue. Moro worked at a pizza takeout business near his 
apartment. Police are searching for the man with whom Moro argued, but no one 
has been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 * Before dawn on Christmas, 21-year-old Isaias Guerrero Morales died after 
being stabbed in the heart, allegedly by his mother's ex-boyfriend, Jose 
Socorro Jimenez. According to Morales' wife, Jimenez came to the family's 
Oxnard home about 3 a.m. and began yelling, making threats over his break-up 
with Moreles' mother. Morales and Jimenez were walking away from the house when 
a fight erupted and Jimenez allegedly plunged a knife into Morales' chest. 
Jimenez is being held in County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail. No charges have 
been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 * And last Wednesday, the decomposed body of Mika Bissett, 20, was found 
dumped along a dirt road near Moorpark. Police in Los Angeles said she was 
strangled Dec. 14 by Michael Dubov, who was living with her in a Venice 
apartment. Dubov reported her missing Dec. 20, then confessed to the killing 
Dec. 29 and led authorities to the body. He was booked into Los Angeles Main 
Jail on suspicion of murder. Bail was set at $1 million. Homicides in '93 by

ACCIDENT CLOGS VENTURA FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Northbound traffic on the Ventura Freeway was backed up at least six miles for 
hours Friday afternoon in Thousand Oaks after a trailer being pulled by a small 
track overturned on the Conejo Grade, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt in the accident, which occurred at about 2:50 p.m. about 
halfway down the grade, said Ventura County Fire Capt. Mark Taillon. 
</P>
<P>
 A valve on the trailer opened when it was dislodged from the truck, and some 
propane gas was released before firefighters could shut the valve down, Taillon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol officers closed some northbound lanes following the 
accident, then at 3:40 p.m. the CHP decided to shut down all northbound lanes 
while the truck and trailer were removed. The freeway was reopened about 15 
minutes later, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic was backed up from the Conejo Grade to Lynn Road, a CHP dispatcher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a parking lot here in Thousand Oaks," Taillon said. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officials have not determined what caused the truck driver to lose control 
of the trailer.

POLICE IDENTIFY BODY OF WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The body of a woman who was strangled and then dumped in a remote area near 
Moorpark has been identified as that of 20-year-old Mika C. Bissett of Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Lt. John Rogers said Michael Dubov, who was staying with 
Bissett, has confessed to strangling her Dec. 14 in Bissett's apartment in the 
5300 block of Knowlton Street in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubov has been booked in jail in Los Angeles on suspicion of murder and is 
being held on $1 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said Dubov waited several days after he strangled Bissett, then drove 
the body to Ventura County and dumped it on a brush-covered embankment along a 
dirt road off Gabbert Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubov had reported Bissett missing Dec. 20, Rogers said. During an interview 
with detectives Wednesday, Dubov confessed to the killing and led detectives to 
the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said Bissett was a student and that her mother lives in Orange County.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County residents in 1993 marked the passing of a number of notables 
with ties to the area: 
</P>
<P>
 * Patricia Nixon, the former First Lady, died of lung cancer in June at age 
81. She was buried in Yorba Linda, in the shadow of her husband's boyhood home, 
at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace.  
</P>
<P>
 * Joseph T. Molloy, 54, Anaheim's police chief since 1988, died in July of a 
heart attack in his office as he prepared for his morning jog. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lorrin (Whitey) Harrison, an Orange County native who traveled the world in 
search of the perfect wave, died in Hawaii in September of a heart attack at 
age 80. Harrison, who stowed away on ocean liners as a youth to surf in Hawaii 
and was featured in commercials, Life magazine and on "The Tonight Show," 
surfed regularly until his final days. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jonathan David Grenz, 44, a real estate broker who lived in Costa Mesa and 
suffered from throat cancer, committed suicide in February by inhaling carbon 
monoxide in Michigan with the help of Dr. Jack Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pvt. Donald Doyle Robertson, 28, and Pvt. David J. Conner, 19, were both 
killed in traffic accidents while on duty in Somalia in March during Operation 
Restore Hope. Robertson, a Tustin resident who worked as a plumbing installer 
before joining the military, was a mechanic in the U.S. Army. Conner, an Orange 
County native and father of a 5-month-old son at the time of his death, was an 
Army truck driver during the African mission. 
</P>
<P>
 * Athalie Clarke, the 90-year-old widow of James Irvine III and a 
philanthropic, cultural and political activist who helped shape much of Orange 
County, died in her sleep at home in May. Clarke helped expand UC Irvine, was a 
Republican delegate to many national political conventions, had played host to 
Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan for living-room chats and founded a national 
water research group. 
</P>
<P>
 * Amy Elizabeth Biehl, a white Fulbright scholar studying the role of women 
during the political changes in South Africa, was killed in August by an angry 
mob of blacks as she drove friends home in a black township. Biehl, 26, grew up 
in Newport Beach and had graduated from Stanford University. Her attackers are 
currently on trial in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 * Donald Heiney, a longtime UC Irvine professor of English and one of the 
founders of the university's nationally known writing program, died of a heart 
attack in his Newport Beach home in July at age 71.

CHRISTMAS TREE SPARKS $150,000 OJAI HOUSE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A house on Creek Road south of Ojai was gutted by fire on New Year's Eve, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the fire was still being investigated.It was sparked by a 
Christmas tree that caught fire, Ventura County fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the blaze, which was called in to the Fire Department at 
about 4 p.m. after 17-year-old Eileen Friedlander found the family room in 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just taken a bath and heard a weird noise, so I went to the door and 
saw smoke coming through the top of the door," said Eileen, who lives in the 
house with her parents and 13-year-old brother. "I opened the door and the 
family room was completely engulfed in flames." 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen escaped the flames unhurt. Her brother Brent was outside playing 
basketball. Their parents are vacationing in the Napa Valley and are due home 
Sunday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was contained at about 5:10 p.m. Authorities estimated it caused 
about $150,000 worth of damage to the three-bedroom, one-story house.

IN STATISTICAL FLUKE, O.C. JOBLESS RATE TOOK BIG DROP IN NOVEMBER; 
UNEMPLOYMENT: DESPITE 1% DECLINE IN OFFICIAL ESTIMATE, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF 
COUNTY JOBS IS FEWER THAN IN NOVEMBER, 1992. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's jobless rate for November dropped to 5.6% from October's 6.6% 
as 11,000 people were erased from the official estimate of the local labor 
force in what a state analyst called a statistical glitch. 
</P>
<P>
 The big drop is a result of the averaging method used to compute local 
unemployment each month and was repeated in nearly every county in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a one-month anomaly," said Eleanor Jordan, Orange County labor market 
analyst for the state Employment Development Department. "We always caution 
people not to rely on a single month's figures to predict a trend." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, economists generally expect Orange County's employment situation to 
improve. The lower November jobless rate "gives a greater level of confidence 
to our forecasts," said Anil Puri, head of the economics department at Cal 
State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate report issued Friday, EDD analyst Jordan said that businesses in 
Orange County added 800 jobs during November. That report counts positions with 
businesses in the county, while the unemployment rate estimates the number of 
county residents who have jobs, regardless of where they work. 
</P>
<P>
 While the November job increase computed by Jordan certainly is welcome in a 
recession-ravaged county, the total of 1.1 million full- and part-time jobs 
still was 16,900 fewer than in November, 1992, when the county's unemployment 
rate stood at 7.0%. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the gains for the latest month came in government and in retail trade, 
which typically swells in November because of the annual pre-holiday hiring 
spurt. The increase of 3,300 retailing jobs and 1,700 government positions, 
however, was nearly offset by the losses of 1,800 jobs in service industries, 
1,100 in construction, 800 in manufacturing and 500 in finance, insurance and 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Los Angeles County, where the jobless rate for November was barely 
changed at 9.4%, other Southern California counties fared as well as or better 
than Orange County in the month's number-crunching. 
</P>
<P>
 The unemployment rate in San Diego County fell to 7.2% from 8.5% for October; 
Riverside's double-digit jobless rate plunged nearly two full points to 11.8% 
from October's 13.6%; and San Bernardino County's rate was lopped to 9.2% from 
10.7% for October. 
</P>
<P>
 The statewide jobless rate for November -- released earlier in December -- was 
8.6%, down from 9.4% for October. Lower Jobless Rate 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a statistical glitch, Orange County's unemployment rate for 
November fell to 5.6% from October's 6.6%, a decline that was repeated in 
nearly every county across California. O.C.'s job picture:

 The State of Irvine's State of the Art: State of the Art Inc. said Friday it 
will post a loss for the fourth quarter after charging off about $4 million in 
software development costs. The maker of accounting software said some of the 
costs of developing the MacP&L and P&L For Windows programs will be written off 
because "recent technology and competitive changes in the computer software 
market" have made the development costs worthless. The company, based in 
Irvine, didn't say how much it expects to lose; it earned nearly $4 million on 
revenue of more than $19 million for the first three quarters.

 Second Pest Threatens State Vineyards: California's wine industry, still 
hurting from the root-eating pest phylloxera, now faces a threat from the 
sharpshooter, a quarter-inch-long insect that is attacking vineyards in the 
wine country north of San Francisco.The insect feeds on many different plants, 
including young grapevines, sucking the sap. It does not kill the plants 
directly but carries xylella fastidiosa, a bacterium that causes many maladies, 
including the fatal Pierce's disease. Pierce's disease, once called Anaheim 
disease, destroyed virtually all the vineyards in Orange County earlier in the 
century. Researchers hope to determine whether some rootstocks might resist 
Pierce's disease as they do phylloxera.

THE READERS SPOKE LOUDLY . . .; ISN'T AIDS A COSTA MESA ISSUE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Zan Dubin's article "Costa Mesa Refuses to Issue Proclamation" 
(Nov. 30), I find it hard to believe that cost alone was the determining factor 
behind Mayor Sandra L. Genis' decision not to officially proclaim Dec. 1 as A 
Day Without Art. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor states in the article that "she supports proclamations only for 
individuals or groups based in Costa Mesa or involved in projects that directly 
benefit the city and its residents." Are we to understand that there are no 
HIV-positive or AIDS-infected residents in the fair city of Costa Mesa? Are we 
to believe that if, through an outpouring of financial and moral support, a 
cure for AIDS is discovered, it would have no "direct benefit to the city of 
Costa Mesa and its residents"? 
</P>
<P>
 Just in case this terrible scourge is with us at this time next year, I will 
be sending Ms. Genis a $5 bill in support of next year's Day Without Art. That 
way, she will not need to worry whether a proclamation would be "a good use of 
taxpayers' money." With an estimated 1 million Americans already infected with 
HIV, AIDS research and HIV-infected individuals need all the help we can give. 
</P>

 LUCILLE A. HARRISON, Corona del Mar Center's Policy 'Elitist' 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' editorial of Feb. 14 ("Let Arts Center Be Impresario, Not Czar") 
gave me further reason to write about an experience with the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a native Southern Californian who recently returned to this area in 
retirement and immediately joined the Laguna Hills Philharmonic Committee, 
which entails a contribution to OCPAC. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I am appalled at the center and its designated ticket outlet for refusing 
to sell any but the higher-priced tickets over the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was I unable to purchase $20 tickets for "The Marriage of Figaro" 
over the telephone, despite a plethora of reputable credit cards, but I was 
forced to drive from Leisure World to the center to buy tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 In more than 40 years as both a volunteer and professional employee in the 
performing-arts field, I have applauded efforts to make the arts less elitist 
as basic to their survival. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been able to charge tickets of any price via telephone at Lyric Opera 
in Chicago and Portland Opera in Oregon. Why this price discrimination in 
Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
 And now OCPAC refuses to permit the performance of anything other than 
classical music? My, aren't we elitist! 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder what kind of fund raising will have to be undertaken to keep the 
center afloat! 
</P>
<P>
 JOAN FOSTER NUGENT, Laguna Hills Rap-Show Brawls Rapped 
</P>
<P>
 This is an open letter to all the rap fans who feel that a good brawl is the 
perfect topper to a rap concert. I'm not speaking as a rap fan, but as a 
veteran of more than 100 rock concerts, dating back almost 20 years. I have 
attended everything from concerts by Los Lobos to Bob Marley to X, and not once 
have I had a chair hurled at me. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, at a few of those X concerts, there were objects airborne. But those 
were bodies, and they were only involved in that unique pagan ritual known as 
slam dancing. No one was seriously injured, and not once were the riot police 
called in. 
</P>
<P>
 If rap fans wish to have venues such as the Forum and the Sports Arena 
continue to allow rap shows to be held there, some serious attitude changes 
will have to be made by those few "rotten apples" who insist on spoiling the 
fun for everyone else. 
</P>

 JOHN McELLIGOTT JR., Fullerton Not Scared by 'Jurassic Park' 
</P>
<P>
 I'm 12 years old and have just been to see "Jurassic Park," and both my 
7-year-old brother, Jesse, and I agree it is not as scary as the newspapers, 
like yours, and the news shows say. So please stop making such a big deal about 
it. Let people judge for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 CAITLIN KURVINK, Huntington Beach Butting Heads Over TV Cartoon 
</P>
<P>
 Beavis and Butt-head are not meant to be role models. They are not meant to 
educate the youth of America. What they are meant to do is be funny, and at 
that they succeed. They're the two losers we all had in our ninth-grade biology 
class who did nothing but sit in the back of the class and screw around with 
the Bunsen burners. 
</P>
<P>
 I am willing to admit that the show is for adolescents and adults and that I 
do not think small children should watch. I also agree with taking the show out 
of its 7 p.m. time slot, but for parents who say that they have no control over 
what their kids watch and that the show should be taken off the air, here's an 
idea: Turn the TV off. Or get rid of the TV and give your kids a book. But I'm 
not your kid, so stop telling me what to watch. 
</P>

 LUKE MANNIX, Capistrano Beach Blame Security, Not Bands 
</P>
<P>
 The stabbing that occurred Sept. 5 at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre may have 
been the second of its type reported over the last two years, but it is not as 
uncommon as city officials claim. 
</P>
<P>
 I witnessed a fight three years ago at Irvine Meadows during and after a 
concert by those hard-core thrash metal head-bangers Crosby, Stills & Nash. It 
began during intermission in the lawn section, erupted again halfway through 
the second half, then resumed afterward in the parking lot, with one person 
pulling out a knife. 
</P>
<P>
 No more than 10 people were actively involved; the other 9,990 of us were on 
our best behavior. It is a disgrace not only that the weapon was allowed in the 
venue, but also that the perpetrators were not thrown out immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 To blame (the recent) violence on Anthrax is a blatant show of 
irresponsibility by (former Irvine) Mayor (Sally Anne) Sheridan and the 
amphitheater management. Instead of trying to figure out which groups to ban, 
perhaps security could be improved so that we can enjoy our rock concerts in 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 GINNY CHAN, Westminster Fans Are Angry Like the Wolf 
</P>
<P>
 In regard to Mike Boehm's review of Duran Duran ("Duran Duran: No Mas, No 
Mas," Aug. 20): 
</P>
<P>
 It seems as if every single music review that your paper prints is bad. If a 
concert comes up and you don't like the group that's playing, don't go. Find 
somebody else who can enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups that are getting the bad reviews are extremely talented and don't 
deserve to be badgered because of your lack of interest. In my eyes, that arena 
was packed with people who thought Duran Duran was worth paying money for and 
worth screaming and cheering for. 
</P>
<P>
 SERENE WEBB, Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
 I was angered that the L.A. Times would send a close-minded blockhead to the 
Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 NICOLE SANDER, Anaheim Kathleen Battle's Recital 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Bernheimer wasn't the only one Battle-fatigued by the performance of 
(Kathleen Battle,) the dazzling diva, Our Lady of the Endless Encore ("An 
Exquisite -- Perhaps Too Exquisite -- Recital," May 17). I, too, became 
increasingly annoyed at the flailing arms, the sappy musicality and the mock 
humility (and did we have to clap after every song?). The encores in particular 
grew cloying, and, by the sixth, yes, the sixth one, I wished I was packing an 
overripe tomato. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll grant that she does have a beautiful, unforced voice; I would just rather 
hear her use it to serve the music than to serve herself. 
</P>
<P>
 ANNETTE NIBLEY, Laguna Beach Did Reviewer See Same Show as Fans? 
</P>
<P>
 I disagree with your review on Paul McCartney's concert at Anaheim Stadium 
("Still Believing in Yesterday," April 19). 
</P>
<P>
 You said Paul should have redone a song the way Eric Clapton did. First, Paul 
isn't Eric Clapton, and second, the Beatles' songs are impeccable the way they 
were written. The fans cherish the old songs, and you don't change something 
that's already perfect. Also, you said that most of the audience probably had 
been around at the time of the Beatles. Walking into the concert, I pointed out 
to my group that the parking lot was relatively full of teen-agers. I think 
it's great that the "older" fans were there, but you should have noted the 
younger ones, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul's concert was fantastic, everything a Beatles fan and a McCartney fan 
could expect. After an incredible concert, how could you end your article with 
a negative? Why not let it be? 
</P>
<P>
 JENNIFER PRESCOTT, Irvine Don't Water Down Stern 
</P>
<P>
 A thank you to Claudia Puig for her article on Howard Stern and KLSX's editing 
practices ("Stern Editing Elicits a New Kind of Shock," March 17). There seem 
to be two camps regarding Howard: Either you love him or you don't. Watering 
him down makes neither happy. 
</P>
<P>
 We have listened to Howard Stern since his first day in New York on WNBC radio 
in 1982. Since our move to Southern California, we have continued to listen 
because we had missed him terribly and we wanted to hear all of the shows. 
</P>
<P>
 People who are offended by Howard's show are not going to be less offended 
because some segments are omitted. They'll just have less material to be 
offended by. 
</P>
<P>
 And to Howard: Although we know that there must be a viable reason that you 
are keeping quiet about this, we are really disappointed that you are allowing 
this to happen. We feel cheated by KLSX and hope that this is a temporary 
situation. We have a lot of respect for you, Howard, and we'll always be loyal. 
Please don't let them do this to you -- or to us. 
</P>

 SHELLY and HOWARD KAPLAN, Rancho Santa Margarita Theater Education Support 
</P>
<P>
 As a sophomore at El Dorado High School, I have been thoroughly enriched 
through drama activities in the past two years. I can hardly begin to express 
my belief that theater education is a very necessary part of the high-school 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 My self-image has improved due to the constant positive reinforcement I 
receive from others. I have a greater understanding of myself through 
explorations of the characters I portray and the emotions and characteristics I 
am composed of. I have learned to accept criticism with grace and gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
 I have seen obvious improvements in my basic memorization, public speaking, 
improvisation, creative thinking, writing and listening skills. In addition, 
I've met new people, earned money, won awards, gained exposure for a possible 
future career and gained many irreplaceable memories. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask you, the public, to please support high-school theater and encourage the 
valuable benefits it can have. 
</P>
<P>
 JULIE D. REMALA, Placentia One Article Worth Saving, Other's Not 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for including Times TV critic Howard Rosenberg's review of the Grammy 
telecast ("It Was a Grand Night for Singing Michael's Praises," Feb. 25) next 
to Times staff writer Randy Lewis' piece on Michael Jackson's speech ("Winless 
Jackson Scores in Speech"). It clearly demonstrated what an "old poop" Howard 
is. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it's only these juxtapositions between an "old poop" and a fresh, 
new mind that allows us readers to see the full picture. Lewis' story is on my 
bulletin board for savoring. Rosenberg's is in the outhouse, replacing the 
discontinued Sears catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 JAN KNOWLTON, Anaheim A Critical Opinion 
</P>
<P>
 Re Martin Bernheimer's consistently ridiculing and invective reviews of 
practically every opera that Opera Pacific has presented (specifically "A 
Troubled 'Il Trovatore' at Arts Center," Jan. 11): 
</P>
<P>
 As for the sets on which he is consistently carping, where does he think Opera 
Pacific is going to get the funds to commission and build new sets for a 
limited season? In a time of recession, the expenditure of a million or more 
dollars to do the same would be unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, it wouldn't be a Bernheimer review unless he managed to slip 
in some snide remarks on the supertitles. The supertitles have opened up the 
willingness of countless of thousands of people who would be frightened away by 
the language barrier and never see an opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Give us a break! We need to encourage the outreach of the arts, not trash 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 CLARENCE AND CELIA TURNER, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Bernheimer responds: "I didn't complain that they borrowed the sets for 
'Il Trovatore,' only that they borrowed bad ones. And I didn't complain (this 
time) that they used supertitles, only that the staging contradicted the 
supertitles. As for encouraging the arts, pretending that bad is good helps no 
one, and it isn't the critic's job to act as a cheerleader." The Public Should 
See Real Murder 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Howard Rosenberg's column "A View to a Kill: How Low Can TV 
Go?" (Jan. 22), criticizing the TV news shows that aired the videotape of the 
man shooting his ex-wife to death while at the grave site of their teen-age 
daughter in Florida: 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg describes the tape as "deadly," "ugly," "gruesome" and 'horrible" 
but "valueless as news." He is vehement that it should not have been shown. 
</P>
<P>
 I disagree. I've been a deputy district attorney for the county of Los Angeles 
for 25 years and am no stranger to killing and murder. What this tape displays 
is horrible and grotesque, but that is exactly why it should be shown on TV. 
The public should know how horrible real murder is -- that it can happen in a 
heartbeat, that it is often perpetrated in the most cowardly and callous 
fashion, and that the victims are often women. 
</P>
<P>
 We have got to face and understand the reality of murder in order to deal with 
it as jurors, judges, legislators and citizens. Airing this tape was the right 
thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 RICHARD J. CHRYSTIE, Orange A 'Half Empty' Approach 
</P>
<P>
 I question Cathy Curtis' propensity to view the world "half empty" as she 
flailed the Bowers Museum's exhibits "Peru Before the Inca" and 'Colors of the 
Dawn/Invisible People: Arts of the Amazon" ("South American Cultures From the 
Wrong Angle," Oct. 19). 
</P>
<P>
 Given the enormity of discouraging cultural events in our daily lives, how 
appropriate and profitable a "half full" perspective might have been, as there 
was value to be appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 In her quest for substance, Curtis could have taken herself as well as her 
readers to the Bowers' third exhibit, "Memories, Milestones and Miracles," a 
multimedia expose on breast cancer, a "cultural reality." Breast cancer strikes 
one in nine women, be they mothers, wives, sisters, daughters, friends or 
lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 This statistic belies Curtis' diagnosis that the Bowers Museum suffers from an 
"allergy to ethnography and anthropology."

 No TV for Babs After All: Just two days before her first paid public 
performance in more than two decades, Barbra Streisand decided not to videotape 
the concerts after all. According to a statement read Friday by Streisand 
spokesman Michael Levine, she decided after two days of blocking and rehearsal 
that "the nine cameras were interfering with some of the audience's ability to 
see and enjoy the concert fully. Miss Streisand came to the decision after 
feeling that the taping compromised both the live and TV audience." Levine 
added, "So, with no television broadcast, it seems ticket-holders are the 
luckiest people in the world." Speculation is still rife that Streisand's 
sold-out New Year's Eve and New Year's Day concerts at the MGM Grand Hotel in 
Las Vegas could be precursors to a national tour, but Levine said that decision 
has not yet been made. TELEVISION

'SCHINDLER' RESONATES ON L.A.'S STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have just seen what I consider to be one of the most startling and brutally 
effective films of my recent memory, a film that is unrelenting in its 
realistic details, yet touching and life affirming and, yes, even entertaining. 
It is an extremely violent film, yet a film that neither glamorizes nor 
romanticizes violence. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a cry of awakening, of reaffirmation, for here is a film that can take 
one of the ugliest events on the human soul and still find a joy of being. This 
film achieves verisimilitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, ironically, "Schindler's List" was directed by the same man, Steven 
Spielberg, who created the "Indiana Jones" trilogy, which dehumanizes the 
killing of humans by clever and entertainingly choreographed and stylized 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no consequences to death in the kind of films the "Indiana Jones" 
trilogy represents; no one is affected by the killing, and the bodies are never 
disposed of. The emphasis is on violent action, not its consequence; we look at 
its doing, not the result. 
</P>
<P>
 As I sat and watched scene after scene of mindless horror in "Schindler's 
List," I was struck by a comparison to the mindless violence on our streets. 
Just as the German guards looked upon Jews as non-human, the drive-bys and 
automatic and semiautomatic weapons dehumanizingly distance attackers from 
victims. It is parents and friends who see the carnage and have to deal with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope the transformation of such directors as Spielberg and Clint Eastwood 
(who demythologized violence in "Unforgiven") will kill the romanticizing of 
violence in our popular art. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL VETRIE, Sylmar 
</P>
<P>
 I have no doubt that the "Schindler" story has provided Spielberg the vehicle 
for attempting to preserve a profound human experience that he has known all 
his life he must somehow try to present. 
</P>
<P>
 And I am reasonably certain he also knows that every other knowledgeable 
co-religionist must also have been constantly bedeviled by the urge to relate 
this episode of human depravity so as to alert others to the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg must be thanking God that he has been given this opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 WILLARD LEVIN, Rancho Palos Verdes 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg has done it again; creating a cinematic masterpiece. Like most 
people, this film outraged me. It is difficult to believe that these events 
actually took place. 
</P>
<P>
 I am writing this letter to ask both Universal Pictures and their distributors 
to make this film available to schools, civic groups and all educational 
outlets so that everyone can learn more about this unfortunate period in our 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 TOM CHALTAS, Studio City Work for Health Coverage 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the Dec. 22 article "Will Work for Health Coverage," concerning Lee 
Mathis, the healthy HIV-positive actor who placed an ad in Daily Variety 
seeking employment in order to maintain his Screen Actors Guild health 
insurance: 
</P>
<P>
 While I certainly can sympathize with Mathis' plight and admire his courage 
for coming forth so publicly, I couldn't help but think how ironic it is that 
someone like myself who is fortunate enough to be in relatively good health and 
to work in the entertainment industry has no health coverage. I am one of 
thousands of assistants in this industry who work without any health insurance 
from either the company or the trade unions. 
</P>
<P>
 I am extremely grateful to have a steady job in these difficult economic 
times, especially in a business that I love, but if I were to suddenly find 
myself facing a life-threatening disease I would not be able to appeal to 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 As many entertainment companies continue to make cutbacks in employee 
benefits, my situation is, sadly, far from unique. 
</P>
<P>
 BILL NORMYLE, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Look, I've been lucky. Through the Writers Guild and SAG, I've had health 
insurance for a long time. It's covered everything from the birth of my 
children to cosmetic chin repair from a racquetball -- yes, racquetball -- 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Now my coverage is expired. Why? Maybe because my last script sales were 
options, not hired work that counts toward coverage, or maybe because the 
free-lance hour writing market has shrunk, or maybe I'm too ugly to get an 
acting job. . . . I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 But, if my health coverage is restored, it'll be through my talent, 
persistence and luck, not because I whine publicly about my hard times. Who 
made this guy or any of us enter a chance business?

 PAUL EHRMANN, Santa Monica That's in Bad Taste 
</P>
<P>
 Concerning "After Brenda, Whither Shannen?" (Dec. 23), regarding Shannen 
Doherty and a list of work she could do after leaving "Beverly Hills, 90210," 
among them was: "Perhaps the Jim Rose Circus Sideshow will have an opening for 
the Incredible Crooked Eyeball Lady." 
</P>
<P>
 I am a professional comedy writer, and I find this to be in exceedingly bad 
taste. To suggest, even in apparent fun, that people with physical 
abnormalities should be hustled off to circus sideshows is abhorrent. 
</P>

 DOUGLAS WYMAN, Studio City Photo Diminishes Actor 
</P>
<P>
 Give us a break: Your Dec. 14 article on Wes Studi is acceptable; the photo by 
Tony Barnard and whoever made the selection is not ("I Came Into the Business 
at the Right Time"). 
</P>
<P>
 That boudoir shot of Studi is ridiculous. He is an actor and not Geronimo, but 
he has a commanding presence that you have totally negated. Truman Capote he's 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans today are attempting to restore dignity to the Native Americans we 
have damaged. Your photo doesn't help. 
</P>

 PANO DOUROS, Venice 'Hemingway' Exhilarates 
</P>
<P>
 I had just come from seeing "Wrestling Ernest Hemingway." I was exhilarated. 
Then I read Peter Rainer's review ("Actors Over the Top in 'Hemingway,' " Dec. 
17). I read it three times to make sure we'd seen the same film. First I was 
amazed, then annoyed, then worried. I was worried that someone would read such 
phrases as "life-affirming mush" (what does that mean?) and "soppy cantankerous 
coots" and deprive him/herself of seeing a wonderful, emotion-filled story. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Duvall, Richard Harris and director Randa Haines have made some 
deliberate choices that this viewer thinks work. If this movie slobbers, it can 
slobber on my shoulder any time! 
</P>
<P>
 LYNN ROTH, Los Angeles Las Vegas Theme Park 
</P>
<P>
 The MGM Grand Theme Park, part of the MGM Grand Casino and Hotel complex, is 
an absolutely dismal attempt at Las Vegas' first theme park. It has just six 
rides, featuring two especially horrible ones. One is the Lightning Bolt, a 
lame and very short rip-off of Disneyland's Space Mountain; the other is the 
Haunted Mine, a very unpleasant trip through an abandoned mine filled with 
skeletons. 
</P>
<P>
 The major portion of the park features some cheesy movie-set streets and 
numerous snack bars. A few of the stores feature some nice items (such as 
animation cels). 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California may no longer be the aerospace center of the nation, but 
its supremacy in theme parks remains unchallenged!

THEATER REVIEW; TAKING THE CONGENIALITY OUT OF 'CAMELOT'; SOME BRIGHT MOMENTS 
OF SWEET MUSICALITY ARE SET APART BY HAPHAZARD STAGING AT THE PANTAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a few brief shining moments in the American musical theater, they wrote 
'em like "Camelot." And for more than a few brief shining moments in the 
staging that just arrived at the Pantages, even those born long after the last 
gasp of the Eisenhower era can glimpse why shows like this last. 
</P>
<P>
 Full of schmaltz but a finely crafted example of its operetta-like genre 
nonetheless, the 1960 Lerner and Loewe classic breezed into Los Angeles for a 
two-week engagement on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it didn't exactly breeze in. But it didn't wheeze in either, as touring 
productions are sometimes wont to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, it both soared and sank. For this revival has what any production 
should envy: Loewe's lilting score and unabashedly romantic ballads, brought to 
you by not one, but the three staunch leading performers: Robert Goulet (King 
Arthur), Patricia Kies (Guenevere) and Richard White (Sir Lancelot). 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it's staged, especially in Act I, as if the mythical English idyll 
Camelot's main crop were concrete and everybody's got their feet stuck in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Plodding along through Lerner's often tedious book, the direction flattens the 
story of the king whose wife and most trusted knight fall in love. All told, 
director Norbert Joerder betrays "Camelot" more vilely than Arthur's evil 
bastard son Mordred, who rats on the affair between Guenevere and Lancelot. 
</P>
<P>
 Joerder, in fact, seems to be doing all he can to make you wait as long as 
possible between the moments of clean, sweet musicality. But the less staging 
in a scene in this production, the better it tends to be: The crowd scenes are 
as botched as the solos and duets are eloquent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Dramatic Moments are thrown away. Even when Guenevere is tied to the 
stake and ready to burn and Arthur has to make an agonizing choice, it's hard 
to get beyond the physical clutter and diffused focus. Similarly, Arthur and 
Guenevere's painful last farewell, which flits by as spear carriers mill about, 
is so quick it's nearly painless. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you can't get the climax to work, what have you got? Not the comic 
relief -- in the person of the old knight Pellinore, whose dotterings provide 
an inadvertent lesson in why vaudeville died. Not even the spectacle scenes, 
such as "The Jousts," which echoes the "Ascot Gavotte" number in the 1956 (and 
generally superior) Lerner & Loewe hit "My Fair Lady." There's no heartache in 
the heroics, no pizazz in the pomp. 
</P>
<P>
 What you do have, however, are some concert-quality renditions of classic 
musical theater set pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 When the crystalline-voiced Kies sits down and sings her tender anthem "Before 
I Gaze at You Again" near the end of Act I, for example, or her later "I Loved 
You Once in Silence," all the preceding distraction melts away. Likewise, when 
White ably belts out the famously overwrought love song "If Ever I Would Leave 
You," the music works as it's meant to, on your soft spot rather than your 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Goulet, who originated the Lancelot role in 1960 and is now in the part 
created by Richard Burton, also brings the right combination of magnanimous 
charm and elegant magnetism to his role. And while the Arthur role doesn't 
provide Goulet with quite the opportunity to show off his mellifluous baritone, 
Goulet makes the most of the half-spoken, half-sung score. 
</P>
<P>
 He's especially compelling in the latter half of the story, once Arthur has 
figured out the attraction between Guenevere and Lancelot and decided to grin 
and bear it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arthurian parable is played out against the backdrop of an ornate but 
generic set that exacerbates the staging's liabilities. Crowding and pushing 
the action forward to the front third of the Pantages proscenium, it neither 
allows the group scenes to breathe, nor affords the intimacy that's needed for 
Arthur and Guenevere's chamber tete-a-tetes.  
</P>

JAZZ REVIEW; A TUNEFUL TENORMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rickey Woodard, whose quartet took charge Thursday at the Brasserie of the Bel 
Age Hotel, knows all the answers to the perennial question: How should the 
tenor saxophone really be played? 
</P>
<P>
 After decades of mauling, distortion and musical logorrhea threatened to 
destroy its essential beauty, the tenor sax has survived in the hands of men 
like Woodard, who know that a strong, consistent sound and continuity of ideas 
can cancel out the need for spurious effects. 
</P>
<P>
 It was evident from the first chorus of "In a Mellotone" that Woodard was in 
command and was equipped to remain so indefinitely. Ideas flowed from the horn 
without ever losing sight of the necessity to remain melodically inventive, and 
without resorting to fashionable freak notes or split tones. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a similar sense of authority in "The Night Has a Thousand Eyes" -- 
the title song of a 1948 movie -- a tune equipped with comfortable chord 
changes that Woodard, pianist Bill Henderson and bassist Jeff Littleton dealt 
with handily. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodard's most melodic moments were reserved for "My One and Only Love," a 
ballad recorded 40 years ago by Frank Sinatra. His ability to tackle the blues 
head on was well in evidence on "Red Top," a Gene Ammons line that also found 
Henderson stretching out convincingly at the keyboard. The set ended with a 
Hank Mobley original that offered solo space to a fine drummer, Harold Mason.

FAMILY ATTRACTION REVIEW; THIS YEAR'S 'WORLD ON ICE' A COOL BEAUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Walt Disney's World on Ice Presents Beauty and the Beast" may not be the 
snappiest show title to come down the pike, but given the two-hour extravaganza 
that is playing in three Southern California locations, its clarity is 
undeniable. 
</P>
<P>
 Produced by Kenneth Feld, the honcho behind the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & 
Bailey Circus, this show is just what the title suggests: With few exceptions, 
it re-creates the 1991 Disney film to a T. 
</P>
<P>
 The show continues through Jan. 9 in Anaheim, and runs Jan. 11-17 at the Los 
Angeles Sports Arena and Jan. 19-23 at the Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is the same, the characters are the same, the Academy Award-winning 
Howard Ashman-Alan Menken score is the same. Shoot, even most of the 
pre-recorded voices are the same, up to and including Robby Benson as the 
gravel-voiced Beast. 
</P>
<P>
 So why schlep out to a chilly arena when you can enjoy the video in the 
comfort of your own La-Z-Boy? For starters, the ice-show format adds a romantic 
sheen and an extra measure of drama that animation, no matter how slick, can't 
match. For example, when Belle, skated by Maradith Feinberg, sings wistfully of 
wanting "so much more than this provincial life," she glides and swirls 
dreamily across the full length of the arena. 
</P>
<P>
 When she and the love-struck Beast waltz, they seem to float above the surface 
of the ice -- no mean feat considering the bulky, seven-foot-tall costume that 
skater Craig Horowitz wears. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mickey-philes, there's the de rigueur visit from the mouse and his gang, 
who open the show in an unrelated musical skit that involves a few young 
members of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad guys take on extra chill on the ice. As Gaston, the consummate village 
baddie, Russian singles skater Victor Barshevtsev swoops and leaps menacingly, 
and delivers frequent flying kicks to his lackey LeFou (Joe Daysog), who 
obliges with belly flops into the front row. 
</P>
<P>
 And, although small in number, the two wolves that lurk in the dark forest 
outside the Beast's castle are made more threatening by athletic, almost 
violent lifts and throws of Russian pair skaters Olga Neizvestnaya and Sergei 
Zaitsev. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the forest's atmosphere of danger are a chorus of skaters dressed as 
barren trees and eerie creatures of the night, who crisscross and circle the 
ice at breakneck speeds under black light. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're not familiar with the Disney film, be forewarned that it bears only 
a passing resemblance to the original folk tale about a beautiful and loyal 
daughter who voluntarily takes her father's place as prisoner in the castle of 
a mysterious beast, and with her love, eventually breaks the spell that binds 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 In Disney's hands, the hexed servants are transformed into household objects 
ranging from an amorous candlestick to a peevish mantle clock, and the whole 
lot of them have a convenient taste for splashy production numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the film's big numbers are re-created here, notably the "Be Our Guest" 
scene, in which Belle is entertained by a Ziegfield-style show of dinnerware. 
Chorus skaters decked out to resemble table settings bundled in glittering 
napkins and even fully laden tables perform standard ice-follies moves for 
Belle's entertainment, and cap it off with a full-scale can-can. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest you think this silver is just for show, in the second act, these same 
characters team up with other home accessories in a choreographed brawl with 
the villagers who storm the castle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the skaters they employ are certainly skilled, Walt Disney's World on 
Ice emphasizes spectacle and storytelling, not skating. If you prefer a 
showcase for professional-level figure skating, you are better off with 
something like the new Dorothy Hamill's Ice Capades. 
</P>
<P>
 There are times in this show in which the skating and storytelling become 
uncomfortable partners, such as a tavern scene in which Neizvestnaya and 
Zaitsev perform an athletic ice dance. It is impressive to behold, but 
nevertheless seems out of place and interrupts the pacing. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the marriage is more successful than in previous "World on Ice" shows, 
like last year's "Double Feature," which relied heavily on a wham-bam 
variety-show format and technical effects.

TV REVIEWS; 'VIPER' TRAVELING DOWN A ROCKY ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Knight Rider," move over. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC rolls out its version of demolition derby at 9 p.m. Sunday with a two-hour 
premiere of "Viper," a series about yet another crime-fighting sports car and 
"the three-man vigilante team behind it." This clunker's regular time slot, on 
Channels 4, 36 and 39, is 8 p.m. Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 Viper is a high-tech, gizmo-glitzed car created by a paraplegic genius named 
Julian Wilkes (Dorian Harewood) who gets to sit in front of computer screens 
saying things like, "I'm reading armor-panel breakdown." The best thing about 
the premiere is that his disability goes unmentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Viper's "wheelman" -- or driver, to the unhip -- is Joe Astor (James 
McCaffrey), a career criminal who surgically has been given amnesia and 
transformed into a good guy on the orders of officials of a city being 
terrorized by a crime syndicate known as the Outfit. Despite his felonious 
pedigree, Joe is deep, real deep. Before finding the big boss of the Outfit, 
Joe remarks pensively, he has to find someone else: "Myself." 
</P>
<P>
 If that isn't funny enough for you, No. 3 in the Viper troika is a laughman, 
motorpool specialist Frankie Waters (Joe Nipote), who talks like, hey, y'know, 
his speech coach is Kirk, the Jere Burns character in NBC's late "Dear John." 
</P>
<P>
 Tire-squealing clashes between Viper and the Outfit -- which devilishly plans 
to hijack plague anti-toxin and hold it for ransom -- are mindlessly violent, 
to say nothing of awesomely inane. 
</P>
<P>
 The best is when the Outfit's low-life operatives peel away from their evil 
deeds in four matching black sports cars. That way the cops couldn't possibly 
spot them. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by series creators Paul De Meo and Danny Bilson ("The Flash"), the 
script gives Joe a love interest (Sydney Walsh) while favoring technology over 
humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the Viper's unspectacular special effects are basically upgraded 
James Bond or modified Batmobile, the car looks sturdier than the series.

TV REVIEWS; LOST-AND-FOUND LOVE IN 'JANE'S HOUSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surgical departure from his characteristically tense screen persona, 
James Woods is virtually unrecognizable as a recovering, melancholy widower 
fitfully raising two kids and taking a second chance on love and marriage in 
"Jane's House" (Sunday night at 9, Channels 2 and 8). 
</P>
<P>
 Attractively teamed with Anne Archer as a chic sports marketing executive who 
revives the widower's lost romantic impulses, Woods catches the uncertainty, 
selfishness and subtle weakness of an ordinary, endearing father bringing a new 
woman into the house one year after the death of his first wife (the entitled 
Jane, whose off-screen presence even in death is palpable). 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than stooping to easy, predictable melodrama befalling a new wife 
confronted by two hostile children, co-producer and director Glenn Jordan 
weaves a fragile tone into Eric Roth's tremulous teleplay (adapted from a novel 
by Robert Kimmel Smith). 
</P>
<P>
 The picture, shot in Vancouver but set in leafy, upper-middle-class Long 
Island, is quietly expressive and redolent of warm neighbors, a living room 
wedding, touch football games on the front lawn and surviving children coping, 
like dad, with painful loss. Especially convincing in her hurtful spite is 
Missy Crider's beleaguered teen daughter. As the sweetly forlorn younger 
brother, Keegan MacIntosh is much more credible here than in CBS' other movie 
about family strife (see accompanying review). 
</P>
<P>
 Anchored to themes of traumatic change and requisite compromise, the real 
drama in "Jane's House" involves Archer's over-accommodating stepmother, who 
gradually begins to lose all sense of herself. Archer never overplays the hand 
of an outsider who finally, like mending broken crockery, flashes the anger and 
instinctual self-preservation that salvages the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 She presses upon Woods' naively complacent husband the hard lesson that he 
can't relive the past by wedging her into it and should have moved her into a 
brand-new house in the first place. In a nice climactic touch, we cut to moving 
men carrying out household plants. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a curious prime-time movie insofar as so little appears to be 
happening on its surface. But it should connect with anyone adjusting to loss 
and the giddy explosion of newfound horizons. Good Intentions Go Awry in 
'Aaron' 
</P>
<P>
 A drama about mental illness, "For Love of Aaron" (tonight at 9, Channels 2 
and 8), may not be everyone's cheery idea of gearing up for the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
 And Meredith Baxter's fierce, overwrought and mannered performance as a wildly 
unstable divorced mom, whose tense eyeballs always appear on the verge of 
springing from her head, is both grueling and hangover-inducing for those on 
the mend from last night, not to mention football. You would never think this 
is the same actress who was so convincing as that other troubled wife, Betty 
Broderick. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the true-life demons and ultimate recovery of author Margaret Gibson, 
the production is a case of good intentions gone awry. Gibson's treatment of 
her personal ordeal (adapted for TV by Peter Silverman) is so cloying in its 
depiction of a semi-crazed mother emotionally and physically dependent on her 
young son that it's difficult to maintain empathy for either one of them, let 
alone the boy's estranged, insensitive father (Nick Mancuso) who blithely 
describes his ex-wife as a "freak." Even Mancuso looks uncomfortable playing 
this stiff knucklehead. 
</P>
<P>
 For that matter, the little boy, the entitled Aaron (a near beatific Keegan 
MacIntosh) has, understandably, serious problems of his own. Primary is his 
reliance on an imaginary playmate he calls Grover, a stuffed toy for whom Mom 
provides chirpy voice-over in puppet-like moments that are more weird than 
lovable. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all too much. Crucially missing is any viable background or psychiatric 
insight to Gibson's mental dilemma. We never get inside her or understand why 
she's forever brushing her hair. 
</P>
<P>
 John Kent Harrison's direction, oddly enough, is better in the supporting 
roles (John Kapelos' doctor, Malcolm Stewart's lawyer and Blu Mankuma's social 
worker). 
</P>
<P>
 In the final 15 minutes, much too late to salvage the show, the movie veers 
into the mother's involving child custody case, climaxed when the acclaimed 
author and by-now-heroine delivers an avant-garde poem that consumes a full 
minute of broadcast time and sounds inspired by Dylan Thomas -- a nice, daring 
literary touch for TV drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive producer Marian Rees, whose judgment is normally unerring, arguably 
made a mistake in letting Gibson write the autobiographical treatment. More 
distance, not a mirror-closeness, seemed needed. RAY LOYND

RESOLVING PUBLIC ILLS, PRIVATE PECCADILLOES

<P>
 It seems like just about everyone makes them. But not too many keep them. 
</P>
<P>
 New Year's in the United States is one of the most festive celebrations of the 
holiday season, according to the book "Folklore of American Holidays." And 
ranking up there with the burning of Yule logs, Champagne toasts, the 
Tournament of Roses Parade and college football are pledges of good resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's prominent figures in government, business, education, law, 
sports and other fields are adopting New Year's resolutions that cover 
virtually everything from losing weight to making their communities safer from 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 As Marie Gray, founder of St. John Knits, summarized her New Year's 
resolution: "Take time to smell the roses." 
</P>
<P>
 Resolutions, however, aren't for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't made a resolution since I was a kid," said Edgar Z. Seal, 
superintendent of Brea-Olinda Unified School District. "I haven't even thought 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 And Diane Crow, regional manager of the California Teachers' Assn., who's 
seeking ways to change public schools, said: "I never make resolutions. I just 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what others in Orange County vow and hope for in 1994: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dean Koontz, best-selling suspense author: 
</P>
<P>
 "I resolve henceforth to blame all my problems and shortcomings on someone 
else. This is now the American way. No one takes responsibility for his or her 
own life anymore. I can't blame Columbus; he's taken. Ronald Reagan is out, 
because he's already been blamed for everything from River Phoenix's drug 
overdose to a star that went nova at the far end of the galaxy. I'd blame 
Roseanne Arnold's parents, but Roseanne has hammered pretty hard on them. So 
I'm resolving to blame all my problems on the dinosaurs. If they hadn't become 
extinct, the human species would not now rule the planet. If they hadn't 
shirked their responsibilities as the dominant species of their time, I would 
never have been born. Therefore, I wouldn't have all these flaws. Those rotten, 
insensitive, selfish, darn dinosaurs. By their very absence, they are my 
oppressors. Boy, I can't wait to try this one on my wife the next time she asks 
me why I forgot to take out the garbage." 
</P>
<P>
 * Jack D. Lindquist, former president of Disneyland: 
</P>
<P>
 "Bring the Disney Classic to Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 * James Doti, president of Chapman University. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm resolving to give shorter speeches, give more optimistic economic 
forecasts, and to perfect my in-line skating so that student members of our 
club won't have to wait for me to catch up." 
</P>
<P>
 * Mac Bernd, superintendent, Newport-Mesa Unified School District: 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen, listen, listen, and listen some more." 
</P>
<P>
 * Larry Leaman, director of the Orange County Social Services Agency: 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal for 1994 is to try and convince the public and elected officials 
that while this trend toward violence is something that needs to be dealt with 
from a law enforcement perspective, that's just treating the symptoms. We also 
need to look at how we can help families and correct alarming trends before 
they become irreparable. There has to be a family-preservation component of 
whatever government does -- not just a 'throw them all in jail' mentality." 
</P>
<P>
 * Bruce D. May, labor lawyer at Stradling, Yocca, Carlson & Rauth, Newport 
Beach: 
</P>
<P>
 "To teach my children to love their neighbors, protect the Earth, stay away 
from guns and drugs and do one good deed a day without taking credit for it." 
</P>
<P>
 * Kathryn Thompson, Aliso Viejo developer: 
</P>
<P>
 "I would very much like to see what I could do to help resolve the problem of 
violence in our community. Perhaps I could be instrumental in legislation 
regarding guns or gangs, I am not sure at this point. But I am very concerned 
about what I see. When a young girl is shot in my own hometown of Dana Point, 
it's very scary." 
</P>
<P>
 * Buck Rodgers, Angels manager: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see us become the safest county and state in the union, where 
people can go out at night and be safe. We need to pull together and support 
our law enforcement people rather than jump on them for every mistake they 
make. To me, there could be no greater gift for our area than that." 
</P>
<P>
 * James D. Ruth, Anaheim city manager: 
</P>
<P>
 "Deal with the loss of jobs, find better employment opportunities for people 
and see the economy turn around." 
</P>
<P>
 * John Crean, Fortune 500 RV manufacturer: 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make more friends. I treasure them. You've got to make new ones 
because you lose old ones -- they die, move away. I'm a people person. Without 
friends, I'd be a big nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 * Rudy Castruita, superintendent, Santa Ana Unified School District: 
</P>
<P>
 "To be a better person to everyone in our schools and be supportive of what 
they're trying to accomplish. Just to try and get through another year of this 
thing called education." 
</P>
<P>
 * David (Kid) Ramos, Anaheim guitarist, songwriter and leader of the Kid Ramos 
and Big Rhythm Combo, a six-member blues band: "I'd like to lose some weight 
and get my hair taller." 
</P>
<P>
 * Milton A. Gordon, president of Cal State Fullerton: 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to continue to assist all of those with whom I have contact to 
encourage and empower them to see their positive virtues and strengths and to 
discourage them from dwelling on their weaknesses and weaknesses of others." 
</P>
<P>
 * Dr. Melvin Sterling, president of the Orange County Medical Assn.: 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I would like to keep doing what I'm doing. My goals are not 
really different from most physicians'. We want to continue to practice 
medicine that we believe to be of high quality without being handicapped by the 
intrusion of insurance companies or other people who come between the doctor 
and patient. We want to maintain patients' rights to make their own decisions 
about their health care." 
</P>
<P>
 * Brad Mayne, general manager of the Anaheim Arena: 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to get more sold-out concerts, more parking spaces and 
additional sports programming. . . . I would also be real pleased with 
consecutive Roller Hockey International championships." 
</P>

<P>
 "I will spend more time with my granddaughter."

</P>
<P>
 "To take the many changes that are on the horizon, both of our own making and 
those things that are imposed from the state or from the outside, and help the 
professional staff, the teachers, the parents and the students prepare for and 
adjust to those changes, and make everything work. There's just so much 
happening. . . . And I also intend to go on a diet." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to find something that's creative and wonderful to do that is 
somewhat apart from my work."  
</P>
<P>
 * Merritt Johnson, president of Orange County United Way: 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to play a role in bringing the community together to heal the wounds 
from the fire, the violence in the streets and the alienation that some people 
feel. We also want to get back to the basics of neighbor helping neighbor and 
caring for those who can't care for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 * Trish Smith, biologist with the Nature Conservancy and director of the 
Irvine Co. Open Space Reserve: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Laguna fire created a great opportunity for land managers to work 
cooperatively to solve common problems; it's a chance for us to really develop 
coast fire monitoring programs, fire management strategies and cooperative 
programs for public access. My resolution is to help make that happen. The fire 
has really gotten us together." 
</P>
<P>
 * Tom Mathews, director of planning for Orange County's Environmental Agency: 
</P>
<P>
 "To communicate what we're doing better so that the public can appreciate the

ONCE AGAIN, FULLERTON RESIDENTS END YEAR WITH GOOD, CLEAN FUN; CELEBRATION: 
ALCOHOL-FREE, FAMILY-ORIENTED FIRST NIGHT FESTIVITIES TAKE OVER DOWNTOWN FROM 7 
P.M. TILL MIDNIGHT. AN ESTIMATED 10,000 ATTEND. 
</P>

<P>
 Most children her age would have to wake up to see 1994, but 3 1/2-year-old 
Jenna Ririe was determined to welcome the new year in person. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to bed," Jenna announced from her stroller Friday night, 
making the noisemaker she spun live up to its name. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping to wear her out and put her to bed early," said Sheila Ririe, 
Jenna's mom. "I guess not." 
</P>
<P>
 The Riries of Chino Hills were among an estimated 10,000 people who attended 
Fullerton's third annual First Night Fullerton, a family-oriented, alcohol-free 
New Year's Eve celebration.  
</P>
<P>
 From 7 p.m. to midnight, families took over downtown Fullerton, which turned 
into a festive street carnival with live bands, pony rides, jugglers, food 
booths, fireworks and even an inflatable "Moon Bounce." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of Champagne, the revelers tossed back fruit juice and Pepsis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great New Year's Eve and this is a great way to celebrate it," said 
Fullerton Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin as he kicked off the festivities from a 
stage outside the Fullerton Museum Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 100 other cities nationwide host similar First Night parties that blend 
a salute to the arts with a clean-theme New Year's Eve. Other smaller-scale 
events also were held elsewhere in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing at places with a clean environment, we think it's cool," said Trash, 
33, one of the founding members of the island rock-style band Sol La Ti, which 
performed at Fullerton's festival. "The family thing is cool, too." 
</P>
<P>
 For John Kade, a bass player with Sol La Ti, the alcohol-free evening 
represented the continuance of a personal victory. A former alcoholic, Kade 
said he is now in recovery and has not had a drink in nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the main reasons I'm playing in this band at all is because I'm 
sober," said Kade, 35, of Chino Hills. "I have to be careful about myself." 
</P>
<P>
 The night seemed to belong to the youngsters, who spent their last hours of 
1993 jumping on the Moon Bounce, riding ponies, listening to bluegrass music 
and making chalk drawings on the streets. Lauren Tekip, 7, drew a banana on 
Harbor Boulevard, one of many streets blocked off to traffic during the 
five-hour festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't normally get to do this because a car would squish you into a 
million pieces," said Lauren, who lives in La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the second year that Lauren and her mother, Ardice, attended the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have the worries you have in other places," Ardice Tekip said. 
"It's one of those few times when there aren't so many obnoxious people out." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were just content to avoid late-night traffic. Joseph Bowman, for one, 
walked to the festival from his nearby home. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just drive weird on New Year's Eve," said Bowman, 26. "And we just 
don't want to be on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of alcohol and the event's strong family appeal have traditionally 
made disturbances virtually nonexistent, according to event organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People understand this is an alcohol-free event, and they know they aren't 
welcome to come in here causing trouble and spoiling it for everyone," said 
Stephen Wilber, special events coordinator for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar alcohol-free events for families were held in Newport Beach and 
elsewhere in Fullerton on Friday evening. The Newport Dunes Resort offered a 
fireworks display, campfires on the beach, movies and mugs of hot chocolate at 
the waterfront resort.

FROM SUNKEN TREASURES TO WEIRD MAPS, IT'S A MYSTERY; RECORDS: COUNTY OFFICIALS 
ARE PLAGUED BY UNSOLVED INTRIGUES -- SOME GRIM, SOME MERELY PUZZLING -- THAT 
REFUSE TO GO AWAY AS 1994 BEGINS.

<P>
 The New Year promises a fresh start, the opportunity to shed the baggage of 
365 days of loose ends and unaccomplished goals. 
</P>
<P>
 With a few exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 When 1993 departed, it left a handful of unanswered questions to plague Orange 
County officials and record-keepers, mysteries that refuse to go away. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the Orange County coroner's office last year noted the passing of 
three men and two women who were marked for perpetuity as anonymous, bringing 
to an even dozen the number of John and Jane Does recorded in the past three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 101 reasons why people might not be identified," said deputy 
coroner Cullen Ellingburgh. "Maybe no one knows they are missing or there are 
only skeletal remains" which are difficult to identify, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, Ellingburgh added, only a very small number of missing persons 
reports on file with authorities contain dental records, making it very 
difficult to identify skeletal remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every unanswered mystery is grim, though. Some simply reek of adventure. 
Take the case of the sunken merchant ship laden with riches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most frequently asked-for shipwreck record is for the Adda Hancock, which 
blew up in Los Angeles Harbor in 1863," said Suzanne Dewberry, assistant 
director of the National Archives in Laguna Niguel. "Apparently it had gold 
bullion on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dewberry said that of a "whole bunch" of sunken ships off the coast, the Adda 
Hancock is far and away the favorite among treasure hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think it's a test to see if we're able to answer," she said of 
the questions posed by people with that golden glow in their eyes. "Something 
in old newspaper articles leads them to believe" the ship was carrying gold 
bullion when it sank. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, archive staffers have searched for a clue so often they don't even have 
to look any more in order to say there's nothing in their 19,000 cubic feet of 
government records to clear up this mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through it time and time again," Dewberry said. "We have never, 
ever found any records for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government holds no monopoly on mysteries. There is more than one 
unanswered riddle filed away in the subterranean vaults of the Orange County 
government archives in the old County Courthouse in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, what's the deal with that 140-year-old map of a stretch of 
English countryside? 
</P>
<P>
 Last February, stacks of aging court exhibits from the 1930s that had become 
separated from their respective case files were transferred from the county 
clerk's office to the archives for storage. 
</P>
<P>
 But one yellowed, oversized map had no case number stamped on it, even though 
it bore a large letter "A," indicating it probably had been an exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at a modern map of England and I couldn't find it," said archive 
technician Ana Christensen. "But we did enough research to find out what area 
it represented -- West Yorkshire. It's probably less than a square mile." 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to connect the map to an Orange County court case, Christensen turned 
across the sea for help. "We got the address of the Sheffield city museum and 
made a facsimile of the map . . . and sent it to them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Lisa A. Atkinson of the Sheffield Archives provided what news she 
could. "The map was most likely drawn in Sheffield . . . circa 1850," Atkinson 
wrote in a letter to Orange County archivists. 
</P>
<P>
 A check of English census, tax and property records, voter rolls and old maps 
had proven a dead end. 
</P>
<P>
 "And she never did identify why it was here," or why it should show up in a 
stack of 1930s-era Orange County court documents, Christensen said. "It's the 
wrong country and the wrong century." 
</P>
<P>
 In another corner of the Orange County Archives, a turn-of-the-century map of 
Fullerton poses a couple of intriguing questions of its own: Exactly who was 
buried alongside that roadway, and where did the bodies go? 
</P>
<P>
 The map turns up in a file from an 1898 petition for a new road that appears 
to be the forerunner of Associated Road in Fullerton, north of Yorba Linda 
Boulevard, Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to the east side of the road are what appear to be markers just above the 
notation "graves."  
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like three crosses," Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 A further curiosity is that the review board that studied the road request and 
wrote a three-page report to the Board of Supervisors made not even a passing 
reference to the grave sites, Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple years after the request was denied, another was submitted with a copy 
of the map, complete with markers and the same notation. But again there was no 
reference to the graves in the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been that it was on somebody's old homestead, a family 
graveyard," speculated Tom Cordry, an Orange County Cemetery District manager. 
"Before they would have issued them any permits to put a road through there, 
they probably would have had to move those bodies in those graves and interred 
them somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, he suggested, "you might be able to dig around there and 
find something. They were a lot more lax about things in those days." 
</P>
<P>
 The county recorder's office may have solved one last mystery that resides in 
an oversized musty old book that duly records in 17 pages the county's entire 
"Record of Oyster Beds." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a record of oyster beds," allowed assistant recorder Ella Murphy, 
"but there's no record of oysters ever being taken out of Orange County water." 
</P>
<P>
 For the record: Early this century, a state law made it illegal to dump sewage 
or other garbage into waters where oysters were being cultivated. 
</P>
<P>
 Seizing this opportunity, locals who may best be characterized as the vanguard 
of the environmental movement came up with a scheme to keep the waters off 
Newport Beach pollution-free. 
</P>
<P>
 From June 9, 1910, through Sept. 13, 1920, these ocean-loving activists filed 
claims with the recorder's office purporting to identify oyster beds just off 
Newport. 
</P>
<P>
 But, according to Murphy, the Orange County Historical Commission has since 
determined that there is no record of a single oyster ever being pulled from 
those waters.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / A GALLERY OF MUSEUMS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 'RAD' PLACE FOR 
SURFING FANS TO VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Visitors from 38 nations and 50 states have raved about the Huntington Beach 
International Surfing Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing fans fill a visitors' registration book on the museum director's desk 
with laudatory comments like "rad," "stoked," "cosmic" and "this place rules." 
One visitor wrote, "The most fun I've ever had in a museum." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum, at 411 Olive Ave. in the city's downtown area, is dedicated to 
preserving the history of surfing, honoring its legends, and keeping alive the 
memory of Duke Kahanamoku, perhaps the world's most famous surfer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,200-square-foot building offers an international collection of 
surfboards and surfing-related artifacts. Its most recent acquisition is eight 
U.S. Surfing Championship Perpetual Trophies inscribed with the names of 
legendary surfers from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Champions include Pete Peterson, Hobie Alter, Mike Doyle, Don Hansen, Joyce 
Hoffman, Linda Benson and Jericho Popper. The trophies were donated several 
weeks ago by George Draper, who retired from the surfboard business last year. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the museum's most popular displays, Surfboards of Distinction, features 
the Waikiki board, which dates back to the 1800s and was used in the waters off 
Hawaii, museum director Ann Beasley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The display includes a board formerly owned by resident Corky Carroll, a world 
champion and one of the most famous local surfers. Also displayed is a 1949 
board made by pioneer shaper Bob Simmons, who was the first to use the 
principles of aerodynamics, according to Beasley. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum tried to acquire a surfboard that was presented to President Ronald 
Reagan when he retired from office, but there was too much red tape, Beasley 
said. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), who surfs, loaned his board 
to the museum instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to say it hung in the halls of Congress," Beasley quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Other exhibits include a tribute to Duke Kahanamoku, who popularized the sport 
and is known as the father of surfing, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 An exhibit is dedicated to the Palos Verdes Surfing Club, the oldest 
continuously active surfing club in the country, according to Beasley. Members 
celebrated the club's 50th anniversary earlier this year at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is open Wednesday through Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. during the 
winter. Admission is $2 for adults and $1 for students. ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / A GALLERY OF MUSEUMS: COSTA MESA; SCIENCE FINDS A SPOT AT 
THE CRYSTAL COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Page Pivirn, 7, wound up for the pitch and let the whiffle ball fly, as a 
radar clocked his speed at a personal best: 44 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The radar demonstration is one of Page's favorite at the Launch Pad, a small 
science museum in the Crystal Court shopping center, where scientific 
principles are taught through games. 
</P>
<P>
 Page also liked the angular momentum display: a small circular platform on 
which a person spins. Sticking out his leg, Page slowed his rotational speed; 
holding his limbs tight to his body, he spun more quickly. "You can get sick on 
this," confided Page, who added that he has seen it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Launch Pad, which opened in June, holds more than 30 demonstrations of 
electricity, momentum, sound, light and other scientific subjects. All of the 
exhibits require people to trigger the display. 
</P>
<P>
 The small museum is a preview of the 88,000-square-foot Discovery Science 
Center, scheduled to open in 1997 in Santa Ana. The $37.5-million museum will 
have more interactive exhibits, an IMAX theater and science classes for county 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Staffers at the Launch Pad teach brief classes now. For instance, Dan Pick 
recently showed youngsters a seven-foot, 20-pound boa and told them about snake 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 The boa, named Elvis, is harmless to people and friendly, Pick said. Elvis is

wound itself over his shoulders and around his arms. "He felt smooth," said 
Aalishah Richardson, 5, as she and her mother, Cynthia, moved on to the soap 
bubble machine.

<P>
 "This is great," Cynthia Richardson said. "I'm in here having fun."

<P>
 Pick said he also has a demonstration of liquid nitrogen, which will make 
solid objects such as carrots so cold they shatter.

 The Launch Pad also has a gift store with toys, puzzles and games which teach 
children about science. WILLSON CUMMER

<P>
 So the Rams aren't synonymous with Super Bowls, the Angels haven't won an 
American League pennant and the Mighty Ducks are just getting their webbed feet 
wet. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean Orange County hasn't been the home to its share of great 
professional and amateur athletes and some great amateur teams. 
</P>
<P>
 They are enshrined in the Orange County Sports Hall of Fame Museum at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty-seven athletes and sports luminaries have been inducted into the hall, 
which is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily and until 90 minutes after stadium 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost is $3 for adults and $1 for children. 
</P>
<P>
 In the museum's Angels section are Nolan Ryan's glove, a portrait of Rod Carew 
slapping a single to left, a photo of Jim Fregosi in his managerial days 
perched atop the dugout steps, and longtime coach Jimmie Reese's fungo bat. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Mighty Ducks section, there are photos of coach Ron Wilson pacing 
behind the bench with a rolled up program in hand, and winger Terry Yake 
streaking down the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to a jersey hung in a glass cabinet is a small card reading, "This space 
reserved for the Stanley Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Under football, there are photos of Rams Jackie Slater, Vince Ferragamo and 
Jack Youngblood. 
</P>
<P>
 There is even a small section devoted to the Southern California Sun of the 
1970s World Football League, which featured running back Anthony Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 There are sections on swimming, college and high school sports, golf and even 
triathlons, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 The hall also pays tribute to the county's amateur athletes, including five 
who have won the Sullivan Award, which goes annually to the nation's finest 
amateur. 
</P>
<P>
 They are swimmer Janet Evans, divers Greg Louganis, Sammy Lee and Pat 
McCormick and runner Mary Decker. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the audio exhibit -- tapes of the radio calls of some great 
Southern California sports moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Its highlights include the last outs of no-hitters by Ryan and the Dodgers' 
Sandy Koufax, the Lakers' Magic Johnson setting the career assist record, the 
Rams qualifying for the 1980 Super Bowl and Kings star Wayne Gretzky setting 
the National Hockey League career scoring mark. TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / A GALLERY OF MUSEUMS: ANAHEIM; WHITE HOUSE REPLICA HOLDS 
DOLL COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bea DeArmond knew she was starting something big when she successfully bid 15 
cents for a small wax and papier-mache doll at a Michigan auction. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 4,000 dolls later, DeArmond's collection has become the centerpiece 
of her Toy and Doll Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in Hobby City, an outdoor shopping mall of 22 hobby and craft stores 
that she and her late husband, Jay, founded in 1960, the museum is housed in a 
replica of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had this all planned from the beginning that I would have a big doll 
museum," DeArmond said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a small museum and then when I got married and came to California, we 
had a small museum in our house. And when the collection got too big, we 
decided to build our own big museum." 
</P>
<P>
 DeArmond, at age 80, still runs the museum and the adjoining doll shop with 
her daughter, Yvonne Ansdell. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission to the museum -- on Beach Boulevard, just south of Lincoln Avenue -- 
is $1 for adults and 50 cents for children. 
</P>
<P>
 The dolls and toys are housed in two-tiered cases along the wall and in the 
center of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 The top tier contains dolls that interest adults, such as Shirley Temple and 
Charlie McCarthy dolls from the 1930s, China dolls from 19th-Century Europe and 
wooden dolls from the 18th and 17th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest is a small wooden figure from Egypt that was carved in about 300 
B.C., DeArmond said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rarest doll is a "Lady Long Fingers," which was carved from wood in 
England in 1623. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom tier next to the floor contains more modern dolls, such as G.I Joes 
and Cabbage Patch Kids, as well as a 1920s Lionel train set and a miniature 
circus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put children's dolls at the bottom so that they will be at the children's 
eye-level, even for the babies in strollers," DeArmond said. 
</P>
<P>
 The G.I. Joes and dolls of athletes such as Joe Namath, Muhammad Ali and 
Jackie Robinson were added, DeArmond said, so "we have things in here that even 
men and boys will like." 
</P>
<P>
 "The fathers will even get down on the floor with their sons to point out 
which G.I. Joes they had as a boy," DeArmond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ansdell said that for serious doll collectors, the museum's collection of 
Kewpie dolls and antique French dolls are probably the most impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what Mother wanted most of all was a good selection," Ansdell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mother wants someone to come in and find a doll she had as a child." 
</P>
<P>
 DeArmond boasts that she has never been seriously ill, which she attributes to 
her doll collecting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It keeps you young because you're always looking, always hunting for another 
doll," she said. TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / A GALLERY OF MUSEUMS: BUENA PARK; HISTORY OF PRINTING, 
PAGES OF FREEDOM 
</P>

<P>
 A program premiering this month at the International Printing Museum will 
introduce schoolchildren and other visitors to the Constitutional Convention 
and two of its most important participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors portraying Benjamin Franklin and John Adams will lead a condensed 
re-enactment of the convention in the museum's new exhibit called Pages of 
Freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and others touring the museum will play the parts of delegates from 
the original 13 colonies, and they will argue their adopted colony's position 
on four key issues that were discussed at the convention. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to give schoolchildren a chance to see what it would have been 
like to be a delegate," said Kent Johnson, who plays the part of Franklin. 
"They will see how our Constitution was shaped." 
</P>
<P>
 The tour includes a display of what Johnson calls "documents of freedom" from 
the Magna Carta to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Period photographs, 
newspapers, maps and other artifacts are displayed with the documents to 
complete the historical setting surrounding them. 
</P>
<P>
 Another tour recently added at the museum is Pages of Adventure, a program 
designed to get children excited about reading for fun. Moving among six period 
backdrops, actor Sheldon Craig reads from books and newspapers reflecting 
various eras. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum began offering the tour in September, and it has quickly become a 
favorite attraction. Students, teachers and parents especially like Craig's 
reading from Mark Twain's "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to read some of Twain's more obscure stuff, and it would get a good 
response," Craig said. "But then I read the scene where Tom is whitewashing the 
fence, and it has everybody laughing, kids and adults, so I do that now." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig, one of the museum's three full-time employees, said introducing 
students to the clever way young Sawyer gets others to do his work on a summer 
day motivates them to read the rest of the classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig also takes museum visitors to New York in the 1940s, reading from "The 
Year of the Boar and Jackie Robinson," the tale of a young Chinese immigrant 
whose love of the Brooklyn Dodgers helps her feel welcome in her new homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the tours, the museum has more than 100 pieces of printing 
equipment, double what is displayed at the Smithsonian Institution, Craig said. 
Most of the pieces were collected by Ernest Lindner, whose father and uncle 
bought and sold typesetting equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's star attraction is a Stanhope press, the first all-metal printing 
press, circa 1810. The museum claims to have one of 20 left in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Printing Museum is open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through 
Saturday. Admission is $6.50 for adults, $4 for students and seniors and $2.50 
for children 7 to 12. The museum is at 8469 Kass Drive. Its phone number is 
(714) 523-2070. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / A GALLERY OF MUSEUMS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; MISSION 
PRESERVES WINDOW ON THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a large sense, the Mission San Juan's sprawling grounds have created an 
identity problem for the tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 People think of the mission as a church because of its ornate 19th-Century 
chapel. They are drawn by the beauty of the mission grounds and its immaculate 
flower gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Mission San Juan that officials want visitors to recognize is a museum 
-- a snapshot of romantic early California during the mid-1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mission is its own museum, the mission is the museum and its own greatest 
artifact," said Ed Akins, volunteer coordinator for the Mission San Juan. 
"There is the potential for an incredible learning experience here because 
everything is so well preserved. The mission looks pretty much as it was 200 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Mission officials plan to tap into that potential. A panel of advisers is 
being put together to help the mission become a better museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want this to be a place where you come in the fourth grade and don't 
come back until your child is in the fourth grade," Akins said. "We're on the 
verge of getting bigger and better." 
</P>
<P>
 One area that will be developed is the mission's living history program. Once 
a month, volunteers assume the role of a figure in the area's past, such as an 
early Spanish governor of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary plans call for the program to take place twice per month. Rooms at 
the mission will be occupied by the 19th-Century characters who will go about 
their business as they did more than 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rooms will be alive with living history figures," Akins said. "You can 
walk in and talk to them, ask questions about how they lived. It'll be like 
slipping into a time warp." 
</P>
<P>
 Other projects include sprucing up the current exhibits by repainting signs 
and updating instructional materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Advisory panel members will be experts in historical fields such as 
archeology, museum science and art history. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / A GALLERY OF MUSEUMS: TUSTIN; NATIVE AMERICANS SEEK 
CULTURAL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jane Uyeno says there's nothing wrong with museums, but there is a better way 
to present the culture of a people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Museums are so passive and inanimate," said Uyeno, a member of a group 
proposing to build a Native American cultural center at Tustin Marine Corps 
Helicopter Air Station when it closes in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "A cultural center is not just buildings, it's the sights, sounds, smell and 
spirit of the indigenous people in their cultural settings," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural center would include a school and housing for Native American 
students, demonstration areas for cultural displays, restaurants, theaters for 
cultural performances and stores with merchandise made by Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a national monument to Native Americans," said Uyeno, who 
co-founded the Native American Indian Cultural Center, a nonprofit group, six 
years ago. She said they have been looking for appropriate locations in the 
United States, Canada and Mexico since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go to a reservation, all you learn is the culture of that one tribe," 
Uyeno said. "With a cultural center, you can learn about the culture of all 
Native Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 The model for the proposed center is the Polynesian Cultural Center in Laie, 
Hawaii, which has succeeded in highlighting that culture and provided income to 
the city, Uyeno said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Belardes, chairman of the Juaneno Band of Mission Indians of San Juan 
Capistrano, "This is our territory, so we'd be like the host tribe." The group 
also is seeking federal recognition as a Native American tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal for a Native American Indian Cultural Center is one of numerous 
reuse plans submitted by public agencies and nonprofit groups to a Tustin panel 
studying the development of the base once it is converted to civilian use. 
</P>
<P>
 From 200 to 300 acres of the 1,620-acre base, including buildings and military 
housing, will be available for free or will be sold at discounted prices to 
nonprofit groups. The rest will be sold to private developers to upgrade 
Tustin's tax rolls, fund the public works improvements and help pay for the 
relocation of the military to other bases, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin base closure task force has rejected the proposal for a Native 
American Indian Cultural Center but left the door open by saying that it may be 
included in the proposal by a coalition of school districts, colleges and 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 17-member panel, made up of appointed and elected officials of Tustin, 
Santa Ana, Irvine and the county, as well as representatives of business and 
community groups, can only recommend and won't make the final decisions on 
future uses of the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Uyeno said that she is hoping the Department of the Navy will approve their 
proposal. If it is not approved for the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Air 
Station, they will make another proposal for the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station, which is also scheduled to close. 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of school districts, colleges and universities is considering a 
cultural center in their own proposal to set up educational, business and 
recreational facilities at the Tustin Marine base. 
</P>
<P>
 "A multicultural center with a Native American component is possible," said 
Dante Gumucio, a consultant for the coalition. But he said there have been no 
formal discussions between his group and Uyeno's. 
</P>
<P>
 But Uyeno said that the cultural center must be devoted only to Native 
Americans and that her group cannot support the idea of a multicultural center.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / A GALLERY OF MUSEUMS: AT HOME IN 1898 IN THE KELLOGG 
HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Hiram Clay Kellogg built his house in 1898, it was one of the county's 
most modern homes. Neighbors must have marveled at the newfangled contraptions 
found in the Kellogg house, from the bathroom to the kitchen to the laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, people still come from all over to see the foot-cranked washing 
machine, smudge pots and talking box. And children still splash each other from 
the hand pump, as they probably did 95 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Completely restored by the Discovery Museum of Orange County, the Kellogg 
House now sits at the corner of Fairview Boulevard and Harvard Street in Santa 
Ana. It was moved from its original location on Orange Avenue in 1980, and in 
1985 the museum began conducting tours of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to give students and visitors a feel for what life was like in 
Orange County during the turn of the century," said Wilma Roman, Discovery's 
operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a group of nine children took turns scrubbing a rag on a washboard, 
putting a towel through a wringer and pedaling a washing machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour guide Chris Jepsen watched the group struggling with the foot pedal, then 
reminded them that the early washing machine was a luxury. 
</P>
<P>
 "How would you like to spend a whole day once a week using these to wash 
clothes?" Jepsen asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Jepsen, a history student at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, likes to 
point out several features in the house that stem from Kellogg's love of ships. 
</P>
<P>
 The oval dining room duplicates an officers' mess, Jepsen said, and the curved 
cabinets and shelves along the wall were built by a ship's carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The spiral staircase also replicates those found on ships, and a post that 
runs from the foot of the stairs up to the attic is a spruce mast from a tall 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellogg, a civil engineer who designed the house himself, left the attic open 
to the floor below to give the effect of a crow's nest. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the basic tour, the Discovery Museum offers several specialty 
programs. Indian Nation gives third- through fifth-grade students a look at 
Native American culture. A joint venture of the Southern California Indian 
Center and the museum, the program is taught by local tribal members. 
</P>
<P>
 Kindergarten through second-grade students can spend two hours in the museum's 
"secret garden," learning about how plants live, grow and interact. 
</P>
<P>
 Science and history are integrated in a program for fourth-, fifth- and 
sixth-grade students. Students track the changes in land use in the county and 
are introduced to environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellogg House also is available for birthday parties, receptions and other 
events. The museum is open to the public Wednesday through Friday from 1 to 5 
p.m. and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday, Tuesday and Saturday are for 
tours, which must be arranged in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is $2.50 for adults and $1.50 for children. Schools, youth groups 
and other organizations can arrange tours by calling the museum at (714) 
540-0404. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / A GALLERY OF MUSEUMS: WESTMINSTER; CITY'S PAST TRACED BY 
FORMER MAYOR

<TEXT>
<P>
 As a member of the City Council for 20 years, Joy L. Neugebauer had been one 
of the architects of the city's future. Now that she's out of office, she says 
she wants to be a guardian of its past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a love affair with this city and its history," said Neugebauer, an 
Ohio native who came to Westminster in 1956. "I want people to know what makes 
this city unique." 
</P>
<P>
 A three-time city mayor, Neugebauer lost her council seat in the 1990 
election. She has spent the last three years as executive director of the 
Westminster Museum, assembling artifacts and records of the city's past. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been particularly keen in obtaining farm implements and mementos from 
1870 to 1940, considered the era of the great farms when Westminster was known 
for its sugar beets, lima beans and dairy farms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to preserve this great agricultural heritage before it vanishes 
entirely from this area of Orange County," Neugebauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 And she is doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Blakey Historical Park on Westminster Boulevard, Neugebauer and the 
Westminster Historical Society have relocated structures owned by one of the 
city's well-known farming families. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warne family home, a pump house and a barn, all built in 1915, were moved 
to the historical park in 1989. The barn now houses farm machinery used in the 
early 1900s, including a power rake and a wagon used to haul sugar beets to the 
railroad for shipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The red barn, measuring 72 feet by 63 feet, "looks exactly the way it used 
to," said Alfred Acosta, 63, who worked as a farmhand for the Warnes from the 
time he was a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to play in that barn with my brothers," said Acosta, now a caretaker 
for the Blakey Historical Park. "It's part of my life, so I love to take care 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta, who has never married, said he remembers when Westminster was "nothing 
but open land, with chicken ranches and dairy farms." 
</P>
<P>
 The Westminster Museum is also at Blakey Historical Park. It is housed in the 
former Midway City Women's Club building, which was moved to its present site 
in 1988. Built in 1929, the building has been under restoration since June, 
1989, Neugebauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that during January the museum will be open on Sundays from 1 to 4 
p.m. Its displays will depict the rancho and mission days, the early 
settlements, the great farms in the 1930s and 1940s, and events after the 
city's incorporation in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 Neugebauer said that future displays will dwell on the contributions of 
Mexican, Japanese and Vietnamese immigrants to the city's growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is something young people would appreciate, particularly students, 
Neugebauer said. She said the Garden Grove Unified and Westminster school 
districts have indicated interest in conducting field trips for their students. 
</P>
<P>
 Neugebauer has seven sons and nine grandchildren. Her husband, Donald, a 
businessman, died 19 years ago. Her work with the city has kept her busy and 
happy, Neugebauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love being involved. I thrive on it," she said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / A GALLERY OF MUSEUMS: SANTA ANA; EXPANDED BOWERS GAINS 
RESPECT TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 What began with a local couple's fascination with Spanish and Mexican culture 
has grown into a nationally recognized center for the exhibition of art and 
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bowers Museum of Cultural Art, at 20th and Main streets, is named for 
Charles W. and Ada Bowers, who willed their home and property to the city in 
1924 for a museum dedicated to local history. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1932, the home was demolished and a museum was built. But the couple didn't 
leave an endowment, so the facility didn't open until city officials finally 
allocated money to operate it four years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the museum has had difficult periods, its permanent collection has 
expanded to 85,000 pieces focused on pre-Colombian, American Indian, African 
and Oceanian objects. It also features changing exhibitions that explore the 
art and cultures of California, the Americas, Africa and the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of the museum's collection policies and public service was 
recognized last month when it received accreditation from the American Assn. of 
Museums, a respected Washington-based organization. Of nearly 8,500 museums in 
the United States, the association has accredited only 739. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to get that (accreditation)," said Bowers director Peter 
Keller. "It's something that is awarded, on average, after a two-year study. 
They look at all aspects of the operations of the museum." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is now in expanded and renovated facilities that opened last year 
and took four years and $12 million to complete. The project, designed by 
Newport Beach architect George Bissell, doubled the museum's exhibition space 
and tripled its size while maintaining the original structure's mission-style 
courtyard and bell-tower entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion project took its toll on the Bowers' budget, however. Last 
month, the museum instituted cost-cutting measures that included shortening 
hours and reducing salaries. About one-third of the museum's $3.1-million 
budget comes from the city; $1.2 million is generated from the museum's store, 
restaurant, admission fees and facility rentals; the remainder comes from 
private donations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, the city formed a private nonprofit group, the Charles W. Bowers 
Museum Corp., to run the institution and address major fund-raising. The city 
will gradually withdraw its funding until the museum is self-supporting by 
2007. RICHARD CORE

COSTA MESA MAN FOUND DEAD AFTER 8-HOUR STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police stormed a Hamilton Street apartment where a 31-year-old man had been 
barricaded for nearly eight hours Thursday and found him dead of a 
self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Police responded to a report of a woman screaming in the apartment of Robert 
Dean Stubbs, 31, about 1:30 p.m. Thursday, Sgt. Karl Schuler said.After 
learning that Stubbs had apparently threatened his wife with a gun and fired a 
single shot inside the apartment, located in the 500 block of Hamilton Street, 
they evacuated the apartment complex and cordoned off the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
 Stubbs' wife apparently fled the apartment unharmed, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the standoff, SWAT negotiators tried to make contact with Stubbs, but 
found that his telephone had been disconnected, Schuler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers later fired tear gas into the building. They stormed the apartment at 
about 9 p.m. and found Stubbs dead from a gunshot wound that the county 
coroner's office later ruled was self-inflicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe Stubbs fired the fatal shot at about 1:30 p.m., shortly before 
they arrived, a spokesman said. ORANGE COUNTY

MILLIONTH ARENA VISITOR IS A SURPRISED GUEST STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a shower of confetti, a Chino Hills woman gleefully learned Friday that she 
was the winner of a bevy of gifts as the 1-millionth visitor to the Anaheim 
Arena since the city-owned complex opened June 19.  
</P>
<P>
 "I never won anything before in my life," said Teresa Jordan, who had come 
with her husband, Tom, and children, 7-year-old Christy and 3-year-old Tommy, 
to see Walt Disney's World On Ice Presents Beauty and the Beast, a family ice 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 As Jordan passed through the east gate turnstile at 2:40 p.m., arena employees 
blew horns and threw confetti at her and arena general manager Brad Mayne ran 
up to announce her good fortune, said John Nicoletti, spokesman for the 
Arrowhead Pond arena.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayne and Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly presented the family with gifts, including 
free front row seats to Friday's ice show and their choice of free tickets each 
month to any event held at the arena during the next year, Nicoletti said.  
</P>
<P>
 The family also received stuffed animals depicting characters from Beauty and 
the Beast, Mighty Ducks T-shirts, hats and duck calls and the chance to have 
their pictures taken with the stars of the Beauty and the Beast ice show. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicoletti said attendance at Arrowhead Pond, the home ice for the Mighty Ducks 
National Hockey League team, has exceeded projections. "We were surprised we 
were able to reach this plateau in less than seven months," he said.

BODY FOUND NEAR MOORPARK IS THAT OF FORMER CYPRESS RESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The body of a woman who was strangled and then dumped in a remote area near 
Moorpark has been identified as 20-year-old Mika C. Bissett, a former Cypress 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dubov, who was staying with Bissett, has confessed to strangling her 
Dec. 14 in Bissett's Venice apartment, Los Angeles Police Lt. John Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubov has been booked into jail in Los Angeles on suspicion of murder and is 
being held on $1 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said Dubov waited several days after he strangled her, then drove the 
body to Ventura County and dumped it on a brush-covered embankment along a dirt 
road off Gabbert Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubov had reported Bissett missing Dec. 20, Rogers said. During an interview 
with detectives on Wednesday, Dubov confessed to the killing and led detectives 
to the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said Bissett was a student whose mother lives in Orange County. 
According to voter registration records, the young woman had lived in Cypress 
with her parents as recently as 1992.

CENTER AT VAUGHN CAMPUS MAKES SCHOOL A FAMILY AFFAIR; EXPERIMENT: HEALTH AND 
SOCIAL SERVICES ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO THOSE IN THE POVERTY-RIDDEN AREA, IN THE 
HOPES OF BREAKING CHILDREN'S CYCLE OF FAILURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It began with a 10-year-old child expelled from school for ditching. 
</P>
<P>
 When school officials turned down the frantic mother's pleas for another 
chance, she knew where to turn for help. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Family Center on campus, she told her story to a parent advocate who 
agreed to intercede. The deal he made was that to get back in school, her son 
would have to take counseling and she would have to join a parenting class. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sessions that followed, other tensions surfaced. The woman's 
16-year-old daughter was abusing her own 2-year-old. And a disciplinarian 
father was demoralizing his two sons, contributing to their problems in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the daughter is in parenting classes, too, and has started working part 
time at the family center. The father and mother are receiving counseling. The 
boy is doing better in school. 
</P>
<P>
 This fantastic-sounding story happened at Vaughn Street Elementary School. It 
is a prime example arising from an experiment there to show that the delivery 
of comprehensive health and social services through a school-based program can 
improve students' performance and even lift a community up by its own 
bootstraps. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaughn Family Center is a one-stop resource for the predominantly Latino 
and poor families whose children attend Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
 Occupying a two-room bungalow on campus, the center distributes food and 
clothing, connects children and parents to benefits such as Medi-Cal and 
welfare, enlists the help of other community agencies for child care and health 
care and involves parents in helping their children in school. 
</P>
<P>
 If the services parents need don't exist, the Family Center tries to create 
them, using resources at hand, including the parents. When the center opened, 
there were no licensed day-care providers in the Vaughn attendance area. So the 
center formed a partnership with the Child Care Resources Center to train 
families how to set up day care in their homes. So far 20 families have been 
licensed, providing 102 new spaces for Vaughn families. A new training session 
is held every two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Vaughn parents worked with a health educator from Olive View Medical 
Center to develop a curriculum for prenatal care. Now parents are being trained 
as lay health educators to teach pregnant women in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The hope is that this focused investment in one of the Valley's most 
poverty-impacted schools will break cycles of failure, saving money in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're experimenting with different ways of getting services to people much 
earlier and using a lot more paraprofessionals and community volunteers," said 
Dorothy Fleisher, planning director of United Way's North Angeles Region, which 
co-sponsors the Family Center. "If we're successful, it should cut costs at the 
other end: dropout rates, being unemployed, winding up on AFDC (Aid for 
Families With Dependent Children), the cost of being in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaughn experiment was born three years ago out of a collaboration of 
United Way's North Angeles Region and the Los Angeles Educational Partnership, 
a business alliance that channels private donations into educational reform. 
Both agencies were independently exploring the problem of social barriers to 
education. They decided to start a model project. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn offered the perfect laboratory. It had the worst test scores in the Los 
Angeles Unified School District and was one of California's 64 lowest-achieving 
schools, ranking in the 20th percentile statewide in language achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Its educational deficiencies reflected social conditions of the school 
community. Ninety-six percent of Vaughn students were eligible for the 
federally subsidized free lunch program and, therefore, were considered to be 
eligible for Medi-Cal. Yet few had signed up. Nearly 80% of them suffered acute 
dental problems. Nearly 90% were Spanish speaking with English-language 
deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 A more positive factor in the choice of Vaughn was its new principal, Yvonne 
Chan. Assigned in May, 1990, she quickly established herself as a high-energy, 
media-savvy administrator who wanted to make the school a model for educational 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan lobbied aggressively to bring the program to Vaughn, assuaging teachers' 
fears that it would drain resources from the classroom or dilute their 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The program got off the ground in 1991 with a funding package that included a 
$160,000 planning grant from United Way, $200,000 from the California 
Department of Education and grants from several corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 A governance system was established in which parents joined school staff and 
representatives from United Way and the educational partnership in hiring as 
director Yoland Trevino, formerly director of Bienvenidos, a shelter for 
infants and toddlers who are court dependents. 
</P>
<P>
 Relations between the Family Center and the school have evolved with some 
rough spots, Chan said. Early on, she set up meetings between the social 
workers and teachers to smooth out differences in their viewpoints. Still, 
there were conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teacher says, 'You're suspended,' social workers would say, 'My poor dear, 
did you get breakfast?' " Chan said. "These two things will kill each other and 
I'm in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time with the Family Center overstepping bounds with teachers," 
Chan said. "There were grievances filed with administration. There were 
disagreements between teachers and staff, parents and teachers, teachers and 
teachers. We've lived through all of those rough waters." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she said, the governance of the Family Center and school have merged into 
a smoothly functioning unit overseeing a campus that assumed nearly complete 
control over its own destiny this fall by becoming the Valley's first 
state-chartered school, renamed the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a part of us," Chan said. "Family Center is not separate." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is distinctly different. It is a place where parents are the center of 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevino included parents in filling out her staff of five community liaisons, 
three family advocates, a family counselor and an administrative assistant. 
Four-fifths of those hired were parents who first became involved in the 
program as volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 The community liaisons, paid $320 monthly for 53 hours, generally volunteer 
full days, Trevino said. They take charge of the clothes closet and the food 
pantry, coordinate child care and bilingual counseling, help parents fill out 
forms for services and organize events. 
</P>
<P>
 The family advocates visit each family that comes to the center for help and 
work out a case plan under the supervision of the licensed family counselor. 
This can include connecting family members with community resources, helping 
them get benefits such as Medi-Cal, providing transportation and just 
listening, Trevino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, about 140 families are in case plans. Among them, 120 have 
qualified for twice-monthly federal food supplements, 40 have received housing 
support, and 40 have entered substance abuse treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
 All the parents are asked to contribute something in return, from sweeping up 
around the center to organizing school events, Trevino said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Family Center has proven resourceful in the use of volunteers to expand 
existing community services. El Nido Family Centers in Pacoima provided a 
trainer who taught parents the importance of reading to their children and 
showed them skills for creative reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives the parent an opportunity to find their own inner child and to 
strengthen the relationship," Trevino said. "We now have grandparents that are 
reading to their grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 Trevino next plans to train other parents as reading trainers so they can 
spread the "Motherread" program to other schools in the Northeast Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers also teach computer classes, Spanish literacy, English as a second 
language and a Spanish class aimed at the school's African-American parents. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Vaughn experiment has produced encouraging results. Students 
tested in Spanish have increased their scores from under the 10th percentile to 
above the 30th, Chan said. Mobility -- the rate at which students transfer in 
and out of the school -- has dropped from nearly 70% to less than 40%. There 
are now 34 students in gifted programs, compared to none before. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceding that much of the evidence of their success is anecdotal, however, 
Fleisher, the planning director for United Way's North Angeles Region, said she 
is seeking backing to conduct a long-term cost/benefit analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this model saving money? It's complicated to figure that," she said. 
"Sometimes these programs in the short run are using benefits more. In the long 
run they may not." 
</P>
<P>
 At the least, it will take years to track dropout rates as children move to 
higher grades and to measure the degree to which they grow into productive 
adults or place a future burden on the social system. 
</P>
<P>
 More immediately, the Vaughn experiment continues to face obstacles -- 
particularly financial -- to setting its most ambitious plans in action. 
</P>
<P>
 A primary goal -- extending quality medical care to all Vaughn families -- has 
been particularly challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross of California funded planning for a health insurance program, but 
so far the program has not gotten off the ground, Fleisher said. Decisions have 
yet to be made on such questions as whether all family members would be 
insured, or just the schoolchildren, and which medical services should be 
provided on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in January, Blue Cross will pay for a nurse practitioner to visit 
the school twice a week, Trevino said. The company also will enroll several 
Vaughn families in its CaliforniaKids program, providing complete health 
coverage for $25 per year for up to four children and $10 for each child beyond 
that. The program is for families who aren't eligible for Medi-Cal but can't 
afford private health insurance. As it turned out, though, only a few qualify 
because 80% of Vaughn's students are eligible for Medi-Cal, having been born in 
the United States. Many don't know that, though, or are reluctant to apply for 
government assistance, leading to inevitable crises. 
</P>
<P>
 'We've had families that come in with horrendous doctor bills for whatever 
emergency," she said. "They say, 'Please, can you do something because they're 
pestering us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The assault on dental problems also is moving slowly. Currently all Vaughn 
students receive an annual screening by a dentist from UCLA. Only those with 
the most urgent problems can be treated at the overburdened Parent Teacher 
Student Assn. dental program at nearby Telfair Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevino has received a donation of two used dental chairs and hopes to convert 
a bathroom on campus into a clinic staffed by volunteer dentists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cost is astounding," she said. "We're going to need something like 
$20,000 to do that, and we don't have that kind of money." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Family Center faces a struggle just to ensure its own existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Its primary funding from the State Department of Education expires after one 
more year. Proposals will be written for new sources of money. But, in the end, 
proponents of the experiment are counting on a shift in public policy to come 
to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the thinking is to get agencies to redirect resources," Fleisher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Children's Services, for example, might find that it has 
enough Vaughn children in its caseload to provide a social worker at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "United Way's intent is really to demonstrate that by doing business 
differently, we can get better outcomes," Fleisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until those outcomes can be proved conclusively, a little faith may be 
required. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way this thing is going to work is for the public to say we're 
convinced this method is cost effective, so we're going to fund people to do 
this," Fleisher said.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; THE JEWISH SPECTATOR A VITAL VOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Magazines: The quarterly, which is edited in Calabasas, is small in 
circulation but prominent figures are among its contributors and readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish Spectator, an intellectual magazine with a religious focus, has a small 
circulation of about 6,000 and is edited in Calabasas, hardly the center of 
Jewish life. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the quarterly's regular contributors include prominent U.S. rabbis and 
educators, among them prolific author Jacob Neusner, a former Brown University 
professor now at the University of South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The influence of the 66-page periodical goes well beyond its limited 
circulation because as many as two-thirds of its recipients are libraries and 
rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
 From its 1936 founding in New York City until its sale in 1989, Jewish 
Spectator reflected the independent and thoughtful, sometimes feisty, stances 
of founder-editor Trudie Weiss-Rosmarin. The man who bought it, Robert 
Bleiweiss of Calabasas, has kept up the tradition, observers have said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a highly credible publication," said Gene Lichtenstein, editor of the 
Jewish Journal newspaper in Los Angeles. "There aren't many magazines that have 
a religious focus and attempt an intellectual dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 Commentary and Tikkun, for instance, are larger Jewish-oriented magazines with 
strong political interests to the right and left respectively. A third Jewish 
periodical, Moment, has a more popular format, according to Bleiweiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish Spectator's successful transition to a West Coast suburban setting and 
a new editor is a testament to the determination of Weiss-Rosmarin, who earned 
a doctorate in her native Germany shortly before arriving in America in 1931. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the magazine, she asserted that secular Jewish culture, politics and 
community work in America still needed an intelligent, vibrant Judaism in order 
for Jews to survive as a people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weiss-Rosmarin had enormous confidence in Judaism, its attractiveness and 
ability to compete with contemporary cultures in the modern world," wrote 
Deborah Dash Moore of Vassar College in a recent biographical essay. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1980s, the septuagenarian editor had moved to Santa Monica and was 
looking for someone to help with the journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Given an honorary doctorate by Los Angeles' Hebrew Union College in 1984 and 
frequently requested as a speaker in the Los Angeles Jewish community, 
Weiss-Rosmarin also lectured at the Brandeis-Bardin Institute in Simi Valley. 
It was through that Jewish educational institute that she found her successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer-editor Bleiweiss, a former director of the institute, was being 
consulted by Weiss-Rosmarin for publishing advice, but she also began 
suggesting that he become a partner with her in the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consistently said no because my wife Vida and I were busy building our 
commercial business, primarily publishing labor union newspapers," Bleiweiss 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then when she was reaching the end of her life in 1989, she called us one day 
and said that we absolutely had to take it or it would be on our heads that the 
magazine would fail," Bleiweiss said. She had declined offers from three 
institutions to buy the magazine, asserting that the publication would lose its 
personality and independent thrust, Bleiweiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went over to see her and to turn her down, but I spent 2 1/2 hours with her 
and walked away buying the magazine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was May, 1989. Weiss-Rosmarin died on June 26, shortly after her 81st 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 In her final, combined spring-summer issue, Weiss-Rosmarin wrote of Bleiweiss: 
"He is a remarkably knowledgeable trans-sectarian Jew totally committed to the 
sustenance of Jewish values for this and subsequent generations." 
</P>
<P>
 Bleiweiss, now 59, said he and Weiss-Rosmarin were on the same ideological 
wavelength. The difference between Weiss-Rosmarin and himself was that she was 
a Talmudic scholar. "I'm a darn good editor and a devoted, scholarly Jew but 
not a scholar," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her description of her successor as "trans-sectarian" referred to Bleiweiss' 
contacts with all three of Judaism's major branches. 
</P>
<P>
 His son, Mark, an adviser and frequent contributor to the magazine, is in New 
York studying to be an Orthodox rabbi. But Robert and Vida Bleiweiss said they 
feel very close to Reform Judaism. He has taught a Bible class for nine years 
at Rabbi Steven Jacobs' congregation, which merged last year to form Kol Tikvah 
in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, his three senior contributing editors are prominent in 
Conservative Judaism: Rabbi Daniel Gordis, dean of administration at the 
University of Judaism; Rabbi Bradley Shavit Artson of Mission Viejo and Deborah 
E. Lipstadt, associate professor of modern Jewish studies at Emory University 
in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Lipstadt, a former director at the Brandeis-Bardin Institute who also taught 
at Occidental College, is the author of the critically acclaimed "Denying the 
Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory" published in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Told late last year that she didn't have to write her usual column for Jewish 
Spectator in light of her busy book-publicizing schedule, Bleiweiss said that 
Lipstadt responded, "Don't you dare. Save those pages." Lipstadt's essays and 
commentaries have appeared in every issue that Bleiweiss has edited. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bleiweiss took over the magazine, its overall circulation was down to 
about 1,500 and its paid circulation stood about 800. Today, he said, the paid 
circulation is at 1,307. But were it not for their income from publishing a 
dozen labor newspapers, the Bleiweisses said, they would be unable to keep it 
going. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Jewish Spectator lost some subscribers when he wrote an editorial 
three or four years ago praising the social work of the ultra-Orthodox Chabad 
Lubavitch movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lubavitch is not mainstream Judaism and has a lot of things wrong with it 
ideologically and functionally, but I certainly can't argue with people who put 
millions and millions of dollars each year into reclaiming drug-lost youth and 
feeding hungry people," Bleiweiss said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Bleiweiss also received heat for criticizing the many Jewish federation 
organizations across the country, which he characterized as "still mainly run 
by assimilated, ignorant, self-serving people." But in the winter issue, 
published this week, he wrote that he was encouraged by what he saw as hopeful 
signs at the November convention of the Council of Jewish Federations in 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 An editorial he wrote in the fall issue scored supporters of Jerusalem's 
Hebrew University for selecting singer Michael Jackson for the 1994 Scopus 
Award to be presented in Beverly Hills in January.  
</P>
<P>
 "This will mark the umpteenth time a major Jewish charity will have reached 
out cynically and opportunistically to tie the name of a distinguished Jewish 
institution to a member of the American glitterati, motivated entirely by the 
fame and box-office appeal of the person to be honored," Bleiweiss wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous winners of the Scopus Award, cited for excellence in their chosen 
field and philanthropic generosity, have included Frank Sinatra and Nancy 
Reagan, as Bleiweiss noted. But the awardees have also included author Eli 
Wiesel, pianist Arthur Rubenstein, the late Rabbi Max Nussbaum, conductor Zubin 
Mehta and film director Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jackson's selection was announced in July, he became the subject of a 
lawsuit and investigations involving possible child molestation. Bleiweiss made 
no comment on those stories, but did conclude his editorial by betting that the 
singer would still get the award and "the joint will be sold out." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of American Friends of Hebrew University, however, announced 
recently that Jackson had asked to have his name withdrawn at the time he 
canceled his world tour, saying he needed help to overcome an addiction to pain 
relievers. The organization said Cable News Network talk show host Larry King 
would receive the award instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to say I lost the bet," Bleiweiss said this week. "It should not be 
given to a superficial figure in pop culture."

O.C. JAZZ / BILL KOHLHAASE; CONCERTED EFFORTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerts ruled the local scene in 1993, led by KLON-FM and the Hyatt 
Newporter's Jazz Live at the Hyatt series. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the concert scene slowly expands, the club scene is headed in the 
other direction with the loss of the entertainment policies at Maxwell's 
restaurant in Huntington Beach and, more recently, Vinnie's in Laguna Hills and 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Big shows are nice, but jazz goes best in small rooms, where intimacy makes 
the performances a personal experience. There's a lesson to be learned from all 
this: Support the remaining clubs or lose them, too. Best Concerts of 1993: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Joe Henderson (Orange County Register Jazz Festival, UC Irvine, Oct. 17). 
Few showed up to hear the heavyweight champ of the saxophone and his crack 
ensemble with pianist Renee Rosnes and drummer Al Foster. But those who did 
were well-rewarded with Henderson's trademark expression and enough of the 
saxophonist's trademark cries, calls and caterwauls to satiate his fans. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Shirley Horn (Orange County Performing Arts Center, Costa Mesa, Feb. 2). 
Horn is probably the only singer-pianist who could transform the 3,000-seat 
Segerstrom Hall into an intimate room where her delicate vocals and perfectly 
placed accompaniment could touch one's very soul. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Lee Konitz (Jazz Live at the Hyatt, Newport Beach, Aug. 20). 
Improvisational excursions from alto man Konitz in a tribute to his longtime 
associate, Lennie Tristano. Exchanges with fellow saxophonist Gary Foster made 
for particularly stirring moments. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Orchestra, Steve Turre (Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, Nov. 13). Composer Akiyoshi's orchestrations, almost symphonic in 
nature, and her grand sense of what music can say combined with the sax and 
flute work of Lew Tabackin, made for both intellectual and emotional rewards. 
Turre's conch shell and trombone choir provided earthy contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Art Farmer Plays the Music of Gil Evans (Jazz Live at the Hyatt, July 30). 
Though fluegelhornist Farmer wasn't at his best and the orchestra, gamely led 
by conductor Mark Masters, struggled at times with Evans' harmonic blends, the 
program was a haunting re-creation of the famous Evans-Miles Davis sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Charlie Haden Quartet West (Jazz Live at the Hyatt, June 6). Bassist 
Haden's film noir approach to jazz made for a night of romance and intrigue. 
Saxophonist Bennie Maupin filled in for saxophonist Ernie Watts, bringing an 
extra measure of cool and dignity to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Buddy Collette, Fred Katz (Jazz Live at the Hyatt, June 4). This reunion of 
two of the original members of Chico Hamilton's quintet matched Collette's 
gentlemanly sax and flute sounds with Katz and his mischievous cello lines. A 
fine display of tonal as well as improvisational sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 8. George Van Eps (Vinnie's, Laguna Hills, July 9). The man who practically 
invented the seven-string guitar, now well into his eighth decade, pulled 
orchestrally rich statements from his instrument while never forgetting to 
swing. Van Eps is a living treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Ron Stout (Cafe Lido, Newport Beach, Aug. 31). Trumpeter Stout's pair of 
sets was exactly what nightclub jazz is all about: hot-and-bothered here, 
touchingly tender there. An evening full of spontaneity and musicianship. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Joshua Redman (Coach House, San Juan Capistrano, Oct. 28). Superstar as 
humble sideman was the evening's theme when guitarist Pat Metheny joined the 
20-something saxophonist for a hard-bop-inspired outing. Ego was forgotten as 
the two mixed and matched their considerable styles.

 Los Angeles first encountered his expressive face, his lithe body, his 
mercurial wit and his dramatic magnetism a decade ago. At the time, the former 
Bostonian was one of the few bright lights in John Clifford's rapidly dimming 
L.A. Ballet.He was 15, and still a senior at Hollywood High. Now a grand old 
man of 26 and a leading force at the New York City Ballet, he performs a huge 
repertory, ranging from quirky caractere assignments to the princely duties of 
the "Nutcracker" cavalier (an achievement documented in the current film). 
While assimilating the Balanchine style, he has created roles for Jerome 
Robbins, Eliot Feld and Peter Martins. The last-named, Woetzel's boss and 
champion, has invited him to choreograph a work for the NYCB in the spring of 
1994, and, amazingly, to succeed Heather Watts as director of the ballet 
program at the company's summer school in Saratoga Springs.

 Tom Tomlinson was an unknown quantity locally when he was picked in July to 
succeed Thomas R. Kendrick as head of the O.C. Performing Arts Center. Five 
months after his arrival from Anchorage (he was director of the Alaska Center 
for the Performing Arts), it still remains unclear what kind of stamp Tomlinson 
will put on the county's 7-year-old cultural edifice. 
</P>
<P>
 As executive director, he supervises some programming for the 2,994-seat hall 
(basically the musical theater, ballet and jazz series; outside groups provide 
classical music, opera and choral music). Tomlinson, 43, also oversees the 
building's annual budget of about $18 million.

 Observers are waiting to see if he can maintain the quality of the center's 
ballet offerings, a task made increasingly difficult by the continuing 
financial woes of many touring troupes. The real test for Tomlinson may come 
when and if the center expands; the addition of a concert hall and a smaller 
theater have long been on the drawing boards, but plans remain stymied by the 
economy.

 "I've always been a natural slacker," says comedian-actress Margaret Cho. "Now 
I'll have to be a professional slacker. I'll be busy, but I'll always look like 
I just got out of bed." 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-year-old will have good reason to get out of bed this year. Following 
her brief appearances in the Disney feature "Angie I Says" and in the 
Korean-American feature "Broken Words," Cho is set for some high-profile work 
as the star of a comedy series being developed at Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 A star turn in a series is a plum for any actress, but Cho says the gig 
doesn't surprise her. "It's a natural extension for me to be on television," 
she explains. "I've always had my own show running, it just hasn't been 
broadcast before." 
</P>
<P>
 Cho says that the best part of the success she's enjoyed so far has been the 
pay-back that her stand-up career has made possible. "I've seen people at my 
shows that used to beat me up as a kid, because I was a terrible misfit. Now 
I'm so vindictive, and it's a joy. The people who took my lunch money are now 
paying to hear me talk about them on stage. That's the best."

 Bassist Christian McBride's protean talents were well known within the jazz 
community as long as three years ago, when he was heard as a member of Freddie 
Hubbard's quintet and Benny Green's trio, among others. But it was in 1993, 
when he toured with sax upstart Joshua Redman's quartet, that this remarkable 
musician's profile bloomed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassists aren't usually headed for stardom -- the number of leaders who play 
the accompanying, though essential instrument, can almost be counted on one 
hand. But star status seems destined for McBride, who's already had an impact 
on modern jazz that's similar to the splash the redoubtable bassist Paul 
Chambers made in the mid-'50s. 
</P>
<P>
 This extraordinarily gifted musician's most dazzling aspect is his resounding, 
pliable tone -- his notes are dark, round and resilient. Then there's his 
commanding sense of time, his ability to put the right notes in the right 
places, no matter the tempo. His solos are delivered horn-like, with dashing, 
fluid lines a regular feature. Finally, he's also an astute composer with 
something to say. All this, and McBride's just 21 years old.

 Until the eagerly awaited Bruce Nauman retrospective arrives at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art in July, expect art world attention to be riveted across town. 
There, the L.A. County Museum of Art will embark on the search for a director 
-- the second such search it has made in as many years.In the 1980s, LACMA 
fully joined the majors among American museums; a vibrant new director should 
be able to establish it as an innovative leader. Whoever this mystery man -- 
or, mirabile dictu , mystery woman -- turns out to be will have his or her work 
cut out in stabilizing the institution's financial picture, building morale 
among staff and charting an invigorating artistic direction for the future.

POP BEAT: SMELLS LIKE ROCK CLASSICS; NIRVANA'S FORUM CONCERT DEMONSTRATES WHY 
THE SEATTLE GROUP MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT AMERICAN ROCK BAND SINCE R.E.M. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nirvana's Kurt Cobain sang at times Thursday night at the Forum with an 
intensity so primal that he seemed fully capable of frightening physical acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there were other times when his lyrics were so disarmingly vulnerable that 
he seemed utterly incapable of defending himself against even the slightest 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Cobain's ability to blend those conflicting emotions in his songs that 
made Nirvana's "In Utero" the most compelling album of 1993 -- and establishes 
Nirvana as possibly the most important American rock group since R.E.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing his trademark pajama top and jeans, Cobain led the Seattle-based band 
Thursday through a triumphant series of songs -- from "Smells Like Teen Spirit" 
to "Heart-Shaped Box" -- that are so immediately accessible, yet wonderfully 
mysterious, they already have the ring of rock classics. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Bob Dylan and Elvis Costello, Cobain favors lyrics that are deceptive -- 
words that can not only mean different things to different people, but can also 
take on new meanings as one's own attitudes and emotions change. 
</P>
<P>
 While he clearly writes from the position of an outcast, Cobain sometimes 
seems torn over the basic question of whether he wants to once again declare 
his independence or whether he yearns for the acceptance of all those who have 
pushed him aside over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss the comfort in being sad," he says in "Frances Farmer Will Have Her 
Revenge on Seattle," giving no clue in his delivery to whether he's mocking his 
own isolation or finding solace in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Where there is a conscious, literary edge to much of Dylan and Costello's 
work, Cobain writes in a more fragmented manner that makes him, in a strange 
way, the ideal poet for this dysfunctional age. 
</P>
<P>
 While seemingly built around arbitrary and conflicting ideas and images, the 
songs -- with their appealing Beatlesesque melodic touches -- abound with an 
alienation and anger that speaks to an unusually wide audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Without losing the punk-aligned fans that first embraced the band, the group 
now attracts everything from the collegiate hip to the mainstream curious to, 
encouragingly, a growing post-30 contingent that has discovered there is 
something in the band's music that speaks to more than just the MTV crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 On a rare night when festival seating was utilized at the Forum, Nirvana -- 
following opening sets by the veteran Butthole Surfers and the promising 
Chokebore -- exhibited captivating force. Drummer Dave Grohl and bassist Krist 
Novoselic played with raw vigor and Pat Smear doubled on guitar with Cobain. 
Cellist Lori Goldston joined the group for acoustic versions of such songs as 
"Polly" and "All Apologies." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone was pleased with the latter excursions. During one of the 
acoustic numbers, fans near the front of the stage heckled Cobain and threw two 
shoes at him. One shoe glanced off his head, while the other hit his guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the kind of crowd impatience that Nirvana should ignore, but there was 
another sign of frustration worth heeding. At the end of the encore, the group 
went through the old smash-the-guitar and drown-them-out-with-feedback routine 
that has long been part of its playbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it was meant as a wry slap at rock ritual or a salute to the band's 
own punk roots, the approach has become tedious. Rather than a bonus on the 
evening, dozens in the crowd took it as a signal to head home from the concert, 
a benefit for FAIR, an organization devoted to fighting media bias and 
censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 As Nirvana moves confidently into the new year, this is one part of its 
repertoire that is best left behind.

FACES '94: SOME NAMES TO BE RECKONED WITH IN THE NEW YEAR; FILM; LEONARDO 
DICAPRIO

 1993 was pretty good for Leonardo DiCaprio, who mesmerized audiences with his 
star turns in "This Boy's Life" and the limited release of "What's Eating 
Gilbert Grape." But this year, his career as the preeminent actor of the 
post-Brat Pack generation shows real promise of taking off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grape," which earned him awards from the Los Angeles Film Critics Assn. and 
National Board of Review as well as a Golden Globe nomination for best 
supporting actor, opens wide this month. And the rest of the year will see him 
in the Western "The Quick and the Dead," opposite Sharon Stone, for Sam Raimi; 
in a short film on the festival circuit, "The Foot-Shooting Party," a Vietnam 
tale in which DiCaprio's character considers maiming himself to avoid military 
service; and, it looks likely, in the film version of Jim Carroll's gritty 
memoirs, "The Basketball Diaries." 
</P>
<P>
 DiCaprio, only 19 and living in Los Feliz with his mother, thinks, to 
paraphrase Mick Jagger, that time is on his side. He's not worried about 
chasing after adult roles: "I'm young, young-looking and young at heart. It's 
best for me to capitalize on that." 
</P>
<P>
 The kudos hasn't gone to his head -- at least completely. "People looking at 
and appreciating your work -- that's just as much of it as acting."

FACES '94: MORE NAMES TO BE RECKONED WITH IN THE PERFORMING ARTS; POP MUSIC; 
CADILLAC TRAMPS

<P>
 For the past three years, Cadillac Tramps have been the people's choice on the 
local grass-roots rock scene. In 1994, the five-man Orange County band will bid 
to raise its profile on the national level. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tramps -- singer Mike (Gabby) Gaborno, guitarists Brian Coakley and Jonny 
(Two Bags) Wickersham, bassist Warren Renfrow and drummer Steve (Spanky) 
Barrios -- have laid the groundwork for a national breakthrough in classic 
indie-rock fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Formed late in 1987, the band rose through the local punk-rock ranks. By 1990, 
its raw but well-focused guitar attack, its heavy but bouncing signature beats, 
its '50s tough-guy look and Gaborno's humorous stage antics had made it Orange 
County's best-drawing local act, capable of packing Bogart's two nights 
running. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tramps began heading out on the road after signing with the small, 
Orange-based Doctor Dream label. Two albums, "Cadillac Tramps" (1991) and 
"Tombstone Radio" (1992), established a crunching sound informed by punk rock, 
blues, R&B and '50s rockabilly. Continuing with extensive touring in 1993, the 
Tramps won some highly placed fans: The mega-selling Seattle band Pearl Jam 
took a liking to the Tramps and featured them as opening act. 
</P>
<P>
 The coming year will see another studio album for Doctor Dream -- the Tramps' 
last under their deal with the label, and perhaps their ticket to 
higher-profile national shows and a coveted major-label deal. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era of overnight alternative-rock phenoms, the Tramps can point to dues 
paid and a foundation assiduously laid. MIKE BOEHM

 Nashville's booming record business has produced so many new performers in the 
last five years that it's hard to tell one twang from another on the radio 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 That gives Bobbie Cryner a leg up on the pack of '94 hopefuls, since her dark, 
soulful voice is unlike anyone who's come along in years.Her ultra-traditional 
country sound would fit comfortably in the jukebox next to such 
standard-bearers as George Jones and Patsy Cline. 
</P>
<P>
 That's prompted some uncommonly enthusiastic reviews of her debut album, 
titled simply "Bobbie Cryner," and from the audiences that heard her when she 
went on tour last year, opening for George Strait. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reaction that impressed me the most is letters from people who say 'I've 
never written anybody before,' or 'When I saw you and heard you, I just had to 
sit down and write,' " she said by phone from Nashville, her home since 1988. 
"That's really flattering, because it shows that they are really hearing what I 
have to say." 
</P>
<P>
 What she says, she communicates not just through her twisting-turning vocals, 
but through lyrics of the album's 10 songs, six of which she wrote. If there's 
a common theme, she says, it is to address "the strength that I believe women 
possess . . . as individuals, not as a gender." RANDY LEWIS

 They were obscure graduate students at Loyola Marymount University last year 
when they beat the odds and sold a screenplay, about a terrorist plot to blow 
up the English Channel tunnel, to Columbia Pictures -- for a whopping $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 As hot writers of the moment, Ron Mita, 31, of Santa Clarita, and Jim McClain, 
32, of North Hollywood, say they're enjoying being pursued by producers eager 
to pitch them ideas.Even though they finally (after five years of going to 
school part time) got their master's degrees, they find it hard to break the 
habit of living like students and have yet to see the inside of Spago. 
</P>
<P>
 This month they will put up for auction a newly completed action script with 
the unlikely title "The French Teacher." Meanwhile, the pair is undaunted by 
the stalling of their million-dollar debut, "Track Down," now that Jodie Foster 
is no longer slated to play the engineer who staves off disaster. They are in 
fact pleased that Columbia has brought in high-priced screenwriter Kevin Jarre 
("Tombstone," "Glory") for a rewrite. Don't they remember what happened to two 
other fledgling screenwriters who saw their highly touted script develop into 
last year's most embarrassing flop? 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd hate for this to be the 'Last Track Down Hero,' " says Mita. "But the 
studio seems to be treating the script with some respect. The changes they're 
talking about are all reasonable." TERRY PRISTIN

 Domino has friends in high places, but that isn't the only reason the 
21-year-old Long Beach rapper's debut single, "Ghetto Jam," has broken into the 
pop Top 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he grew up in verbal competition with his junior high cohorts, Snoop 
Doggy Dogg and Nate Dogg, Domino is in no hurry to prove his verbal skills.On 
his self-titled debut album, his rhymes slide as smooth and unfettered as Miles 
Davis' horn on "Kind of Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 The coupling of live bass, guitar and keyboards with Domino's easy drawl -- 
which comes from his living in St. Louis until he was 9 -- is the 
sweetest-sounding rap debut since Digable Planets' collection last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonus with Domino is his lyrics. They contain enough of an urban edge to 
satisfy the hard-core rap purists; more pointed at times than either Snoop's or 
Dr. Dre's, yet lure in the casual pop fan with their seductive, catchy ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been trying to be different my whole life," says Domino, who doesn't 
reveal his real name. "I just hoped when I made it, I would put a little dent 
in (rap)." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be surprised if during '94 he earns the critical raves to wind up at the 
top of the extremely competitive Long Beach heap. HEIDI SIEGMUND

 Cheryl L. West's "Jar the Floor," a play about four generations of African 
American women, will finally arrive in Southern California on March 19 at the 
Old Globe Theatre in San Diego -- after eight productions elsewhere throughout 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It's only one of several plays that are bringing attention, productions, 
awards and Hollywood deals to this Champaign, Ill.-based writer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Old Globe also plans to do West's "Puddin 'n Pete," about a divorced 
couple who remarry, later in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater's artistic director Jack O'Brien calls the 37-year-old former 
social worker "a major voice" with "a head full of plays." Meanwhile, a 
three-way co-production of her latest play, "Holiday Heart," opens Friday at 
Syracuse Stage and will then move to Cleveland Play House and Seattle Repertory 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hollywood, West is working on a screenplay for Oprah Winfrey's production 
company, and Spike Lee has the movie option on "Before It Hits Home," her first 
major play. 
</P>
<P>
 It examined AIDS within a black family and attracted some flak in the process. 
But West refers to critics of her portrayals of black characters as "the 
positive police." DON SHIRLEY

 Last month, Michael Kieran Harvey was one of two to share the first prize at 
the first Ivo Pogorelich Solo Piano Competition in Pasadena. He took home to 
Melbourne, Australia, a $75,000 check, a promise of concert dates in Spain and 
Germany and a recording contract from Hong Kong-based Naxos Marco Polo. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition was a breakthrough for Harvey, who claims there's "absolutely 
no market" for mainstream classical pianists in Australia. Reviewing Harvey's 
unorthodox final-round program of works by Prokofiev, Beethoven, Berio, Vine 
and Messiaen, Times music writer Daniel Cariaga observed: "The Australian 
pianist's way with all this music was one of authority, abundant resources of 
tone, dynamics and nuance, and utter artistic conviction, which seemed to reach 
and touch the audience. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "This competition opened up avenues to people I would never have had contact 
with in my life, especially in the recording industry," Harvey said. GRETA

LENNONGRAD, BACK IN WHAT USED TO BE THE U.S.S.R. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One night three years ago, Kolya Vasin dreamed of a great temple. It might 
have come from playing the John Lennon classic "Imagine" one too many hundred 
times. Or from the revelry he and his Bohemian crowd here had arranged that 
evening to honor Lennon's 50th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vasin awoke, he quickly painted a picture of the vision he had seen in 
his sleep. On the shores of the Gulf of Finland, a giant temple would rise, 70 
yards high, its irregular stone crags broken only by two great spheres, a 
yellow one reading "All You Need Is Love" and a blue one reading "Give Peace a 
Chance." A yellow submarine would float nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a shrine to rock 'n' roll -- the John Lennon Rock 'n' Roll Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia and the whole world need such a temple," Vasin said, sitting at a 
broad table graced by a ceramic model of the temple the size of a large turkey. 
"This temple will say to people: Stop, stop being ugly, stop being sad. Be 
happy, because life is short," he said. "It will be a spiritual revolution on 
the cusp of the 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
 When the inspiring power of the Beatles mixes with the Russian predilection 
for mysticism, a potent combination results. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Imagine' is the proto-image for the temple," said Vasin, a heavily bearded, 
comfy man with slightly off-center, merry eyes. " 'Imagine all the people 
living for today.' Well, I did. I imagined. The result is the temple." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasin, an artist known as one of Russia's most ardent and knowledgeable 
Beatles fan -- he prefers the term "Beatles-ologist" -- now devotes his life to 
promoting the idea of the temple. He sends letters to rock stars, fan clubs and 
foundations. His friends have formed a committee to help. He has attracted a 
smattering of media attention. 
</P>
<P>
 He produces T-shirts and heart-shaped coffee cups bearing the temple's logo, a 
peace symbol shaped like a heart, and reading, "All you need is love. John 
Lennon Rock 'n' Roll Temple" in Russian and English. 
</P>
<P>
 He figures he needs $10 million to build the structure. He may raise that sum. 
But the very quest to build the shrine serves as the natural culmination of a 
life devoted to and possessed by the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 In a testament to the power of Western pop culture and its ability to defeat 
totalitarian attempts at controlling it, Vasin, now 48, first heard rock music 
on what was called "Rock on Ribs." These were underground LPs recorded on the 
plastic from X-ray plates, back when the puritanical Communist Party frowned on 
rock and jazz as corrupting influences. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasin hated the restrictions and falsity of Soviet life. St. Petersburg -- 
then Leningrad -- was long known as the Soviet city with the richest 
underground rock music scene. Vasin first heard the Beatles in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 "I listened and listened to the Beatles and suddenly there was an epiphany -- 
an 'Oh, yeah!' . . . I'd never experienced that before and it remains to this 
day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a deeply Russian trait not to do things by halves. When Vasin fell, he 
fell. Now, he says, "John Lennon is Jesus Christ to me, only with a guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a stupid little boy, and the Beatles opened up the world to me," he 
said. "I owe them my peace, my work. Everything good that I have done in my 
life I connect with them -- and my mother, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 "John opened up this world for me and I worry about everything being good," he 
said. "If I read about a killing or ugliness, I feel bad. In order not to feel 
bad, I have to build the temple to be nearer to eternity or God." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasin wants to build the shrine in St. Petersburg, in Russia, for a very 
simple reason: "Because I live here -- I love this country, I have a bunch of 
friends here." 
</P>
<P>
 But the literature he has been sending adds another explanation: St. 
Petersburg has always been known as Russia's Window on Europe, and now he wants 
to make it a Door to the World. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Petersburg would have been an even more appropriate setting, if Vasin had 
succeeded in convincing city officials to rename the city from Leningrad, its 
Soviet-era title, to Lennongrad. He also tried for a Lennon Street with no 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 The temple, as Vasin describes it, would be full of different kinds of music, 
from organ to blues to a cappella, bells and basic rock 'n' roll. Inside, he 
said, "would be a non-stop party for all humanity," with nothing forbidden, 
everything dominated by good cosmic vibrations. Everyone welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 He has already printed a list of special temple holidays, which would include 
Rock Woman Day on Jan. 19 (Janis Joplin's birthday); Black Glasses Day on April 
23 (Roy Orbison's birthday); Back in the U.S.S.R. Song Day on Oct. 21 (for the 
day the Beatles' White Album came out); and the calendar's centerpiece, John 
Lennon's birthday on Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Though still ensconced in his first-floor office at 10 Pushkinskaya St., an 
abandoned building occupied by artists, Vasin is already inducting willing 
Lennon fans into the temple's future congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony goes something like this: "Assume the position of Rock 'n' Roll," 
Vasin barked to a recent inductee, indicating he should point his toes inward 
in a pigeon-toed, knock-kneed, Elvis-like stance. "Now make an idiotic face, 
and accept from me a dose of rock 'n' roll!" It was actually a tablespoon of 
herb-brewed vodka. "Because rock 'n' roll is bliss and bliss is the tributary 
of paradise!" 
</P>
<P>
 Vasin then rapped the unsuspecting inductee over the head with the vodka 
spoon, which hangs from the office ceiling. "Get into the groove!" After the 
inductee's shock passed, Vasin intoned the final imprecation: "Remember John, 
love, and me, an old sinner."

THE PARTY'S OVER; AND TURNING OUT THE LIGHTS ISN'T GOING TO MAKE THE 
POST-HOLIDAY MESS GO AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARESA ARCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pine needles wait in the carpet to jab into a sock-covered foot; spray-on snow 
holds tightly to the corners of the living room windows; the silver cookie tray 
tarnishes before your very eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The holidays have come and gone, and all that's left is the disaster area you 
once called home. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the festivities are barely over, it's time to buckle down and get 
to work, because the only way the house is going to get clean is with good, 
old-fashioned elbow grease. And, unless you managed to not spend all your money 
last month and can afford to hire help, it's probably going to be your elbow 
grease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cleaning after the holidays can be overwhelming," said Gina Flores, owner of 
Nature Maids in Newport Beach. "The truth is, it's got to be done, and no one 
else is going to do it. So you may as well make the best of it and put on some 
music, maybe boil some potpourri, and start." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tips from cleaning experts on what to do after the party is 
over: WHERE TO BEGIN 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing to do is use the kitchen as your base of operations, say the 
pros. Then start cleaning in the rooms farthest from there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get a trash bag and start filling it up as you move from the farthest point 
toward the kitchen," Flores said. "Once that's done, go back with a good 
(hand-held) duster, like the ones made from lambs' wool, and dust up all the 
crumbs." 
</P>
<P>
 Follow the same route with a sponge and cleaner. Then go through again with 
broom or vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
 The exception to this routine is stains and spills. They need to come first, 
because if they get your immediate attention, you might be able to mitigate the 
damage. CARPET STAINS 
</P>
<P>
 Was your carpet left with a few unwelcome holiday decorations? 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible to get out wine and food stains. The key, say experts, is to 
act quickly and have a little knowledge of chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is to reverse the pH of the stain," said Zachary 
Betts, owner of Betts Carpet Care in Anaheim. "Most food and wine stains are 
acid base, and that can be a real problem because acid can take out the color 
of a carpet." 
</P>
<P>
 To remove a stain, the acidity, or pH, of the spot needs to be brought back to 
neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 Betts advises not reaching for the spot removal products sold at grocery 
stores. These cleaners are mostly de-greasers and are useless against food or 
alcohol stains. They can break down grease but will not remove it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People forget that carpet is made of fabric, just like clothes, and the best 
way to get rid of a spill is to use laundry detergent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The detergent will take the stain out without leaving a residue to attract 
dirt, because the pH has been put back to a neutral state. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Barnes, claims manager for Aladdin Carpet Mills in Fullerton, agrees 
that laundry detergent is the best way to remove spills and stains from carpet. 
"The sooner you can get to the stain the better," he said. "At least get the 
stain mopped up during the party and then clean as soon as everyone leaves." 
</P>
<P>
 The first step is to lay a towel over the stain and walk over it, absorbing 
liquid into the towel. (No, this does not push the stain down into the carpet, 
Betts said.) Next apply a solution of one teaspoon colorless mild laundry 
detergent dissolved in one cup lukewarm water to the stain. Working from the 
outside of the stain toward the center, gently rub the stain with a sponge or 
soft brush. Again place a towel over the stain and keep walking on it until all 
the solution is removed. 
</P>
<P>
 If the stain is from Rover or a guest whose upset stomach couldn't reach the 
bathroom, the process is the same. But Betts suggests following up with a 
vinegar bath to remove any odor. "As those stains sit, they turn to ammonia and 
can give off a horrible smell and fade the carpet color," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Use one-half cup of white vinegar to two-thirds cup of warm water. Apply the 
solution to the stained area and blot with a towel. The vinegar smell will 
eventually evaporate. LINGERING TREE 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest damage to carpeting from a pine tree is sap that is apt to weep 
onto it. The bad news is there is no easy way to remove tree sap from carpet, 
and experts agree this is one stain that should be left to the professionals to 
avoid further damaging the carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to guard against sap reaching carpeting is to make sure there is 
a tree skirt around the base that is as wide enough as circumference of the 
outer branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Pine needles burrowing in for a long winter's nap is the other common problem 
with carpeting during the holidays. There is no way to avoid getting needles in 
the carpet, but the number of needles can be significantly lowered with a 
little planning. Before removing the tree from its stand, wrap it in an old 
sheet or painting drop cloth. This way fewer needles are dropped to the floor 
when the tree is being removed from the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Needles are also tough on vacuum cleaners. They can clump together and clog up 
hoses. Rather than overtax the machine, Sue Asford of Asford Enterprises Inc. 
in Anaheim uses a broom and dust pan to sweep up the majority of the needles 
before vacuuming. Even then, there will still probably be a needle or two left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Short of walking back and forth over your carpet in a pair of wool socks, I 
don't think there is any way to get every needle," Asford said. "They sure do 
make the vacuum cleaner smell great though." CLEANING WINDOWS 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County residents intent on not being deprived of a white Christmas 
sometimes resort to frosting their window panes with cans of spray-on snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Removing that touch of winter from the windows is easier said than done. What 
went on with just the touch of an aerosol button seems harder to move than a 
glacier. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is just no easy way to remove that stuff from windows," said Tony 
Casillas, owner of Sonshine Glass and Mirror in Orange. "To get it out of the 
corners you really have to use a razor blade." 
</P>
<P>
 Casillas warns about spraying fake snow into corners because most windows are 
held in place by a vinyl gasket that can be eroded both by the synthetic snow 
and the harsh cleaners people use to try and remove it. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing that may work is to gently scrape it with a blade. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you use a razor you should get one that's commercial grade, and you have 
to be very careful not to scratch the glass," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, Asford suggests, skip the spray snow and use glass wax. It dries 
opaque white and, when applied with a sponge, has the textured look of frost. 
But the best part is it wipes away with a damp cloth, cleaning as it goes. 
SILVER CARE 
</P>
<P>
 Care should be taken to clean and store silver pieces properly, whether you 
use them all the time or just on special occasions. Regular use is really best, 
says Cindy Adler-Larson of Allan Adler Silversmiths in Corona del Mar. "Over 
time, silver gains a warm patina that makes it even prettier," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On pieces that come in direct contact with food such as eating utensils or 
plates, Adler-Larson suggests washing them in warm water with a mild detergent 
immediately after the meal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foods such as salt or anything with egg as an ingredient can be really harsh 
on silver, leaving black pit marks," she said. "If you leave it until the next 
morning, you could be damaging your silver." 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to store silver pieces is to use silver bags that can be 
purchased at hardware stores or silver shops. These bags are lined with a 
tarnish retardant, according to Scott Sarkisian, owner of Normandy Metal 
Refinishers in Costa Mesa. He also warns against storing silver in plastic wrap 
because a chemical in the plastic will eat away silver. A soft cloth such as 
flannel or cotton is a better choice. But don't secure the wrap with a rubber 
band. Rubber bands contain sulfur, one of the chemicals that tarnishes silver, 
Adler-Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
 When polishing silver, only use a good quality polish -- "either a paste or 
polish that's the consistency of calamine lotion," Adler-Larson said. "Never 
use one of those dipping agents; they're much too harsh." CHINA/CRYSTAL 
</P>
<P>
 When cleaning fine crystal, especially stemware, it is important to keep the 
pieces from extreme temperature fluctuations. That is why it's not a good idea 
to put crystal in the dishwasher, said Joan Diamond of the Lenox shop at South 
Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. She recommends washing crystal by hand in lukewarm 
water with a mild detergent and then hand-drying with a lint-free cloth. To 
reduce the risk of breaking crystal during washing, place a rubber mat or 
double-folded towel on the bottom of the sink. A rubber head on the faucet is 
also a good precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers of most fine bone china say their products are dishwasher safe, 
but Diamond suggests a few precautions to ensure safe machine washing: "You'll 
want to use a mild detergent like Cascade and delete the drying cycle; it's 
much too hot." Allow the china to air dry before storing. OVEN TACTICS 
</P>
<P>
 When you finally get down to cleaning the kitchen, the oven will likely be the 
sorest point of all. No miracle tips here. But if the part you hate most is 
constantly rinsing out a cloth, Asford suggests using old newspapers to wipe 
the oven. 
</P>
<P>
 "After you spray on the oven cleaner, it can be a pain to reach in to wipe off 
all that." She suggests using crumpled newspaper to wipe it away, dropping the 
soiled pieces into a plastic-lined wastebasket. "Once the main gunk is gone, 
you can use a cloth," she says. WAX REMOVAL 
</P>
<P>
 While candles go a long way toward setting a holiday mood, the spilled wax 
they leave behind can dampen spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 For wax on carpeting, the best removal process is to lay an old towel over the 
spot and use an iron to melt the wax up into the towel. "Turn off the steam and 
put it on the highest setting. The towel will absorb the wax," Betts said. 
</P>
<P>
 With wax that has dripped onto silver candlesticks, place the piece under a 
stream of hot water until the wax is softened and easy to lift off. For ceramic 
or glass pieces, Asford suggests placing them in a microwave oven for a few 
seconds to loosen the wax. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another trick is to get a blow dryer and get real close to the wax; as soon 
as it gets hot, it will peel right off," Asford said. STORING ORNAMENTS 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday ornaments are often treasured more for their sentimental value than 
their monetary worth, so it can be heartbreaking when it's discovered that some 
of them were broken in storage. The best way to guard against that is to 
purchase ornament boxes divided into compartments so the baubles are not 
bumping against one another. Make sure each ornament is wrapped in tissue 
before placing it in the box. These boxes can be bought at most stores that 
sell decorations. A good sturdy shoe box can be substituted for the specialty 
boxes; just take care not to crowd the ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Once packed, don't send those decorations to the attic or garage for storage. 
The changes of temperature in those areas are too extreme for delicate 
creations such as hand-blown glass ornaments. Temperature changes can also 
cause condensation inside the ornaments that can affect their color. TREE 
RECYCLING 
</P>
<P>
 If you had a cut tree as part of your holiday decor, recycling it may be as 
simple as putting it out on the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 Trees will be collected through Jan. 7 in curbside recycling programs in 
Anaheim, Brea, Buena Park, Costa Mesa, Dana Point, Fullerton, Garden Grove, 
Irvine, La Habra, Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, Newport Beach, Orange, 
Placentia, San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, Santa Ana, Seal Beach, Stanton, 
Tustin, Villa Park, Westminster, Yorba Linda, Aliso Viejo, Capistrano Beach and 
Cowan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos will collect curbside trees through Jan. 5; Cypress will collect 
Jan. 3 through 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The county also has two Christmas tree recycling sites. People can take their 
trees to Mile Square Park in Fountain Valley or Laguna Niguel Park in Laguna 
Niguel on Jan. 8 and 9 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Cities participating in the 
county program include Huntington Beach, Lake Forest, Rancho Santa Margarita 
and Cota de Caza.

ASK THE HANDYMAN / JOHN MORELL: SPOOL HOLIDAY LIGHTS FOR TANGLE-FREE STORAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: Each year around Christmas, I have the same problem with my strings 
of lights. I put them neatly in a box after the season and when I pull them out 
the following December, they get tangled and it takes hours to unknot them. How 
can they be stored so they'll unravel easily? 
</P>
<P>
 E.C., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "The first thing to do is throw away the old boxes," says electrician 
Dave Greene of Anaheim. "You're probably wrapping and twisting them tightly so 
they'll fit, which contributes to the tangles. You could also be bending the 
wire, which can cause shorts. You're better off getting some type of spool and 
then evenly wrap the lights around it. This will keep the lights safe and keep 
them from tangling when you want to unravel them." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Our Christmas tree has dropped tons of needles, and I'm sure there will be 
lots more when we take the tree down. Are these safe to use as mulch for my 
outdoor plants? How do I prepare them? 
</P>
<P>
 S.B., Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 A: "Pine needles can add some acidity to the soil, which is good in most 
areas," says Jim Kitano of Kitano's Garden Center in La Palma. "It's important 
to grind them up before using them. Some people throw the needles around their 
garden, then have a problem with small seedlings (because) the needles can 
block out any new plants. If you do spread them out without cutting them up, 
try not to pile them in one area and use a shovel to break them into pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We recently installed wood blinds in one of our bedrooms, and I'm a little 
concerned. The room gets a great deal of light all day to the point where most 
of the time the blinds are kept almost closed. They're stained a peach tone, 
and I'm wondering if over time the tone will be bleached by the sun. Is that 
possible? 
</P>
<P>
 R.G., Corona del Mar 
</P>
<P>
 A: "You probably will notice a difference over time," says blind repairman Rob 
Delacorte of Anaheim. "The sun will bleach out some of the tone, but if you 
take care of them, you'll get a longer life out of the blinds. Make sure 
they're periodically cleaned and dusted, and remove them before cleaning your 
windows to make sure you don't get any moisture on the wood. If you're bothered 
by the bright sunlight, you may want to consider putting some type of 
protective film over the glass to provide some ultra-violet protection." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: While cooking a large dinner in our kitchen recently, a mixture of melted 
butter and sugar spilled onto some of the ceramic tiles on the counter and 
wasn't noticed until the next day. The butter has hardened and can't be removed 
with cleanser, steel pads or anything else we've tried. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
 E.E., Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 A: "You may have to try to turn the butter back into a liquid," says tile 
repairman Chuck Graham of San Juan Capistrano. "That butter and sugar has 
probably hardened like a resin, which makes it a problem when you're trying to 
pull or chip it off. I would try using a blow-dryer on the hottest setting 
(aimed) at the spot. Keep it there for a while, and it should soften up enough 
to be pulled off with a scouring sponge."

HOME SAFETY; COMPLETE INVENTORY OF POSSESSIONS IS ESSENTIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Making an inventory of your home's contents may seem like an unnecessary 
expenditure of energy, but it can be invaluable if disaster strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 An inventory will be a great help if you are ever faced with filing insurance 
claims for losses because of fire, flood or theft. If you live in an area that 
may suffer damage from earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding or brush fires, it's 
especially important to keep an up-to-date inventory. Furthermore, an accurate 
inventory will help you offer proof to the Internal Revenue Service if you 
claim a tax deduction for the losses. 
</P>
<P>
 An inventory can also help you monitor the number, age and condition of your 
belongings. This will be useful if you move and decide to rent or sublet your 
home furnished. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tips about taking a household inventory: 
</P>
<P>
 * To start, contact your insurance company or agent. They may have a free 
booklet in which you can list your possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Inventory everything covered by your homeowner's policy. Go through your 
home room by room. Open every drawer and cabinet and carefully list anything of 
value. Write down the name, quantity and description of each item (including 
its serial number and brand name), date of purchase, the cost when new and, if 
possible, its current value. Keep receipts. Newspaper ads and store catalogues 
can help you determine current value. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep separate inventories of valuable clothing, furs, jewelry, silverware 
and works of art. Many homeowner policies have coverage limitations for 
valuables. Hire a professional appraiser to determine the worth of jewelry, 
antiques, works of art and historical and irreplaceable items. An appraiser 
charges a daily or hourly rate or a percentage of your property's appraised 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 * While you're creating a home inventory, take the time to make a list of all 
credit cards, including account numbers, expiration dates, charge limits and 
phone numbers to call in case of loss. Note your checkbook account number, any 
overdraft allowance and the phone number for reporting a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 * Photograph each room. Take close-ups of valuable items. Or have someone 
videotape you while you walk through your home describing and valuing your 
belongings as best you can. Make note of any identifying features, such as 
silver or gold content and the trademark of the manufacturer. But remember that 
pictures don't replace lists because small items may be overlooked and details 
such as carvings may not show up. 
</P>
<P>
 * Store the photos, videotape and the written list in a safe-deposit box, but 
keep a copy of the list in a separate place. 
</P>
<P>
 * Update the inventory annually. Review a new or updated inventory with your 
insurance company to be sure that you have adequate coverage. If necessary, get 
a replacement-cost rider on your policy so that you will be reimbursed at full 
value in case of loss. 
</P>
<P>
 After you've taken an inventory, mark your valuables with your Social Security 
or driver's license number so they may be identified if they are stolen. Use 
waterproof paint on the bottom of ceramic or wooden pieces. On metal or glass, 
use an etching tool or carbide-tip inscriber. These are available at hardware 
and art supply stores, or you may be able to borrow one from your local police 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 If you do experience a loss, phone your insurer right away, then follow up 
with a letter. If the loss is the result of crime, report it immediately to the 
police to validate your claim.

DECORATING; VICTORIANA ENTERS THE WHITE HOUSE . . . AND A NEW ERA OF 
RESPECTABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Victorian decorating, in the doghouse for most of the 20th Century, has moved 
into the White House. The Treaty Room and the Lincoln sitting room have been 
done in high Victorian style for President and Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Nina Hughes, a New York decorator, says that while the Clintons are giving the 
style visibility, Victorian decorating has been gaining acceptance for several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The further away from the period we have gotten, the more respectable it has 
become," says Hughes, a consultant on furnishings when the late 19th-Century 
New Jersey State House in Trenton was restored. 
</P>
<P>
 A totally Victorian interior, as in the White House rooms, is rare today. Most 
people settle for a few pieces as, in Hughes' words, "a decorative element to 
create tension and interest in their rooms." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with Victorian, Hughes says, is that "more styles were introduced 
in the Victorian era than perhaps at any other time. Virtually every period had 
its renaissance during that era." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike today, those eclectic Victorian rooms filled with different elements 
competing for attention weren't considered a mishmash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having a room furnished with a Moroccan pouf, a lacquer table from the 
Orient, a wicker piece and seating, each covered with a different fabric, 
showed that you were cultivated and knew about these things," Hughes says. "We 
are doing the same kind of thing but with greater control and less abandon." 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate Victorian living room probably wouldn't suit today. For example, 
the lamp-lit center table -- often the focal point of the parlor -- would most 
likely obstruct the sight line to the TV set. 
</P>
<P>
 In a modern living room, the main part of the room is the seating, with a low 
coffee table that doesn't block the tube. With or without television, the 
appeal of Victorian style is the nostalgia it evokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems as if it was a more secure and reassuring time when life was easier 
for the middle class," Carol McD. Wallace says. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace is author of "Victorian Treasures: An Album and Historical Guide for 
Collectors" (Abrams, 1993, $34.95). The book offers a tour through the 
Victorian home, explaining the furnishings of each room. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the pieces are in antiques shops and flea markets, just waiting for 
good homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was so much of this stuff made, and many people still have it," Wallace 
says. "So long as you are willing to look beyond the tarnish of silver-plate 
and the dust of old china and glass, you can find what you need at country and 
suburban flea markets. And shops, auctions and tag sales are sources for 
furniture and accessories. I saw a Victorian armchair not long ago, out in 
front of a store in the country for $99 -- and it was perfectly fine." 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of Victoriana on a room varies with the furnishings. For a subtle 
reference to the era, include at least one deep rich hue such as maroon, green 
or brown in a color scheme, Wallace suggests. For a stronger flavor, select a 
19th-Century "parlor suite" of a love seat and two armchairs. These pieces -- 
upholstered perhaps in a paisley -- are among the most telling ways to create 
the atmosphere in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 A hall stand with mirror sets a Victorian tone in the foyer. These relics of 
the late 19th and early 20th centuries usually have hooks for hats and coats, a 
shelf for mail and sometimes even a seat for donning or removing boots. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dining room, a chandelier over the table adds a formal, late 
19th-Century touch to almost any furniture. For bedrooms, a washstand with 
marble top and pivoting mirror is practical and small enough to fit a small or 
medium-sized room. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most characteristic aspects of Victorian decorating is a lot of 
fabric at the windows. Wallace suggests adding a layer of fabric to existing 
window treatments -- a swag, a pair of drapery panels or sheer under-curtains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went a bit wild with the swags, tails and tassels for the curtains," says 
Priscilla Townes. She and her husband restored an 1870s brick house in 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 Townes says they had trouble finding building materials and artisans but no 
trouble finding period and reproduction furniture and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a fantastic amount of material available," says decorator Hughes, 
"so much so that it's daunting for the neophyte."

BEWARE COMMON HAZARDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The key to making your home safe for infants is to survey and resurvey. While 
the task may seem overwhelming at first, taking safety precautions can quickly 
become an ingrained habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some basic safety precautions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cover electrical outlets. (Some safety covers protect plugged-in appliance 
cords as well as unused outlets.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Use window guards or sturdy screens to avoid a fall. Never place furniture 
near windows. Tie drapery or mini-blind cords high, out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 * Always throw away plastic bags and wrappings, such as dry-cleaning bags, 
shrink-wraps and shopping bags that could suffocate a child. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep older siblings' toys away from baby. Toys for children age 3 and up 
often have smaller pieces that could choke a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use carpet and area rugs to provide traction and a soft surface for 
inevitable falls. Place skidproof padding underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep children from climbing stairs unsupervised by placing gates at the top 
and bottom of the staircase. Don't use old accordion-style gates, which could 
entrap a child. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never let your children play in the garage or workbench area of your home, 
where almost everything is a hazard.

HOME SAFETY; PROPER CRIB WILL LET YOU REST EASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Selecting baby gear with safety in mind can keep home sweet home a haven for 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
 For infants, safety often begins with proper crib and mattress selection. 
Cribs in poor repair or with ill-fitting mattresses are responsible for myriad 
injuries to infants. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, babies can suffocate if their heads or bodies become wedged 
between the mattress and the side of the crib. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid this, be sure the crib mattress fits snugly into the crib. If more 
than two fingers can fit between the edge of the mattress and the crib, the 
mattress is too small. 
</P>
<P>
 Widely spaced crib slats -- those that permit babies' arms, legs and torso to 
slip through but prevent their heads from doing the same -- can also cause 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Slats, spindles or rods should be spaced no more than 2 1/8 inches apart. And 
do not use cribs with cracked or missing slats. 
</P>
<P>
 Reduce the risk of head entrapment by selecting head and foot boards without 
cutout spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Plastic wrappings or bags can cling to babies' faces and cause them to 
suffocate. This material should never be used to cover the mattress or pillows. 
</P>
<P>
 Cribs made before 1978 may be coated with paint or varnish containing 
dangerous amounts of lead. Refinish older cribs with lead-free paint designed 
for baby products. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove all toys strung across the crib top after babies are 5 months old or 
can push up to their hands and knees to avoid becoming entangled or falling 
over a hanging crib toy. Changing Tables and Playpens 
</P>
<P>
 Changing tables and playpens should also be selected with safety in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Choose changing tables with easily accessible drawers or shelves. Babies can 
roll off the table even if left unattended for only a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for mesh playpens with openings that are less than a quarter-inch wide. 
The mesh should have no tears, holes or loose threads. Do not leave babies in 
mesh-sided playpens with one side down. Babies can suffocate if they fall or 
roll into the gap between the edge of the floor board and the mesh side. 
</P>
<P>
 If a wooden playpen is the choice, be sure the slats are spaced no more than 2 
1/8 inches apart. Safety Gates 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden accordion-style gates made before 1985 may have wide V-shaped openings 
along the top edge and sides that may entrap children's heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, select gates with straight top edges or accordion-style gates with 
openings no more than 1 1/2-inches wide. 
</P>
<P>
 And remember: Safety gates are deterrents, not a substitute for supervision. 
Almost all gates can be dislodged or climbed. Traveling 
</P>
<P>
 Taking precautions before traveling with babies can also be important. 
</P>
<P>
 Select a wide-based stroller to prevent tipping. Test the brakes to be sure 
that they lock the wheels securely. 
</P>
<P>
 The stroller's safety belt and crotch strap should open and lock easily -- and 
both should fasten securely to the frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Infants should ride in car seats positioned in the center of the back seat 
facing the car's rear. In the event of a crash, the impact would be spread 
across their backs.

HOME MAINTENANCE; FORESIGHT WILL HELP DRAINS FLOW FREELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 A little preventive maintenance will keep your bathtub drain from clogging. 
</P>
<P>
 A slightly clogged drain is much easier to clear than a totally blocked one. 
In many cases, flushing the drain with liberal doses of boiling water will 
restore free flow. (Don't pour boiling water into plastic pipes, however. They 
are not made for temperatures over 180 degrees Fahrenheit.) 
</P>
<P>
 Keep a bathtub drain from clogging by cleaning the stopper assembly every 
couple of months. On most tubs, remove the screws from the overflow plate and 
pull out the assembly. Then ease the stopper out. Clean both pieces of any 
accumulation and reinstall them. With the curved part of the stopper linkage 
facing down, work the stopper gently back and forth to fit it into place. Then 
reinstall the overflow plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Act promptly when you notice the bathtub drain is emptying slower than usual. 
When a bathtub drains slowly or not at all, it's probably caused by an 
accumulation of hair and soap curds lodged in the drainpipe, usually near the 
drain opening. 
</P>
<P>
 To correct such clogging, use a rubber plunger with a wide flat tip that makes 
good contact with the tub bottom. Before starting, remove the stopper and stuff 
a wet rag into the overflow drain to increase pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Run an inch or so of water into the tub. Spread a thin coat of petroleum jelly 
on the lip of the plunger. Place it directly over the drain, tilting it 
slightly to release trapped air, and plunge it up and down vigorously to build 
up pressure. Then pull the plunger off the drain opening. If the water rushes 
down the drain, you have dislodged the blockage. Run more water in the tub. If 
it doesn't go down easily, try the plunger again. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plunger doesn't do the job, try a trap-and-drain auger, better known as 
a plumber's snake. Available at hardware stores, this is a long, flexible tube 
with a spiral hook at one end and a crank handle at the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove the overflow plate and stopper assembly. Feed the snake through the 
overflow opening. Crank the handle of the snake clockwise, pushing and pulling 
it to work the head down into the trap below the floor to break up the 
blockage. In older homes, the bathtubs may have a cylindrical drum trap on the 
floor near the tub. On other bathtubs, access to the drainpipe is through a 
nearby trapdoor. Use these access routes to unclog these types with a snake. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way to clear a blocked drain is with a liquid drain opener. These 
chemical cleaners are heavier than water and settle through the water in the 
pipe to reach and dissolve the blockage. Use extreme caution when using a 
chemical drain cleaner. It's highly caustic and can burn your skin and corrode 
pipes. Follow directions on the container exactly. Wear rubber gloves and 
safety goggles. If you splash cleaner on your skin, douse it immediately with 
cold water. If the drain remains clogged after you add drain cleaner, don't try 
to clean the drain by any other means. Allow the water to remain in the tub and 
call a plumber. 
</P>
<P>
 Treat your drains monthly with the following homemade cleaner that deodorizes 
drains and fights buildup in traps. It's safer than a commercial drain cleaner 
-- especially if you have a septic system, but not if you have plastic pipes: 
</P>
<P>
 Place one cup of baking soda, one cup of salt and a quarter cup of cream of 
tartar in a covered jar and shake well to mix. To use, pour a quarter cup 
directly down the drain, followed by two cups of boiling water. After one 
minute, flush it out with cool tap water. 
</P>
<P>
 Store the unused mixed ingredients in a dry place in a tightly sealed 
container.

ONLY IN L.A.: YEAR IN REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We first prepared our year-ender eight months ago, after a prediction by 
psychics that an earthquake would destroy California on May 8 at 7:05 p.m. It 
didn't happen, but the oddities kept on coming, as our final wrap-up 
illustrates:  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cultural spectacular of the year: A couple made love on a ridge behind the 
Hollywood Bowl during the June Playboy Jazz Festival, apparently unaware that 
hundreds of spectators had binoculars trained on them. A witness noted that 
each time the duo "would change whatever they were doing, people would cheer 
them on." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Your tax dollars at work: David McFadden, a librarian at Southwestern 
University Law School, wrote to the Los Angeles city clerk's office, requesting 
a list of the members of the City Council. Instead, he received a sheet listing 
the betting spreads for the pro football games of Sept. 26-27. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, he had a civil explanation: Police responded to a report of a man 
in an Army uniform holding a gun outside a San Fernando Valley elementary 
school in May. He turned out to be a guest speaker who had brought along a 
Civil War-era rifle and costume. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Can you tell us the color of his eyes?During the Woody Allen-Mia Farrow case, 
Farrow testified that a "former husband" of hers had offered to break Allen's 
legs. But the court blocked her from revealing which ex-spouse it was: former 
L.A. Philharmonic conductor Andre Previn or singer Frank Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Post no scrawls: A neighborhood leader in the Fairfax area spray-painted this 
message (see photo) on the side of an abandoned building. An unorthodox tactic, 
perhaps, but you'll notice that it hasn't been rubbed out by any rival 
painters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Something for everyone: In February, a Long Beach store called Condom Wrap 
advertised its selection of "outrageous Valentine, Chinese New Year and Black 
History condom gifts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How most singles meet in L.A.: California Highway Patrol Officer John Bavetta 
and Sheriff's Deputy Candace Dean were married at an intersection in La Canada 
Flintridge in August -- celebrating the fact that it was the spot where the two 
met during a traffic accident a few months earlier. Dean, who had been slightly 
injured in the accident, arrived for the nuptials as she had left the accident 
scene -- in an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scarier than the Big One: Hundreds of panicky residents phoned authorities in 
March after disc jockey Rick Dees pulled a hoax by announcing that toilets all 
over the Southland might explode. Dees, who blamed the crisis on a backed-up 
sewer system, cautioned listeners to put at least 10 pounds of weight on their 
toilet seats to prevent outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We're surprised the thief didn't wear a disguise: A Telluride, Colo., 
newspaper reported in January that a resident claimed her sunglasses were 
stolen by a woman who "asked her many questions and was wearing a big puffy 
jacket." The victim described the suspect as "a Los Angeles-looking woman." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Will that be coach or first class, sir?During the standoff involving the 
followers of David Koresh at the Branch Davidian complex, a stranger ran into a 
home in Upland and reportedly yelled: "Take me to Waco!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He deserved a special Emmy: Santa Monica actor Christopher Cotten was so 
convincing as a fugitive on an episode of TV's "America's Most Wanted" in June 
that he was detained by Nashville police, who thought he was the bad guy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Excuse me, are you going to be on the phone long?Comic Marty Ingels was 
sentenced to 120 hours of community service after pleading no contest in 
February to a charge of making annoying phone calls to actress June Allyson. 
Investigators said Ingels, who claimed that Allyson owed him money, made 138 
hang-up calls to her home in one eight-hour period alone. Ingels blamed the 
hang-ups on a broken auto-dialer. 
</P>
<P>
