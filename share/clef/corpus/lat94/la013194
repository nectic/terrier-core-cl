 GETTING BY: Sorry, but the commuting nightmare won't be ending in the near 
future. Still, there are ways to make it bearable. Street Smart offers advice 
on safety precautions and which alternative routes and modes of transportation 
make the most sense. Commuters, ride-sharing experts and CHP officers offer 
suggestions. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 SUPER SUNDAY: They lost their homes and they're living in shelters, but dozens 
of earthquake victims at least got to watch the Super Bowl, courtesy of Circuit 
City and the A. C. Green Foundation. Dozens of people cheered on their favorite 
team in front of color TVs at 29 Red Cross shelters around the area. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 HIGH ANXIETY: The two public high schools hit hardest by the quake were El 
Camino Real in Woodland Hills and John F. Kennedy in Granada Hills. Both 
schools -- which serve 5,000 students -- are closed and may stay that way until 
March. At first, students enjoyed the time off. But now they're getting nervous 
-- about final exams, sports and college applications. . . . El Camino math 
teacher Jerry Hickman, above, teaches calculus students at his home. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE DOC: When the Pretty Big One hit two weeks ago, Dr. David Frankle was 
thrown six feet across the emergency room at Holy Cross Medical Center in 
Mission Hills. But he picked himself up and went to work, grappling for days 
with one medical crisis after another. And he loved it. Why? No paperwork and 
lots of autonomy. "It was just pure doctoring," he said. "It was great." (B5) 
</P>
<P>
 BOY SHOT: A 16-year-old Canyon Country boy was shot in both legs and seriously 
injured after he allegedly fired a pellet gun at an off-duty Los Angeles police 
officer. The youth was booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon 
after the Saturday night confrontation in the parking lot of a Santa Clarita 
restaurant, authorities said. (B14)

 FEWER TANKS: Ventura County prizes its rural heritage, but most residents want 
city comforts, like sewers. Only 6.4% of the county's homes rely on septic 
tanks. . . . That figure will probably drop: Under county rules, new homes 
within 200 feet of a sewer line must hook up. . . . Septic tanks are fine in 
the country, said Robert Gallagher of the county's Environmental Health 
Department. But in dense areas like El Rio, they have contributed to 
ground-water contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 STOP & GO: Motorists in the county who shudder at the thought of becoming more 
like Los Angeles have been able to point to one thing L. A. has that we don't: 
traffic meters -- those on-ramp stoplights that regulate cars entering 
freeways. . . . But that new connector between the Simi Valley and Moorpark 
freeways has increased traffic so much that Caltrans may install meters (Street 
Smart, B1). . . . First step: counting cars, which will take up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
 FIXING WELFARE: We've had five presidents in the 18 years since James E. Isom 
became Ventura County's welfare director, and they've all tried to revise the 
system. "Nothing productive has come out of it yet," Isom said. . . . President 
Clinton is right to talk about work, he said. "But there has to be training, 
and that costs money." . . . Most recipients want to work, he said. "But not at 
McDonald's for minimum wage. Yet others work there. Should we treat welfare 
clients differently?" About 65,000 county residents get welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 BUSY MONTH: February is the shortest month, but it has been an eventful one in 
Ventura County. . . . On Feb. 18, 1850, the Legislature established Santa 
Barbara County, which included Ventura County. On Feb. 7, 1900, Thomas Bard was 
elected to the U. S. Senate, the only county resident to serve there. . . . And 
many devastating floods have come in February -- including one on Feb. 17, 
1884, that moved Santa Paula Creek from west of the city to the east side. . . 
. Some February events are predictable (The Month Ahead, B2). Tank Towns

 Nick Cravat, the diminutive acrobat who worked with actor Burt Lancaster in 
circus tours and films, has died. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
 Cravat died Saturday of lung cancer at the Motion Picture and Television Fund

 Later, he became an actor, too, and performed acrobatic stunts with Lancaster 
in the films "The Flame and the Arrow" in 1950 and "The Crimson Pirate" in 
1952. They shared billing in the 1977 film "The Island of Dr. Moreau," which 
was Cravat's last. 
</P>
<P>
 Cravat also appeared in the films "My Friend Irma" in 1949, "The File on 
Thelma Jordan" in 1950, "Ten Tall Men" in 1951, "The Crimson Pirate" in 1952, 
"Veils of Bagdad" in 1953, "King Richard and the Crusaders" in 1954, "Three 
Ring Circus" in 1954, "Davy Crockett" in 1955, "The Story of Mankind" in 1957, 
"Run Silent, Run Deep" in 1958, "Cat Ballou" in 1965, "The Way West" in 1967, 
"The Scalphunters" in 1968, "Valdez Is Coming" in 1971, "Ulzana's Raid" in 1972

MENENDEZ RETRIALS: A NECESSARY DECISION; D.A. GARCETTI, FACING TWO HUNG JURIES, 
OPTS TO TRY AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps at one point Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti, 
elected in November, 1992, looked at all the major cases in his office and 
figured that the Menendez murder case was scarcely the worst of the varied and 
troublesome lot he had inherited. For one thing, at least the trial issues 
wouldn't be racially polarizing, with a possible urban explosion hanging on the 
outcome. For another thing, as some of the prosecutors must have chuckled to 
themselves sarcastically, there was no videotape of the crime, and what a 
relief that was! For if there is one thing today's prosecutors will no longer 
risk over-valuing, it's the videotape as a slam-dunk witness for the 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the Menendez trial wasn't Rodney King. So how much of a 
nightmare could it be? 
</P>
<P>
 No one would say that now. 
</P>
<P>
 For, six months later, two separate trials later, hundreds of witnesses later 
and dozens of hysterical or tasteless or just plain bizarre episodes of 
witness-stand testimony later, justice in the trials of Erik and Lyle Menendez 
is no closer to realization. For on Friday, two weeks after the Erik Menendez 
jury was declared hopelessly deadlocked, so too were the 12 persons good and 
true who had deliberated for 25 days in the case of brother Lyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 So now what is the district attorney to do? The trial judge, Stanley M. 
Weisberg, thought the facts of the case strong enough that he told both juries 
they could convict on anything from murder-one to manslaughter, but not to 
consider acquittal. However, unless a retrial is mounted, acquittal would be 
the practical result of this twin mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday Garcetti did not appear to be agonizing over the question. The two 
brothers, who admitted to the Aug. 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their wealthy 
parents but pleaded special circumstances as long-suffering victims of abuse, 
would be tried again, said the district attorney, firmly. That decision is 
problematic -- and inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants appear likely to continue to enjoy the benefits of attorneys 
who have mounted powerful, imaginative defenses -- that, in effect, the two 
sons were driven to the insanity of parricide by the brutal and exploitative 
circumstances of their wrenching upbringing. And the new trials -- two separate 
ones are necessary because of differences in admissible evidence in each of the 
brothers' cases -- aren't likely to be any shorter or less lavishly costly than 
the first go-round. 
</P>
<P>
 For these formidable reasons alone it is to be hoped that Garcetti isn't just 
whistling in the dark, gambling on more receptive juries, praying that the 
Menendez brothers will not be as apparently effective with jurors the second 
time as the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it is to be devoutly hoped that he would not risk yet another 
panoramic ordeal without the promise of additional material evidence or 
substantial new prosecutorial insight or strategy to enhance the chances that 
the taxpayers' additional money will be spent with result. 
</P>
<P>
 But, granting all these reservations, in the end it must be said that Garcetti 
did what he had to do. The district attorney himself put the issue quite well: 
It was not an issue of winning or losing but of doing justice. The office of 
district attorney exists precisely for that reason: to serve as the people's 
agent in the achievement of a measure of justice. By this standard, Garcetti 
suggested, he believes he has an "ethical, professional and moral 
responsibility to go forward" with a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 Parricide is an ancient, powerful crime, one that causes ever-greater 
revulsion as the level of a society's civilization increases. It should be the 
inclination of the people to support a prosecutor who, weighing a case this 
grave, says he must in good conscience proceed -- to have these cases decided 
one way or the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes you shouldn't nickel and dime justice.

REP. ROHRABACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with disgust Rep. Dana Rohrabacher's (R-Huntington Beach) demands that 
illegal immigrant quake victims be forbidden from receiving aid (Jan. 23-24). I 
cannot believe that with all the wonderful Los Angelenos giving of their money, 
food, clothing and volunteer work, out of the goodness of their hearts and with 
so many people feeling the pain and suffering that these poor quake victims are 
feeling, that there could exist a person who would deny these victims aid just 
because they are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Has this representative forgotten that one must help his fellow man in time of 
crisis? What difference does it make whether they are legal or illegal? This 
kind of callous disregard for the suffering of others is truly a horrible trait 
to have in life, especially when it comes from an individual with power. I hope 
no one listens to this politician's requests and listens instead to the pleas 
of help of all earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 MARIA RIVAS HAMAR 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 While viewing nonstop TV coverage of the earthquake news and subsequent lines 
of people applying for aid, I couldn't help thinking, "How many of these people 
can our government support?" 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Montes of the League of United Latin American Citizens states that 
Rohrabacher's comments are "racist." Anytime anyone questions handouts given to 
illegal immigrants, whether it includes free health care or free education, 
that person is labeled a "racist." 
</P>
<P>
 I hope this earthquake has "shaken up" more people into realizing that the 
disaster relief pit is not bottomless and unless we monitor who gets the money, 
we who live here legally will have to do with less while those who live here 
illegally can have more. The American pie is only so big.

MANDATORY QUAKE INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "Stitching Together a Disaster Safety Net," editorial, Jan. 22: 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot believe The Times is now calling for mandatory earthquake insurance 
because "government doesn't have resources to compensate for disaster produced 
property loss." I think the question that we should be asking in light of that 
statement is, what am I paying taxes for? The police cannot protect me, our 
schools are war zones and kids are not learning anything anyway, and the 
richest nation in the world cannot provide basic housing for all of its 
citizens. Haven't we learned our lesson from mandatory car insurance? Probably 
half the drivers in the state do not have car insurance because it is too 
expensive. What are you going to do when a homeowner cannot afford earthquake 
insurance? Put him in jail? Tell him tough luck about your home? 
</P>
<P>
 The last thing we need is another government agency soaking up more money that 
we seemingly do not have. I think The Times would better serve the community by 
looking at how government is wasting our tax dollars rather than encouraging 
government to take more. It's a pretty pathetic situation in California when 
the only way to get some type of service out of government is to tax ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 ROBERT J. BOCK JR. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 Your otherwise excellent editorial suggesting that Congress require earthquake 
insurance for all Californians stopped short of an effective solution. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes more sense is mandating "natural disaster insurance" for all 
Americans. This would cover not just earthquakes but floods, mudslides, 
tornadoes, hurricanes, drought, freeze damage and other nasty surprises from 
Mother Nature. After all, not long ago homes and businesses without flood 
insurance here in the Valley and across the Midwest were inundated, so why 
focus on just one peril? 
</P>
<P>
 By pooling all these natural risks across all state lines, there would be 
enough cash to cover the inevitable disasters without having to use tax dollars 
to bail out their victims.

 Now that the shaking has stopped, more or less, I'd like to take a moment to

though I've never met them.I mean, of course, Kate Hutton of Caltech and Lucile 
Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey. I think of them familiarly as "Dr. Kate" 
and "Dr. Lucy," and through the years, after every earthquake, they have been a 
source of calm, rational information, at a time when rumors fly and alarmist 
predictions abound.

HOMELESSNESS ANTIDOTE FOR FOSTER KIDS; LOS ANGELES COUNTY LAUDABLY AIMS TO 
PROVIDE JOBS FOR FOSTER CARE 'GRADUATES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because an 18th birthday signals the end of government support for foster 
children, these youngsters often do not see that event as one to celebrate. 
Ready or not, they must leave the security of foster or group homes to work and 
live on their own. And, as any teen-ager will tell you, jobs are hard to find 
in this time of high unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the plight of those experiencing this so-called emancipation, the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors will aim to fill 5% of the county's new 
entry-level jobs with teen-agers leaving foster care. Hundreds of youngsters 
are expected to benefit from these government jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Deane Dana proposed the plan following reports in The Times and by 
the Los Angeles County Grand Jury that found many foster children are forced 
into homelessness by abrupt release. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana's motion also gives foster children who are completing their junior year 
in high school first chance at federally funded summer youth employment and 
job-training programs. They need that priority to learn marketable skills and 
gain work experience before they must leave foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 youngsters will be released this year from foster care. Most 
cannot turn to parents or other relatives, and they typically lack money to 
rent an apartment and to cover daily expenses. Some will find a way to go to 
college, but for many it's a grim situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers on the streets without skills often turn to welfare to survive. A 
few resort to crime. Without a doubt they need help, and Peter Digre, the 
compassionate and assertive director of the county Department of Children's 
Services, is providing some transitional housing. Digre now insists that all 
foster care "graduates" have a job, a place to go and four changes of clothes 
before they leave group homes or fosters parents. That checklist is helpful, 
but Sacramento should provide more state assistance. New York state, as a 
result of a lawsuit there, now provides former foster children with up to 
$1,800 for rent plus a $300 monthly subsidy until they turn 21. California 
should do at least as much. 
</P>
<P>
 The county jobs will mean the difference between a safe haven and the streets 
for many former foster children. But government can't hire all of them. The 
private sector, too, should pledge jobs to help foster care graduates 
struggling to make it on their own.

HELP FOR UNEMPLOYED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hurrah for Peter Dreier and Richard Rothstein's Column Left ("Man-Made 
Disasters' Double Punch," Jan. 21). They're so right: We shell out billions for 
the victims of earthquakes, fires and other natural disasters, but turn a deaf 
ear to the cries from our millions of unemployed.And these include engineers 
and technicians who could lead in repairing our bridges, roads and other parts 
of our sagging infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us old-timers remember how Roosevelt created the WPA (Works Progress 
Administration) and the CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) in the '30s, giving 
jobs to millions of unemployed professional, skilled and unskilled workers. 
This saved our infrastructure and helped pull us out of the Great Depression. 
Let's bombard Clinton and the Congress with demands for a public works and 
conservation program that's even better than the one proposed but turned down a 
few months ago.

SABINE REICHEL ON ABUSED WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Some Women Nurture Misery," by Sabine Reichel, Commentary, Jan. 20: 
</P>
<P>
 I am shocked and pained to see that women are still being blamed for being 
beaten, pummeled, raped and murdered. I am a detective working domestic 
violence cases in South-Central Los Angeles, and I can tell you that the women 
who walk into this police station to drop the charges are trapped. Trapped 
because so very many of them do leave (their abusers) and he hunts her down and 
beats her for leaving. Beats her for calling the police. Beats her for trying 
to make it on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Why doesn't she leave? Because leaving means knowing who to ask, where to go, 
how to begin. Because leaving means crime reports, restraining orders, 
paternity suits, divorce suits, child support suits and myriad court 
appearances. All this while working full-time, caring for children, going to 
doctors, doing the laundry, buying groceries. And on top of all this, that 
crazy person is beating her. 
</P>
<P>
 Why doesn't she leave? She shouldn't have to. Reichel should ask, "Why does he 
beat her? Why is he so obsessive, controlling, insecure, sadistic, cruel?" 
Asking why she doesn't leave is akin to blaming her for the violence he 
inflicts upon her. Blaming her for the crime he commits. 
</P>
<P>
 Why doesn't she leave? She shouldn't have to. He shouldn't hit her at all. Not 
ever. Not at all. Period.

 How sad it is that Reichel sees the "truth" of relationships between men and 
women as "dark, irrational and turbulent, defined by ambivalence and laced with 
underlying hatred." Bad alliances are not exclusive to heterosexual, or for 
that matter any relationship, sexual or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Relationships between people require a lot of give and take. What happened to 
love? Could the truth really be that it is only those people that subscribe to 
Reichel's way of thinking who are living without love and are having these 
problems with their relationships? I think so, and I pity them.

<P>
 Thank you for the Reichel article on the Bobbitts. After I read it, I felt 
like standing on a table and shouting, "Yes!." 
</P>
<P>
 Reichel is absolutely right. There is not enough time on Earth for people to 
blame others for their mistakes. These three ideas -- education, 
self-confidence and independence -- need to be burned on the souls and psyches 
of all women. Brava, Sabine! 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 As I read Reichel's article, I wondered what experiences, study or 
observations have shaped her skewed, cynical and grossly generalized perception 
of the relationship between men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be much more penetrating and intelligent to discuss what makes our 
society so accepting of violence in intimate relationships and why any person 
feels he has the right to subjugate another.  
</P>
<P>
 To surmise that all female victims of abuse are "mentally lazy" and to 
conclude that the solution is "education, self-confidence and independence" 
reveals a shortsighted and surface level look at this issue. Blaming the 
victims for the abuse perpetuates its existence and keeps us from the real 
roots of the situation and its viable solutions. Where exactly should women go 
to get self-confidence and independence? Autonomy and options are neither 
readily available nor abundant in the lives of battered women. The real problem 
is not that these women are too stupid to take advantage of the opportunities 
to escape an abusive situation, it is that of being isolated from what little 
help may be available. The real problem is that we, as a society, would rather 
spend our money elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 I rarely see editorials or public outcry addressing the fact that assault in 
any instance is against the law, yet when assault and rape take place within an 
intimate relationship, these crimes usually do not rate arrest, conviction or 
jail time. The focus of our efforts should be at stopping violence in our homes 
rather than persecuting the person who falls prey to it.

PERSPECTIVE ON RACE HATRED; FOR GENTILES, TOO, THE HOLOCAUST IS NEVER TO BE 
FORGOTTEN; THIS SINGULAR CRIME IS NOT A JEWISH PROBLEM BUT A EUROPEAN PROBLEM, 
THE APEX OF CENTURIES OF CROSS-CULTURAL HATREDS.

<P>
 The great irony is that people discover race hate the way lovers discover 
love. It always seems utterly new and fresh to the hater, who like the lover 
feels that he has invented the emotion. And like love, race hate always 
expresses itself in the same cliches uttered as if the hater had discovered the 
principles of the universe. "They take our jobs." "They're everywhere." "They 
lust after our women." "They're just too damn different."  
</P>
<P>
 Racism is as human as love. In defining ourselves, the tribe we belong to, its 
mores, we are tempted to believe in the inferiority of the culture and mores of 
other groups. Prejudice is the hairy backside of what we all need: a sense of 
identity. Sometimes, the more grand the cultural identity, the greater is the 
temptation to racism. The officers of the Einsatzgruppen, the SS killing 
squads, all loved their Mozart and their Goethe. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, particularly in America, race hate or group hate seems rootless, as in 
the now famous case of the two young men who attacked a Vietnamese stroller in 
Laguna Beach because they thought he was gay. It did not seem that the young 
men had any measurable reason, any damage they could point to or quantify, to 
explain why they wanted to beat the hell out of either Asians or gays. Did 
America's war experiences provide them with a primitive spur? The AIDS 
epidemic? A long bow to draw to believe that their own immune systems would 
somehow be strengthened by assaulting a perhaps-gay Vietnamese beach-walker. 
</P>
<P>
 We often righteously sneer at the racial and religious violence in Northern 
Ireland and in the Balkans, but hate in both these cases is based on versions 
of history and measurable blood spilled in the past. There is more than legend 
to what the Serbs and Croatians did to each other since the Middle Ages, and to 
what Bosnian Muslims may once have done under Turkish rule. Catholics and 
Protestants in Northern Ireland can similarly point to historic massacres, even 
though they may be written too simple-mindedly into their respective maps of 
the world and their folk songs. In all cases, the hate is merely augmented 
rather than caused by religious difference. But at least the Northern Irish 
Catholics can point to very real injustices and miseries they have suffered. 
Protestants can point to their own heap of bodies, the real fear of IRA gunmen 
and of being absorbed into a Republic of Eire in which their civil rights may 
be curtailed for the sake of Catholic doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
 Race hate in America is not often based on any real disadvantage suffered by 
the hater. It is based on stereotypes or rumor. But that's all the serpent in 
the gut needs to start secreting its poison. 
</P>
<P>
 Over every question of race or group hate lies the shadow of the Holocaust, 
and for the moment the Holocaust questions are associated with Steven 
Spielberg's film of my book. As a Gentile, an Australian of Irish Catholic 
background, I have no hesitation in saying that the Holocaust should be talked 
about again and again and should not be forgotten. The reason is that the 
Holocaust is the most extreme version of rootless race hate in European 
history. Classic European anti-Semitism was based more on the idea that the 
Jews had killed Christ and were engaged in an anti-European philosophic and 
financial conspiracy than on any measurable harm done to Europe. No one could 
point to Jewish massacres of Christians, though in Poland and Germany vague but 
intense hate was able to be engineered into blaming Jews for the economic 
problems of both countries. But who could say, my mother was raped by a Jew, my 
father hanged by one? 
</P>
<P>
 The SS mastered the ultimate challenge of genocide: If you get the hated group 
where you want them -- behind wire -- how do you ensure that your now- 
perfected kingdom isn't sullied by too many corpses lying around and giving 
mute evidence of what happened to them? It's a question of processing the hated 
group. The Nazis devised the most bureaucratic, most extreme, most 
technological means of doing that. No question that the Cambodian tyrant Pol 
Pot would have loved to have been able to organize such methods to punish those 
of his own people who lacked "political correctness." No question that the 
tyrant Mengistu of Ethiopia would have loved to have been able to apply a final 
solution to the Eritreans of the Horn of Africa. But the Nazis really did it, 
and they were Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 As a European who grew up very far from the scene, I don't feel uselessly 
guilty about that, but I feel amazed and appalled. On a recent Sunday in 
Chicago, I met an elderly couple, the Schlesingers. A tall, sober-looking man 
and a small-boned, extremely handsome woman, they had been prisoners in Oskar 
Schindler's work camps. It struck me again, the ridiculous idea to which all 
the resources of the Reich were devoted -- the idea that European civilization 
and the Schlesingers could not be allowed to coexist. The Schlesingers, urbane 
and pleasant as they are, could not be permitted to go on breathing. Only 
Schindler's intervention and their own intelligence ensured that they did 
continue to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe one shouldn't be surprised, since the racist always talks in terms of 
mass extermination. The last station on the hate line in his head is always 
something like Auschwitz, which stands as the most graphic instance of the kind 
of place to which hatred takes people. 
</P>
<P>
 And now the further great irony is that Jews like Steven Spielberg are 
actually blamed for remembering, for reviving the memory that is not only 
Jewish but human. The Jews, we are told by the haters, remember their disasters 
in a particularly and hatefully Jewish way. And what about the fact that the 
Israeli right wing uses the Holocaust as a sanction for the persecution of 
Palestinians? Instead of addressing that real political problem, let's work on 
forgetting the Holocaust as fast as we can. Christians are allowed to remember 
the crucifixion of their Messiah, which occurred some time in the first century 
A.D.; Jews should be disqualified from remembering their dead of 1939-1945 
because they are too good at it, too damn . . . Jewish! 
</P>
<P>
 But the Holocaust remains for me not a Jewish problem but a European one. The 
Germans themselves are grappling with a conflict about this among their 
historians -- how to fit this unique event into German history, into the German 
and European imagination. And that is not the Jews' fault. It is the fault of 
Europe, which has pursued anti-Semitism consistently since the Middle Ages and 
has still not yet repented of it. It is the grand Europe that all us people 
from the new world love to visit and rightly admire that brought race hate to 
its ultimate conclusion. That is why it is important for Gentiles to retain the 
memory of the Holocaust, and to receive the warnings inherent in it.

CONTRARIAN QUESTIONS ABOUT POST-QUAKE AID; IT'S OUR MONEY, NOT A GIFT FROM 
WASHINGTON; A SALES TAX WORKED IN 1989, BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY IN 
RECESSION-RACKED 1994. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL FOX, Joel Fox is president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a jolting aftershock following the Northridge earthquake, some 
politicians immediately called for a tax increase to repair the damage. They 
wanted to follow the example set after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake of 
Northern California, when sales taxes were raised to pay the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But for California in 1994, tax increases would tremble our already unsteady 
economy. In economic terms, 1994 California is worlds apart from 1989 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden State has been mired in a recession for nearly all those years. 
According to legislative sources, a quarter-cent sales tax for 13 months, as in 
1989, would bring in $100 million less because of the poor economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, when the sales tax was increased for the earthquake, the rate was 1 
1/4 cents less than it is today. The gas tax is twice as high as it was in 
1989. And the current 18-cent state gas tax does not include the recent federal 
gas-tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
 While Californians agreed to tax themselves after the 1989 disaster, that has 
not been common practice. After the floods of last summer, Iowa, Illinois, 
Missouri and Wisconsin did not raise state taxes for disaster relief. After 
Hurricane Andrew nearly blew Florida into a different time zone, the state did 
not raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida responded to its crisis in a unique way. Officials set up a trust fund 
for hurricane relief to capture the anticipated tax revenue from a buying and 
construction surge. Much of the private property lost to Hurricane Andrew was 
insured, however, so Florida officials anticipated money from insurance 
companies to cover damages. A majority of the private property destroyed by the 
Northridge quake was not insured. But there certainly will be money spent on 
reconstruction, and the increased tax revenue this brings should be considered 
in formulating revenue needs. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton should be commended for the $7.5-billion aid package he 
proposed. But California is getting nothing more, proportionately, than other 
disaster areas get. The accepted perception is that California must kick in 
money of its own, likely in the form of a tax increase. Some or all of that 
matching money could come from previously authorized but unspent bonds.  
</P>
<P>
 But California deserves additional federal funds without raising its own 
taxes. That is because since 1989, California has been a "donor" state, sending 
more tax dollars to the federal government than it receives in expenditures and 
grants. Congress should balance the books and send California the excess 
billion or so dollars that state taxpayers have sent to Washington. Truly, this 
money is our money. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the money from Washington, the California congressional delegation must 
be united. A few Republicans are balking at the aid package, but even John 
Wayne Republicans cheer when the cavalry rides to the rescue of the besieged 
wagon train.

CONTRARIAN QUESTIONS ABOUT POST-QUAKE AID; BAILOUTS REMOVE THE INCENTIVE TO 
PREPARE; AMERICANS' GENEROSITY IS ABUSED WHEN ASSISTING VICTIMS IS COMPULSORY 
THROUGH TAXES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JOSEPH FARAH, Joseph Farah is editor of Inside California, a state political 
newsletter, and of the cultural watchdog biweekly, Dispatches.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When faced with such tragedy as the Northridge earthquake, the easiest 
reaction is to suggest that the federal government just bail everybody out. 
It's also the most gutless reaction. And the dumbest. 
</P>
<P>
 People are saying, "Gee, the federal government rescued Florida after Hugo, 
Hawaii after the big storm, San Francisco after the quake, Oakland after the 
fire and the Midwest after the flood. So, now it's our turn in Southern 
California."  
</P>
<P>
 Can someone show me where it suggests any such thing in the Constitution? 
</P>
<P>
 While it's understandable that California taxpayers expect some reciprocity, 
does it make sense to write Los Angeles a blank check now just because we have 
made similar mistakes in the past? In fact, the staggering potential cost of 
the L.A. cleanup ought to register as a 7.0 on the Richter scale of our 
national policy-making consciousness: We simply can't afford an endless 
nightmare of multibillion-dollar disaster bailouts.  
</P>
<P>
 There are other reasons to rethink our benevolent reflexes every time calamity 
strikes. Look at it this way: The same day the earthquake ripped the Los 
Angeles area, somewhere else some poor guy -- maybe in Idaho or Mississippi -- 
lost his house when it was struck by lightning. Is he any less deserving of our 
compassion? Is he any less an innocent victim? If not, how come I'm not being 
asked to pay higher taxes to help him out?  
</P>
<P>
 Let's take this analogy a step further. Let's say the guy has no fire 
insurance. Now, not only is he forced to start over with no aid, no visit from 
President Clinton, no sympathy from Sen. Barbara Boxer, but he also has to help 
pay for the earthquake victims in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Lots of people would like to help out the L.A. quake victims. Americans rise 
to the occasion every time they are confronted with tragedy. But compassion 
cannot be forced upon people. And it's bound to cause resentment when some 
elected public servants act like it's their money that's being offered. Here's 
are some suggestions on how this could be better handled:  
</P>
<P>
 * President Clinton should set up a toll-free hotline, get on television and 
use the moral authority of his office to ask Americans to contribute to a 
special L.A. earthquake fund. Let the Red Cross, Salvation Army or another 
charitable agency decide how to address the needs.  
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage more personal responsibility and community preparedness. 
Government doesn't do that when it takes away the incentive to insure property. 
If Uncle Sam is going to pick up the tab, why should anyone bother to pay for 
insurance?  
</P>
<P>
 * Instead of transferring wealth from other parts of the country, why not just 
allow hard-hit Los Angeles to keep more of its own wealth? Federal and state 
tax breaks for the disaster area would turn loose the power of the 
free-enterprise engine and transform the sluggish L.A. economy into a dynamic 
showcase.  
</P>
<P>
 I know it's not practical to suggest a total break from past practice. Can we 
at least come to a consensus that this is the last mega-tragedy for which the 
federal government is going to accept responsibility? Can we all agree there is 
no endless supply of money in Washington, no matter how noble and worthy the 
cause? If so, maybe something positive will have emerged from Los Angeles' 
cataclysm.

CONTRARIAN QUESTIONS ABOUT POST-QUAKE AID; HELP THE VICTIMS, BUT MAKE CUTS 
ELSEWHERE; WITH A $4-TRILLION DEFICIT, CONGRESS HAS TO STOP GOING OFF-BUDGET 
FOR DISASTER RELIEF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NUSSLE, Rep. Jim Nussle (R-Iowa) is part of a bipartisan push to require 
spending cuts to offset federal disaster relief. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congress should act quickly to provide money to help the Los Angeles 
earthquake victims, but funding that relief should not burden future 
generations with red ink. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing better exemplifies how the federal government got itself so deep in 
debt than the way it pays for disaster relief. When disaster strikes, the red 
ink flows freely. Congress suspends regular budget rules and unconscionably 
spends tax money off-budget when paying for disasters via special emergency 
appropriations. 
</P>
<P>
 With the rules suspended, members of Congress often turn emergency 
supplemental bills into vehicles to pay for favorite projects unrelated to the 
disaster. Of the last 22 emergency supplemental appropriations bills passed by 
Congress, 18 ended up using more money than even the President requested. 
</P>
<P>
 If paid today, the $4.4-trillion federal debt would cost every American alive 
$17,000; the Congressional Budget Office says the deficit will be $5 trillion 
at the end of President Clinton's four-year term. One-fifth of your tax dollars 
go to deficit spending. More than $200 billion a year, 14% of the federal 
budget, goes to pay interest on the debt -- the third largest expense after 
Social Security and defense. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why last summer, when Congress was considering $2.5 billion for the 
flood-damaged Midwest, where my family and I live, I urged my colleagues to 
behave responsibly. I, along with 23 of the 52 members of the California 
delegation, suggested that Congress provide disaster assistance to flood 
victims by using corresponding spending cuts. We lost on a procedural maneuver. 
But my message still is, let's help everyone who's been hurt by the flood and 
earthquake, but let's not assume we don't have to pay the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress, like every family affected by the earthquake or flood, should be 
expected to reorder its priorities. For me, two of the top priorities for 
Congress must be helping the earthquake victims and stemming the flow of red 
ink in Washington. With disaster aid for the earthquake victims near the top of 
everyone's federal-spending list, we should avoid letting natural disasters 
compound our growing fiscal disaster. We should cut low-priority and 
unnecessary spending from the federal budget to pay for earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a sensible solution to two serious problems.

EARTHQUAKE REACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Being a native Southern Californian and a professional working in the 
disaster-preparedness field, I've come up with the latest list of reasons to 
stay in/get out of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 REASONS TO STAY: 
</P>
<P>
 1.The exceptional courage, kindness and community spirit of all those affected 
by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The extraordinary efforts of city, state and federal agencies and 
departments to alleviate the impacts of the disaster.  
</P>
<P>
 3. The presence of the National Guard to protect our peace and what was left 
of our property. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Maybe more people will take the train and stay off the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Orange County's Red Cross chapter immediately scheduling classes on 
disaster/earthquake preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 REASONS TO LEAVE: 
</P>
<P>
 1. KCBS (Channel 2) News with its inaccurate and constant use of the "Great 
L.A. Quake" graphic. To represent the Northridge earthquake as the great one is 
a serious community disservice.  
</P>
<P>
 2. The Orange County Board of Supervisors and Anaheim, who insisted on 
receiving "their fair share" of federal disaster relief to fix the Sony 
Jumbotron (scoreboard) at Anaheim Stadium while thousands are left homeless.

 3. The Orange County supervisors, who still have not prioritized the funds to 
correct critical structural faults in county fire stations. 4. The residents of 
Orange County, for not insisting that these structural problems be corrected 
immediately, and for not showing up to any of the Red Cross 
disaster-preparedness classes or stocking up on supplies.  
</P>
<P>
 5. The collective commercial parasitic slime who were preying on the victims 
and (over)charging for critical supplies.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; FOOT-DRAGGING ON SEISMIC SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the two weeks since the Northridge earthquake sent Orange County a wake-up 
call on seismic safety, it has become increasingly clear just how fortunate the 
county was to escape with so little damage. A review of past warnings and of 
failures to take corrective action reveals a cavalier attitude among officials. 
Earthquakes in Southern California are so frequent there is no excuse for 
governments to be caught ill-prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the state Seismic Safety Commission found that Orange County and the 
cities of Garden Grove, San Juan Capistrano and San Clemente missed a state 
deadline to come up with plans to reduce the risk to unreinforced buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1986 state directive gave localities until 1990 to produce the plans. It did 
not require actual retrofitting, merely an inventory of old masonry buildings 
that had not been reinforced. It was up to local governments to decide how to 
reduce the risks. That does not sound like an onerous requirement, and, indeed, 
most municipalities met it. Orange County officials claimed they met it, too, 
or at least thought they did; however, a closer look shows they missed the 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has admitted that a 1989 letter to the state about seismic safety 
promised updates but that none ever were provided. In addition, the letter 
referred to a plan that never went before the Board of Supervisors and 
eventually was scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 One county official said that although there was concern over seismic safety, 
other demands received higher priority in years of tight budgets and cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to act amounts to a form of Russian roulette, and if the chamber was 
empty two weeks ago, Orange County never can know when it might be loaded. 
After a 1989 county report showed 14 firehouses in the county at high risk in 
an earthquake, some sensible steps were taken to remedy deficiencies. But much 
more must be done. 
</P>
<P>
 The new state report speaks of 72 buildings, 15 of them owned by the county, 
being at risk. Some are old fire stations, others are restaurants or shops. 
</P>
<P>
 A Garden Grove official said his city missed the state deadline because it 
wanted first to draw up a plan for retrofitting that did not burden business 
owners unduly. That's a good idea. But taking eight years to come up with a 
plan, and missing the deadline by more than three years, is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Many city and county officials contend that whatever dangers there might be 
are not life-threatening. But this attitude represents a kind of gambling, and 
the death toll of more than 50 in the Northridge earthquake shows how high are 
the stakes.

SUPER BOWL XXVIII / COWBOWS 30, BUFFALO BILLS 13; IT'S A FOUR-GONE CONCLUSION; 
COWBOYS GO TO HIGHER LEVEL AS BILLS SINK LOWER; PRO FOOTBALL: DALLAS DOMINATES 
SECOND HALF IN 30-13 VICTORY. SMITH IS MVP WITH 132 YARDS AND TWO TOUCHDOWNS.

<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys are champions again and the Buffalo Bills are the 
undisputed kings of the Super Bowl flop. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys and the Bills both made Super Bowl history Sunday, thanks to two 
unlikely stars, James Washington and a redeemed Leon Lett. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, a backup safety, had a hand in 17 of Dallas' points as they beat 
the Bills 30-13 and won their second NFL title in a row and sent Buffalo to a 
record fourth consecutive Super Bowl defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 No franchise in the history of American team sports has lost the championship 
game four consecutive times. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith ran for 132 yards and two touchdowns as Dallas became the 10th 
NFC team in a row to win the Super Bowl by outscoring the Bills, 24-0, in the 
second half after trailing, 13-6, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Washington who turned the game around as the Cowboys became only 
the fifth team to win in consecutive years and tied San Francisco and 
Pittsburgh with four Super Bowl victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington returned a fumble 46 yards for a touchdown, intercepted a pass in 
the fourth quarter that led to another, and forced a first-half fumble that led 
to a field goal. Both fumbles were by Buffalo's star running back, Thurman 
Thomas, whose frustration seemed to symbolize the entire team's. 
</P>
<P>
 Lett, who has had to endure two notorious gaffes, made the play that turned 
the game, stripping Thomas of the ball on the third play of the second half 
with Buffalo holding a 13-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, whose interception led to Dallas' first touchdown in last year's 
52-17 rout of Buffalo, picked it up and rambled in for the touchdown that tied 
the game, changed the momentum and guaranteed Buffalo its place in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and the Dallas defense then took over. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith rushed rushing for 61 of his yards on the next drive, scoring from 15 
yards out to give Dallas a 20-13 lead. Lett, Charles Haley, Jim Jeffcoat and 
Darren Woodson, meanwhile, all made big defensive plays to shut down a Buffalo 
offense that had rung up 216 yards in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a great day for Troy Aikman, last year's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 19 of 27 for 207 yards, but couldn't get the ball in the end zone in 
the first half, when Buffalo's Jim Kelly was moving the ball up and down the 
field with ease, passing for 176 yards before intermission. But Kelly finished 
with only 260 yards on 31-of-50 passing. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, the league's MVP in the regular season, added the Super Bowl MVP award 
to his collection. 
</P>
<P>
 After being held to 41 yards in 10 carries in the first half, he took over 
after Lett and Washington had combined to tie it and Jeffcoat and Haley had 
combined on a 13-yard sack of Kelly on Buffalo's next series. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas then got the ball on its own 36 and Smith carried for nine yards, then 
ran for three yards, then nine, seven, 14 and four. After Aikman hit Daryl 
Johnston for three yards, Johnston dashed 15 yards up the middle on third and 
three for the score that gave Dallas the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith scored again from a yard out 5:10 into the fourth quarter after 
Washington had returned an interception 12 yards to the 34. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Murray, who had field goals of 41 and 34 yards in the first half, added 
a 20-yarder with 2:50 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo offense controlled the first half, piling up 216 yards in taking a 
13-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the defense that kept the Bills in the game, giving up short plays 
but nothing long. Dallas, only one for nine on third down attempts, was held to 
two field goals in the first quarter after twice getting good field position. 
The first time came after Kevin Williams returned the opening kickoff 50 yards. 
The second came on Thomas' fumble at midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' return, to the Buffalo 48, was followed by a 20-yard pass from 
Aikman to Jay Novacek that put the Cowboys at the 28. But three plays netted 
only four yards and Murray's 41-yard field goal gave them a 3-0 lead 2:19 into 
the game. It was the third-fastest score in Super Bowl history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills tied it 2:22 later on Christie's Super Bowl record 54-yard field 
goal, set up by a 23-yard pass that Thomas caught in the flat and took to the 
Dallas 39 by slipping past Larry Brown. The previous record kick was 48 yards, 
shared by Jan Stenerud of Kansas City and Rich Karlis of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 On Buffalo's next possession, Thomas fumbled after taking a shovel pass from 
Kelly and Darren Woodson recovered at midfield. Smith ran twice for 11 yards 
then Aikman hit Harper for 24 to the 15. 
</P>
<P>
 But again the Buffalo defense stiffened, the key play coming when Marvcus 
Patton dumped Smith for a one-yard loss on second-and-four from the Bills' 
nine, and Dallas had to settle for Murray's 24-yard field goal that made it 
6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Bills took advantage of a Dallas mistake -- a running-into-the-kicker 
penalty on Dallas' Dave Thomas that allowed the Bills to continue a drive that 
had stalled at the Bills' 41. It ended with Thomas slashing in from four yards 
out at the end of an 80-yard, 17-play drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the half, Dallas drove 62 yards from its own 1 to the Buffalo 37. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bruce Smith hurried Aikman on a seam pass intended for Harper and Nate 
Odomes picked it off and returned it 41 yards to the Dallas 47, where Buffalo 
started with 1:03 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills reached the nine, but had to settle for Christie's second field 
goal, from 28 yards, to go into intermission with a 13-6 lead.

THEY FORGET HOW GOOD MCHALE WAS; PRO BASKETBALL: CELTIC WASN'T IN SAME CATEGORY 
AS MAGIC, BIRD OR JORDAN, BUT HE WAS A PHENOMENAL LOW-POST SCORER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARACE, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Boston, Larry Bird was setting up easy layups by threading half-court, 
behind-the-back passes. In Los Angeles, Magic Johnson was closing his eyes, 
turning his head and lofting sweet, underhand alley-oops for his forwards to 
jam. This was the NBA of the 1980s, a decade defined by two master passers, one 
on each coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Bird led the Celtics to three NBA championships. Johnson won five with the 
Lakers. Together, they dominated the game while ushering in an era of 
unselfishness, in which players were ultimately judged by the answer to this 
question: Does he make his teammates better? 
</P>
<P>
 In this setting, Kevin McHale played out his career. Kevin McHale, who never 
met a pass he didn't like -- as long as he was on the receiving end. Kevin 
McHale, who never met a shot he didn't like -- as long as he was on the 
shooting end. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin McHale, who may have been the most lethal low-post scorer in basketball 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, it's almost easy to forget how good he was. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 In the era of the master passers, McHale was both blessed and cursed: Blessed 
to be the recipient of Bird's offerings, cursed to be in Bird's shadow; blessed 
with unique ability, cursed to be an amazing scorer when superstars were 
measured by their court vision. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, McHale has never paid much mind to where he might be placed in 
history. No offense, but he has other things to do. 
</P>
<P>
 McHale retired May 5, 1993, moments after he and the Celtics were eliminated 
by the Charlotte Hornets in Game 4 of their first-round playoff series. His No. 
32 was retired on national TV Sunday at halftime of the Celtics-Phoenix Suns 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, McHale, 36, works for the Minnesota Timberwolves as a special 
assistant coach and broadcaster. He has been spotted on national television, 
headphones in place, eating an ice-cream cone on air. Invariably, one of his 
five children is seen sitting next to him; the kid, too, wears headphones and 
is eating ice cream. Life is pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
 McHale wanted to win titles. He wanted to have fun. He managed. 
</P>
<P>
 He still can't believe he never had to work for a living. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He grew up in Minnesota, which borders Canada and is known for its beautiful 
lakes, sprawling dairy farms and dark mines. More specifically, McHale was 
reared in Hibbing, a city of 22,000 that has spawned the likes of Roger Maris 
and Bob Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
 In his youth, McHale was like every other lad in Hibbing; he figured he could 
kill time playing hockey until he had to get a job. Then, he would follow his 
father into the iron mines. No big deal. Indeed, McHale never thought about 
playing basketball at any level until he was 13, when he was a mere 5 foot 9. 
By the time he was 18, he was 6-10. Even as he sprouted, basketball remained 
just another way to occupy his time. He preferred hockey, which, as it turned 
out, was like Dylan opting for electric over acoustic. 
</P>
<P>
 When McHale led his high school team to the state championship game, college 
basketball coaches were just beginning to notice him. When the tardy 
scholarship offers were tendered, McHale counted himself lucky merely to 
postpone his job search until after he enjoyed himself in college. 
</P>
<P>
 As McHale once recalled, this was the way he made his decision to go to the 
University of Minnesota: "One day I just told my parents I was going to school 
and they said, 'Oh good, we'll be able to watch you play.' I thought it was 
great to get a scholarship. My parents wouldn't have to pay and, better than 
that, I wouldn't have to take out all those student loans and be broke." 
</P>
<P>
 After starting for the Minnesota Golden Gophers for four years, McHale was 
widely known among NBA general managers. The Knicks were hoping to select 
McHale with the 12th pick in the 1980 draft. Wishful thinking. The Celtics had 
the No. 1 pick and wanted a big man. They traded their top pick to the Golden 
State Warriors for Robert Parish and the No. 3 pick, which the Celtics used to 
take McHale. 
</P>
<P>
 This deal was probably Red Auerbach's greatest swindle. The Warriors wound up 
with center Joe Barry Carroll, who, at one point, had a good season in there 
somewhere -- it's just that nobody can recall. The Celtics wound up with two 
future Hall of Famers to put in the front court with Bird, a fair player in his 
own right. Perhaps the greatest frontcourt in the history of basketball had 
been assembled. Instantly, the Celtics were a power lode. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celtics had invented the sixth man, the idea being that a potent scorer 
off the bench could rip the heart out of a tiring opponent. McHale was perfect 
in the role. He went on to become the best sixth man of his generation -- 
during a time when important reserves were ripping off sweats all over the 
league. His scoring average improved in each of his first six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Making him the sixth man and selling him on it was important," said Bill 
Fitch, the Celtic coach McHale's first three seasons. "You've got to have those 
bench points and have them every night. Kevin got them." 
</P>
<P>
 K.C. Jones, with a laissez-faire approach to coaching veterans, led the 
Celtics to titles in 1984 and '86. In those years, on into 1987, McHale was at 
the peak of his skills. After seven pro seasons, he had developed a low-post 
game that featured a litany of previously unseen moves. It is not a stretch to 
say that the assorted drop steps, head fakes, pump fakes, baby jump hooks, 
shovels and fadeaways that now proliferate the frontcourt play began largely 
with McHale. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can guard Kevin," Bird said, "especially in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 His arms were long enough to tie his shoes without bending over -- and those 
arms were perhaps his greatest asset. McHale's wingspan, on his 6-10 body, has 
been estimated at 8 feet. Most adult wingspans average 2-to-3 inches more or 
less than their height. 
</P>
<P>
 He became one of the more intimidating shot-blocking presences in the league. 
By January 1987, McHale was reputedly among the five most complete players in 
the world. That season, he averaged 26.1 points (on 60.4% shooting) and 10 
rebounds. Offensively, he was arguably as virile as that first-time scoring 
champ in Chicago, the guy with the bald head and the shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 But as good as McHale was, there was Bird, and Magic -- and the guy with the 
bald head and the shoes. McHale, incredibly talented and amazingly affable, 
resigned himself to the fact that his career would be played largely in the 
shadows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was sometime around the apex of his career when the family financial 
adviser informed the McHales they were set for life, a fact that prompted 
McHale to say, "Other than buying the lake house (in Minnesota), I do basically 
the same things now, except with better stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think of myself as doing anything that's all that important. I just 
love to play basketball. How great is life? You got everything you need. What 
else do you need? I laugh every time I go to work." 
</P>
<P>
 A broken foot cut considerably into his professional mirth. On March 11, 1987, 
in a game against the Suns, Larry Nance and McHale crossed feet and McHale 
heard something snap. 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment McHale fractured his right foot, his game would never be the 
same. In the weeks to come, McHale sprained both ankles, yet plodded on, 
through the 1987 playoffs. Although he continued to average more than 20 points 
the next three seasons, they were seasons marked by surgeries rather than 
triumphs. Perhaps not coincidentally, the Celtics haven't won a championship 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 Parish aged. Bird hurt his back, tried to play, then retired after he won a 
gold medal in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. McHale, who had sworn he would never 
again subject his body to searing pain, did just that. By October 1992, McHale 
couldn't bear the thought of another training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had told my wife and my kids that I was done playing," McHale said. "I was 
hurt at the time, my ankle was bothering me. But then the kids started bugging 
me, especially my two boys. They wanted me to play, they loved the other guys 
and they wanted to be ball boys. So I geared it up one more time for Mike and 
Joe." 
</P>
<P>
 For Mike and Joe, McHale suffered through the worst regular season of his 
career. After adding back pain to ankle pain, he had just one more burst of 
greatness left, and he saved it for the playoffs. In the Celtics' first-round 
loss to the Charlotte Hornets, McHale averaged 19 points, 7.3 rebounds and 1.75 
blocks. In his very last match, a gut-wrenching, one-point loss in a thrilling 
Game 4, McHale nearly pulled off one more miracle -- but his last-second, 
alley-oop pass to Dee Brown was tipped away at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of amazing," McHale said, "that my career ended on a pass."

BASEBALL NOTES; HE PREFERS TO REMEMBER MANTLE FROM PLAYING DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTY NOBLE, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of Saturday's papers ran pictures of Mickey Mantle in the follow-through 
of that ferocious swing. And wasn't that wonderful to see again? His face was 
contorted from the effort exerted, not from the effects of alcohol. His body 
still was trim, and all those thick, farm-strong muscles were straining to stop 
the most powerful swing in the game. The image stuck in my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Something else stuck in my throat when I considered the reason that photos of 
Mantle were running on the day before Super Bowl XXVIII. 
</P>
<P>
 I've seen thousands of photos of Mantle in that position of power. Scrapbooks 
made thick when I was 7 and he was "7" and this city had seven newspapers are 
stored in my attic, each one filled exclusively with photos similar to the ones 
I saw Saturday morning -- with Mickey swinging. Mickey swinging left-handed and 
right-handed, at the Stadium and anywhere else. Mickey in black and white. 
Mickey in color. 
</P>
<P>
 I assumed -- or pretended -- that each swing produced a home run. And I 
cherished them, looked at them until I had memorized them. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the only pictures of Mantle I want to see now. I can do without the 
ones taken at Oldtimers Days and card shows, the ones that show the effects of 
62 years of gravity and four decades at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt robbed when Elvis died and Lennon was killed. The generations before 
mine would get to see their icons grow old -- Sinatra, DiMaggio, Carson. Now it 
turns out I don't want to see Mantle grow old. I can handle Dylan, Yogi, 
McCartney, Angie Dickinson, Little Richard and even Shelly Fabares in their 
fifties or older. But I want Mantle in Fifties when he was XXVIII and worthy of 
seven daily headlines and seven pictures of that swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, I don't want to read any news stories about him now. With him at age 
62 and with blackouts and memory loss afflicting him, chances are the stories 
aren't going to be very uplifting. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll read Phil Pepe's book about 1956 and Bob Sheppard's poem about the 
monster home runs, and look at some of those thick scrapbooks. And I'll 
remember meeting him when I was XXVIII and so certain my objectivity could 
handle it. I was wrong. And I'll recall taping a commercial for Newsday with 
him and Whitey and wondering what my third-grade buddies would do if they saw 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 And I'll do what, it seems, I've done for as long as I can recall: root for 
Mickey. 
</P>

 Willie Mays publicly chastised his godson, Barry Bonds, last Sunday night when 
he accepted an award for Bonds at the awards dinner of the New York chapter of 
the Baseball Writers Association of America. Mays said Bonds should have made 
the trip from California and been proud to accept the award in person. 
</P>
<P>
 Interesting thoughts from the same man who, in 1990, was in New York the day 
of the same dinner and, having promised to attend and receive the chapter's 
Toast of the Town Award, didn't show. At least Bonds had made no promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Bonds didn't need to be lectured. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mays arrived in the dais room Sunday night, he greeted Dwight Gooden, 
saying, "Hey, Darryl, how ya doin?" He quickly realized his mistake, and he and 
Gooden said almost in unison, "Yeah, we all look alike." 
</P>

 The fear is that this could be a summer without baseball, what with all the 
talk and speculation about labor problems. Well, the 1994 baseball year already 
is diminished. The Elias Sports Bureau has decided not to publish a 10th 
edition of the "Baseball Analyst." That means everyone connected with the game 
begins the season with an 0-1 record. And it's a big loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Two reasons for the Elias decision are economics and too many people using the 
remarkable wealth of information without crediting the source. "If we received 
credit one out of every 10 times we should have," said Peter Hirdt of Elias, 
"our sales would have increased dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
 If a salary cap ever is put in place and revenue sharing ever is implemented, 
what will the Yankees do? Their 12-year contract with Madison Square Garden 
Network expires in 2000, but the contract already has been cashed in with 
CitiCorp and the money distributed among George Steinbrenner, his wife and the 
other owners. That contract was a prime source of revenue. The Yankees had 
cash-flow problems two years ago when they took out loans to cover the signings 
of Danny Tartabull and Mike Gallego, and people not in the Yankees' employ but 
familiar with baseball's finances say an inordinate amount of baseball's 
overall debt is the Yankees'. So might the Yankees have trouble contributing to 
the revenue-sharing pool? Probably not. But the cash-flow problem could return. 
</P>
<P>
 If the responsibilities of the league presidents are to be diminished -- and 
that seemingly will be the case when baseball implements restructuring -- the 
presidents' roles may be little more than dealing with umpires. If that's the 
case, the National League ought to consider Doug Harvey as a candidate. The 
former umpire would be ideal for the position. ... A scout who watched Luis 
Rivera, the Mets' new shortstop, when Rivera was an amateur says Rivera has 
"scared eyes," which is another way of saying Rivera is not a "two-out" 
shortstop. ... How much out of whack was Jim Abbott's 1993 salary arbitration 
proposal? He sought $3.5 million. A year later, he sought $600,000 less and 
settled for $2,775,000. ... Bob Kipper, signed by the Mets during the 
offseason, has the first few lines of "New York, New York" playing on his 
answering machine. "Start spreading the news. I'm leaving today." 
</P>
<P>
 Shawon Dunston, still recovering from May 1992 back surgery, was able to do 
all that was asked of him two weeks ago in a Cubs minicamp in Mesa. But, no, 
the Mets still don't want him, nor should they. He would be overpriced at full 
strength. The Mets were among the clubs who sent someone to watch Dunston work 
out. Dunston batted 10 times last September before pulling his hamstring, but 
apparently he's more capable now than he was when he made his comeback ... 
Related question: How could the Cubs run a minicamp? The Yankees were told by 
the players association that they couldn't. According to Eugene Orza, attorney 
with the players association, the Yankees erred by inviting players to their 
planned camp. "They can run a camp, but they can't invite players to camp," 
Orza said, "because invitations, in this game, become demands."

 Call them what you will -- presidents, vice presidents, directors, vice 
chairmen or general managers -- each is his club's primary baseball executive 
and essentially has the responsibilities traditionally associated with general 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever you call them, there are three new ones: Dan Duquette, late of the 
Expos, now with the Red Sox, and two others recently promoted -- Bill Bavasi of 
the Angels and Kevin Malone, Duquette's successor with the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotions of Bavasi and Malone, each 36, increased to 12 the numbers of 
"general managers" younger than Marlins pitcher Charlie Hough, the oldest 
active player in the game. Hough turned 46 earlier this month. Sandy Alderson, 
the Athletics' president and general manager, is only six weeks older than 
Hough. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mets General Manager Al Harazin was interviewed for the Red Sox job 
that went to Duquette. Says Harazin: "Dan is a bright young baseball mind. He's 
today's genius. ... I was 'today's genius' two years ago."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL NOTES; BY KEEPING EVANS IN LIMBO, PITTSBURGH IS HURTING 
ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Paul Evans deserves an answer. More than half the season is gone and Evans 
still has no idea whether he will be back as Pittsburgh's basketball coach next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, recruits who might be considering Pitt have no idea who will be 
coaching the team next season. When that happens, a program essentially is shut 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, who turns 49 Monday, has the Panthers headed toward their sixth NCAA 
appearance in his eight seasons at Pitt, but his contract expires at the end of 
this season. He hasn't received an extension. He hasn't been told this is the 
end. He hasn't been given a timetable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tough on me," Evans said in a recent Big East coaches conference 
call. "You worry about every game, every shot. ... I don't know what the deal 
is. I think we have a few alumni who wish we had John Calipari back." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans made that statement before it was reported that Calipari agreed to a 
six-year contract extension as coach at UMass. Of course, contracts mean very 
little in the age of the escape clause. 
</P>
<P>
 Calipari is a former Pitt assistant and has been rumored to be in line for the 
Pitt job for several seasons. Calipari is known to have some support among 
alumni who want to hire a high-profile recruiter. Every time the rumors began 
in past seasons, Pitt started winning and Evans saved his job. This time, it 
isn't clear if winning will be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA placed Pitt on two years' probation in November. Evans wasn't 
implicated in any of the NCAA findings, most of which involved improper 
recruiting inducements provided by former assistant John Sarandrea. If there 
had been a direct connection to Evans, maybe he'd know his fate. Instead, guilt 
by association has left him in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitt received no postseason or TV sanctions. At the time the probation was 
announced, Athletic Director Oval Jaynes said an evaluation of Evans "will be 
made in the near future." More than two months later, everyone is still 
waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 The team will play in a new 15,000-seat, on-campus convocation center by 1996. 
That should help recruiting. But right now, the process has come to a 
standstill. As a result of the probation, Pitt will be limited to 12 
scholarships (one fewer than the NCAA limit) for the 1994-95 and 1995-96 
seasons. The NCAA also reduced the number of expense-paid visits for recruits 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Those limitations are compounded by the uncertainty over Evans' future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts (recruiting)," Evans said. "We only had one kid visit in the fall. 
When we get to the point where a kid is going to put us in the top five, the 
other four coaches say, 'Why would you want to waste a visit there? He's not 
even going to be there."' 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the Pitt administration is waiting to see if the Panthers go into one of 
their late-season swoons. Only once in the past five seasons has Pitt been 
better than .500 in the final 10 games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 If that is the criterion Evans is to be judged on, the Pitt athletic 
department is sending out a very bad message. Evans deserves an answer and he 
deserves it before the season is over. 
</P>

 Remember the old days when Syracuse couldn't hit a free throw? Don't look now, 
but the Orangemen lead the Big East in free-throw percentage (73.1 percent -- 
225 of 308 -- before playing Saturday). Syracuse was outscored, 32-7, from the 
line in a 96-82 loss at Providence Tuesday, but went 7 for 10 from the line. 
That made Syracuse 77 for 90 from the line (85.6 percent) in a four-game span. 
"If we shot free throws like we used to, we'd be 1-6 (in the Big East)," Coach 
Jim Boeheim said. "We've had great free-throw shooting, which we're 
unaccustomed to -- but we'll take it. Actually, we've spent less time on it 
than we used to. Maybe that's why. We don't think about it now." ... Boston 
College guard Gerrod Abram became the first Big East player to shatter a 
backboard since Pitt's Jerome Lane in 1988 when he dunked against Providence 
Jan. 22. Abram is 6 foot 1, 169 pounds, but he forced an 18-minute delay with 
his shattering performance. "It was my first (broken backboard) and last 
probably," Abram said. "It was a once-in-a-lifetime thing. My first thought was 
Shaquille O'Neal and Chocolate Thunder (Darryl Dawkins). I knew when I did it, 
that it put me in their class." 
</P>
<P>
 Seton Hall point guard Bryan Caver has always wanted more playing time. He is 
getting it now that Danny Hurley is on an indefinite leave of absence because 
of depression. Caver recently played 275 of a possible 280 minutes. "As much as 
I like this, I'm not a robot," Caver said. "I'm human. I get tired like 
everybody else." ... Miami has become an embarrassment to Big East basketball. 
The Hurricanes announced a crowd of 2,870 for their game against Seton Hall at 
Miami Arena Wednesday night. The game was televised by ESPN and empty seats 
dominated most camera angles. On the same night, the UConn women announced a 
paid attendance of 5,826 for their home game against St. John's. ... The St. 
John's men's team experienced an 80-degree temperature change last week, going 
from 5 below in New York to 75 in Miami. ... Syracuse's Lawrence Moten fouled 
out for the first time this season Jan. 22 against Seton Hall. "Usually he's 
very smart," Boeheim said. "For him to foul out is unusual. It's difficult when 
you don't guard anybody most of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 UMass junior guard Mike Williams, who spent Thursday night in a hospital after 
collapsing in the second half of the Minutemen's 76-74 loss to Cincinnati, was 
cleared to fly home with the rest of the team Friday after undergoing tests. 
The next step is to determine when it's safe for him to play again, so the 
doctors at UMass will run some more tests in the next few days. 
</P>

 It's no surprise, but ESPN and ABC analyst Dick Vitale has UConn's Donyell 
Marshall on his midseason All-America team. Joining Marshall in Vitale's top 
five are California's Jason Kidd, Duke's Grant Hill, Purdue's Glenn Robinson 
and North Carolina's Eric Montross. Player of the year? Vitale says Marshall is 
"a close second" to Robinson. "Marshall has really closed the gap," Vitale 
said. "The kid is the total package." Vitale gives UCLA's Jim Harrick the early 
nod for national coach of the year and Maryland's Joe Smith freshman of the 
year. ... Jervaughn Scales of Southern University in Baton Rouge, La., ranked 
first in rebounding (14.9) and second in scoring (28.0) in Division I last 
week. Only two players have finished first in both categories: Wichita State's 
Xavier McDaniel (27.2 points, 14.8 rebounds) in 1984-85 and Loyola Marymount's 
Hank Gathers (32.7, 13.7) in 1988-89. ... Texas guard B.J. Tyler has been on a 
tear, averaging 28.5 points, 7.6 assists, 3.2 steals and 5.3 three-pointers in 
a recent 10-game stretch. After the Longhorns won nine of 11 games, Coach Tom 
Penders started campaigning for Top 25 votes. "Take Louisville and give them 
our schedule and their record would be no better," Penders said. ... Big Eight 
teams are 5-0 against the Big Ten this season.

 Pepsi is counting on a couple of monkeys to help it overcome Coca-Cola's 
gaping lead in the global cola wars.Over the weekend, Pepsi Cola International 
fired its most ambitious salvo in the soft drink marketing battle outside the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Its new commercial, aired in 28 markets to a potential audience of 500 million 
consumers, shows researchers experimenting on two chimps, giving a diet of 
Coca-Cola to one, Pepsi to the other. By the end of the test period, the chimp 
who drank Coca-Cola is making great strides, hammering pegs into the right 
holes, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 But the carefree Pepsi chimp is driving down a beach in a Jeep with several 
girls and a surfboard, music blaring.

 FCC May OK Infinity Deal for KRTH-FM: Radio shock jock Howard Stern's employer 
may be allowed to buy the big Los Angeles station as FCC members back away from 
earlier threats to block the deal, the New York Times and the Washington Post 
reported last week. The FCC discussed penalizing Stern's employer by nixing the 
purchase, but the commission is concerned that such drastic punishment would be 
overturned in court, the newspapers said. A favorable decision for Infinity 
Broadcasting Corp. of New York is expected by Tuesday, the newspapers said.

JACK SMITH: AN ABSENT-MINDED CONFESSOR ABOUT RECALLING NAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is no secret that, like most people in their senior years, to put it 
kindly, my memory isn't as sharp as it used to be. I am particularly remiss at 
remembering names. 
</P>
<P>
 I am reluctant to go to social events for fear I will be unable to remember 
the names of friends I have known for years. Assuming other people have the 
same problem, I always say "Jack Smith" when I put my hand out. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this sounds foolish when the person I am greeting has known me for 
years and of course remembers my name. (Mine isn't too hard to remember.) 
</P>
<P>
 What rattles me is when the old friend, instead of telling me his name, shakes 
my hand heartily and laughs, "Hey! I know who you are!" 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves me standing there still not knowing the person's name. My only 
recourse is to get to my wife's side and ask her sotto voce what the person's 
name is. Her ability to remember names is paranormal. She will say, "That's 
Gert Wallach. You know, she's a Friend of the Center." 
</P>
<P>
 I have heard some Presidents have had retainers who stand beside them at 
social functions to whisper the names of citizens who come up to shake hands. 
My wife could handle that kind of a job. I do believe that women have a gift 
for remembering names. I wouldn't be surprised if Hillary does it for Bill 
Whatsisname. 
</P>
<P>
 I am familiar with various methods for remembering names, but none of them has 
worked for me. Usually the method merely increases my embarrassment.  
</P>
<P>
 I have just consulted a new book, "How to Remember Names," by Dr. Thomas Crook 
with Christine Allison (HarperPerennial). A blurb on the jacket says, "The 
proven, easy, immediate method for remembering names, numbers, lists . . . and 
where you put your glasses." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't mean to suggest that Dr. Crook can't help some people, but I seem to 
be beyond his reach. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, he lists the most common American names, from Abbott to Young, 
and gives clues for remembering each. For example, when you meet somebody named 
Abbott, you are supposed to think of Abbott and Costello, or "butt (a cigarette 
butt)." The next time you meet Abbott, you will think of Abbott and Costello or 
butt and it will clue you in to Abbott.  
</P>
<P>
 I've tried that. It's nothing but trouble. Supposing I meet a man named 
Churchill. I think of Winston or a church on a hill. When I meet him again I am 
likely to call him Winston, or Hill, or even Church. 
</P>
<P>
 I had a dentist once who evidently used this method. He knew I was with The 
Times and asked me if I knew a fellow worker named Mudge. I didn't remember any 
Mudge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill," he said. "Bill Mudge." 
</P>
<P>
 I realized that he meant Bill Dredge, who was indeed a colleague of mine. 
Obviously the doctor had planted mud in his mind as a clue, because what do 
dredges do? They dredge up mud. 
</P>
<P>
 By the same token, if I were to meet a man named Abbott, on our next encounter 
I would probably call him Mr. Butt -- or something worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Crook suggests numerous other clue words. For Harrison, for example, hairy 
man or hairy son. Henderson, hen under son. Larson -- arson, larceny. Those all 
sound like trouble. If I were to encounter a man I had met as Mr. Larson, I 
would probably think of larceny and call him Crook, which would be OK if I were 
actually to meet Dr. Crook, the author, himself. 
</P>
<P>
 My main hope in reading "How to Remember Names" was to find out how to 
remember where I put my glasses, as promised on the cover. Misplacing my 
glasses is one of my main problems. I can't read without glasses, and I am 
always picking up something to read -- the paper, a magazine, a book, letters. 
</P>
<P>
 But often I have misplaced my glasses. I sometimes have to search the whole 
house. It is very exasperating. Usually they turn up, but sometimes on a couch 
or in bed where they have been sat on and bent out of shape.  
</P>
<P>
 There is indeed a chapter called "How to Remember Where You Put Your Glasses 
(keys, wallet and just about everything else)."  
</P>
<P>
 "The goal," it says, "is to make the ordinary become extraordinary. In the 
case of your glasses, for instance, you will want to dramatize where you place 
them, each time you put them down. Say you place them on your night stand, near 
the alarm clock. Mentally imagine the alarm clock ringing loudly as you put 
them down . . . the more theatrical and absurd . . . the dramatization, the 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 OK. But when I go to the right room, how do I remember what I went there for?

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 THE WAKE-UP: The county's Emergency Management Division hasn't been able to 
keep earthquake-related brochures on its shelves since the Northridge quake, 
says Mark Johnson, the division manager. More than 200 were requested last 
week. The brochures, which contain information about emergency planning, 
earthquake preparedness and shelters, are also available from any of the 
county's 31 cities. "The quake has really gotten people to wake up," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE KITS: The rush is also on at Earthquake Preparedness Products in Santa 
Ana. The business normally keeps hundreds of earthquake kits in its showroom 
but is now down to a handful, says owner David Lebanoff. The 1992 Landers quake 
and the Jan. 17 Northridge quake are the only two that affected sales. "After 
Landers, the customers were much more frantic. They'd just point to a kit and 
say, 'I'll take that.' They didn't care what it was or what was in it," 
Lebanoff said. "This time, people are much more interested in what they are 
getting and how long it will last." 
</P>
<P>
 NIGHTMARE: Of all the possible nightmares on Orange County's freeways during a 
quake, the worst would be if both the Riverside (91) and Orange (57) freeways 
were cut off at the same time, says Stan Oftelie, county transportation chief. 
The only alternate route to the Inland Empire, where many Orange County 
employees live, is the two-lane Brea Canyon Road. "Can you imagine?" Oftelie 
asked. "We'd have to work with L.A. to help people get to jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 KIDS PREPARED: Some schools require that students bring earthquake kits at the 
beginning of the year. At Turtle Rock Preschool in Irvine, for example, 
children must bring the following in a large Ziploc plastic bag: three boxes of 
juice; two cans of fruit; two cans of tuna; two cracker snacks; three plastic 
spoons and forks; one package of baby wipes; a family photo; and a comforting 
letter written by a parent to a child. Says Principal Linda Christiansen: 
"After the Landers quake, we thought it would be a good idea."

STREET SMART: 'SMART' PROJECT ON BEACH BLVD. WILL BE DONE IN PHASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Beach Boulevard has been widened and repaved from Stage Road 
in Buena Park to Hillsborough Drive just south of La Habra. I understand that 
this has been done as part of a Beach Boulevard "super street" project. 
</P>
<P>
 What I don't understand, however, is why the three lanes don't continue just a 
little farther north to West Imperial Highway, which is a major intersection 
used by a large volume of traffic.  
</P>
<P>
 Hillsborough Drive only provides access to one housing tract, and northbound 
through-traffic on Beach must still squeeze down from three lanes to two just 
north of there. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis F. Hanrahan La Habra Not to worry. Construction on the segment between 
Hillsborough Drive and Imperial Highway should begin in the fall. The "smart 
street" (formerly known as "super street") project is being worked on in 
phases, but that does not necessarily mean the phases get done in order of 
geography. 
</P>
<P>
 As you know, Beach Boulevard flows through many cities and therefore requires 
a lot of coordinating among these cities and the Orange County Transportation 
Authority, which is overseeing the entire project. 
</P>
<P>
 Some segments received higher priority than others because they were easy to 
complete or traffic volumes were high and needed immediate attention, John 
Standiford, spokesman for OCTA, said. Some segments were pushed back on the 
schedule because traffic in the area wasn't as heavy, or there were 
difficulties, like obtaining a right-of-way, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 From an engineering standpoint, the segment between Stage Road and 
Hillsborough Drive was completed relatively quickly because all that was needed 
was widening the street and rehabilitating the pavement, Standiford said. 
Making improvements from Hillsborough to West Imperial Highway is more 
complicated because OCTA had to coordinate with the city of La Habra, which 
intends to widen a portion of the roadway as part of a separate project, and 
Caltrans, which has jurisdiction over West Imperial Highway, and Los Angeles 
County, which has jurisdiction over the west side of Beach Boulevard there. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Going north on Moulton ParkwayQ from Calle Aragon to El Toro Road, I notice 
tiny reflectors on the left side of the street. They are very helpful, 
especially when they designate a left turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 From El Toro to Santa Maria Avenue, there are none. This area is heavily 
traveled by older citizens, many of whom use the left turnout. In rain, fog and 
at night, we often start slowing down to locate the turnout.  
</P>
<P>
 This slows down traffic unnecessarily. Since this area will be more heavily 
used during the El Toro Y construction, I feel that it is doubly wise to 
correct this. 
</P>
<P>
 Bethel Tante Laguna Hills The stretch of Moulton Parkway you describe is under 
the domain of the county. A combination of painted striping and raised, 
reflective pavement markers called Botts dots are part of the standard road 
design for this area, said Ignacio Ochoa, traffic engineer for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa said he will assign traffic investigators to look at Moulton Parkway 
between El Toro Road and Santa Maria Avenue. If Botts dots are lacking in this 
area, they will be installed, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>

 This is about confusing road signs on Marguerite Parkway. Going south on 
Marguerite it merges to one lane after Avery Parkway. Two signs posted on the 
right side of the road say "Lane Ends, Merge Right." But painted on the surface 
of the road are arrows pointing left to merge left. 
</P>
<P>
 For people who follow road signs and would like to be in the correct lane for 
turns and merges, this sign is very confusing. The road was paved recently. I 
think the arrows were painted wrong at that time.

 Mission Viejo traffic engineer Shirley Land said your letter was the first 
time she has heard of some sign confusion on Marguerite Parkway at Avery 
Parkway. The roadway there was resurfaced last summer.  
</P>
<P>
 Land said her department will check out the area and if there is indeed a 
contradiction between roadside signs and arrows painted on the road, they will 
correct the situation. Land suggests that in the future, if there are questions 
or concerns about roads in Mission Viejo, to call her office directly. She can 
be reached at the Mission Viejo City Hall, (714) 582-2489.

GEORGE RAMOS: MALIGNED DISTRICT'S MUSCLE COMES IN HANDY IN CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS

<TEXT>
<P>
 When San Fernando Elementary School reopens this morning, two weeks after it 
was heavily damaged in the Northridge earthquake, it won't be just because of 
the hard work of Principal Candida Fernandez-Ghoneim and her dedicated staff. 
</P>
<P>
 It'll also be because of the behemoth Los Angeles Unified School District. It 
used its influence with state and federal officials to marshal assistance for 
San Fernando Elementary and other schools damaged in the San Fernando Valley, 
where, ironically, sentiment to break up the 640,000-student district is the 
strongest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't have reopened without the state and the (school) district," said 
Fernandez-Ghoneim as she surveyed her campus the other day. "They've been 
wonderful. We have gotten more resources because we are a unified district. 
We've had fires and riots. Who knows who'll get hit next? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the breakup (of the school district) is the answer at all." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez-Ghoneim echoed a view held by many Latino educators and activists: 
They were glad the bill to break up the L.A. school district died in the state 
Legislature last year, but worried what a new calamity would do to the 
financially strapped district. 
</P>
<P>
 The school system has been like a bloodied boxer on the ropes, desperately 
trying to stay on its feet. The threatened teacher strike over shrinking 
salaries was one shot to the gut, and program cutbacks due to decreasing state 
aid were a damaging blow to the head. The LEARN program, a new approach to 
decentralizing the educational curriculum, was seen as a way to placate 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
 When damage estimates to school property from the 6.6 magnitude quake were put 
at $700 million, many had the same frustrated reaction as did school board 
President Leticia Quezada, who lamented, "How can we take one more crisis? This 
is so devastating it could cause someone to literally throw up their hands, 
find a hole and disappear." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of doing that, the L.A. school district has shown some political 
muscle in marshaling relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, school board members met with James Lee Witt, the head of the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency, who vowed to help repair some 150 schools, 
including San Fernando Elementary, which was one of the most severely damaged 
by the quake. Other federal officials were quickly persuaded to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials also persuaded state officials to provide 200 portable 
classrooms to temporarily replace those rendered unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino activists who shared Quezada's frustration were glad to see the 
often-maligned district still has influence. "Can you imagine if there were 
five, six or seven smaller districts and they were all fighting for some 
earthquake aid?" wondered Eastside activist Marshall Diaz. "The district is so 
big and powerful and influential that we can jam the state and the federal 
government to get things for us." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of San Fernando Elementary, Quezada and other school officials 
were sure no one else could step in to ensure its reopening today. Even the 
city of San Fernando -- a predominantly Latino blue-collar town that takes 
enormous pride in the school, founded in the late 1800s -- could render little 
assistance because of its own problems caused by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the school's bungalows were knocked off their foundations and several 
1920s-vintage classroom buildings were rendered unsafe for students because of 
structural damage. The school auditorium was declared safe by inspectors but 
Fernandez-Ghoneim has decided against using it because of large cracks in the 
building's ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada, hearing that bureaucrats weren't going to meet the school's needs for 
portable classrooms, leaned on them to reverse field and give eight to the 
school. Federal and state officials who visited the school vowed to provide 
everything from security to textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, maintenance workers from all over the school district, aided by a 
detachment of National Guard soldiers, swarmed over the campus to clean up 
debris and restore essential services. Food, water and school supplies have 
been stockpiled in anticipation of today's resumption of classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrangements have been made for several psychologists to be on hand to help 
parents and students overcome any misgivings about the school's reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all else, Fernandez-Ghoneim wants to make sure the 1,150 students who 
return to school have a sense of stability back in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the Los Angeles Unified School District has given the damaged 
schools in the Valley in this crisis.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: YOUTH OPINION; 'AIDS 
HAS COME TO SAN GABRIEL HIGH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY CHANG, Sandy Chang, 17, is a senior at San Gabriel High School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I first found out that English teacher Joe Cornish has AIDS, I felt as if 
an oppressive chunk of lead suddenly dislodged my heart. Here is somebody I 
respect as a teacher, as an adviser and as a friend who now has AIDS. Nothing I 
have ever learned about the illness could have prepared me for this shock. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next few days, I felt upset that my friend's life would be cruelly cut 
short. But as the weeks drifted by, my feelings soon turned into frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 As of now, four months have passed since Mr. Cornish volunteered to have his 
medical condition publicly announced. But little has been murmured about him or 
AIDS except an occasional brief remark.  
</P>
<P>
 It is this reluctance to talk about Mr. Cornish and about AIDS that troubles 
me. Not until I noticed that I pronounced AIDS with ease while engaged in 
conversation with Mr. Cornish did I finally perceive the problem: AIDS exposes 
our timeless human weaknesses to judge, to fear, to shun. 
</P>
<P>
 But should fear justify shunning AIDS and those most in need of a friend? Or 
are we hesitant to talk about AIDS because we're really uncomfortable with 
ourselves and our sexuality? 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever our reasons may be for refusing to talk about AIDS, the persistent 
state of denial needs to stop. Mr. Cornish wanted his health situation revealed 
and discussed openly so that we would heighten our understanding of AIDS and 
realize how close it touches us. Whether or not we are ready to accept it, AIDS 
has come to San Gabriel High School. Since Mr. Cornish has graciously shared 
that he has AIDS -- at the expense of his privacy -- we should at least honor 
his wish. 
</P>
<P>
 If the purpose of a secondary education is to prepare students for the real 
world, why haven't we mobilized yet to educate about AIDS? Isn't the teen-age 
population one of the fastest-growing groups at risk of becoming HIV infected? 
It's obvious that we can no longer hide behind a wall of inhibitions in 
discussing sexual practices and other risk factors associated with HIV/AIDS if 
we are to battle the epidemic. Our own discomfort needs to dissolve. As AIDS 
continues to affect us in its own determined way, we need to band together to 
shape a more sensitive society. 
</P>
<P>
 For the old belief that society shapes us is actually a myth: We are 
responsible for shaping society.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SECOND OPINION / 
OTHER MEDIA; LA PRENSA SAN DIEGO; IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO SPEAK ENGLISH TO PAY 
INCOME TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a commentary by Raoul Lowery Contreras in La Prensa San Diego, a weekly 
published Fridays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Internal Revenue Service is experimenting with Spanish-language income tax 
forms in heavily Mexican American San Diego and Cuban American Miami in an 
effort to make it easier for people to pay their income taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 There is resistance to the program, however.Some complain around these lines: 
"We shouldn't do anything to encourage people not to learn English"; "We 
shouldn't spend $100,000 on Spanish-language materials"; "English should be the 
only language of America." These positions are uninformed.  
</P>
<P>
 First, studies by the Census Bureau, prove that "Hispanics" of all kinds are 
learning English much faster than any other non-English speaking group that has 
ever come to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, studies conclude that each individual learns enough English to 
function and that the more English one learns, the better one's place is on the 
economic ladder.  
</P>
<P>
 Third, the very people who object to this pilot program of the IRS are the 
same people who complain that immigrants aren't paying their fair share of 
taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 As it is not necessary to speak English to work in the United States, nor to 
be in the United States, it is not necessary to speak English to pay taxes.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TESTIMONY; ONE 
PERSON'S STORY ABOUT THE PLIGHT OF HAITIANS; 'WE MUST NEVER SUBSTITUTE CHARITY 
FOR JUSTICE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By As Told to ROBERT SCHEER ; The Rev. Louis Chase of Lynwood United Methodist 
Church was born in Barbados and recently visited Haiti. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Immigration to the United States is a consequence of the economic policies 
that are impacting the Third World. It is very easy on the one hand to be 
critical of people who cross the border, but U.S. corporations are fleecing the 
people of these countries of their resources. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was an equitable wage within the region, if infrastructure could be 
developed, there are many people who would not want to leave Mexico and other 
Latin American countries to come here, Haiti included. 
</P>
<P>
 I just returned from Haiti where hunger and starvation are common. There are 
people who simply drink sugar water to blunt their hunger. There is very little 
currency moving within poor communities, and the people are hungry. Torture is 
still taking place, there are systematic shootings in populated neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 What I observed on my visit to Haiti were things that were taking place before 
the embargo. For example, at one hospital in the countryside, the reason most 
people are admitted is because of malnutrition.  
</P>
<P>
 Haiti, and Port au Prince in particular, has become like a dung heap. You have 
these heaps of garbage, anywhere from three to seven feet high, with a 
putrefying odor. And there are kids and old people and pigs and goats that all 
are rummaging through the same garbage for food. It is the most awful situation 
I have seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Being in Haiti and coming back, I've noticed a xenophobia in the United States 
toward people of color, especially people from Haiti. I think there is no doubt 
that there is an issue of racism in the U.S. immigration position that is also 
coupled with an antiquated political position in the region regarding 
communism. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, when there was a boat that arrived on one occasion with some 
Haitians and some Cubans, the Cubans were granted political asylum and the 
Haitians were sent back to Haiti. Now to me, this is a matter of racism. 
Because anyone who is familiar with what is taking place in Haiti has to 
understand the political crisis there and the misery and desperation of the 
people under the military regime. And if you are in any way a supporter of 
(ousted President Jean-Bertrand) Aristide in Haiti you can be killed, you can 
be raped, you can be tortured. Even children have been beaten by members of the 
army simply for having a picture of Aristide. For the 10 days that I was there 
I probably had the luxury of a maximum of four hours of electricity. There was 
no tap water in Port au Prince when I was there.  
</P>
<P>
 When I went to the market, I saw some of the people arriving in 
Mercedes-Benzes, but the rest had burros. You had something like 50 burros 
parked in the stalls, because that is the way they travel. 
</P>
<P>
 The wealthy do not want to share in any way with the poor of that country. 
There are two worlds: the world of the the elite and their children and all the 
other Haitians. Those who are (dark-skinned) are considered subhuman, almost 
like the days of slavery; they are there to work and enhance the financial 
status of the (generally lighter-skinned) oligarchy.  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government has abandoned Haiti because it is not seen as an area of 
any political or strategic interest, although it is very clear that Haiti is a 
source of cheap labor for the United States, just like Mexico. A number of 
American corporations are benefiting enormously from Haitians who are working 
for $1.11 per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Any discussion of working conditions and wages or benefits is enough to get 
people fired, and the U.S. companies that have returned to Haiti fired all the 
union members at their plants. U.S. companies don't pay any taxes, nor are 
there any health or pension benefits, or any environmental inspections, or 
health and safety inspections. Between 1983 and 1991, real wages in Haiti fell 
by 56%, and this coincided with Haitian apparel exports to the United States 
more than the doubling. 
</P>
<P>
 I am for the embargo. What we are finding is that the embargo is impacting a 
number of the elite. I gather that by the end of this month several 
corporations will have to close shop because of the embargo.  
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration needs to put Haiti high on the agenda, and also to 
take Aristide very seriously. I don't think Aristide is being taken very 
seriously.  
</P>
<P>
 Haiti is beautiful, a country of mountains and beautiful seaside. It has a 
tremendous amount of potential for development. But what is lacking is the sort 
of leadership with integrity that people find in Aristide, because what he has 
claimed for the people is something that the oligarchy does not provide -- 
honor and respect, so that they can be seen as human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 The generosity of the American people is outstanding. Wherever you go in Haiti 
you will find Americans who are trying to help. But we must never substitute 
charity for justice. What the Haitian people really need is justice.

 Transportation construction like the $163-billion MetroRail project can 
disrupt nearby communities for years. As a way to give something back to the 
communities affected by their projects, in 1985 the Los Angeles County 
Metropolitan Transit Authority created an intensive training and jobs program. 
The Transportation Occupations Program (TOP) offers technical study, summer 
employment and academic scholarships to steer high school students into 
transportation-related careers. The program partners the MTA and the unified 
school districts of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Compton; school districts are 
added as the Metro Rail system expands. More than 90% of the students who 
successfully complete the classroom component of the program go on to college. 
COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM 
</P>
<P>
 INSTRUCTION 
</P>
<P>
 Students receive 12 hours of after school and weekend instruction each week 
during the school year. They earn high school credit by taking classes in a 
state-approved curriculum that includes drafting, architectural model building, 
engineering math, graphic design and technical illustration. Teachers are 
recruited from school districts and engineering and transportation companies. 
At least two field trips each semester supplement classwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Four hundred students from 20 high schools have participated in TOP classes 
since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 SUMMER JOBS 
</P>
<P>
 TOP finds engineering-related summer jobs for students who miss no more than 
10% of the program's classes and maintain a C-average in their regular school 
work. Students earn more than minimum wage working 30-hour a week jobs with 
local engineering and construction companies. Jobs include blueprint 
production, surveying, computer drafting and document control and design. The 
students who go on to college can return to the jobs during summer breaks.  
</P>
<P>
 Fifty companies have provided employment for TOP students since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 SCHOLARSHIPS 
</P>
<P>
 Students who pass all TOP classes, attend at least 90% of the classes each 
semester and have a minimum 2.5 cumulative high school grade point average are 
eligible to apply for college scholarships ranging from $300 to $1,500 each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 103 scholarships worth $108,000 have been awarded since 1986. AN EMPLOYER'S

<P>
 Companies benefit by bringing in these young kids. These kids are fresh; they 
haven't even begun to approach the envelope of their creativity so they are 
like dry sponges, absorbing whatever knowledge a company desires to give them. 
They're being disciplined at a very early age about what the work environment 
is -- the importance of time and delivery of product, budget constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 When they go to school and get an academic base they know how it's going to be 
applied in the world of work. They can extrapolate from academia and understand 
how it fits into the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 The students have jobs of significant responsibility. None of them are making 
photocopies, making coffee, filing. They work on computers with (software) 
packages that some say are the most complicated programs to learn in the 
industry. The responsibilities are indicative of the quality instruction the 
students receive in the classes TOP offers. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm an import to Los Angeles along with many of my colleagues that have been 
on around this rail project for 10 years or so. There was not a labor resource 
pool here that the project could draw upon. We're aware that we're helping to 
train a new diverse generation of workers. And as an African American man I 
know that I play a vital role exposing this profession and industry to the 
community which I'm a part of. A STUDENT'S PERSPECTIVE

</P>
<P>
 Graduated from Washington High School in Los Angeles and TOP in 1990, 
currently a civil engineering major at Cal State Long Beach and part-time 
employee at Daniel, Mann, Johnson & Mendenhall. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking all of these computer drafting and design classes I worked on the 
CAD (computer aided design) network here one summer. Then I was hired permanent 
part time and that's when I got into production and even assisting in the 
training process (with other TOP students) to help people who weren't as 
computer literate. We were helping out these older engineers. And it helped us 
because we learned how to negotiate with people, how to act maturely, how to 
apply our knowledge for the benefit of the project; it gave us confidence and 
we earned some respect for our knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 I had an idea about what I wanted to do when I was in high school, but I saw 
no path to follow. The TOP program gave me a visible path, a practical solution 
for exactly what I could do after I get my degree and experience -- even before 
I get my degree -- that's going to help me later on. Hopefully I'll graduate in 
1995 and I plan to stay in the L.A. area working with the rail project if I 
can. TO GET INVOLVED

 Aftershocks are keeping anxiety levels high as Southern Californians begin to 
put their lives back together after the Northridge quake. People who have 
always depended on our freeways are reluctantly turning to public 
transportation and discovering its many benefits. Others from areas not 
affected by the temblor are learning valuable lessons about being prepared. And 
who can leave out the many volunteers who have shown us that in order to cope 
we have to work together. A look at how people are doing. PAT ASKREN 
</P>
<P>
 Chief, Fillmore Volunteer Fire Department, Ventura County 
</P>
<P>
 Our volunteers answer rescue calls, put out fires and respond to any disaster. 
To join the department you have to pass a physical, you must have a valid 
California driver's license and you must live within the city limits of 
Fillmore. Most important, our volunteers must be able to leave what they are 
doing, at any given moment, to respond to an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 There is only one difference in the way we respond to an earthquake and the 
way we respond to a fire. With an earthquake, we tell our volunteers: "Before 
you respond, make absolutely sure your family is safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Within the first two minutes after the quake, we had our first units 
mobilized. Our first stop was the Fillmore Hotel, which had 80 residents and is 
about a half-block from the fire station. We rescued two children and performed 
first aid on some of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 The other volunteers began trickling in and, within 15 minutes, we were 90% 
mobilized. All our volunteers were affected by the quake; one will have to have 
his house torn down. But we are in charge of the lives and safety of 13,000 
people. In the first 24 hours after the quake, no one had any sleep and we 
responded to 75 calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of our volunteers are business people. If they work a week straight, 
they've lost a week's wages. And they gladly do it. PAT CANE 
</P>
<P>
 Scientist, chairman of Olive View Neighborhood Watch, Sylmar 
</P>
<P>
 We were concerned about looters the first couple of nights. I was here in 
1971. We didn't have any looting then, but things have changed. Most of the 
homes were not able to be closed up. They had broken windows and doors could 
not be shut. 
</P>
<P>
 On one street of about 50 homes, almost everyone was sleeping in a tent or 
vehicle. We set up barricades there with a group on guard at each end. We told 
people they could come in if they had identification or if we knew them. If 
they were coming in to visit someone, we told them we would escort them. We 
only had barricades at night. During the day, there were people driving by to 
look. I wanted to grab them and say, "Quit looking at what problems I have. Get 
some gloves and help." TOM WEISSBARTH

 I knew the neighborhoods that had been hit hard. A lot of walls were down, but 
people had better things to do than pick up their bricks. We had the manpower 
to go in. We'd make two piles -- one of neatly stacked bricks that could be 
reused and one of rubble in the street -- to be picked up by the city. Some of 
those bricks are $1 apiece, so if you save 100, it's worth something for the 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody expected us, and a lot were very leery because they thought I was 
another contractor. Some of these people have been hit nonstop by contractors. 
They'd say, "Are you going to bill me?" And I'd say, "No, we want to help." 
</P>
<P>
 The crews did very well. We had 10 to 20 people each day, ranging from age 12 
into the 40s. The kids got a lot out of it. One house we went to was the home 
of a paraplegic. We cleared his whole side yard. They knew they were doing 
something useful and that this man was going to remember them for a long, long 
time. They felt valuable. PATTI NAGY

<P>
 Once our homes were secure, the people in my area got out with our gear -- 
each of us has a bag we make up ourselves that includes a hard hat, 
flashlights, medical items, radios and other things. We were on the street 
between 5 a.m. and 5:15 a.m. My son and I went door-to-door on our block. We 
checked to make sure that each resident was OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the people we talked to had their shoes on, which was great because 
cut feet are the most common injury in an earthquake. Most of the people had 
flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
 We checked particularly on elderly or special-needs people. We also found on 
many streets that neighbors were already checking on neighbors even though they 
weren't part of the ERT. There was a lot of community outpouring.

 Aftershocks are keeping anxiety levels high as Southern Californians begin to 
put their lives back together after the Northridge quake. People who have 
always depended on our freeways are reluctantly turning to public 
transportation and discovering its many benefits. Others from areas not 
affected by the temblor are learning valuable lessons about being prepared. And 
who can leave out the many volunteers who have shown us that in order to cope 
we have to work together. A look at how people are doing. SGT. BEN BOSWELL 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Office of Public Safety, San Bernardino 
</P>
<P>
 People would be better off if they had a plan and are prepared, particularly 
small business. Insurance. Retrofitting so products don't fall off shelves and 
break. Inventorying materials. Backing up records, particularly invoices. We 
know that following a major disaster approximately 28% of small businesses will 
never open again because they were ill-prepared, and half of the remaining 70% 
will be severely impacted over the next three years. CARMEN NIEVES 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency services coordinator, Riverside 
</P>
<P>
 I think I'd like to comment on the older lessons that have been reinforced -- 
the importance of people being prepared for such a catastrophe. After the 
Landers quake, I got a call from a person who wanted to know what the city was 
going to do for the citizens. "Where are you keeping the food and the water? 
Where is it stored for all of the citizens?" 
</P>
<P>
 With a population of 250,000, we have neither the space nor the money for 
that. Our response has to be to save lives and get the city back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 I really feel the general public thinks the government is going to be there 
the minute the ground stops shaking. And that's not true. It does take time for 
us to get our resources and find out what's going on and how we're going to 
distribute those resources. People must understand that they need to be 
prepared, to have their neighborhoods prepared, to talk about what's going to 
happen and where they're going to go. GLENNA KIPP 
</P>
<P>
 Owner, Glenna's Balloon Designs, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think you could ever be prepared enough. There are a lot of simple 
things that can be done at the office as far as keeping books from sliding off 
shelves and bolting things to the floor. Compared with replacing equipment 
after an event has happened, the preventive measures are pretty cost-effective. 
PAT PLEW 
</P>
<P>
 Owner, Kwik Kopy, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Kwik Kopy's a franchise out of Houston and we have what we call an "angel 
squad." We absolutely help each other. As soon as my phone started working, I 
called to let them know that we were OK. They were already trying to call all 
the Southern California centers to see what we needed and how they could help. 
Like anything else, it's simply a matter of being a good neighbor. SHERRI 
MUNSEY 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate secretary, Highland 
</P>
<P>
 Small businesses should be equipped with a generator to keep computers on line 
so they don't dump their information. They need to stockpile supplies to take 
care of employees. Price gougers? I have no sympathy for those folks. I know 
things are in short supply, but gouging the public when they're down is 
uncalled for. They should be run out of town on a rail. JEFF BOWMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Chief, Anaheim Fire Department 
</P>
<P>
 One of the key lessons for Anaheim and Orange County is to recognize it isn't 
just policemen and firemen involved in managing a crisis. It's a huge pool of 
city, county, state and federal employees. And the key to managing people is 
having systems in place. You have to have a backup system in case things don't 
go the way you expect. What happens if the Anaheim emergency operations center, 
for example, becomes rubble? Then what?

 I was going to take a vacation this summer; it's been a long time since I've 
had some time off. But this earthquake set me back. I've lost a lot of stuff in 
my home. But right now, the most important thing is getting my business back 
together. The pool has some cracks and there was some equipment damaged. The 
big problem is getting the kids back into the water. Most of them seem a little 
nervous. Hopefully, time will heal that. But since I'm one of the only swim 
schools in the Valley, I have to get things going. Still, I can't complain. 
Looking at some of the problems that some people have, I consider myself 
fortunate. PHILIP ELWELL 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 My plans won't change. It's been a bit inconvenient. I've lost some things. 
All my glasses were broken, so I have touse plastic cups and stuff. But we'll 
get over it. I know some of the locals who come in here have some problems. 
Some have been hit hard. Things like this are expected to happen. We do live in 
earthquake country. I'm just glad I had the place earthquake-proofed two years 
ago. At the time, I was a bit upset about the price. But looking at what could 
have happened, it could have been a lot worse. WALTER DUDOR 
</P>
<P>
 Lives within two miles of epicenter in Northridge 
</P>
<P>
 This quake will not change any of my family's immediate or long-term plans. 
I've lived here all my life. And earthquakes are part of the territory. So 
we're picking up and getting things back together. And since my business is 
here, we're not just going to pack up and leave. My only problem is this quake 
hitting Northridge. I always thought disasters like this were only supposed to 
happen to Malibu, not Northridge. HENNIE GORELICK 
</P>
<P>
 Rental property owner; resident of Woodland Hills 
</P>
<P>
 My husband and the kids were planning a trip to Holland this summer, but I 
don't know now. We own other property that was near the quake and it was 
damaged. I spend more time with the tenants than with my own home, which also 
suffered damage. Things are just up in the air now. It's going to cost a lot of 
money to fix these things. We have been putting money aside, but now something 
like this happens and it's difficult. My husband, who always used to say that 
earthquakes were no big deal and that nobody gets hurt, has changed. He's 
different now. There's a lot of stress. This is one more reason to leave 
California.

UCLA LEARNS NOBODY'S PERFECT, AND CAL'S KIDD GIVES THE LESSON; COLLEGE 
BASKETBALL: BRUINS BECOME THE LATEST NO. 1 TEAM TO LOSE, 85-70. POINT GUARD 
GIVES BEARS A SPARK WITH HIS TRIPLE-DOUBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Life at the top suddenly became uncomfortable for UCLA, a team that sadly 
discovered there was only one way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 In a somber locker room Sunday, there was no levity because of the gravity of 
the situation. You know, what goes up, must come down. 
</P>
<P>
 And losing, even for the first time in 15 games, didn't feel that great, said 
Ed O'Bannon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to swallow," he said. "We're used to winning -- it's as simple as 
that. When you lose your first and it's one of your biggest games, it's hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's No. 1 team lost to California, 85-70, before 15,039 at the 
Oakland Coliseum Arena, where the No. 1 reason why appeared to be Jason Kidd. 
</P>
<P>
 Out on the floor for all but three minutes, Kidd produced his fourth 
triple-double of the season with 18 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the Bruins become a statistic -- the fifth No. 1-ranked team this 
season to be beaten. The others are North Carolina, Kansas, Arkansas and 
Kentucky, so at least UCLA (14-1, 7-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference) is in good 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd said it is time to move over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was talking about UCLA being No. 1, but I think we showed we can 
play with the best teams in the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Jim Harrick took the loss in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest thing in sports is to go undefeated in your conference," Harrick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday for UCLA, the hardest thing in sports was stopping Kidd. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore guard was responsible for building Cal's 15-point lead in the 
second half and then protecting it when O'Bannon and the Bruins came close. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kidd stuff was pretty inspirational for Cal. After Charles O'Bannon's 
three-pointer pulled the Bruins to within 36-33, Kidd rebounded one of the rare 
misfires by Lamond Murray and gave the ball back to Murray for a resounding 
dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 After Murray stole the ball from Charles O'Bannon, Kidd fed Randy Duck on a 
breakaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Monty Buckley's second three-pointer of the half gave Cal a 43-33 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 At the midway point, UCLA trailed, 45-35, its anti-Buckley strategy in 
tatters. A 17.6% three-point shooter this season going in (three for 17), 
Buckley was two for four in the half and finished three for seven on his way to 
23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 It got worse, then better, then worse again for UCLA in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kidd stole the ball from Shon Tarver, who might have had his poorest game 
of the season, Cal was off and running again. Kidd found Buckley open on a 
breakaway, and Buckley's layup put Cal in a 58-43 driver's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the signal for the Bruins to come back and pull ahead. They did it on 
the road against Washington State, and they did it on the road against 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 But they couldn't do it against Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's failing certainly had nothing to do with Ed O'Bannon. He finished with 
24 points in 39 minutes and pulled down a career-high 19 rebounds.  
</P>
<P>
 "He personally brought us back," Harrick said. "He willed us not to lose, and 
we just didn't get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bannon guided UCLA on a 19-5 run over the next seven minutes with an 
eight-point burst, and the Bruins nearly caught up, trailing only 63-62 with 
7:54 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a rally notable for an omission. For most of that Bruin surge, Harrick 
benched Tarver for freshman Cameron Dollar, and it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins were down only 70-68 with 4:41 to go when Cal took off for good. 
Two free throws by Duck, a layup by Ryan Jamison after a pass from Kidd, a 
missed three-pointer by Charles O'Bannon leading to a Cal fast break concluded 
by a Kidd layup and the Bears were quickly ahead by eight, 76-68. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tarver's jump shot with 6:18 to go, the Bruins scored only one more 
field goal the rest of the game, on a drive by Charles O'Bannon with 27 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins produced a couple of season lows -- their 37.8% from the field (28 
of 74) and 5.3% from the three-point line (one for 19). Also, Cal's 85 points 
were the most the Bruins have given up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just another win on the long road in the Pac-10," said Murray, who 
played all 40 minutes and scored 21 points with nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney, who had nine points, seven assists, five turnovers and no steals, said 
the Bruins will come back. After all, he said, it's a long season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just one game," he said. "They ran their stuff. They just outplayed us. 
Teams are still going to come after us, no matter if we're No. 1 or No. 5." 
</P>
<P>
 And as far as saying goodby to No. 1, well, it isn't as if it's the first time 
anyone has had to do that this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty big deal, I guess," Edney said. "We were proud of our ranking, 
but we also understood all the things that came along with it. We knew it was 
going to be that much more difficult winning games." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Cal is feeling pretty good about itself, even though starters 
Alfred Grigsby and K.J. Roberts are injured. If those two were around, Murray 
knows where Cal would be ranked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd be No. 1 right now, no doubt about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And they might have had their week at the top, too. The Bruins would tell 
them.

FLOYD HAS PRODUCTIVE BACK NINE; SENIOR SKINS: HE WINS $240,000, INCLUDING 
$70,000 IN SUDDEN-DEATH PLAYOFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Raymond Floyd, who didn't earn a cent the first day of the Senior Skins, made 
up for it Sunday, winning $240,000 and the tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-time defending champion Arnold Palmer finished second with $115,000 in 
earnings, including $70,000 on the final day. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Trevino, the first-day leader with $80,000, failed to win a hole on the 
second. Jack Nicklaus, after winning $15,000 on the first hole of the 
tournament, was shut out the rest of the way in the match of golf Hall of 
Famers. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd, at 51 the youngest of the foursome, earned the final $70,000 when he 
birdied the fourth sudden-death hole after the 17th and 18th holes of 
regulation were tied. Only he and Nicklaus remained in the competition at the 
fourth extra hole, and Nicklaus barely missed a long birdie try, leaving Floyd 
a tap-in to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were an awful lot of birdies out there," said Floyd, who birdied each 
of the four playoff holes. "I think this was probably one of the best Skins 
Games ever, by anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really exciting for me to be shut out yesterday then come back and 
play the quality of golf I played today. I shot a 31 on the front nine 
(Saturday), birdied four in a row in regulation today, then birdied all the 
extra holes." 
</P>
<P>
 The longest hitter in the foursome and putting extremely well, Floyd won 
$100,000 on the third hole Sunday, No. 12, then added $70,000 with his fourth 
birdie in a row, on No. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer saw his chance to win the Senior Skins for a third consecutive year end 
when his second shot on the first playoff hole, the par-five 10th, rolled over 
a cart path and nestled against lava rock. After a favorable drop, a poor chip 
took him out of the hole. Each of the other three players birdied the hole and 
continued to play. Trevino then dropped out with a par on the third extra hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I played a little better than I had been, but it certainly was 
disappointing not to be out there going for the title again," Palmer said. "If 
you didn't make a birdie out there, you just weren't in the game; that was the 
atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Trevino: "The way Raymond was making birdies, it was pretty tough to top 
that."

MORNING BRIEFING: SCHOENFELD GETS LAST LAUGH WITH JOB COACHING CAPITALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hiring of Jim Schoenfeld as coach of the Washington Capitals last week 
brings to mind his first brush with national fame. 
</P>
<P>
 It was May 8, 1988, and Schoenfeld was coaching the New Jersey Devils in a 
playoff game against the Boston Bruins. The Bruins won, 6-1, and Schoenfeld 
believed that the officiating had something to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 He confronted referee Don Koharski in the hallway and yelled, "Have another 
doughnut, you fat pig." Koharski responded by saying, "You won't work in this 
league again." 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL responded by suspending Schoenfeld. He responded by getting an 
injunction that would allow him behind the bench. The referees responded by 
boycotting the next game. Amateur officials were used. 
</P>
<P>
 Team player: Kevin McHale's No. 32 was retired at Boston Garden on Sunday at 
halftime of the game between the Celtics and the Phoenix Suns. McHale's style 
of play seemed out of place in the era of unselfish players such as Larry Bird 
and Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrote Michael Arace of the Hartford Courant: "In this setting, Kevin McHale 
played out his career. Kevin McHale, who never met a pass he didn't like -- as 
long as he was on the receiving end. Kevin McHale, who never met a shot he 
didn't like -- as long as he was on the shooting end." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: How many times has Jack Nicklaus won the Vardon Trophy, given to 
the PGA Tour player with the lowest scoring average? 
</P>
<P>
 More McHale: The retirement of McHale's jersey brings to mind that he was 
indirectly involved in one of the biggest swindles ever perpetrated by Red 
Auerbach. In 1980, Boston sent its top draft choice to Golden State for Robert 
Parish and the No. 3 pick. Golden State used that pick to take Joe Barry 
Carroll, whose career was unmemorable. The Celtics used the No. 3 pick to take 
McHale. 
</P>
<P>
 Religiously correct: The Catholic aura of Notre Dame is apparent from the 
grotto to Touchdown Jesus overlooking the football field. But Irish football is 
nondenominational. Last week, Gus Ornstein from Tenafly, N.J., said he would 
attend Notre Dame, where he would be its first Jewish quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Religion didn't play a part in my decision," Ornstein told Taylor Bell of the 
Chicago Sun-Times. "I'm a reform Jew. I observe Jewish holidays. They said 
there would be no problem with a Jewish kid on campus. They made me feel very 
welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Bad feeling: So what does it feel like to lose to the Clippers? Shaun Powell 
of Newsday described the Seattle locker room after the SuperSonics lost to the 
Clippers last week: "Inside the team's Coliseum locker room, things were about 
as lively as a mausoleum. The boom box sitting catty-corner to Shawn Kemp's 
cubicle, starved for a cassette tape. Michael Cage shuffled by and 
uncharacteristically said nothing. Other players whispered their responses to 
the mini-cams and note pads. Only the canary-yellow blazer hanging in Gary 
Payton's locker spoke loudly." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Clippers: In that game, Clipper Ron Harper made 15 of 21 shots and 
Seattle's Nate McMillan had this to say: "Michael Jordan is gone. He's the only 
guy who should be capable of doing that to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Stranger than fiction: Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Sun, predicting the CBS 
promotions of its coverage of the Winter Olympics: ". . . look to CBS to go to 
commercial for nine days with the tease. . . . 'And coming up after this break 
will be the Nancy Kerrigan story.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: None. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: New Fox football commentator John Madden, on all the hype 
surrounding his leaving CBS: "If I got caught up in that stuff about myself, I 
wouldn't like myself." MARYANN HUDSON

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a sweet and sour Sunday for UCLA. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Former Bruin teammates James Washington, Troy Aikman and Ken Norton Jr. 
contributed mightily to the Dallas Cowboys' second annual Super Bowl victory 
over the Buffalo Bills. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours earlier, ABC didn't show the first eight minutes of the 
UCLA-California basketball game because it was busy with the Senior Skins 
playoff. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Better yet for Bruin fans if the last eight minutes also had been blacked out. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 After rallying and nearly catching up -- they were trailing 21-14 when ABC 
finally left the golf, station breaks, commercials and promos -- the Bruins 
faltered down the stretch. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Blame much of it on Jason Kidd, who won the point-guard showdown with Tyus 
Edney and took control at crunch time. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Cal exposed the Bruin weakness -- their half-court offense, particularly 
against a zone defense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The end of UCLA's 14-game win streak meant that members of the last major 
college team to complete a season unbeaten -- the 32-0, 1976 Indiana Hoosiers 
-- could begin their annual ritual of calling Coach Bob Knight. . . . Now I 
know why Emmitt Smith held out for more money than Thurman Thomas is making. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills weren't half bad this time, but it turned out to be still another 
Super Bowl lacking in drama. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I mean, did you give the disheartened Bills any chance after the aroused 
Cowboys took the lead in the third quarter? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Only two of the last dozen Super Bowls have been decided by fewer than 10 
points. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Another former Bruin, linebacker Marvcus Patton, made one of Buffalo's best 
defensive plays when he threw Emmitt Smith for a yard loss on second and four 
from the Bills' nine in the first quarter. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It was interesting to see Michael Jordan watching the game from the stands in 
Atlanta, no doubt preparing to make his NFL playing debut next season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I felt old when Dick Enberg gave coin-tosser Joe Namath's age as 50. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' signing of Bo Jackson will bring them publicity, home runs and 
RBI, not necessarily in that order of importance. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Remember, Bo's 448-foot, leadoff home run over the center-field fence in the 
1989 All-Star game at Anaheim Stadium? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Just when Julio Cesar Chavez's skills are diminishing, he is starting to speak 
more English. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He shouted, " . . . . you, King!" at promoter Don King after Frankie Randall 
was awarded a 12-round decision Saturday in Las Vegas. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If Chavez was blaming King for his first loss, he should have thanked the 
promoter after the gift draw with Pernell Whitaker. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Funny, too, that Chavez complained about referee Richard Steele deducting two 
points from his total Saturday because of low blows.It was Steele who stopped 
the Chavez-Meldrick Taylor fight with only seconds remaining in the 12th round. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 The odds favoring Chavez over Randall had been as high as 18-1 and two future 
Chavez dates at the MGM Grand were announced by Jimmy Lennon Jr. in the ring 
earlier in the evening. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The main event didn't begin until 9:50 p.m., meaning 12:50 a.m. in the East 
for pay-per-view TV customers. The live card started at 3:30. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Tell Don King to get me a fight," KMPC's Big Joe McDonnell said at ringside 
after watching 290-pound Anthony Wade wade into the ring for his bout against 
Razor Ruddock. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It is time for Hector (Macho) Camacho to hang up the gloves, but he probably 
won't because of financial reasons. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Before the severe damage to the Coliseum was revealed, Bob Arum had planned to 
promote a tripleheader title show there two days before the World Cup soccer 
final in July. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Among the highlights of NBC's long sports day was Kevin McHale's humorous and 
poignant speech during the Boston Garden ceremony retiring No. 32. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Fenway Park won't be quite the same without the voice of Sherm Feller, who 
died Friday at 75. The public address announcer was to Boston Red Sox fans what 
Bob Sheppard is to New York Yankee fans. . . . Look-alikes: Tonya Harding and 
Dana Carvey's Garth. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That Dallas win Saturday night surprised me more than the one Sunday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Clones: The Kings and Mighty Ducks each have 44 points in the NHL standings. 
The Clippers are 15-25 overall, 9-11 at home, and 6-14 on the road. The Lakers 
are 14-26 overall, 8-11 at home, and 6-15 on the road. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks, Howie Long, for all those seasons when you made my job easier by being 
such a willing, candid and articulate person to interview. I look forward to 
hearing your acceptance speech one day at Canton, Ohio.

GLASSON'S FINISHING TOUCH PRESERVES PHOENIX VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Glasson knows this much about himself: When there's a tournament to be 
won, he'll be there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pride myself in my ability to take it home," he said after shooting a 
seven-under-par 64 Sunday to win the Phoenix Open by three strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, to not fold my tent coming down the stretch. Obviously, what I need 
to do is get there more often. That's one of the things I hope to accomplish 
this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasson finished with a total of 16-under 268 in gaining the sixth title of 
his 11 years on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasson has won six of the seven tournaments he has led in the final round. He 
won $216,000 with his first 1994 finish in the money. He missed the cut at the 
Hawaiian Open, then skipped last week's Northern Telecom Open. His winnings for 
the event exceeded his season earnings for all but four of his 10 years on the 
PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been forced to adjust his swing since curing a back problem that 
stemmed from multiple operations on both knees from the 1970s until 1984. An 
inflamed back muscle nearly ended his career in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Hawaiian Open, Glasson went to work on his swing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd played Tucson last week, I would have shot a million," Glasson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Estes, a non-winner in six years, kept the pressure on until he bogeyed 
the 15th hole after Glasson birdied it. He got back on track with a birdie on 
the final hole and earned his biggest check -- $129,600 -- by finishing alone 
in second at 271. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Springer, Jeff Maggert and Blaine McAllister tied for third at 272, while 
Rick Fehr, who started the day tied with Andrew Magee and Dan Forsman, shot a 
71 and dropped back to 273 with a bogey on the last hole. Tom Lehman also 
finished at 273.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; BETZOLD'S DOUBLE IN 11TH LIFTS THE TITANS OVER STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Betzsold had a two-out, run-scoring double in the 11th inning to lift Cal 
State Fullerton to an 8-7 victory over Stanford in a nonconference baseball 
game Sunday at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Betzsold's double scored Bret Hemphill, who had doubled with two outs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Silva (1-0), a sophomore right-hander, completed four innings of shutout 
relief for the victory. Cal State Fullerton (2-1) took two of three games in 
the season-opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton, ranked sixth by Baseball America, took a 6-0 lead with 
three runs each in the first and second innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans built their lead because of a sloppy Cardinal defense. Stanford, 
ranked 12th in the same poll, made three errors that led to four unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante Powell had two hits, scored two runs, drove in one and stole four bases. 
Craig Skyberg had a hit and also scored two runs for Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Ricabal, 11-3 last season as a starter for the Titans, failed to hold the 
early 6-0 lead. He allowed four runs in the third to cut the Titan lead to 6-4. 
Cal State Fullerton scored in the fourth to take a 7-4 lead but Ricabal allowed 
three more runs in the fifth. He gave up six earned runs, walked three and 
struck out four. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Wagner replaced Ricabal to start the sixth and had three strikeouts in 
two shutout innings before Silva came in. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Reimers (0-1) allowed seven hits and one run in 7 2/3 innings of relief 
but took the loss as Stanford fell to 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans play UC Riverside at 2:30 p.m. Tuesday in their home opener. Cal 
State Fullerton then plays host to Arizona for a three-game series starting at 
7 p.m. Friday.

USC BLOWS LEAD, RALLIES TO BEAT STANFORD, 81-73; WOMEN'S BASKETBALL: LESLIE 
SCORES 34 POINTS AS TROJANS TAKE TWO-GAME LEAD IN THE PAC-10. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cheryl Miller's USC women's basketball team grabbed the Pacific 10 basketball 
race by the throat Sunday afternoon, beating Stanford, 81-73, to take a 
two-game lead over the rest of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, who won their ninth in a row to go 15-1 overall (8-0 in the 
Pac-10), had a 17-2 lead in the early going before 1,077 at Lyon Center. But 
they had to rally in the second half to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford came back from a 38-36 halftime deficit and had a 57-51 lead with 
11:25 to play before the Trojans, behind Lisa Leslie, caught up, 57-57, and 
outscored Stanford, 24-16, the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time Stanford, winner of the last five conference 
championships, had lost two consecutive games since the 1987-88 season. The 
Cardinal also lost Friday night at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie, the 6-foot-5 senior from Inglewood, had a 34-point, 11-rebound, 
three-block game. Her third field goal, a jump shot from the free-throw line, 
made her the Pac-10's all-time scoring record. She passed Stanford's Val 
Whiting, who had 2,077 points. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Pac-10 women's basketball didn't begin until the 1986-87 season, so 
Leslie is still the No. 5 USC scorer, behind Miller (3,018), Cherie Nelson, Pam 
McGee and Paula McGee. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie made 14 of 20 free throws and was clearly the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the Lisa Leslie everyone's been waiting to see," said Stanford Coach 
Tara VanDerveer. "She had a great touch on her shot today. She rebounded well 
and was very athletic. 
</P>
<P>
 "USC is a totally underrated team (the Trojans were eighth in last week's 
Associated Press poll). They've been in tough situations and won. They could 
have lost their games at Oregon and Oregon State, but they won. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lisa, right now, is the best player in the country, and (Nicky) McCrimmon may 
be the best point guard in the country. The sky's the limit for this team." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who faulted her team only for blowing the early 17-2 lead, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "All things considered, this was our best game," she said. "We see a growing 
level of maturity with these players. . . . They're going up to the next 
level." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford rallied with long-range shooting. Jamila Wideman put the Cardinal 
ahead for the first time, 46-44. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's tightened pressure defense interrupted Stanford's rhythm, creating 
turnovers. The Trojans put together an 8-0 lead to take the lead for good.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; ILLINI DOMINATES BOARDS IN WHIPPING INDIANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Keene, scoreless in his last game, matched a career high with 19 
points and Illinois grabbed 18 offensive rebounds Sunday to beat No. 11 
Indiana, 88-81, in Champaign, Ill., ending a six-game losing streak against the 
Hoosiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana, with its fourth loss in five road games this season, fell to 12-4 and 
5-2 in the Big Ten. Illinois, with a 39-20 overall rebounding edge, improved to 
11-5 and 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Deon Thomas added 18 points for Illinois, which had five players in double 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana's leading scorer Damon Bailey, averaging 22.7, managed only 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Illini expanded a five-point halftime lead to 11 by scoring the first six 
points of the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' hook and then his dunk put Illinois up by 12 with a bit more than six 
minutes to go. A minute later Robert Bennett's three-point play made it a 
13-point game and the Illini held on. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4 North Carolina 85, Wake Forest 61 -- Eric Montross scored 22 points on 
10-for-13 shooting and the Tar Heels (17-3, 5-2) pounded Wake Forest's front 
line in an Atlantic Coast Conference victory in Chapel Hill, N.C. Wake Forest 
is 12-7, 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
 It was textbook Tar Heel basketball. Virtually all of North Carolina's points 
came from within 10 feet of the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 9 Kentucky 91, Auburn 74 -- Tony Delk scored 25 points and Kentucky shot 
76% from the field in the second half in Auburn, Ala., to hand Auburn (5-11, 
0-8) its eighth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky (16-3, 6-2) moved to within half a game of first-place Florida in the 
SEC's Eastern Division. Rodrick Rhodes added 19 points for the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 17 Minnesota 92, St. John's 64 -- Minnesota bounced back from a tough loss 
and a rough trip with an easy victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Gophers (14-6) easily handled St. John's (8-9) in New York, just 24 
hours after losing to No. 7 Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gophers were led by Voshon Lenard with 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 8 Massachusetts 76, Rhode Island 47 -- Marcus Camby scored 15 points and 
Massachusetts (16-3, 8-0) held Rhode Island (6-9, 3-5) scoreless for more than 
seven minutes as the Minutemen beat the Rams in an Atlantic 10 game in Amherst, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 20 Alabama Birmingham 60, Dayton 52 -- Robert Shannon scored 23 points, 
including five straight to thwart a Dayton (4-11, 0-3) comeback and help 
Alabama-Birmingham (16-2, 4-1) hold on in a Great Midwest Conference game in 
Dayton, Ohio.

NHL ROUNDUP; SCHOENFELD HAS BEEN ENERGIZER FOR CAPITALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For now, anyway, the Washington Capitals appear to be revitalized under new 
Coach Jim Schoenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just incredible, the energy we've had these past two days," Washington's 
Alan May said after the Capitals ended Detroit's nine-game road unbeaten streak 
with a 6-3 victory Sunday at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Ridley had a goal and two assists for Washington, 2-1 since Schoenfeld 
replaced the fired Terry Murray on Thursday. The Capitals, who beat 
Philadelphia on Saturday, have a two victories in a row for only the third time 
since Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, it's an excitement thing," defenseman Sylvain Cote said. "Getting a 
new coach is like a writer getting a new pen -- you can't wait to use it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the thrill of a new pen -- or coach -- does eventually wear off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've still got a lot of work to do, but we're headed in the right 
direction," forward Kelly Miller said. "The last two games are an indication of 
how we can play. It's just a matter of doing that on a consistent basis all 
year long." 
</P>
<P>
 The Capitals pulled out of a 1-1 tie with three goals in the second period. 
After Detroit closed to 4-3, Ridley got the clincher, a power-play goal with 
8:05 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked real hard, and the work paid off," Schoenfeld said. "All in all, 
the thing we're looking for is commitment and effort. We got both barrels 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Sheppard had two goals and an assist for the Red Wings. Sheppard has five 
goals in his last two games and his 35 goals are second in the NHL behind 
Toronto's Dave Andreychuk, who has 40. 
</P>
<P>
 But Detroit, which also got a goal from Steve Yzerman, lost for only the 
fourth time in its last 23 games (16-4-3). The Red Wings were 8-0-1 on the road 
since losing at Montreal Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was more us than anything," Sheppard said. "We just broke down. We made 
some mistakes that we're not accustomed to making the last two months, and they 
capitalized on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 5, Philadelphia 4 -- Patrick Roy's career-long winless streak against 
the Flyers ended when Guy Carbonneau scored in overtime at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Keane passed the puck near the side of the net at 2:29 of the extra 
period, and Carbonneau beat Tommy Soderstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy, a three-time Vezina Trophy winner, now has a 1-6-6 career record in the 
regular season against the Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 3, Buffalo 2 -- Jesse Belanger scored two goals, including the 
game-winner, and John Vanbiesbrouck had 37 saves, leading the Panthers at 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory increased the Panthers' unbeaten streak to nine (5-0-4), extending 
its NHL record for a first-year team.  
</P>
<P>
 The victory, combined with Philadelphia's loss, moved the Panthers into third 
place in the Atlantic Division and sixth place in the Eastern Conference. That 
would be good for a playoff spot, an unlikely place for a first-year expansion 
team so late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not thinking about that at all," Florida Coach Roger Neilson said. 
"There's a long way to go in this season."

SANTA ANITA; VICTORY IN PALOS VERDES COMPLETES WEEKEND SWEEP FOR BOYS OF MANILA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manila is in such outstanding company at Will Farish's breeding farm near 
Versailles, Ky., that he needs weekends like the last one to maintain his 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Farish's Lane's End Farm is cluttered with prominent stallions. Besides 
Manila, other Breeders' Cup winners that stand there include A.P. Indy, 
Alysheba, Gulch and Steinlen. A.P. Indy and Alysheba also won horse-of-the-year 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Manila, winner of the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita in 1986 and champion 
grass horse the same year, could wind up the most versatile of them all. On 
Saturday, one of his sons, Bien Bien, won the $132,100 San Marcos Handicap at 1 
1/4 miles on grass; and on Sunday another offspring, Concept Win, won the 
$107,100 Palos Verdes Handicap, which is a six-furlong dirt sprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Bien Bien's owners, Trudy McCaffery and John Toffan, and trainer Paco Gonzalez 
are talking about returning their 5-year-old to dirt, for the $1-million Santa 
Anita Handicap on March 5, and Concept Win's main-track performance in the 
Palos Verdes could be their extra nudge. 
</P>
<P>
 Concept Win might have distance limitations -- none of his five victories has 
been beyond 6 1/2 furlongs -- but his trainer, Willard Proctor, won't hesitate 
to flip-flop him from dirt to grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that if a horse can run, he will run anywhere, dirt or grass," 
Proctor said. "Some people don't agree with me, but that's what I think. This 
horse's future can be either place." 
</P>
<P>
 In Concept Win's first four grass races, the best he could do was two 
second-place finishes, but his last victory before Sunday's was in October at 
Santa Anita, coming down the hill at 6 1/2 furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last race, a half-length loss to Diazo at seven-furlongs in the Malibu 
on dirt on Dec. 26, Concept Win might have done better but for a wide trip from 
jockey Gary Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I cost him that last race," said Stevens, who racked up his 100th 
stakes victory at Santa Anita's winter meets. "My goal today was just not to 
fall off of him. This is as good a sprinter as I've ever been on." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens rode Sunny Blossom to victory in the 1989 Palos Verdes in a 
track-record time of 1:07 1/5, and Concept Win, running over a track that was 
producing good times all day, missed matching that clocking by two-fifths of a 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 Scherando, ridden by David Flores, set fractions of 21 seconds, 43 2/5 and 55 
1/5 and still had something left for the final eighth of a mile, which made 
Concept Win's task even more difficult. Concept Win won by 1 1/4 lengths, with 
J.F. Williams, the 2-1 favorite in a six-horse field, coming from about nine 
lengths back to take second, a neck in front of Scherando. 
</P>
<P>
 Bred by his owner, Leonard Lavin, with a mating of Manila with Conveniently, 
Concept Win paid $8.80 as the third choice. Carrying 115 pounds, four less than 
the high-weighted Wild Harmony, he earned $62,100, sending the total over the 
$200,000 mark for his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got to a half-length of Scherando, my horse started throwing his ears 
up," Stevens said. "He was looking around, kind of waiting, but still he was 
going on with it. The time was not a fluke. Absolutely not. I know the track is 
fast, but he's going to run 1:08 and change on a slow race track." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores has been first, second and third with Scherando the last three times he 
has ridden him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran big," Flores said. "You have to let this horse run out of there. He 
still had something left at the end. I thought he was going to win, but the 
other two horses were just too good." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While some of the early Kentucky Derby favorites were colliding in the 
Hutcheson Stakes at Gulfstream Park, late-developing 3-year-olds ran at Santa 
Anita, with Pollock's Luck, also ridden by Stevens, beating the highly regarded 
Numerous by a nose at 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the first for Pollock's Luck since the Polish Navy-Lucky Us 
colt broke his maiden in his first start at Hollywood Park on Dec. 20. In 
between, he had run third in another sprint at Santa Anita on Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous, a $1.7-million yearling sired by Mr. Prospector, was making his 
first start since a maiden victory at Santa Anita on Nov. 13. His trainer, 
Charlie Whittingham, was not discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had been away from the races for some time," Whittingham said. "He had a 
bruised foot over at Hollywood Park, and that cost us about a month with him. 
Then I had trouble finding a race for him, because when I entered him, the 
races wouldn't fill (draw enough horses). He's still eligible for non- winners 
of two (races), so that's where he'll run next." 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye, replacing the suspended Chris McCarron on Numerous, went 
over the $130-million mark in purses.

HORSE RACING ROUNDUP; HOLY BULL GETS A LESSON IN HUTCHESON VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Holy Bull, a 1-2 favorite, learned something in the education process of a 
3-year-old and remained unbeaten with a three-quarter length victory Sunday 
over Patton in the Grade II Hutcheson Stakes for 3-year-olds at Gulfstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull had never lost a lead until Sunday, but he rallied and drew even at 
the sixteenth pole, pulling away in the last 70 yards to win in 1:21 1/5 for 
the seven-furlong race that was diminished in stature when Dehere was scratched 
Saturday because of colic. 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey Mike Smith said he knew Holy Bull, who carried 122 pounds, nine more 
than Patton, could rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have looked like a fool if it hadn't worked, but when Patton went by 
us, it was just part of my plan," Smith said. "What I didn't want was to have 
to put him to a drive earlier than I did. This colt hadn't run for three 
months." 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull, who has earned $388,760, paid $3, $2.40 and $2.10. Patton paid 
$2.80 and $2.20. You and I paid $2.20 to show in the five-horse field. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Arkansas-bred Ruddy Eagle outran Estrick to win by a neck in the $24,000 
Crimson Saint allowance feature at Oaklawn Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Jon Court, the winner returned $18, $6.40 and $4 after running the 
six furlongs in 1:10 2/5. Estrick paid $9.80 and $4.80, and third-place 
finisher Be Got Begone was worth $2.60.

RUNNING / REDONDO BEACH 10K; DOS SANTOS BREAKS AWAY IN VICTORY SPRINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The three leaders could not have been a more varied assortment of runners, but 
Valdenor Dos Santos, Mark Nenow and Brian Abshire ran tightly together for the 
majority of the 16th annual Redondo Beach Super Bowl 10K race Sunday, before 
Dos Santos pulled away in the final 100 meters to win it in a course-record 28 
minutes 27 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Nenow crossed the finish line three seconds later, and Abshire finished two 
seconds after that to take third. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they matched each other, stride for stride, for much of the race, the 
three runners not only have widely different running backgrounds, but also are 
at much different stages of their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dos Santos, whose time broke John Treacy's 1990 course record by three 
seconds, is a 24-year-old road racer from Brasilia, Brazil. Nenow, 35, of 
Fountain Valley was one of the best 10K runners ever for the United States, but 
is far past his prime. And Abshire, 30, of Chandler, Ariz., has the U.S. indoor 
record in the 3,000 meters, 7:41.57, and is training for the indoor track 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Abshire took the early lead, with Dos Santos and Nenow right on his heels. 
With a little more than three kilometers remaining, they broke away from the 
pack and ran in a group for all but about a half-kilometer. Dos Santos charged 
ahead around a corner and led by a few paces on a downhill slope before Abshire 
and Nenow caught him again. It was apparent that chasing Dos Santos had taken 
its toll on the other two. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last three kilometers, I had to decide to press a little harder because I 
knew they were fast," Dos Santos said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dos Santos made a final surge down the home stretch, leaving Abshire and Nenow 
to race each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I could catch (Nenow) in the last 100 meters, but I kind of 
misjudged the finish," Abshire said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nenow, a former world-record holder for a 10K road race and owner of the 
seven-year-old U.S. record of 27:20.56 in the event on the track, was surprised 
at his finishing speed. He sustained a series of leg injuries in 1988 and 1989 
that ended his career as a world-class runner, and now he works in promotions 
for an athletic shoe company. He was pleased with his time, but said he has no 
intentions of making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Somers, 32, of Danville, Calif., won the women's division with a 
personal-record time of 32:56. Somers was challenged only by herself, along the 
final, gradual incline to the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept telling myself, 'This is the place I can't slow down,' and I think 
that's why I got a P.R.," said Somers, who won the Long Beach Marathon last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Edgar DeOliveira, 26, of Brazil won the men's mile run for the second 
consecutive year. His time of 3:59.24 broke the course record, which he set 
last year, by slightly more than four seconds. Teena Colebrook, 37, of Torrance 
won the women's mile in 4:52.93. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Molinatti, 36, of Huntington Beach won the wheelchair division.

HERNANDEZ DISMISSES DE LA HOYA BEFORE FIGHT AGAINST RAMIREZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It lacks the glamour and money of an Oscar De La Hoya showdown, but Genaro 
Hernandez's defense of his World Boxing Assn. junior-lightweight title against 
Jorge (Cocas) Ramirez tonight at the Forum still has a touch of risk. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for a last-minute snag, Hernandez would have fought De La Hoya early 
this year instead of Ramirez.But for the second time, De La Hoya's camp decided 
to bypass Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 So, with surgery to replace a screw in his sore right hand scheduled for next 
month, Hernandez (29-0-1, 14 knockouts) is fighting Ramirez (64-10-3, 51 KOs), 
a veteran of high-profile junior-lightweight bouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oscar De La Hoya, he can talk at his own press conference," Hernandez said 
recently. "It's kind of tiring to hear (about De La Hoya). Nobody wants to talk 
about Cocas or anyone else I've fought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not afraid of Oscar De La Hoya; he's had, what, 11 fights? If I'm afraid 
of anybody, it should be Cocas, with all the experience he has." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the card: a 10-round middleweight bout between Young Dick Tiger 
(28-10, 18 KOs) and Florencio Ibarra (8-1, 7 KOs). TIM KAWAKAMI

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; DOUBLE DOSE OF HARDSHIP; FRAILTY, FEAR AND 
ISOLATION MAKE QUAKE TRAUMA WORSE FOR ELDERLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HURST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joyce Barry must work up her courage every time she climbs the stairs to her 
tiny third-floor apartment in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared to death to ever come in here," said the small, matchstick-thin 
woman. "I talk to myself before I come up. I say everything is all right, but 
then within 15 or 20 minutes I get scared again." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry shudders with fear and begins to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 At 64, with a weak heart and without anyone to help her, Barry is trying to 
cope with the terrifying memory of the quake that drove her into the street two 
weeks ago, and with the horrifying aftershocks that continually shake and 
rattle the old building in which she lives. 
</P>
<P>
 She is among an estimated 500,000 elderly people -- a quarter of them living 
alone -- who reside within the areas hit most directly by the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster officials are increasingly concerned that relief efforts have 
overlooked many of the elderly who, like Barry, are frail, vulnerable and 
living without basic necessities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The services that are provided through the aging network services, 
particularly nutrition services, have been disrupted," said Merrill Jacobs, 
chief deputy director of the state Department of Aging. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is asking for $6 million in federal disaster funds for the aged, 
and federal officials such as Fernando Torres-Gil, assistant secretary of 
aging, are touring disaster zones. Officials say the amount of assistance 
needed for elderly quake victims is unknown but obviously great. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, city and county officials have been promised only $100,000 in federal 
funds to deal with the problems of elderly quake victims who need food, 
shelter, medical care and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 A toll-free phone number for quake aid to the elderly is to be established by 
county officials this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The frail elderly are particularly vulnerable because they often have 
difficulty performing routine tasks necessary to get help, social workers say. 
Traveling to relief centers and standing in lines are sometimes impossible for 
them. Routine phone conversations with officials can cause anxiety and 
confusion. Relocation can be so disruptive and traumatic that it is 
life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone is frail and disconnected, it is very frightening to make a 
change, because you can lose sight of who you are," said Maria Arechaederra, 
executive director of WISE Senior Services, an agency serving the elderly on 
the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 A frail elderly woman who was transferred from a quake-damaged Santa Monica 
rest home died soon after arriving at another facility, said Barbara Kingston, 
care manager for WISE. "Regardless of the cause of death, she is definitely a 
victim of the earthquake," Kingston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 57 people who were officially listed as killed by the quake, 30 were 60 
years of age or older. Many of those deaths were the result of heart attacks. 
(Overall, heart attacks killed 22 of the 57 victims.) 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of elderly people were displaced when five nursing homes in Santa 
Monica, Sylmar and Simi Valley were damaged by the temblor. In addition, at 
least 30 residential facilities that provide less intensive care for elderly 
clients were severely damaged. Dozens of senior service centers were also 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Bayer, director of the Los Angeles County Area Agency on Aging, said her 
social workers are interviewing elderly quake victims at shelters and are 
answering calls for help, but acknowledges that officials have no idea how many 
older people are in need.  
</P>
<P>
 Bayer recounted the plight of an elderly blind woman who was afraid to leave 
her bed for two days after the quake because she heard glass smashing around 
her and feared injury if she got up. Aid finally came after a neighbor called 
relief workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Private agencies, such as Catholic Charities, are sending teams of volunteers 
-- some of them elderly people themselves -- into affected neighborhoods, 
trying to locate older people who may be injured, terrified or stranded. 
</P>
<P>
 But some social agencies that focus on the elderly have themselves been 
staggered by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 A center operated by WISE in Santa Monica, where about two dozen Alzheimer's 
victims and other elderly people took part in programs such as memory 
enhancement, gardening and dancing, was condemned after the quake. WISE staff 
members are trying to provide day-care services in makeshift offices to those 
clients most in need of aid. 
</P>
<P>
 WISE's Arechaederra recalls a frantic plea from the daughter of an Alzheimer's 
victim, who she said told her: "If you don't take that man off my hands, I'm 
going to kill him." 
</P>
<P>
 The WISE agency is providing counseling to help clients deal with the fear 
left by the quake, but that fear is deep-seated. 
</P>
<P>
 One of WISE's clients, 73-year-old Gwen Warren, is convinced that she and her 
79-year-old husband, Gene, should flee California, even though they have no 
funds for travel. Gene, a former disc jockey, is bedridden, unable to move and 
barely able to speak as a result of a stroke two years ago. He stays in a 
hospital bed in one room of the two-room apartment and Gwen sleeps in the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 When the quake struck, Gwen tried to rush to her husband's aid, but a falling 
bookcase pinned her to the floor. Before she was able to extricate herself, 
Gwen lay under the solid oak case screaming in fear and anguish as she pictured 
Gene in the other room, alone, unable to rise or speak. 
</P>
<P>
 A retired nurse, Gwen spends all but about three hours a week in the two-room 
apartment caring for Gene. Their apartment has become a place of terror as well 
as confinement for them both. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just feel your bed is a place of security," she said. "And now I feel 
like I have no security." 
</P>
<P>
 Several blocks away, another client of the WISE agency sits alone in her 
third-floor apartment and prays for safety during aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Molly DeGoes, who said she is "way over 75," is so crippled by arthritis that 
she cannot climb stairs. The elevator has been out of service since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 DeGoes said she pays a man $3 to go to the store for groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been out of the house for a week," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Chinese figurines still stand on a knickknack shelf on a wall of the 
apartment, but the ceiling above them is marred by holes and cracks left by the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 DeGoes could not clean up the fallen plaster because of her arthritis, so she 
took $20 that her brother had sent her to buy a bathrobe and used it to hire a 
cleaning woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleaning woman normally charges $50 for her work, but she accepted $20 and 
a present. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a pocketbook for Christmas," DeGoes said, "and I never go anywhere so I 
gave it to her. And she was satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
 On the staircase outside DeGoes' apartment, Irene Gordon, who is in her 70s, 
struggles up to her fourth-floor rooms. She has been to the doctor and wears a 
bandage on a knee that has been sprained from climbing the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaster in Gordon's two-room apartment is badly scarred by the quake and 
she lost precious dishes and a vase she had owned for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, she said, there were no quake problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm strong-willed," she said. "I made up my mind once and for all: I try to 
do my very best. I go shopping by myself. I don't rely on anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said, it would be nice to move downstairs: "I don't want to live on 
the fourth floor anymore."

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; CLOSINGS NO VACATION FOR YOUTHS, TEACHERS; 
EDUCATION: AS TWO DAMAGED HIGH SCHOOLS SIT IDLE, STUDENTS TRY TO KEEP STUDYING 
AS THEY WORRY ABOUT COLLEGE PLANS, GRADES AND FRIENDS.

 Jerry Hickman's house has become a math classroom. The teacher at El Camino 
Real High School in Woodland Hills serves practice tests in his kitchen and 
discusses calculus in his living room. His guests are teen-agers eager to 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman is trying to maintain continuity for the students in his Advanced 
Placement calculus courses who have no school to attend because it was heavily 
damaged in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't afford to fall behind," Hickman said. "This is a huge inconvenience. 
I've given my students assignments for the next three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 To the 5,000 students at El Camino and at John F. Kennedy High School in 
Granada Hills, who have no idea when their schools will reopen, the unexpected 
winter vacation caused by the 6.6-magnitude quake has been marked by boredom, 
anxiety and a host of unanswered questions. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens to college applications? What about finals? Is the soccer season 
over? How about basketball? 
</P>
<P>
 "At first it was nice to have a short vacation," said David Rand, an El Camino 
senior. "But now it's screwing everything up." 
</P>
<P>
 The two high schools were hit with the worst earthquake damage of all the 
secondary campuses in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Kennedy's 
three-story administration building suffered structural damage and El Camino's 
classroom walls could fall at any minute. Both schools have been closed since 
the Jan. 17 quake and officials say it could be March before they reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 While the district focuses on the campuses' physical problems, the students 
say they are worrying about their futures. Teachers say they, too, are anxious 
to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Camino staff and students are confronting another set of problems. 
Principal Martin King, who has been at El Camino for seven years, filed his 
retirement papers the week before the quake and planned to leave Friday. 
Although King says he will stay on as long as he is needed, he says he is ready 
to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers submitted three names of preferred candidates for the position but 
the staff has not heard who will be selected by Supt. Sid Thompson to take the 
head job. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite personnel problems, both schools have had to make tough academic 
decisions. Both staffs decided to abandon final exams and grade students based 
on their work before the quake. Students whose grades could have improved by 
taking an exam say they are disappointed that they will not have that 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the college entrance exam, the Scholastic Aptitude Test, was postponed. 
It was scheduled for Jan. 22 at El Camino and nine other campuses in the 
district. The Educational Testing Service, which administers the SAT and the 
Achievement Test, plans to reschedule the exams at different school sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Other school activities, including student council elections and a semiformal 
dance at Kennedy, were scrapped. And students in Advanced Placement courses, 
which culminate in a test in May, say they are worried about the break in their 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether we're in school or not, we're going to have to take that test," said 
Jennifer Gould, an El Camino senior. "This is not fun. Everyone's real 
jittery." 
</P>
<P>
 Some teachers at El Camino and Kennedy are holding special study sessions for 
their Advanced Placement students. And, El Camino's Advanced Placement teachers 
agreed Friday to hold optional tutoring sessions in bungalows on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy history and government teacher Richard Sprouse has been meeting his 
Advanced Placement students in various smaller schools. The Advanced Placement 
tests allow students to earn college credits if they score high enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students and teachers are concerned that college and financial aid 
applications could be delayed because transcripts have not been mailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding that problem at Kennedy is the fact that the administration 
building -- which houses student records, among other things -- is so badly 
damaged that officials have not decided if records and other materials will be 
salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
 At El Camino, the problem is not structural but it is potentially dangerous. 
Classroom partition walls are loose and could fall with a significant 
aftershock. Additionally, the ceiling tiles came crashing down and might need 
to be replaced in most classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Camino and Kennedy staffs have agreed unanimously to extend the school 
day by 39 minutes -- and possibly lengthen the school year -- rather than 
transfer students to different schools or try another way to get them in 
different schools sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews have been working on both campuses since the earthquake, trying to shore 
up unstable posts and buildings and to check gas lines. Both campuses are 
without water. Portable classrooms likely will be installed on the campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the harshest critics of the district commend the maintenance workers and 
the district for their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be the first to criticize the district, and I can't find anything wrong 
with the way the district has handled this," said Jack Koening, El Camino's 
teachers union representative and government and economics teacher. "We figure 
it takes something over a 6 (magnitude) to make them cooperative and something 
over a 7.0 to make them congenial." 
</P>
<P>
 The unexpected break has left many students home with little to do. All but a 
handful of schools have reopened, so brothers and sisters have returned to 
classes and parents have returned to work. Some live far from their school 
friends: Of El Camino's 2,700 students, 900 are bused from across Los Angeles. 
About 1,000 of Kennedy's 2,300 students are bused. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Correa, a Kennedy senior who is bused from her home in South-Central 
to the Granada Hills campus, said she misses her friends -- several of whom 
live in the north Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a part of you -- like family," Correa said. "It's kind of like I 
already graduated and I'm never going to see anyone again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An aftershock during a teachers meeting at Kennedy last week left several 
teachers upset and fearful. 
</P>
<P>
 Andreda Pruitt, Kennedy's principal, said she was in tears on Monday when she 
saw the devastation at the school, which has become a backdrop for politicians. 
Thompson and members of the Board of Education held a news conference there, 
and Gov. Pete Wilson also made an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Pruitt said she knew how to handle the disaster at Kennedy after being 
involved in the cleanup following the 1971 Sylmar quake, when she was a teacher 
at Los Angeles High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel so disconnected," said Jean Feldman, a Kennedy English teacher and 
student council adviser. "I'm out of my normal routine and I'm sure the kids 
are feeling the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully we can plan a St. Patrick's Day dance," she said. "If we're back."

CITYSCAPES / PAUL FELDMAN: EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; FREEWAY-PHOBES SAY 
QUAKE SHOWS THEY'RE JUST STREET SMART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Amy Malina, an expatriate New Yorker, has routinely risked whiplash while 
motoring on Manhattan's pothole-plagued expressways. She has also frequently 
defied death by boarding subways well past midnight, bound for the most 
crime-infested neighborhoods of Brooklyn and the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when it comes to driving on Los Angeles freeways, forget about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always had an intense fear of entering the freeway," said the Westside 
resident. "But now I'm sort of in the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm no longer driving-impaired." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some friends jokingly refer to Malina, 40, as a surface girl. Others call her 
a freeway-phobe. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the appellation, the musician/composer is among the tens of thousands 
of Southland residents who were afflicted with a strong fear of freeway driving 
long before portions of the Santa Monica, Antelope Valley and Simi Valley 
freeways came crashing to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 If not vindication, the temblor has resulted in validation for many Angelenos 
with freeway phobias. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been afraid of the freeways," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Lea Purwin 
D'Agostino. "And this certainly doesn't endear them to me." 
</P>
<P>
 D'Agostino, who is frightened by excessive driving speeds, seeks to avoid 
freeways even as a passenger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I scrunch down in the back seat so I don't have to look," said the veteran 
prosecutor, who commutes on surface streets between the Westside and Van Nuys. 
"Sitting next to a serial murderer in court doesn't faze me one iota. But the 
thought of being in a car on a freeway does." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts estimate that as many as 10% of all Southland drivers refused to 
venture onto the freeways before the Northridge temblor. About 25% of those who 
did, they add, did so with trepidation.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot have a fear of panic or anxiety and are more afraid of that while 
they're driving," said Gerald Tarlow, an assistant clinical professor of 
psychiatry at UCLA and director of the Center for Anxiety Management. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city defined in large part by its car culture, many freeway-phobes have 
traditionally remained silent about their aversion. 
</P>
<P>
 But with freeway traffic having slowed to a crawl -- not to mention being 
rerouted along such surface streets as Robertson Boulevard, Little Tujunga 
Canyon Road and Sierra Highway -- some freeway-phobes have become bolder -- 
verbally, at least. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who drove the freeways before the earthquake used to look at people 
like me as if they felt sorry," said USC journalism professor Clancy Sigal. 
"Now I look at them and I feel terribly sorry for them because I know what they 
must be going through. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's a NIMBY (not in my back yard) thing," he added. "I don't want 
them to mess up my surface streets. Stay away." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a far cry from the glory years of the freeways, when the thick asphalt 
ribbons served as symbols of mobility and progress, or in Joan Didion's novels, 
freedom and abandon. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also a far cry from the opinions of traffic experts, who continue to 
maintain that freeways are the safest place to drive this side of Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 At the California Driving School, where business has plummeted during the last 
two weeks, instructors dispense with the psychological rigmarole and head 
straight for the freeway, sometimes without informing their clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's any qualms," said its president, George R. Hensel, "it would not 
be for people driving on the freeway.  
</P>
<P>
 "It would be for people on the surface streets under the freeways." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If any winners have emerged this month -- besides the TV viewers who will no 
longer have to suffer through live coverage of high-speed freeway chases -- it 
is the authors of "L.A. Shortcuts" and "Freeway Alternatives," two books on how 
to avoid interstates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must confess my book is starting to sell," said David (Dr. Roadmap) Rizzo, 
author of the latter tome. "Sales had slowed to a trickle of about one a day. . 
. . But my publisher told me that last week alone two book chains ordered 250 
more each." 
</P>
<P>
 For surface-streeter Malina, the quake means no longer having to be the butt 
of jokes.  
</P>
<P>
 "My husband once suggested that I go to driving school for some postgraduate 
work to overcome my problem," she said. "But the earthquake makes me feel 
strongly that I don't mind having my phobia." 
</P>
<P>
 "I always knew there was something fishy about those freeways. Now I can put 
my finger on it exactly." 
</P>
<P>
 Malina has driven only once on a Los Angeles freeway. It happened by mistake 
nearly a decade ago after she agreed to follow a friend from Los Feliz to 
Chinatown. When the friend turned left onto the Hollywood Freeway, Malina 
turned sick to her stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured what the hell, this is crazy, let's try it," she said. "But no 
sooner was I on the freeway than my car, seemingly on its own, as if it thought 
better of it, exited immediately on the next ramp."  
</P>
<P>
 Malina and her cousin, another freeway-phobe, proceeded to drive west down 
Sunset Boulevard back to the Westside, recovering from their nausea in time to 
stop in Beverly Hills for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you can lead a horse to water," she says. "But you can't make it 
drink."

QUAKE SURVIVORS MEET THEIR RESCUER

<P>
 It was a super Sunday for Jerry Prezioso and Steve Langdon, all right -- but 
not for the reasons one would think. 
</P>
<P>
 The roommates in the Northridge Meadows building finally got to meet the 
reserve cop who tunneled and hefted "like the Incredible Hulk" through the 
rubble on a dark Monday morning to find them trapped but alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I really gotta thank you," Prezioso told Don Stein, the Los Angeles 
reserve police officer. "We were in there five hours before anyone heard us." 
</P>
<P>
 The roommates met Stein for the first time in Prezioso's room in the 
Northridge Hospital Medical Center. The two men were just voices in the dark on 
Jan. 17, when Stein was looking for survivors, and heard screams. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifting huge pieces of concrete, stucco and wood, Stein said he "felt like the 
Incredible Hulk. My adrenaline was pumping, and I wasn't worried about what 
could happen to me if another shaker hit while I was in the rubble." 
</P>
<P>
 Once he located Prezioso, he was stunned by his composure. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a sense of humor you wouldn't believe. A building was sitting on this 
guy, and he wasn't scared or spooked or anything!" said Stein, who summoned the 
firefighters who rescued the men. 
</P>
<P>
 Prezioso and Langdon talked Sunday with the same humor that saw them through 
the hours when they were trapped face-down by the floor above them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good way to break a lease, don't you think?" said Prezioso, 67. "Hey, 
you gotta have humor in tragedy. . . . I can't help that. I'm a New Yorker." 
</P>
<P>
 Langdon was hospitalized for a time and Prezioso is still in the medical 
center, where he was sent with injured legs and nails in his body. 
</P>
<P>
 As he was removed from the collapsed building, Prezioso remembers saying: "Now 
I can watch the Super Bowl." But the men paid little attention to Sunday's 
game. "There'll be a lot of other Super Bowls," Prezioso said. "This night is 
more important."

L.A. SCENE / THE CITY THEN AND NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CECILIA RASMUSSEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The distance from the Eastside of Los Angeles to the west has always been the 
same, but until the end of World War II, it was a leisurely excursion, a 
daylong, horse-drawn journey there and back, a Red Car ride to the beach, a 
slow drive along surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The war, as it changed so much, changed all that, too. The wartime machinery 
created the peacetime demand for freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 By war's end, 280,000 people a year were beginning to flock to what was 
rumored to be the land of milk and honey. Many had been here before, such as 
servicemen en route home from the war. 
</P>
<P>
 There was almost nowhere for them to live. In 1947, 1,500 of them camped out 
in MacArthur Park to protest. One veteran carried a sign reading, "Foxholes in 
1945 -- Rat Holes in 1947." 
</P>
<P>
 Builders soon began answering the demand with thousands of homes, settling the 
city more densely and widely than it had ever been. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation had to match the population and real estate boom, and in the 
same year as the MacArthur Park protest, the state Division of Highways began 
buying up property along the route that was to become the Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 It would take nearly a decade and $98.5 million to purchase 4,129 parcels of 
land from churches, banks, markets, homeowners and even a railroad. Almost 
15,000 people were displaced by the freeway -- more than 10 times as many as 
were bought out when Chavez Ravine was cleared to build Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 One hundred property owners sued the state; only two ended up in court. Most 
residents along the freeway's path -- and most civic leaders -- were elated 
that the hoped-for Santa Monica Freeway was finally going to be built. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, one apartment building owner played a game of dodge ball for years. His 
two-story building, purchased along with the land by the state, was sold back 
to the owner at a state auction. The owner moved the apartment house farther 
west. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, the state wanted that land, too, and agreed to move the 
apartment house again, still farther west. Even that "final resting place" was 
eventually nicked in one corner by the freeway's ultimate right of way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1957, with legal obstacles cleared, construction crews began to build Los 
Angeles' first east-west freeway, starting with the bridge that spans the Los 
Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Santa Ana Freeway Downtown to the ocean, the 17-mile freeway would 
eventually cost more than $210 million, or $12 million a mile, compared to $5 
million a mile for the older Hollywood and Harbor freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 29, 1965, thousands of Angelenos -- mostly Westsiders waiting for the 
linkup -- stood watching as the 4.6-mile section of the Santa Monica Freeway 
from Vermont Avenue to La Cienega Boulevard was dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
 (In fact, a completed freeway was several months away, when the final 
sections, at the San Diego Freeway and the McClure Tunnel onto Pacific Coast 
Highway, were opened.) 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication was zestful, even though the freeway was not finished. Instead 
of the usual ribbon-cutting, a tire dangling at the end of a 150-foot-long rope 
secured to the hovering Goodyear blimp tore through the ribbon just west of La 
Cienega Boulevard as a Dixieland band played.  
</P>
<P>
 A few days short of 29 years later, a section of the freeway just east of the 
ribbon-cutting site was destroyed by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the quake, the freeway had not had an easy go of it, and neither 
had its commuters. With 270,000 cars a day, it became the nation's busiest -- 
and the site of controversy, innovation and bad jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them was the diamond lane brouhaha of 1976. As an effort to relieve 
congestion and encourage car-pooling, a single lane -- painted with diamond 
shapes -- was reserved for car-pools but was generally ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 During the oil crisis, one of the first (and by definition terrible) 
electronic puns appeared along the freeway: lighted message signs warning 
motorists "Don't Be Fuelish!" (Such signs, without the effort at humor, are now 
common on freeways.) 
</P>
<P>
 And there was the failed try at adding a name to the 17-mile Santa Monica 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans Director Adriana Gianturco wanted the Santa Monica to become the 
first link in the "Christopher Columbus Transcontinental Highway," another 
nickname for the coast-to-coast highway that drivers in four time zones know as 
"the 10." 
</P>
<P>
 The name never caught on beyond the California border because Arizona refused 
to join the salute. In fact, the name never got beyond a lone $1,300 sign near 
Santa Monica's 11th Street bridge. (This was the second time Gianturco's 
reputation had been injured in a freeway mishap; the diamond lane also was her 
idea.) 
</P>
<P>
 And the freeway has been immortalized in more low-key mode, a country-Western 
song that goes: "Santa Monica Freeway . . . sort of makes a country girl 
blue-oo-oo-oo." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Jan. 17, when "the Medium One" broke the 10, that girl would have been 
downright sad. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; DETOUR INTO THE FUTURE?; FIRMS SCRAMBLE TO HELP 
STAFF FIND ALTERNATIVES TO DRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As Juli Oborne boarded a Metrolink train in the pre-dawn hours one day last 
week at Santa Clarita, she vowed: "Today, I'm going to do battle with my boss. 
I'll stand on the branch manager's desk to get that shuttle." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the new post-quake environment, dramatics weren't necessary. Beginning 
today, Oborne and half a dozen fellow workers at Law/Crandall Inc., an 
environmental consulting firm in City of Commerce, will find a company car 
waiting at Union Station for the last leg of their commute. 
</P>
<P>
 Oborne's boss is operating in an abruptly changed world of work these days, as 
are thousands of other Southern California employers who had previously ranged 
from ardent to halfhearted in their support of ride-sharing, telecommuting and 
flexible work hours. 
</P>
<P>
 While politicians, academics and others expound on the earthquake's message 
that Southern Californians must rethink the way they work, employers are 
wrestling with immediate real-world dilemmas that aren't readily solved by the 
advice of theoreticians. 
</P>
<P>
 Many service jobs and certain industries, notably hotels and restaurants, will 
never lend themselves to such alternatives as employees working at home 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Digital transferal of your ham and eggs doesn't really work," said Neil 
Cohen, a Hilton Hotels Corp. vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, until freeways return to normal and all job sites are back in 
operation, it won't be clear how much commuting patterns are changing -- or how 
long such changes might last. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody suspects that, yes, changes have happened in targeted areas," said 
Bruce de Terra, a transportation planner at the California Department of 
Transportation's Office of Traffic Improvement. "But there's so little you can 
get a grip on right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, virtually all major employers have plans in the works to help improve 
the commutes of their workers, many of whom face mundane but difficult hurdles 
such as the one Oborne and her colleagues overcame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most employers are trying to supplement Metrolink, so they are looking to 
establish some kind of shuttle or short-distance van pool," said Sandy Boyle, 
regional manager in the Long Beach customer service center of VPSI Inc., a 
subsidiary of Chrysler Corp. that provides van pools to companies and 
individual riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Inquiries about space on her vans have doubled lately, Boyle said. However, 
many employers -- strapped because of Southern California's three-year 
recession -- apparently have yet to commit to paying for such services over 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cases, employers are stepping forward and saying, 'We're going to pay 
for it as long as we can,' " Boyle said. "Other employers hope to persuade the 
(Metropolitan Transit Authority) or Metrolink to provide these services for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Commuter Transportation Services, the five-county nonprofit group that helps 
employers and employees find ride-sharing partners, has had to hire more 
workers and add 20 phone lines to its 800 number to handle a 600% increase in 
calls since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a tremendous response," spokeswoman Roberta Tinajero said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, U.S. Secretary of Commerce 
Ronald H. Brown, Gov. Pete Wilson and others announced the formation of the 
Southern California Emergency Telecommuting Partnership, which offers 
information and other support for home telecommuting, including equipment and 
software donated by IBM, Intel, AT&T and other companies ((800) 6-INFO-HWY). 
</P>
<P>
 "People who were stranded and isolated by the earthquake have a way to be 
productive again," said Susan Herman, general manager for the Los Angeles city 
Department of Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the nature of the business precludes some workplace innovations, 
staffs have been encouraged to try new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hilton's personnel must still show up at the hotels, many of the more 
than 300 employees at its corporate headquarters in Beverly Hills have been 
offered flexible work hours, computer and fax equipment for telecommuting and 
more ride-sharing opportunities since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Sizzler International's chefs still have to show up in the restaurants, 
even before the quake 40% of its corporate headquarters staff in Los Angeles 
used some form of ride-sharing, telecommuting, flexible work hours or public 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some of the region's biggest employers have shifted gears, revving 
up programs started since 1988 in response to the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District's ride-sharing rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the AQMD's Regulation XV, which requires all companies with 100 or 
more workers to offer incentives for employee ride-sharing, was eased somewhat 
the Friday before the quake. The AQMD, in response to heavy criticism from 
recession-plagued businesses, gave companies a two-year hiatus on planned 
increases in the incentives they must offer to employees to encourage 
ride-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will now allow special credit, however, to firms that donate 
telecommuting facilities and other help to businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 But due to the quake, Bank of America -- the state's largest private employer 
with nearly 30,000 workers in the Los Angeles area -- has bought $100,000 worth 
of Metrolink passes to sell to employees at its larger work sites. The bank has 
also installed a toll-free phone number to give information on mass transit to 
employees, and it is setting up a shuttle system to connect its major work 
centers to Metrolink stations. 
</P>
<P>
 BofA has long offered $60 a month in subsidies to mass-transit users, as well 
as flexible time schedules when workers can arrange them with their 
supervisors. Now it is also providing computers to employees who can 
telecommute from home and switching workers to four-day, 10-hour-a-day 
workweeks where possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Such compressed workweek options have looked better to many companies since an 
executive order from Sacramento. On Jan. 20, Wilson temporarily suspended state 
labor laws requiring that overtime be paid after eight hours of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has proven to be very popular with people because you've taken a day off 
the workweek commute cycle, and you can also make it easier to miss the worst 
commute times," BofA spokesman Bob Wynne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewlett Packard Co. has offered flexible work hours to its more than 800 Los 
Angeles area employees since 1978, but it is still debating other measures that 
many companies have already adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell International Corp. is also still making the adjustment to workplace 
flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell's Rocketdyne plant in Canoga Park was hit hard by the quake. Since 
then, the company, which had tried only small pilot projects in telecommuting, 
has set up computers in its Palmdale facility that it expects to be used by as 
many as 60 Canoga Park employees living in the Antelope Valley. Car- and 
van-pooling -- 3,500 of Rockwell's 21,000 employees in the Los Angeles basin 
participated before the quake -- are also up.

FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES: A BYTE OUT OF HEALTH COSTS

 Call it health care without Hillary. 
</P>
<P>
 A new computer game promises that players can revamp our health system sans 
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The software is touted as a program that "gives you everything you need to 
remake the American health care system -- except the First Lady." Its slogan: 
"Hillary not included." 
</P>
<P>
 The $29.95 game, backed by the Markle Foundation, purports to answer one key 
question: "Will you be reelected?" Shaking Up the Market 
</P>
<P>
 With the Northridge earthquake only 2 weeks old, one would think the timing 
could be better to try to lease a house that rests on a single concrete pillar 
in the hills overlooking the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sherman Oaks businessman Alan Fox is doing that, offering the famous 
Chemosphere house he owns above Studio City for $2,795 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The octagonal home, which resembles a flying saucer, was referred to in the 
1961 Encyclopaedia Britannica as "the most modern home built in the world." It 
also was the setting of a murder in director Brian DePalma's thriller "Body 
Double." 
</P>
<P>
 According to an exec with Fox's property management firm, the house suffered 
only a broken window in the quake. Not a Typical Family Film 
</P>
<P>
 A bizarre ad has been running in the Hollywood trades that has a lot of people 
talking. It asks for $3.5 million for "tens of thousands of feet of original 
film & sound records" of convicted murderer Charles Manson and his followers. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out it's from Robert Hendrickson, who is selling his Oscar-nominated 
Manson documentary and additional footage. Manson is in prison, convicted of 
masterminding the 1969 Tate-LaBianca murders. 
</P>
<P>
 An aspiring film maker then, Hendrickson, now an engineer, describes the 
footage as "2 1/2 years in which the cameras never stoped rolling." He says his 
footage shows the dark side of Manson's followers. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale comes on the heel of controversies over commercial exploitation of 
the murders, including the sale of T-shirts picturing Manson and the inclusion 
of a Manson-written song on the new album by rock group Guns N' Roses. 
</P>
<P>
 Patti Tate, sister of slain actress Sharon Tate and an activist fighting 
exploitation of the murders, said she doesn't know enough about what 
Hendrickson is doing to judge it, but she said the overall commercialization of 
Manson that is taking place bothers her. "They're making a cult idol out of 
him. That's wrong," she says. Briefly . . . 
</P>

 QVC chief and Paramount suitor Barry Diller on raising money for AIDS Project 
Los Angeles last week: "When I called this one or that big shot, they're so 
thrilled I'm not asking for billions to help our financing (for the Paramount 
deal) that getting fifty or a hundred thousand dollars is a snap." . . . A

END NEAR IN ICN BATTLE; BUT ISSUES RAISED IN THE SQUABBLE WILL PERSIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ and JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It began as a colorful but straightforward story, one of an ambitious and 
smooth-talking stockbroker who wanted to oust the dapper, mercurial chairman of 
a mid-sized pharmaceuticals company. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the 10 months since, Rafi Khan's effort to topple Milan Panic, founder 
of ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Costa Mesa, has evolved into an extraordinarily 
nasty battle whose repercussions have ricocheted throughout the financial 
services industry. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, at ICN's long-awaited annual meeting, the question of whether Khan 
and a six-member slate of candidates should replace Panic and eight other ICN 
board members will finally be settled. It appears almost certain that Panic, 
whose troubles stem in part from his seven-month sojourn as prime minister of 
Yugoslavia, will emerge victorious. 
</P>
<P>
 The broader issues raised in this battle, though, will not disappear as 
quickly. For starters, Khan may still have to answer allegations of criminal 
wrongdoing that surfaced as a result of ICN's concerted effort to discredit 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, the ICN-Khan affair has focused overdue attention on the 
standards and practices of the booming mutual fund industry. Khan's 
relationships with mutual fund companies that are ICN's largest shareholders 
have led to questions about possible conflicts of interest on the part of fund 
managers -- and may have contributed to the firing last month of prominent 
Invesco Funds Group Inc. manager John Kaweske. 
</P>
<P>
 Invesco said Kaweske was terminated because he broke company rules by not 
reporting personal trades. His portfolio included shares in a private placement 
of stocks in Cardiac Science Inc., an Irvine medical device company that Khan 
has promoted for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Cooper, chairman of Cardiac Science, is a member of Khan's slate of 
would-be ICN directors. And the managers of three mutual funds that are large 
holders of ICN stock -- Glickenhaus & Co., Putnam Investments of Boston and 
Chestnut Hill Management Corp. -- also bought shares in Cardiac Science. 
</P>
<P>
 These funds and several other institutional holders of ICN shares also own 
stock in a laundry list of companies that Khan has recommended in a series of 
reports, written in an unabashedly campy style. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those stocks have risen sharply in the past 24 months -- though one of 
them, Future Communications, is in bankruptcy and the subject of a number of 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The implication, subtly suggested by ICN, is that Khan has a network of fund 
managers who would support him in exchange for insider tips on new stock issues 
and other similar favors. 
</P>
<P>
 While no clear evidence has emerged to support such a theory, it has prompted 
federal and state regulators to focus on the links between stock promoters and 
fund managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan, who owns less than 1% of ICN's outstanding shares, and the fund managers 
who have invested in the drug firm say the implications of wrongdoing are 
ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a sham that all this (controversy over Cardiac Science stock) 
comes up right before the annual meeting," Khan said. "All this is inspired and 
contrived by Panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Khan and the fund managers note that Cardiac Science has hardly been a stellar 
investment, and cite a far more innocent reason for their involvement with 
Khan: He has a good record in picking stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very sympathetic to Khan," said Seth Glickenhaus of Glickenhaus & Co. 
"He's a salesman, a very bright person." 
</P>
<P>
 ICN has invested heavily in an effort to discredit Khan, taking out full-page 
ads in newspapers and hiring private investigators to delve into his past. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Khan, the investigators uncovered evidence that suggested he 
may have been involved in a scheme to defraud the British government by 
illegally buying too many shares in British Gas. 
</P>
<P>
 After a dramatic November hearing in federal court in New York, U.S. District 
Judge John Sprizzo found that Khan had probably masterminded the British Gas 
share-buying scheme and lied about it in court. 
</P>
<P>
 He later persuaded the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan to investigate Khan 
for perjury and other possible wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan, who was once a staunch ally of ICN and Panic, is now accused of using 
insider information in pursuing his proxy fight. He denies those charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Five brokerages involved in short-selling Future Communications shares accused 
Khan in lawsuits of engaging in market manipulation. Some of those firms either 
have settled or are negotiating deals, according to Khan's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 And federal authorities, working in seven cities, have subpoenaed records of 
Khan's trading activity at his former employer, Beverly Hills brokerage 
Reynolds Kendrick & Stratton, and are looking into his stock dealings at 
another local brokerage, H.J. Meyers & Sons Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Three former Khan employees and associates -- Kristina Kraverica, Olivia 
Winsten and Shirley Kwok, all of whom knew Khan at H.J. Meyers or Reynolds 
Kendrick -- were subpoenaed to appear before a New York grand jury beginning 
Wednesday, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 No criminal charges have ever been filed against Khan. But clearly, the 
allegations have eroded Khan's support among fund managers -- even though many 
are dissatisfied with ICN. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rafi (Khan) is now a controversial figure," said one fund manager, who asked 
not to be identified. "If a judge says that Rafi is a crook, then that is a 
pretty big hill to get over." 
</P>
<P>
 Another manager noted that mutual funds rely heavily on their reputations to 
attract customers. "Funds are political creatures, very sensitive to their 
image," he said. "That makes it very hard for them to vote for" Khan. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fund managers cited other problems. Philip Dubuque, fund manager at 
Chestnut Hill, would not divulge how he would vote, but he questioned the 
experience of Khan's proposed directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubuque said management has lately been "listening to shareholders." Indeed, 
Khan's challenge has clearly forced ICN to promise to address a number of 
issues that had angered stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Those include the dilution of shares through private placements in Europe, 
lucrative compensation packages for ICN executives and Panic's alleged neglect 
of the company during his ill-fated stint as prime minister of Yugoslavia that 
ended abruptly last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Putnam spokeswoman Nancy Fisher said her firm had decided to back current 
management after it "carefully considered the arguments of both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had face-to-face meetings with Mr. Khan and Mr. Panic, and while some 
concerns raised by Mr. Khan deserve serious attention, we are impressed by the 
willingness of ICN to address issues important to us," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, not all of Khan's erstwhile allies have abandoned him. Seth Glickenhaus 
said last week that he would probably vote his funds' 575,000 ICN shares in 
favor of Khan's slate. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan maintains that he holds the advantage in the proxy fight. 
</P>
<P>
 But privately, he is livid that funds such as Invesco -- for whom he claimed 
to have made $500 million with profitable stock recommendations -- are 
abandoning him now. Khan also believes that Invesco fired Kaweske because he 
would have pledged the fund's 1.6 million shares to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan now says he is counting on support from a number of smaller mutual funds 
to land him a seat on ICN's board. 
</P>
<P>
 ICN officials said they were heartened by what they feel will be an easy 
victory Tuesday after a long, tumultuous campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman David Calef said the votes will be counted during the annual meeting 
and the results announced immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very confident about the outcome," he said, noting that a New York 
judge has ordered Khan to vote 44,000 of his own 120,000 ICN shares to the 
company because it was determined that those shares were acquired as the result 
of trading on insider information. "Even Rafi is voting for us."

OFF THE TICKER: BUFFALO'S GRIEF IS WALL STREET'S JOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Wall Street, everybody is a Dallas Cowboys fan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys' victory Sunday guarantees that stocks will rise this year -- at 
least if you believe the "Super Bowl indicator." 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, a victory by the National Conference team has usually coincided 
with an up year in the stock market. A win by the American Conference has 
usually signaled a down year. That holds for 24 out of 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 For purposes of the indicator, original NFL franchises such as Pittsburgh are 
still considered National teams, even though they were moved to the American 
Conference after the NFL and AFL merged in 1970. That stacks the odds in the 
indicator's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, superstitious Wall Street craves a National victory. At least the 
Bills can say they lost for a good cause. TOM PETRUNO

 Malone Sees Trouble for Networks: John Malone, chief executive of 
Tele-Communications Inc., predicts one or more of the major U.S. television 
networks will fall prey to takeover bids this year, according to a report in 
the Feb. 7 issue of the New Yorker magazine.Malone, whose giant cable company 
is engaged in a $33-billion merger with Bell Atlantic, told the magazine that 
CBS will probably be sold within 12 months. Malone also said he has been 
counseling his friend Ted Turner, who hopes to buy ABC or NBC. The magazine 
quotes Malone as saying CBS "will probably merge with Disney within 12 months."

D-DAY HERE IN PARAMOUNT TAKEOVER BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QVC Network Inc. is facing the moment of truth in its four-month, $10-billion 
battle to wrest Paramount Communications Inc. away from rival suitor Viacom 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC's and Viacom's current tender offers to Paramount stockholders expire 
today. Takeover stock specialists say Viacom will win the contest unless QVC 
improves its bid, thus extending the battle one more day, to Tuesday's deadline 
set by Paramount for "best and final" offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're coming back, or they're going to lose," said an arbitrager who said 
he and other arbitragers will tender their Paramount stock to Viacom if QVC 
does not improve its bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts and arbitragers said they were expecting QVC to revise its bid today, 
but public comments and leaks from the QVC camp have cast doubt over such 
speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're probably going to change their bid to make it more 
attractive," said analyst James Meyer of Janney Montgomery Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC had no comment Sunday about its plans. 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to QVC said Friday that QVC's bid was higher and that it was 
possible the bid would not change. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC's bid is $92 a share in cash for 50.1% of Paramount shares, and securities 
for the rest. The total value of the bid is estimated at $84.50 a share, or 
$10.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom is bidding $107 a share in cash for 50.1% of Paramount, plus 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The total current value of the Viacom bid is about $83 a share, or $10 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the higher cash portion in Viacom's bid and a financial instrument 
protecting the value of the securities are regarded as tipping the balance in 
Viacom's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount withdrew from a merger agreement with QVC on Jan. 21 and entered a 
pact with Viacom, based on Viacom's Jan. 18 bid. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC has raised its offer twice from an initial cash-and-stock bid of $80 per 
share, or $9.7 billion, made Sept. 20. Viacom has revised its offer four times 
from an initial $69.14-a-share in cash and stock, announced Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Any new revised QVC bid is expected to offer more cash and protection to the 
securities in the "back end" of the offer. If QVC raises its bid before the 2 
p.m. PST deadline, that could set off another round of bidding Tuesday.

 Business Survey Confirms Confidence Growing: Corporate confidence in the 
economy has risen, along with expectations that business investment will jump 
this year, the Australian Financial Review said, citing results of a recent 
survey.The survey shows that 42% of 640 executives polled predict improvement 
in the economy by June, contrasted with 6% who see a decline. Nearly eight in 
10 directors predicted a stronger economy by year's end. A survey released last 
week by Dun & Bradstreet showed business confidence at its highest level in 
five years, with companies predicting higher orders, sales and profits.

 Pepsi to Expand Production: PepsiCo Inc. said it will invest $350 million over 
the next five years to open 10 bottling plants, aiming to become the top soft 
drink company in the world's most populous country."Over the next five years, 
we will more than double our capacity in China," said James Lawrence, Pepsi's 
president for the region. In 1993, Pepsi produced 40 million cases of 8-ounce 
bottles of soda in China, capturing 7% of the market. It said it aims to 
produce 370 million cases in the near future.

AMERICAN FIRMS CAN REAP BOUNTY IN VIETNAM BUSINESS, GROUP SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American companies could share in as much as $9 billion worth of trade and 
investment if the 19-year economic embargo against Vietnam is lifted, according 
to the director of a business group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans could participate in $6 billion in trade and $2 billion or $3 
billion in investment," Virginia B. Foote said following a U.S. Senate vote 
Thursday urging the Clinton Administration to lift the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Foote, director of the Washington-based United States-Vietnam Trade Council, 
said in a telephone interview that she expects a decision by President Clinton 
quite soon, perhaps within the week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate vote is not legally binding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still the President's decision," Foote said. "They haven't changed that 
dynamic, (but) I think the President will take this Senate vote very 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam's Ministry of Foreign Affairs hailed the vote as a "positive action 
required by the current reality and in accordance with the aspirations of the 
American people." 
</P>
<P>
 "We hold that this action will be approved by American public opinion as well 
as in the world," ministry spokeswoman Ho The Lan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam offers a market of 70 million consumers, a large pool of inexpensive 
labor and oil and coal resources. Mobil Corp. has already won bidding for the 
right to explore for oil off southern Vietnam. But until the embargo is lifted, 
it can collect only seismic data and is barred from producing or selling oil 
from the offshore field. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. 
have signed agreements to help Vietnam with $300 million in information 
technology purchases over the next seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the opponents of lifting the embargo are veterans groups and members of 
the families of 2,238 Americans unaccounted for in Indochina from the Vietnam 
War, including 1,647 in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Legion, the largest veterans group in the United States, with 3.1 
million members, said in a statement issued in Hanoi that veterans and POW-MIA 
families will take their case to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than give the President 'political cover,' the Senate has ensured that 
the President will have to personally decide whether to abandon the families of 
our POWs," said Bruce Thiesen, commander of the American Legion. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has said that before he will lift the embargo, he must be satisfied 
that Vietnam has cooperated in giving the fullest possible accounting of the 
MIAs. In the last two months, a series of Administration officials and senators 
have visited Vietnam and reported that Hanoi is doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States first imposed sanctions against North Vietnam in 1964 at the 
start of the war. It extended the embargo to all of Vietnam in 1975 after 
communist North Vietnam took over the South, which had been supported by the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Some American business officials in Hanoi saw the Senate action as another 
indicator that the time has come to put the war behind and look to a future of 
economic and diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just one more in a series of indications that virtually every sector 
of American government has stood very publicly and said it's time to lift the 
trade embargo and to get on with normalizing relations," said Peter Ryder. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryder is president of Manolis & Company Asia Ltd., which runs a real estate 
development and investment firm in Hanoi. Officials of his company have been 
traveling to Vietnam for the last two years and established a representative 
office here last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 American firms can open offices, make contacts, gauge the market and sign 
contracts with Vietnamese counterparts, but they cannot do any business. The 
only exceptions are for sales of humanitarian goods and for work on development 
projects such as highways and bridges financed by international lending 
institutions. There are 35 U.S. companies with offices in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh 
City.

 Third Stock Market Planned: In announcing the move, the government said it 
will also slow growth in share issues to ensure completion of its huge 1994 
treasury bond issue, the official China Securities paper reported. The China 
Securities Regulatory Commission is studying when and where the third exchange 
will open, the paper quoted securities chief Liu Hongru as saying. Faced with 
inflation of 19.6% in major cities last year, its worst in four years, China 
reportedly plans to soak up excess money supply by issuing about $11.6 billion 
in treasury bonds this year.

 Trade With China Rises but Growth Slowing: Commerce between the two nations 
through Hong Kong rose strongly in the first 10 months of 1993, but growth 
showed signs of slowing because of recent measures by China to restrict 
imports, the Board of Foreign Trade said.Taiwan-China trade totaled $7.16 
billion for the period, a 20% rise from a year earlier. Taiwan's exports to 
China jumped 24% to $6.26 billion, while imports were down 2.13% to $900 
million. Most Taiwan-China trade goes through Hong Kong because Taipei bans 
direct transport links with China.

 At Least $20 Billion Needed for Highway Work: Experts at an international 
seminar on roads and bridges estimated that the nation needs between $20 
billion and $25 billion to rebuild its road system, the Vietnam News Agency 
reported.Almost half of Vietnam's 66,000 miles of roads have been rated poor by 
the United Nations. Many roads have no shoulders, poor drainage and are filled 
with potholes. About a dozen U.S. companies are registered to bid on the 
project in July.

 New World Bank Loan OKd: The organization said it has approved an 
interest-free loan of $96 million for Vietnam to develop its agricultural and 
rubber industries and increase farmers' incomes.The 40-year loan is the third 
to Vietnam by the World Bank since October. The other loans, totaling $228 
million, were for highways and education. "The agricultural rehabilitation 
project follows substantial agricultural reforms begun in 1989, which 
dismantled farming communes and restored family farming," the bank said. The 
money will be used in part to provide small farmers with loans. Only about 10% 
of the 11 million small farmers in Vietnam now receive formal credit.

O.C. ENTERPRISE / DEBORA VRANA: SOFTWARE FIRM LAUNCHES NEW MARKETING PLAN; 
STRATEGY: FORMERLY HITCHED TO THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY, NUMERICAL CONTROL 
COMPUTER SCIENCES OF SANTA ANA SEEKS NEW CLIENTS OVERSEAS FOR ITS PRECISION 
PROGRAM.

 Once dependent on aerospace giants like Hughes Aircraft Co. and Rockwell 
International Corp. for its business, a Santa Ana high-tech machine company is 
repositioning itself to survive the shifting economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, Numerical Control Computer Sciences, makes the software needed to 
operate high-tech metal cutting machines. Its software has been used to 
manufacture fighter planes like Northrop Corp.'s YF-23 and the B-2 bomber. The 
company's computer programs helped manufacture the metal tiles needed to keep 
the Columbia space shuttle from disintegrating on re-entry to Earth's 
atmosphere and helped make tanks used in the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 In operation for 20 years, the company is now trying to meet the demands of 
the changing aerospace industry by moving into overseas markets and finding new 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized we had to get involved in something besides aerospace if we 
wanted to grow," said Donald F. Schultz, the 58-year-old president and founder 
of NCCS. "As everyone knows, aerospace has taken quite a beating." 
</P>
<P>
 And Schultz is a man who knows the aerospace industry. A Colorado native, he 
moved to California in his early 20s and joined what would later become 
Rockwell. Early on, he was attracted to the fledgling computers used to run 
some of the machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back then, in the early 1960s, we had mainframe computers and no disk 
drives," he said. "It was something completely new, and the government was 
sponsoring this." 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz stayed for 13 years before moving to Northrop. Then, in 1974, armed 
with only $3,000, he started NCCS out of his home. A few years later his 
brother joined him. Still, with four young children at the time, Schultz had 
serious reservations about leaving the security of a corporate position to take 
a risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I struggled with it," he said. "But at the time, I knew more about what I was 
doing with the software than anyone one else in this country. It wasn't that I 
was so bright, I just worked harder than anyone else."  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the company's reported revenue was $3.2 million. It expects to pull 
in nearly $3.5 million this year, and at least 15% of that will come from 
foreign sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make a very niche product, which has caused us to sell software around the 
world, not just in Los Angeles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the aerospace industry has cut back or moved into new lines of 
business, NCCS has shifted to adapt to new ventures, such as commercial 
aviation, and found new clients in the manufacturing industry, which has become 
increasingly high-tech. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very flexible," Schultz said. "We make our own software, and we can 
make it do whatever we want." 
</P>
<P>
 NCCS's software packages aren't cheap, typically running about $65,000. For 
that, the customer gets software that operates a five-axis machine -- an 
instrument so flexible that it can manipulate a cutting tool in a fluid motion. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Though more expensive than other cutting machines, the five-axis tool is 
extremely precise, which makes it attractive to manufacturers who need that 
exactness. It is especially popular for aerospace work because its spindle head 
can tilt and swivel, allowing the machines to cut metal surfaces from any 
angle. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie D'Leon, regional sales manager with NCCS, said the company counts among 
its newest clients Egan Industries, a New Jersey maker of plastic mold 
machinery, and Midwest Pattern, a Quincy, Ill., company that makes molds for 
refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, a new customer is Innovation Sports, an Irvine company that 
makes knee braces for athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their software is just the best there is," John Gates, a research and 
development engineer at Innovation Sports, said of NCCS. "It gives me maximum 
control as I'm cutting all the new bits and pieces that go into our braces." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said he once bought costly software from one of NCCS's main competitors, 
a French company, but soon switched back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other software just wasn't as good," he said. "We won't be switching 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 If your Orange County company has annual sales of less than $10 million, we 
would like to consider it for a future column. Call O.C. Enterprise at (714) 
966-7871.

Q & A: ROBERT J. COHEN; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, LEGAL AID SOCIETY OF ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Legal Aid lawyers in Orange County are probably best known for suing local 
officials who try to ban the homeless. That enrages conservatives, many of whom 
oppose the idea of lawyers getting paid by government to sue government. But 
local Legal Aid does a lot of other things for the 15,000 poor people who come 
though its doors each year -- from divorces to going after scam artists who 
prey on the poor. Staff writer Michael Flagg visited the Santa Ana office of 
executive director Robert J. Cohen, 46, to talk about Legal Aid. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What are some of the scams being pulled on poor people these days? 
</P>
<P>
 Let me give you an example: There was one case that started out simple and 
ended up keeping about a third of our office busy. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman came in who was an immigrant from Afghanistan; her husband was shot by 
the Communists. Her father was chancellor of the University of Kabul; she was 
very much a middle-class person. She came to this country after unsuccessfully 
searching for her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 She got a low-wage job, and one of the first problems she encountered was 
buying a car. She didn't have any credit history. But she saw an ad in the 
paper, and she wound up sub-leasing a car. Sub-leasing was a very big scam a 
couple of years ago in this county and across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How did it work? 
</P>
<P>
 People without credit histories would go to brokers, who took in cars from 
people who no longer wanted their leases. The brokers would take what they call 
a down payment, but it was really for their services in matching buyer and 
seller. 
</P>
<P>
 What's wrong with that? The brokers would run off. There were the sleaziest 
people in this business. They'd have a cash flow of a couple hundred thousand 
dollars in lease payments, and they'd run off with it and start a new business 
under another name. Or people who sub-leased the cars would run off, and the 
people whose names were on the lease would be stuck. 
</P>
<P>
 So this lady came to me and said she couldn't even figure out how to make her 
car payment anymore. So I called the bank, and they said the owner had died, 
and they were wondering why the car was still being driven around! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, of course they repo'ed the car right away, and we threatened to sue the 
broker, so the broker kept bringing her nicer cars until eventually he brought 
her a Cadillac. But the repo men would be waiting by her house, and as soon as 
she'd park a car there, they'd take it off. 
</P>
<P>
 There were literally hundreds of people in Orange County who'd encountered the 
same scam. We had a Marine come in who was about to be charged with murder 
because he had let his car go to the auto broker, who'd sub-leased it to 
someone who'd committed a murder in it. We didn't get much help from the police 
because, frankly, they had more important things to do. We got an injunction, 
and we wound up getting funding from the bankers association for our lawsuit. 
Security Pacific even helped the Afghan woman lease a car without any 
subterfuge. 
</P>
<P>
 And the state Consumer Affairs Department drafted legislation that made it a 
felony to sub-lease a car without the consent of the bank, so all this 
confusion cannot inure to the benefit of the sleazy auto broker. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Do you get a lot of these kinds of cases? 
</P>
<P>
 We're not doing that much consumer work these days -- only about 14% of our 
cases. That's because the cases we've handled on behalf of the homeless take up 
a lot of our resources. We'd rather not have to spend those resources that way. 
But we have to because, essentially, what local governments are doing is 
criminalizing poverty when they try to force the homeless to go elsewhere with 
anti-camping ordinances. It's not a crime to be a poor person. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's your budget? 
</P>
<P>
 It's about $4.3 million. Two-thirds comes from the federal Legal Services 
Corp. Most of the rest comes from the state Bar. The federal funds have gone 
up; the state funds went down. So 10 years ago, when our office only covered 
Orange County, we had 17 attorneys. Now we cover southeastern L.A. county as 
far as Compton. Our potential clients have doubled. And we still have 17 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What about lawyers in private practice in this county. Do they do enough pro 
bono work? 
</P>
<P>
 The ones who are doing it are doing it a lot. But it's a small percentage. You 
have something like -- what -- 7,000 or 8,000 attorneys in Orange County now? 
And you have 600 or 700 that volunteer to do pro bono. So most of them don't -- 
one in 10, if that many. And it used to be worse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Are there a lot more poor people than there used to be? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes. And in most places it's growing faster than the population at large -- a 
big jump. My sense is that's true in Orange County too. I know our office got a 
substantial increase in funding from the federal government because the census 
found we had a larger growth in poor people than most areas of the country. In 
1980 our service area encompassed 250,000 people; now it's 350,000. You see 
that kind of jump in the Sun Belt in general. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who are these new poor people? Immigrants? The dispossessed middle class? 
</P>
<P>
 It's all of them. The angriest are those in the process of being dispossessed 
from the middle class. The hardest thing I do is tell them we don't have the 
resources to help them. If you have a meritorious claim or a good defense to a 
lawsuit, you should be able to get legal help. That's the way it is in most 
civilized countries. But we turn away a lot of people. We have people who come 
to us and say: "I'm an American citizen. I have a right to this service." And 
we have to tell them: "No, the way this works is that you have a right to be 
defended if you're charged with a crime. But you don't have a right to access 
the civil courts with an attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On homelessness. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Our streets and our parks should not become our mental institutions. It's a 
medical problem and should be treated as a medical problem -- or else it 
becomes a police problem." 
</P>
<P>
 On city ordinances that try to ban the homeless. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "People in urban areas see the problem day in and day out. They develop 
'compassion fatigue.' They're willing to do anything to get rid of the 
homeless, even if it means violating the law." 
</P>
<P>
 On Legal Aid champion Hillary Rodham Clinton being in the White House. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "After Reagan, we couldn't have a more supportive White House. That's not the 
problem for us now. It's 'How much money will Congress appropriate?' " 
</P>
<P>
 On the future of Legal Aid. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not magicians. If the money's not there, we can't serve all the people 
who deserve help."

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: THIS BULL SHOWS NO SIGNS OF BEING LASSOED 
</P>

 Wall Street is set to close out January with nearly everything going right for 
stocks -- to the continuing amazement of market bears who keep waiting for 
cataclysm. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials finished Friday at a record 3,945.43, up 19.13 
points on the day, after the government's report that the economy in the fourth 
quarter grew at the fastest pace in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow's gain was no fluke: Most broader market indexes also hit all-time 
highs Friday, virtually ensuring a strong finish for the month. The Dow is up 
5.1% so far this month, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up 2.6% and 
the Nasdaq Stock Market's composite index is up 2.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 A January gain is psychologically important for Wall Street, because 
historically the market's trend for the year follows its trend in January. 
Since 1950, an up January for the S&P 500 has presaged a full-year gain, and a 
down January has presaged a full-year decline, in 37 of 44 years -- an 84% 
batting average. 
</P>
<P>
 But the market has far more than the "January barometer" going for it. Despite 
the best efforts of the bears to talk stocks down, the truth is that the 
fundamentals underlying this bull market remain exceedingly healthy: 
</P>
<P>
 * Corporate earnings are robust. Wall Street expected strong fourth-quarter 
profit reports to match the zooming economy, and so far the numbers look good. 
Ben Zacks, whose Chicago-based Zacks Investment Research tracks earnings, says 
61% of reports received through last Monday matched or exceeded expectations. 
Thirty-nine percent were below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pattern is very similar to the previous couple of quarters," Zacks says. 
Overall, Wall Street analysts expect operating earnings for the blue-chip S&P 
500 companies to rise 25% in the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Because stock prices are ultimately determined entirely by underlying 
earnings, the fourth-quarter growth may go a long way toward keeping investors' 
mood positive -- especially as strong earnings lead to rising cash dividends 
that go directly into shareholders' pockets. Indeed, the number of companies 
boosting dividends in 1993 was the highest since 1989, according to Standard & 
Poor's Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 * The inflation outlook keeps getting better. The shocker in the 
fourth-quarter gross domestic product report Friday was that a key inflation 
indicator was far below expectations -- while the economy's growth, 5.9% 
annualized, was above expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The GDP implicit price deflator, a broad-based measure of inflation, rose at a 
1.3% annual pace in the fourth quarter, instead of the 3% rate many economists 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 For a number of reasons, including weak oil prices and extreme competitive 
pressures in many industries, higher prices aren't a part of the story in this 
rejuvenated economy. So long as that's the case, Wall Street has little reason 
to fear that interest rates are poised to rise significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 More investors seemed to embrace that view late last week, as bond yields 
dropped and beaten-down bank and utility stocks roared to life. The banks and 
utilities are classic interest-rate-sensitive issues, which means investors 
sell them when rates are expected to rise and buy them when rates are falling 
or stable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consumer confidence is surging. The bears need to face a simple fact: 
Outside of quake-rattled Southern California, people feel good about the 
economy. That's also increasing their willingness to invest in stocks, which 
pumps more money into corporate America, which in turn increases the likelihood 
of business expansion and further economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "A dash of confidence can go a long way toward boosting growth," notes John 
Lonski, economist at Moody's Investors Service in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer confidence has ebbed and flowed over the past three years, of course. 
But Robert Barbera, economist at Lehman Bros. in New York, notes that the 
current jump in confidence is different in intensity: Consumers not only feel 
optimistic about the future, they also feel good about the present , according 
to a monthly consumer survey by the University of Michigan. That element had 
been missing since 1990, Barbera says. 
</P>
<P>
 What's also different in this economic cycle is the mind-set of those 
confident consumers. They are spending more money, but they are also investing 
more. Stock mutual funds took in a record $14.5 billion in net new cash in 
December, a figure that is likely to be topped in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The aging baby-boomer population has its priorities straight, says William 
Dodge, investment strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. The need to 
save for retirement is taking precedence over spending on things such as 
clothing. Hence, stocks of clothing makers and retailers continue to be 
hammered, as they were in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the boomers are concentrating their spending is on big-ticket items such 
as cars, furniture and household appliances -- necessary purchases that may 
have been deferred as concerns about job security overwhelmed Americans over 
the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 As spending on big-ticket items soars, so do stocks of the beneficiaries of 
that demand, such as auto makers, machinery makers and truckers. (The trucks, 
after all, move the products.) And far from winding down, Dodge and other pros 
believe that this spending wave is only in its infancy. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, we've got a healthy economy with low inflation and a powerful 
predilection on the public's part for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The bears will say it's a sure sign of a peak when so much appears to be going 
right for the market. But they're underestimating the most important force of 
all: momentum. Until the glowing backdrop for stocks changes meaningfully, this 
bull market's steady advance is unlikely to suffer anything more than brief 
interruptions. January's Leaders and Laggards 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street has bet heavily in January on a continuing strong economy in 1994: 
Industrial stock groups have surged while traditionally "defensive" groups, 
such as utilities, have slumped. Here are the biggest winners and losers so far 
this year among 87 stock groups.

 Analyst review: "The prospects for Irvine Sensors depend to a large extent on 
its memory chip stacking technology. They have developed technology for 
thinning memory chips to something like the thickness of Glad wrap, stacking 
and bonding them. They can stack four memory chips in the space of one. It's a 
very sophisticated product and has very promising applications. It could 
replace the hard drives in personal and laptop computers with something the 
size of a credit card. The company's technology is first-rate, but in terms of 
its commercial viability, the company is heavily dependent on the agreement it 
signed with IBM in June, 1992, to produce the short stacks. Samples are just 
coming off the production lines now."

 The Poorman vs. KROQ: Suspended KROQ disc jockey Jim (The Poorman) Trenton has 
filed suit against the station and its parent company, Infinity Broadcasting 
Corp., alleging breach of contract, slander, fraud and copyright infringement. 
The suit contends that by continuing to run the popular late-night show 
"Loveline," which Trenton developed and hosted, the station is infringing on 
his creation. Trenton had been at the station 12 years before his suspension 
August, 1993. He remains under contract with KROQ until November, 1994. Trenton 
had been host of "Loveline" since 1986, along with Dr. Drew Pinsky, but was 
replaced by Ricky Rachtman last November. Trenton's suit was filed in Superior 
Court in Burbank, but attorneys for KROQ are attempting to have the matter 
moved to federal court. A hearing will determine the ultimate venue. MOVIES

 Box Office Bowl: 20th Century Fox's comedy "Mrs. Doubtfire" and TriStar's AIDS 
drama "Philadelphia" were battling it out for first place for the second 
weekend in a row at the nation's box office. "Mrs. Doubtfire" took in about 
$8.1 million and "Philadelphia" about $7.8 million, according to early industry 
estimates released before Sunday's Super Bowl, which traditionally draws 
potential ticket buyers away from movie theaters. Warner Bros.' "Grumpy Old 
Men" was next with $5.1 million. "Blink," the thriller from New Line that 
opened Wednesday, took in $4.6 million. Paramount's "Intersection" grossed $4.3 
million for the No. 5 spot. And Universal's "Schindler's List" is still going 
strong in limited release -- the film took sixth place with $3.5 million.

 Super Houses: ABC's "Home Improvement" took part in the Super Bowl, sort of. 
The hit show is putting together a special episode to help promote Habitat for 
Humanity, the group devoted to providing housing for disadvantaged families. 
Part of the show, which airs March 2, will be shot in homes built as a result 
of the "Super Bowl XXVIII Habitat Blitz Build," which is now completing 
construction on four houses for needy families in Atlanta. Here's the story 
line: Tim challenges his assistant Al to build Habitat homes. But Tim gets help 
from some NFL players including John Elway, Barry Sanders, Kenny O'Brien and 
Bill Pickel as well as boxing champ Evander Holyfield. Al enlists Miss America, 
Kimberly Aiken. President Jimmy Carter, a longtime Habitat supporter, will also

 Bye-Bye, Basehart: After six years in Woodland Hills, the Richard Basehart

The closure had nothing do with earthquake damage, Baer said. . . . In other 
theater news that does have to do with the earthquake, Actors Alley, which was 
to have opened twin productions of "The Male Animal" and "The Audit" last

STAGE; 'PLAYLAND' ELOQUENT, INTENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You have to go back to the days when the agonies of the Vietnam War were 
tearing up the American stage to get an idea of the visceral power of Athol 
Fugard's "Playland" at South Coast Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 And even then, the most-passionate anti-war plays, from David Rabe's macabre 
"Sticks and Bones" to John DiFusco's nightmarish "Tracers," never had the 
eloquent grit of Fugard's up-to-the-minute bulletin on the state of his 
nation's divided soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the stunning ensemble performance of Richard Doyle and Kene Holliday 
in SCR's Second Stage revival of "Playland" is a theatrical experience not to 
be missed -- both for its staggering physical intensity and its raw poetic 
grace. 
</P>
<P>
 With greater currency than ever, this two-character drama addresses the 
question of what comes next in a South African society ruled for so long by 
white racists now that apartheid is being dismantled and the prospect of black 
majority rule is edging into view. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle plays Gideon le Roux, a white army veteran whose recent re-entry into 
civilian life is haunted by grisly memories of combat (especially the 
atrocities he committed) during South Africa's losing Border War against the 
freedom fighters of now-independent Namibia. 
</P>
<P>
 Holliday plays Martinus Zoeloe, the black night watchman of an itinerant 
carnival camped near a small town in the Karoo, South Africa's arid tableland, 
where Gideon has come to celebrate New Year's Eve, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinus also turns out to be haunted by homicidal memories, though from a 
private war he does not regret fighting. A fuming, Bible-quoting believer in 
the hellfire of eternal damnation, he wants no part of Gideon or the honky-tonk 
celebration on the midway hosted by the disembodied voice of "Barking Barney," 
the carnival boss. 
</P>
<P>
 But both men -- each embittered, burdened by guilt and filled with barely 
suppressed rage -- inevitably face off on the dilapidated patch of dirt where 
the shabbily dressed Martinus cooks his supper in a trash can and the nattily 
attired Gideon swigs on whiskey, all against a backdrop of latticework, 
scaffolding and lights suggesting the third-rate carnival rides beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 When "Playland" made its U.S. debut under Fugard's direction in a 1992 La 
Jolla Playhouse production, the critical reception was decidedly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' Sylvie Drake objected to the predictable setup of the confrontation 
("classically obvious") and had even deeper reservations about the ending 
("stubbornly counterfeit"). 
</P>
<P>
 Those problems remain, including two interludes in the action she didn't 
mention that bring the forward motion of this one-act, 95-minute drama to 
momentary halts. (Gideon wanders offstage to the midway not once but twice, 
while a sound collage of Barking Barney doing his version of an American-style 
DJ entertains us with rock 'n' roll oldies.) 
</P>
<P>
 But in SCR's revival, which opened Friday, the furious sweep of the 
performance takes us on an unforgettable roller coaster that ranks with some of 
the best rides that director Martin Benson has ever offered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment Holliday appears as Martinus, spewing curses at the midway 
crew and the offstage revelers, we are in the presence of an actor capable of 
powerful moods and mysterious undercurrents. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he sits alone in sullen dignity, his arms folded across his chest and 
his eyes staring into the dark, or picks up his fighting stick and suddenly 
moves like a warrior, Holliday registers the stoical self-possession of a man 
who has faced the worst and taken up a solitary vigil. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle, on the other hand, evokes a man trying to cover up his desperation and 
defeat. His bottom lip trembles, betraying nerves. His eyebrow twitches. He 
never stops moving, never sits. As the more volatile of the two characters, 
Doyle gives a mercurial performance that can't be praised enough. 
</P>
<P>
 His range alone is astonishing. Doyle can exude the abysmal cynicism of a 
battle-scarred killer and still transform himself into a picture of youthful 
innocence without ever betraying the telltale signs of "acting." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, even if the structure of this ironically titled play seems forced 
and the characters meant as symbols of South African society, Martinus and 
Gideon are written with such fluency that they never have to strain for belief 
as full-blooded people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playland" may not offer the emotional upheaval of its immediate predecessor 
"My Children! My Africa!," a once-in-a-lifetime drama, but Fugard's artistic 
mastery is evident again and well worth the price of admission.

 There was no roar of balls rolling down the old lanes at Mr. T's Bowl, the 
Highland Park alley-turned-bar that was the home Saturday night of the roaming 
club Fuzzyland. Instead, Royal Trux ground out feedback on a stage erected 
above the defunct lanes.Great setting. Not such a great band. 
</P>
<P>
 A group spawned out of New York's experimental noise scene and now based in 
Chicago, Royal Trux plays warped, Stones-style classic rock while donning '70s, 
white-trash fashion. This makes the group a kitschy and extra-cool novelty in 
the indie rock world. 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in skin-tight, tattered bell bottoms and her hair combed over her face, 
lead singer Jennifer Herrema belted out unintelligible lyrics in a Louie 
Armstrong-affected rumble as the band played noisy mutations of classic rock. 
</P>
<P>
 As the songs seemed to slow and speed up like a faulty turntable, the inside 
joke was entertaining -- but wore thin. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicians who were rolling strikes at Mr. T's made up the group Geraldine 
Fibbers, a new L.A. country band featuring Ethyl Meatplow lead singer Carla 
Bozulich. Although Fibbers played only familiar country tunes, the band made 
the songs its own by serving them up with thick and gritty, double-guitar sound 
backed by an aggressive violin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fibbers, also consisting of a stand-up bass and drums, played an 
especially soulful version of "He Stopped Loving Her Today," one of George 
Jones' signature hits, but the highlight was the urgent rendition of Dolly 
Parton's old "Jolene." 
</P>
<P>
 Bozulich's deep and throaty vocals, which usually growl over Ethyl Meatplow's 
industrial dance music, seemed in their element crooning the moody tunes. In 
the maze of new groups with experimental ideas, this one stands out. LORRAINE

OPERA; NEW LEADS IN 'EL GATO' FINALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new torero and a new heroine took the stage for the final performance of 
Manuel Penella Moreno's "El Gato Montes" Saturday at the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Both singers proved dramatically involved and involving, and both, in an 
otherwise previously reviewed cast of the Music Center Opera of Los Angeles 
presentation, responded to the text, to each other and to the rest of the cast 
with realistic complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 Vocally, however, there were some problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Ordonez brought a small and slender voice to the bullfighter Rafael 
Ruiz. He sang with evenness, flexibility and point, making much of Italianate 
catch-in-the-throat expressivity. 
</P>
<P>
 But, although occasionally he rose to large, heroic utterances, he often was 
overpowered by the orchestra (led again by Miguel Roa) and otherwise tended to 
sound constricted at the top of the range. 
</P>
<P>
 Paloma Perez-Inigo acted Solea with mercurial moods, sometimes flirtatious, 
sometimes childlike, often intense in declarations of love. 
</P>
<P>
 She sang with a smallish, dark-toned lyric soprano, which she cannily 
exploited in some pianissimo passages and in shading of the text. Still, her 
very top notes emerged raw under pressure, and elsewhere she displayed some 
unsteadiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, both singers were impressive in negotiating the composer's 
Spanish inflections and contours in musical line with ease and style. CHRIS 
PASLES

COUNTERPUNCH: CRITICISM OF SPIELBERG BRINGS OUT DEFENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some other responses to Robbie Kinberg's Counterpunch, "Spielberg's Still in 
Never-Never Land":  
</P>
<P>
 The film's power was in the personalization of the hideous events, as opposed 
to yet another statistical recitation of horror. At the showing I attended, the 
audience (a full house) sat respectfully silent throughout the entire lengthy 
credit list at the movie's conclusion. . . . The only sound heard was brief 
(hesitant) applause at the showing of the director's name. -- Judy Landau, 
writer, Northridge 
</P>
<P>
 I think a film of this magnitude made in its own context was sorely needed. . 
. . -- Ray Eveleth, insurance benefits specialist, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 It's rather silly to attack a filmmaker for not making the movie you would 
have made -- especially when some exhaustive and very harrowing filmic accounts 
of the Holocaust already exist. If you want a historical account of what 
happened, try to find a screening of "Night and Fog" or rent Claude Lanzmann's 
"Shoah." -- Michael Baber, writer-director-animator-musician, Studio City 
</P>
<P>
 For those of us who are survivors, whether we want our memories revived or 
not, "Schindler's List" from this point forward will define, cinematically, how 
most people will come to know the Holocaust. For me, it is not simply a good 
thing, but a transcendent blessing. -- Abraham H. Foxman, national director of 
the Anti-Defamation League and a Holocaust survivor who was saved by his Polish 
Catholic nanny. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg has done us Jews a service in that his name might bring those who 
don't know about the Holocaust to the theater while also rescuing a deserving 
man from obscurity. -- Russell Brown, senior, Harvard-Westlake High School, 
North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 As the people and events are real, Steven Spielberg was not free to alter 
basic facts and characters, not if he were to remain honest about his effort. 
-- Anne Ling, free-lance editor, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 This great movie will provide the basis for even more insights into this 
tragic story. The fact that one movie leaves important things unsaid is not 
valid criticism. One picture should be judged on how well and truthfully it 
tells its one story. -- Herbert Hafif, attorney, Claremont

COUNTERPUNCH: MALE NUDITY ON FILM: WHAT, NOT EVEN A PEEK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN O'NEILL, Dan O'Neill is a fiction writer, essayist and critic who often 
writes about movies. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recently, I saw what was supposed to be a very erotic, very adult film called 
"Jamon, Jamon." Because this was a Spanish movie, the reviews claimed it wasn't 
filled with the usual prudish hang-ups of American films and actually had a 
healthy, open, natural approach to the subject. The main male character is an 
aspiring matador who, as the jokes keep telling us, is endowed like a bull. 
Since there was female nudity I was expecting at least a glimpse. But no, not 
even a peek. There's even a nude bullfight scene, but incredibly it's done at 
night. Apparently some things cross cultural boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Short Cuts," which features a lot of female nudity at the drop of the hat, 
Huey Lewis' brief flashing of his penis seems almost like an inside joke on the 
squeamishness of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Piano," reviewers told us that Harvey Keitel exposed himself in more 
ways than one. So, when the big moment came and the two leading characters 
could no longer contain their lust, I was expecting some equal opportunity 
frontal nudity, but it was not to be. Then I remembered that Keitel had done a 
frontal nude scene in "The Bad Lieutenant" and had been punished with the NC-17 
rating, which is a financial kiss of death. So, maybe the filmmakers knew what 
they were doing economically, but what were they doing artistically? Aren't men 
as vulnerable as women? When two people are in bed together, why do we only see 
the woman totally nude? Why are we even shielded from the truth when a man 
takes a shower?  
</P>
<P>
 Since the ratings board has psychologists on it, perhaps they can supply the 
deep-seated answer to this fear of the penis. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent reaction of most pundits and commentators to the Bobbitt episode 
was so snickering and childish that it exposed a subject we were totally 
uncomfortable with. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But why is it so verboten? Is this the last vestige of puritanism left in the 
world? If male nudity were allowed on the screen would it trigger an audience 
reaction they couldn't control? Is this a reflection of the male ego, with 
actors afraid they don't measure up? Or is it a new variation on Freud's penis 
envy? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure of the answers. I do know that in 1994, there's no rational, 
adult reason for this behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Future generations are apt to look back on our actions and find them as stupid 
as the pooh-bahs who covered up body parts on Michelangelo's art.

COUNTERPUNCH: 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' A REALISTIC PORTRAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN ROYAL, Susan Royal is the publisher and editor in chief of American 
Premiere Magazine, a film industry trade publication, and has interviewed 
Spielberg on a number of occasions. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robbie Kinberg denounces Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List" ("Spielberg's 
Still in Never-Never Land," Calendar, Jan. 10) as "fodder to historical 
revisionists who insist that the Holocaust never happened." Yet he suggests 
that Spielberg should revise the historical facts about Oskar Schindler and the 
"Schindlerjuden," as they call themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he would prefer that Schindler be portrayed as being smaller than 
he actually was. Liam Neeson, who plays Schindler, is a bit smaller than 
Schindler was, but Kinberg thinks using an actor close to Schindler's actual 
size results in his "deification." Another fact he would like changed is that 
some 300 Jewish women who worked for Schindler miraculously escaped being 
gassed at Auschwitz. Kinberg decries, "How are we to know that gas ever came 
down?" 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know what version of "Schindler's List" Kinberg saw, but in the 
version I saw, human ashes spewed out of a crematorium and fell on the street, 
the cars and Oskar Schindler himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after that scene we see the exhumation of thousands of bodies from a 
mass grave, supervised by madman Nazi commandant Amon Goeth, who complains 
about having to burn the evidence. Does Kinberg suppose that scene will lead us 
to believe that these Jews had died comfortably of old age? 
</P>
<P>
 Kinberg complains that "Schindler's List" is "more about a single Nazi than it 
is about 6 million Jews." I don't recall Spielberg announcing that he intended 
to cinematically document all these atrocities. Toward that end, there are 
already a number of excellent documentary films in existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg made a feature film based on a true story about real people, many of 
whom are alive today. The facts of their lives cannot be rewritten to satisfy 
Kinberg's agenda, as worthy as it may be. One of these survivors, Leopold 
Pfefferberg, struggled for years to get this story told, finally talking author 
Thomas Keneally into doing the research and writing the account. I don't know 
how much he or the other survivors would appreciate Kinberg's suggested 
revisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The film centers on Oskar Schindler because his transformation from being a 
self-absorbed businessman to someone who would risk everything he has -- 
including his own life -- to save 1,100 Jews is fascinating and deserves to be 
told as it actually occurred.  
</P>
<P>
 Kinberg needn't worry about the Nazis being portrayed inaccurately. The Nazis 
in "Schindler's List" are plenty bad. They shoot Jews as casually as swatting 
flies. That this film could possibly serve as "fodder" to the Holocaust deniers 
is preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
 More power to you, Mr. Kinberg, for wanting to expose those who would have us 
believe that the Holocaust wasn't really as bad as it's cracked up to be. But 
please go after the right people. Deborah Lipstadt's book, "Denying the 
Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory" (the Free Press, 1993) 
identifies them. The director of "Schindler's List" is not among them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg knew this film would be scrutinized by everyone from Talmudic 
scholars to your average Spielberg-bashing snob. He could have rested on his 
laurels (not to mention his money) by not attempting to tell this difficult 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did tell it. And with such eloquence and restraint that even his 
harshest detractors (excluding Kinberg) have begrudgingly acknowledged his 
astonishing accomplishment.

PERFORMERS GET WORKOUT IN HEIM'S 'TETE AU CARRE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With enormous theatrical savvy and professional production values, Jacques 
Heim's full-evening performance spectacle "Tete au Carre" polishes and 
popularizes the hyper-athletic, bop-'till-you-drop style of movement theater 
that has become so prevalent locally. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented over the weekend at Highways Performance Space in Santa Monica, the 
eight-part piece took place inside, atop and around a metal jungle-gym 
(designed by Greg Smith) that constantly changed with the addition of curtains, 
ramps, platforms and projection screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers Jennifer Azzarone, Joel Fitzpatrick and Roger Webb also contributed 
to the project, along with eight performers from Heim's locally based Diavolo 
Dance Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Program data translated the title as "physically and mentally beating to a 
point of change." It might be more appropriate, however, to call the piece 
"Circus of the Scars," since it began with surreal sideshow vignettes a la the 
late Alwin Nikolais and then incorporated juggling, feats of balance and, 
especially, group gymnastics in sequences dramatizing societal aggression and 
requiring a high degree of physical risk. 
</P>
<P>
 In one full-company showpiece, everyone raced up a slant-board to the top of 
the set and then dropped -- sometimes face down -- to either a narrow wooden 
beam midway or to the floor below. Exciting? Of course, but when it went wrong, 
as it reportedly did on Thursday, performers have needed stitches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries seemed evident on Friday, but company members frequently looked 
underrehearsed -- and worried. Apart from his clever, gestural modern dance 
commentaries on sexual politics, Heim's choreography depended on the most 
familiar contact-improvisation formulas, and even at its most difficult and 
dangerous, the result often failed to take off either physically or 
conceptually. 
</P>
<P>
 The most successful segments included the inventive mime "snapshots" of the 
prologue, Heim's volleyball game opposite Curtis Hurt (with the fearless David 
Salper cast as the ball), parts of the quartet about male hostility and the 
virtuosic interlude in which composers Juliet Prater and Jean-Pierre Bedoyan 
used the jungle gym as a giant percussion instrument. LEWIS SEGAL

MUSICA ANGELICA PROGRAM ESSAYS EARLY VOCAL MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some music demands to be performed perfectly, or not at all. The angelic vocal 
music of the late Renaissance and early Baroque, polyphonic in structure, pure 
in sound, is a good example. 
</P>
<P>
 Musica Angelica -- an ensemble that offered a program of the vocal music of 
Dowland, Purcell, Monteverdi and Gesualdo at Westwood United Methodist Church 
Friday evening -- didn't quite reach the requisite celestial heights, however, 
and its concert became a kind of listener's purgatory. 
</P>
<P>
 This was very much attributable to the imperfect quality of the singing. 
Though director and lutenist Michael Eagan has brought together nine talented 
singers for the group, they do not yet present a coalesced sound, the precision 
of ensemble and poignancy of communication necessary to make this music bloom. 
Mostly, they just got along, solidly but a bit inelegantly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Musica Angelica's countertenor was ill certainly couldn't have 
helped matters, as Eagan juggled his singers variously to cover the demanding 
gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Musical highlights there were, however, including John Dowland's chattery "Can 
she excuse," with its exuberant confusion of words; Antonio Lotti's 
"Crucifixis," with its chains of suspensions like an audible crown of thorns; 
and Monteverdi's "Come dolce hoggi l'auretta," the sole surviving fragment from 
his opera "Proserpina rapita," gracefully warbled by Samela Aird Beasom, Susan 
Judy and Christen Herman. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagan inserted some of his own early-music inspired compositions into the 
program as well. These ranged from the bright harmonies and slippery chromatics 
of "To my dear and loving husband," for three sopranos and lute, to the atonal 
"Love's Farewell," for countertenor, tenor and baritone: brief, well crafted 
and strikingly textured works. TIMOTHY MANGAN

'CAR 54' TAKES FATAL DETOUR ON THE ROAD TO BIG SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Car 54, Where Are You?" (general release), based on the popular Joe E. Ross 
and Fred Gwynne TV series of the '60s, bombs on the big screen in the '90s. 
Thanks to a relentlessly terrible script by many hands, it's a dumb movie about 
dumb cops that should have remained on the shelf, where it's been sitting for 
over two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gravel-voiced David Johansen stars as Gunther Toody, not exactly Brooklyn's 
finest, who gets a new partner in John C. McGinley's uptight, by-the-book 
Francis Muldoon after Leo Schnauzer (Al Lewis, from the original series) at 
last retires. Amid uninspired nonstop shenanigans -- many loaded with 
heavy-handed sexual innuendo -- there's a nominal plot concerning the nailing 
of a Mafia kingpin, played by Daniel Baldwin as a Robert De Niro impression. 
(In case we don't get this, Baldwin is actually required to refer to De Niro). 
Cop groupie Velma Velour (Fran Drescher) vamps the virginal Muldoon while Toody 
endures shrewish wife Lucille (Rosie O'Donnell). 
</P>
<P>
 These and others -- including Nipsey Rusell, also from the TV series, as the 
precinct's none-too-swift captain -- are game under Bill Fishman's energetic 
direction, but one and all are done in by the dire, dated material. To give 
credit where credit is due, the film, a seamless blend of Toronto and Brooklyn 
locales, has colorful settings, but their authenticity serves only to underline 
the production's synthetic quality. Wonderfully seedy Coney Island is too good 
a backdrop to waste on the film's frenzied finish.

READINESS PAYS FOR HOSPITAL AT EPICENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the tales are told about the Great Quake of January, '94, Bill Pringle 
Jr. and the rest of the crew at Northridge Hospital Medical Center will have 
among the best of all. 
</P>
<P>
 Working in a trauma center at ground zero when the magnitude 6.6 Northridge 
earthquake struck, they hauled babies out of their intensive care unit 
incubators and brought them through wobbly, darkened stairwells to safety, and 
set up makeshift triage centers to treat seriously wounded quake victims in the 
pre-dawn chill of the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pandemonium," said Pringle, an emergency room nurse. "That we were at 
the epicenter and could still take care of people -- it was a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not a miracle. Northridge's seeming luck can be traced to many 
factors: a well-prepared staff, a well-designed building and an earthquake that 
struck in the pre-dawn hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Most significant, the hospital had been retrofitted to meet state regulations 
requiring hospitals built after 1973 to be earthquake resistant not only on the 
outside, but on the inside as well. Hospital officials had reinforced and 
braced the necessary mechanical, electrical and medical gas systems. By 
contrast, hospitals without such reinforcements found themselves unable to 
treat patients, and in some cases having to evacuate them to other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as one in five acute-care hospitals in the state run a "potentially 
high" risk of failing in an earthquake because they do not meet quake 
reinforcing rules, according to the latest state report. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Hospital Medical Center's survival and the response of its staff 
are already being studied by the many experts eager to learn lessons from the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 State scientific teams and government investigators have pored over every 
crack and crevice of the building at Roscoe and Reseda boulevards to determine 
why the hospital stayed operable through such a monstrous pounding while others 
farther away did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts also will be studying how the hospital's preparedness plan and the 
quick and cool staff response allowed hundreds of panicked people to be treated 
for serious injuries starting four minutes after the earth's upheaval. Many of 
those treated for heart attacks, artery lacerations and other serious injuries 
might have gone without life-saving medical aid if the hospital had not taken 
precautions to bolster its infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21 premature infants in the neonatal ICU ward -- including the tiniest, 
Baby Girl Scammell -- could have died had the building and its infrastructure 
faltered even for a short while. Patients in the adult intensive care unit 
would have been at similar risk without operating life support systems, 
hospital officials said. At the other San Fernando Valley trauma center, Holy 
Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, a patient died when the quake knocked 
out power to his ventilator, coroner's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) joined a number of state 
officials who have called for costly earthquake retrofitting of all hospitals 
so they can continue operating when a major earthquake hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Only hospitals built since 1973 need to adhere to special earthquake-resistant 
codes. Fears of astronomical costs resulted in exemptions for older hospitals 
until they remodeled or expanded. Starting in 1983, guidelines requiring that 
internal hospital systems be made earthquake resistant went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts cited the example of Northridge, which with its cracked walls and 
floors nevertheless was running at close to normal within hours of the quake, 
as evidence that retrofitting can make the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proof is in the pudding. . . . The codes do work," said Shell Culp, a 
spokeswoman for the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would think that since these codes have been around for 20 years that 
other hospitals would have brought themselves up to the code. But there isn't 
anything in the law to make them do that," Culp said. "So now they're biting 
it, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hospital Seismic Safety Act was enacted in response to the 1971 Sylmar 
earthquake, which left 50 dead in two hospital collapses. By 1990, state 
officials reported that 21% of the acute care hospitals statewide still had 
potentially high seismic risk. In the zone encompassing Southern California, 
358 buildings housing 18,458 beds would "probably not remain functional," the 
report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials declined to specify which hospitals were rated worst. They 
said such ratings would give an inaccurate picture of how a hospital could 
withstand a major quake -- and hurt their business -- because other performance 
measures were not factored in. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's Seismic Safety Commission has long supported retrofitting and 
pushed for legislation to require it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are essential-services buildings that must be counted on as being 
functional after an earthquake," said spokesman Fred Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary evidence from the Jan. 17 quake indicates that those without 
external and internal reinforcements and bracing fared far worse than those, 
such as Northridge, that had them. At St. Johns Hospital and Health Center in 
Santa Monica -- which according to state officials had not met the quake 
guidelines -- the internal structures held up but some buildings did not. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, it was the failure of necessary internal systems that knocked 
out vital treatment capabilities, said state hospital construction chief Walt 
Stall. 
</P>
<P>
 Serious damage to three Valley hospitals resulted in patient evacuations and 
the loss of nearly 1,000 hospital beds. No one was injured, apparently, in the 
transfers from Holy Cross, the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Sepulveda and 
the county's Olive View-UCLA Medical Center. But experts said such transfers 
can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of Northridge Hospital Medical Center are nearly 50 years old, but the 
entire hospital has been retrofitted or brought up to quake-prevention codes. 
It is steel-framed and made to bend, and is anchored into place by 35-foot deep 
footings. Cabinets and heavy equipment are anchored into wall studs or floors. 
Much of the internal piping and wiring is flexible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do more than is required," said hospital official Neil Humphrey said. 
"People have their script and know what they have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 That script had some glitches, but mostly it went like a well-choreographed 
emergency response ballet. There were many unsung heroes, especially those 
working the graveyard shift. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 4:25 a.m. on Jan. 17 when one of the emergency room staff remarked to 
Pringle about how quiet things were. Six minutes later, as the five members of 
the emergency room skeleton crew chatted, the world turned topsy-turvy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building gave a horrible lurch, an up and down motion, with a roar," 
Pringle said. "Everything that wasn't nailed down was thrown to the floor. Some 
things that were nailed down were too." 
</P>
<P>
 To Danny Goodwin, a central services technician making his rounds, "it felt 
like someone grabbed me by the leg, twisted it and threw me down." 
</P>
<P>
 They were all sure the Big One had hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the staff had dived under desks as heavy medical equipment flew around 
the room in the darkness. When the emergency generators kicked in as 
programmed, six seconds after the thrashing stopped, the staff began preparing 
for what they knew would be an onslaught of the injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Dust, supplies and water were everywhere, and the sprinklers were on. Medical 
equipment lay thrashed and in pieces on the floor, and ripped fluid bags made 
everything slippery. 
</P>
<P>
 Floors and walls were cracked. Seams in the building had pulled apart, leaving 
some four-foot gaps, with one side three feet higher than the other, Goodwin 
said. Yet he managed to bring emergency supplies to the rear ambulance dock. 
There, Pringle, registered nurses Rick Paige, Kathy Biederman and Mike Freeman 
and emergency medical technician John Mackin were using their military 
experience to perform triage. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the staff also was in motion, careening toward the hospital on 
broken roads, or making it to the emergency room from elsewhere in the vast 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle supervised an effort to get chairs, gurneys and supplies to the 
parking lot, where they worked on the most seriously injured with flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
 Within half an hour, emergency room doctors Ed Lowder and Greg Moran were 
giving life-saving care to more than 15 heart attack victims. At least one 
would not make it. Soon, victims of all sorts were streaming in. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had to be flexible," Lowder said. "You didn't know what the next 
situation was going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 It was dark, cold and unsanitary in the parking lot. Some patients were routed 
inside to the trauma rooms, despite the aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses on the fifth-floor nursery had handed off some babies to mothers, who 
took off like fullbacks rushing downfield. The rest were sorted out and tagged 
downstairs in a small corner of the emergency room set up as a "baby room." A 
hundred patients were discharged that day; nurses thought that they, like the 
babies, were safer somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 In the neonatal ICU, tiny infants were untethered from their heart monitors 
and feeding and breathing tubes, swaddled in blankets and rushed down darkened 
stairways. Baby Girl Scammell -- precarious at 4 weeks old, three months 
premature and just 2 pounds, 7 ounces -- had to be held by one nurse while 
another followed alongside, pumping air into her lungs through a rubber bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty women in labor came to Northridge that day, including four who arrived 
at once. Side by side, the four women gave birth in Trauma Room Two, without 
curtains separating them from each other, or from the general bedlam. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were pushing in concert," said obstetrics nurse Tina Boston. "It was 
cuter than heck." 
</P>
<P>
 All four had boys. At least two others miscarried, one after being knocked out 
of her hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 90 minutes of the quake, a command center was established as practiced 
in the hospital's last earthquake drill just two months before. Emergency 
supplies of drinking water, oxygen and diesel fuel for the backup generators 
were brought in, as were prearranged tanker trucks with water for other uses. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its fractured appearance, the building remained structurally sound. By 
the afternoon, patient units closed by the quake were being reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 By last week, life at Northridge was returning to normal, and everything that 
broke was being fixed. Patients were safely back in their beds, including Baby 
Girl Scammell, whose parents lost their home in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl and Laura Scammell came late one evening to see their daughter, whom they 
named Madison. They cooed to her in the enclosed Isolette as nurses smiled and 
scurried about. Carl Scammell caught nurse Donna Grill by the elbow and 
described how he had rushed to the hospital, fearing the worst. Then he thanked 
her for all they had done for his baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how you did it," he told her. "You saved our daughter's life."

CLINTON LAND DREAM TURNS INTO POLITICAL NIGHTMARE; INQUIRY: THE ARKANSAS 
INVESTMENT WAS A BASIC GET-RICH IDEA GONE BAD. BUT TIES TO BANKER WEAVE A 
COMPLEX WEB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many have had the dream of getting rich through real estate, and Bill Clinton, 
then the attorney general of Arkansas, was no different from countless others 
when he and his wife chased that dream in 1978 by becoming partners in a 
venture known as Whitewater Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Wade, the real estate agent who handled sales for Whitewater, said he 
remembers Clinton telling him about his hopes for making money -- and perhaps 
even settling down -- on scenic property in the Ozark Mountains of northern 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really pretty up there," Wade said Clinton told him shortly after the 
Clintons and two friends bought 230 acres in 1978. "Why don't you pick me out a 
lot. I might retire up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Whitewater has turned into a political nightmare for President Clinton 
and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, becoming the subject of a broad federal 
investigation into the their financial dealings during their years in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 The fundamental allegation by critics is that the project was a "sweetheart" 
deal arranged by the Clintons' Whitewater partner, James B. McDougal, to 
provide the Clintons with low-risk profits with little investment by them. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also questions about whether money from McDougal's savings and loan 
was mingled in the venture's accounts to help keep the project afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 There have also been suggestions that political clout from Clinton, who moved 
on to the governorship, may have subsequently helped delay the foundering S&L's 
day of judgment before federal regulators and that Clinton's campaign treasury 
may have benefited from donations from the S&L. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was disclosed in December that Whitewater records were removed from 
the office of White House deputy counsel Vincent Foster after his suicide last 
July -- and then that the papers were kept from investigators -- suspicions 
escalated rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton gave in to subsequent congressional and public pressure and agreed to 
the appointment of a special counsel, who is now beginning to investigate the 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
 The expanding trail of leads and political charges drew much attention to 
Whitewater, the affair, but left Whitewater, the real estate venture itself, 
only more obscure. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Times reporters have interviewed more than 30 people 
associated with the project and reviewed hundreds of pages of records in an 
attempt to reconstruct what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspects of the venture remain tangled in an underbrush of small-time real 
estate deals and missing documents. However, the evidence now available seems 
to offer more support than contravention for two core claims made by the 
Clintons: that rather than rewarding them financially, Whitewater was a 
money-loser and that during the key phases of the project, the Clintons seemed 
to exercise little management control. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the records and interviews document several transactions 
that raise questions about the venture: 
</P>
<P>
 * How much was paid for a prime lot at the development, one that Wade said had 
originally been set aside for Clinton, and where did the money go? 
</P>
<P>
 * What does a loan taken out by Hillary Clinton to help Whitewater indicate 
about her involvement in the project? 
</P>
<P>
 * Is there a connection between the eventual sale of the Clinton-McDougal 
interest in the venture and the messy finances of McDougal's S&L? THE 
PARTNERSHIP 
</P>
<P>
 It was McDougal who in 1978 came up with the idea to cash in on the Sun Belt 
land boom by developing lots for vacation and retirement homes along the White 
River. The waterway is famous for its trout fishing and rafting. Similar 
developments were springing up in Florida, Georgia and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal had known Clinton since they had both worked for Sen. J. William 
Fulbright, the powerful Arkansas Democrat, in the late 1960s. McDougal had 
later made some successful property investments, including some for Fulbright. 
Clinton, meanwhile, had been elected attorney general and McDougal offered to 
help his friend build a financial future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought this was going to be a sure winner," McDougal said of the 
Whitewater project in an interview last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 2, 1978, the Clintons joined with McDougal and his wife, Susan, to 
form a partnership. They paid $203,000 for the land. The couples borrowed the 
entire purchase price from two small Arkansas banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Slightly over a year later, they transferred the land to the newly formed 
Whitewater Development Co., a 50-50 partnership. After making basic 
improvements, they valued the land at $250,000 and named the remote subdivision 
Whitewater Estates. THE LOT 
</P>
<P>
 Wade, a local real estate agent who served as the salesman for the project, 
said he was overseeing the surveying when Clinton asked him to pick out a prime 
location. Bruce Lindsey, a senior White House aide and longtime Clinton friend, 
says the President remembers it slightly differently: that someone suggested 
that land had been set aside for him. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one disputes the lot's appeal. Lot 7 was 27 acres high above the river. 
It was the largest of all the lots and was, in the words of one Whitewater 
customer, "absolutely gorgeous." 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton's interest later waned and sometime in 1980, Lot 7 was placed on 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax stamps, which indicate the sales price in a real estate transaction, show 
that Whitewater sold Lot 7 to Wade on Oct. 14, 1980, for $2,000. The following 
day, Wade sold the property to a Houston doctor, M.T. Bronstad, for $35,000. 
Bronstad said he paid cash for the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The indicated price of $2,000 for 27 of the best acres and Wade's apparent 
windfall have raised eyebrows among those examining the Whitewater matter. Why 
would the Clinton-McDougal development, later to be characterized as a 
money-losing venture, virtually give away a choice property? 
</P>
<P>
 Wade says Whitewater was not shortchanged. "Someone made a mistake on the 
revenue stamps," he said. "I paid $33,000 and only made a little money when I 
sold it to Bronstad." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey said the Clintons have no idea what Wade paid because Whitewater's 
operations were run by McDougal. HILLARY CLINTON'S LOAN 
</P>
<P>
 To stimulate sales in late 1980, the Whitewater partners decided to put a 
model home on one of the lots. Lindsey said McDougal asked the Clintons to come 
up with the money for the house because the McDougals had already paid for 
subdivision improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 16, 1980, Hillary Clinton took out a $30,000 personal mortgage to 
finance the home and acquire title to a Whitewater lot on which to build it. 
</P>
<P>
 The mortgage loan was made by the Bank of Kingston, a tiny institution in 
distant Madison County, Ark., that had recently been purchased by McDougal. 
Whitewater Development could not borrow the money because its only asset -- the 
White River land -- was already pledged as collateral for the current loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton in turn loaned the $30,000 to Whitewater to build the house 
and pay other expenses connected with the development. This also helped 
sidestep any possible questions about a federally insured institution -- the 
Bank of Kingston -- lending money to the personal ventures of one of its 
owners, McDougal. FINANCIAL SQUEEZE 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, the model home was sold and several other parcels of four to six 
acres each were sold for $10,000 to $12,000. The prices were not high, but land 
was moving and revenue was generated to help pay the loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Many early buyers were middle-class people looking for inexpensive retirement 
or vacation property. Among them was Douglas Murdock, a lawyer who now lives in 
Thousand Oaks, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents were investing in the area and it was just a matter of wanting to 
own some land," said Murdock, who paid $11,000 for five acres on the river in 
1981. "I realize that there was a question about whether it was so far out in 
the boondocks that it would never amount to anything, but it was cheap." 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers interviewed said they either didn't know or didn't care that the 
then-governor had a stake in the development. "We heard he was one of the 
owners, but it didn't make any difference one way or the other," said owner 
Maryanne Cammarata, who lives in Summit, Ark. "We just wanted some land on the 
river." 
</P>
<P>
 Most early lots were purchased on installment contracts. Buyers put down 10% 
and made monthly payments for seven years. Whitewater used the revenue to make 
payments on its loans, and the deeds were retained by the banks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arkansas law restricted the interest that sellers could charge on 
installment contracts to 10%. In the early 1980s, as the nation's prime 
interest rate soared above 20%, the Clinton-McDougal partnership ended up 
paying more for its Whitewater loans than it could recover from sales of the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 Then sales dried up too. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of the 44 lots were sold in the first two years, but no sales were 
recorded in 1982. Land records show that from 1982 through 1984, only two 
additional lots were sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Fancher, a businessman in nearby Flippin, was trying to develop a smaller 
piece of property near Whitewater in the early 1980s when he got caught in the 
same squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just stopped coming to buy land and we were left holding the bag," he 
said. "The Clintons got caught in the shorts, like others up here." 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon was repeated across the Sun Belt as projects went bust or 
developers tried to hold on long enough for the economy to change. For the 
Clintons and McDougals, the dream of getting rich was replaced by a dream of 
getting out. SELLING OUT 
</P>
<P>
 A former associate of the Clintons' said Hillary Clinton had been wary of the 
investment from the start, and, as conditions deteriorated, she repeatedly 
urged her husband to end the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't like McDougal and she didn't like Whitewater," said the associate, 
who spoke on the condition that his name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Wade who came to the rescue. Wade said McDougal approached him in the 
spring of 1985 about the unsold lots, saying: "I'm tired of messing with this 
thing. Why don't you just buy 'em?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wade formed a partnership with Russell Webb, a urologist in Mountain Home, 
Ark., and they acquired the 24 remaining lots. In exchange, Wade and Webb gave 
Whitewater a Cessna airplane valued at $35,000 and assumed about $35,000 of 
Whitewater's outstanding loans on the land, according to records and 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey said McDougal later sold the Cessna and pocketed the proceeds as a 
commission for the sale to Wade and Webb. He said the Clintons did not learn of 
the sale of Whitewater's remaining lots until after it was completed in May, 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have questioned whether this transaction was related to other events 
occurring during this period. In April of that year, McDougal held a 
fund-raiser at his savings and loan, Madison Guaranty, that raised $35,000 
toward Clinton's $50,000 1984 campaign debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton, on retainer as a lawyer for Madison Guaranty, 
successfully petitioned the Clinton-appointed state securities commissioner to 
approve a recapitalization plan for the institution, which was weakened by bad 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has asserted that the matters were unrelated, and the 
commissioner, Beverly Bassett Schaffer, has said she showed no favoritism. But 
critics have expressed doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Whitewater continued to be a financial headache. Although the 
lots had been sold, the Clintons and McDougals were still obligated to make the 
payments on the original purchase loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons' tax returns show deductions for Whitewater interest payments of 
$19,021 between 1980 and 1988. Lindsey said the couple's 1978 and 1979 returns 
show $22,000 in interest deductions related to Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the $68,900 that the Clintons say they lost on Whitewater was 
financial contributions to the company that were not tax-deductible, according 
to James M. Lyons, a Denver lawyer who examined the Whitewater transactions for 
the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal told the Associated Press that he believes that the Clintons lost far 
less in Whitewater. He said his "records" showed a loss for them of about 
$9,000. But he acknowledged that his "records" were his memory. POWER OF 
ATTORNEY 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater continued to be a financial problem for the Clintons into the late 
1980s. Occasionally, property buyers defaulted on their purchases and the lots 
were returned to the development company for resale. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade, who was the agent for those lots as well as his own, said completing the 
resales was difficult because of turmoil in the McDougals' personal lives. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal's S&L had collapsed, and he was unemployed, under investigation and 
under psychiatric care for severe depression, according to records. His 
marriage had broken up, and his wife had moved to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't find Jim or Susan, and we had these two lots we needed to sell," 
Wade said. "So I called Mrs. Clinton and asked her to see about getting a power 
of attorney to approve the sales." 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 28, 1988, Hillary Clinton wrote a letter to McDougal asking for a 
power of attorney authorizing her to sell the lots and pay off the bank loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we'll be able to get all that behind us by the end of the year," she 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton's letter has raised questions about whether the Clintons were, 
in fact, passive investors or whether she had taken direct action in managing 
the ill-fated project and is thereby more directly linked to questionable 
dealings at the venture and at Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey said McDougal never returned a signed power of attorney. Wade said 
McDougal contacted him shortly after receiving Hillary Clinton's letter and 
approved the sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons remained partners in Whitewater Development until late 1992, when 
they sold their interest to McDougal for a nominal $1,000. The transaction was 
handled by Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal said last fall that Whitewater was his first money-losing venture in 
real estate, and he regretted the losses sustained by the Clintons. "I wanted 
to help Bill Clinton make some money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But today there is little to show for the development. A handful of mobile 
homes and fishing shacks are scattered across the largely undeveloped land, 
along with a couple of homes. 
</P>
<P>
 John Lauramoore, a carpenter, now lives in one of the homes, the model built 
with Hillary Clinton's money on Lot 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened to Clinton happened to a lot of developers," Lauramoore said. 
"He went in on a land deal to make a buck and lost his shirt."

ISRAEL, PLO MOVE CLOSER TO ACCORD; MIDEAST: ARAFAT SAYS ANOTHER WEEK IS NEEDED 
TO COMPLETE DRAFTING OF AGREEMENT ON PALESTINIAN SELF-RULE. BOTH SIDES INDICATE 
EXTENSIVE COMPROMISES WERE OFFERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization came close to an agreement 
Sunday that would have cleared the way for implementation of their accord on 
Palestinian self-government, but they found that two days of intensive 
negotiations were not enough to resolve the complex issues involved. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres at his 
side, said at least another week would be needed to reach compromises on a 
number of issues and to complete drafting of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many principles have been agreed upon," Arafat said after emerging from eight 
hours of talks with Peres late Sunday. "We are now looking to the drafting . . 
. but (these agreements) have to be drafted accurately to ensure the accord is 
implemented precisely. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, it is better not to hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Israeli and PLO officials declined to disclose details of the 
negotiations, they indicated that both sides made extensive compromises on 
control of the entry points into the Gaza Strip and the Jericho District in the 
West Bank after Palestinians establish their administration there, among other 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peres, pressed to further explain the points of disagreement, replied 
simply, "The drafting." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides were disappointed because they had believed earlier in the day that 
they were within reach of a broad, if still tentative, agreement on the major 
issues that have held up implementation of the accord for the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, again with Peres at his side, had announced, in fact, that he would 
meet with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin this week in Cairo to sign the 
agreement, which would be the next major step toward peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 But the negotiators failed, despite their late evening talks and the mediation 
of Egyptian Foreign Minister Amir Moussa, to agree on a package of measures 
that could be presented to Rabin and the PLO leadership for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is natural and not a surprise," Yasser Abed-Rabbo, a member of the PLO 
Executive Committee, said after the two delegations broke off talks at 
midnight. "Some of the problems are in the details, and some are in the 
substance. Above all, however, is a mutual desire for a very clear agreement, a 
very explicit agreement, because we want to avoid problems in carrying it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Uri Savir, director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, went further, 
describing the negotiating session here as "the best meeting yet" in the 
current series of talks on implementing the autonomy accord, which was signed 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
 But he too said neither side had realized how difficult it would be to settle 
the details of the new agreement once the basic principles had been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 A major problem was Peres' limited authority, according to PLO officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Arafat was ready to commit the PLO to measures agreed by the 
negotiators, Peres said he would have to take them back to Rabin, who found 
himself preoccupied Sunday by a bitter parliamentary debate on Israeli health 
care reforms and unable to focus on the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres acknowledged his need to consult Rabin but promised answers when he 
meets Arafat in Cairo, probably next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat had raised expectations of a major breakthrough in the long-stalemated 
talks when he told the World Economic Forum, an annual gathering of political 
and business leaders here, that he and Peres had virtually resolved the issues 
that have delayed the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and the 
Jericho District. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials on both sides cited major compromises on the issue of border 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has insisted on maintaining total control over entry and exit from the 
two areas to prevent the return of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian 
refugees, to ensure that arms are not smuggled in and to underline that the 
regions are not, in fact, independent. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO has sought to minimize the Israeli security controls, particularly 
Israeli searches of entering Palestinians, and to heighten its own presence 
through the deployment of Palestinian police officers, Palestinian flags and 
other symbols of statehood. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations Sunday also addressed questions about the borders of the 
Jericho District, according to Israeli and PLO sources, and about the 
protection of Jewish settlers, now numbering about 5,000, who will remain in 
the Gaza Strip after the autonomy accord takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly pleased that the lengthy impasse in the negotiations appeared to be 
almost over and that implementation of the autonomy accord would soon begin, 
Arafat thanked Peres profusely for "his positive stance" in the talks here and 
a week earlier in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres replied with praise for Arafat for "his supreme effort to bring our 
peoples together in peace and hope." 
</P>
<P>
 In their search for an agreement after weeks of frustrated negotiations, the 
delegations had put new and modified proposals on the table, enlarging what had 
been almost agreed upon in Oslo and earlier in Cairo until they had what one 
participant described as "a package worth the price." 
</P>
<P>
 Peres, addressing the World Economic Forum, said the negotiations have not 
been easy for either side. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, however, Israel is determined "to make the Palestinian story a 
story of success, a story of good neighborliness, a story of hope for coming 
generations," Peres said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat and Peres, who had mounted the stage hand-in-hand, both appealed for 
international support, economic as well as political, to ensure the success of 
the autonomy accord, signed in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Replying to a question, Arafat said that extremist groups opposed to 
compromises he has made in the negotiations with Israel will probably try to 
undermine the accord's implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 "These fanatic groups will increase in this atmosphere of instability, poverty 
and injustice," Arafat said, saying they will be countered by "justice, 
justice, justice for all of us -- and at the same time, a very strong economic 
base. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Either we can have another Somalia," he said, noting that 58% unemployment in 
the Gaza Strip feeds the unrest there, "or we can have another Singapore . . . 
with the high skills and level of education that we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Peres urged Western governments to provide investment guarantees for their 
companies to undertake projects in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can help us make the Middle East prosperous," he told the business 
leaders, "peace will endure." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the absence of peace continued to fuel violence in impoverished 
Gaza on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Jewish settler was shot and seriously wounded on a road leading to Gush 
Qatif, the largest group of Jewish settlements in the region and the target of 
frequent attacks by armed Palestinian groups opposed to the peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas, which has vowed to fight the accord, 
distributed leaflets taking responsibility for the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Gaza, the armed wing of Arafat's own Fatah group claimed 
responsibility Sunday for wounding three Israeli soldiers in a grenade attack 
on an army patrol in Rafah. 
</P>
<P>
 That attack broke a cease-fire between Fatah and the Israeli army, begun after 
the peace agreement was signed. Many of Arafat's armed Fatah Hawks in the Gaza 
Strip say they will continue to attack the army as long as Israeli forces 
continue to arrest and imprison them.

COLUMN ONE; APARTHEID OVER THE AIRWAVES; BLARING MARTIAL MUSIC AND RACIST 
PROPAGANDA, A PIRATE RADIO STATION RALLIES A DWINDLING AUDIENCE OF RIGHT-WING 
WHITES. SHORT OF ARMED ASSAULT, SOUTH AFRICA'S OFFICIALS ARE NOT SURE HOW TO 
SHUT IT DOWN.

<P>
 As security chief of this nation's first renegade radio station, Pieter le 
Roux is clearly proud of his handiwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Atop a treeless hill, past the roadblocks and armed guards, is a newly dug 
moat. Razor wire bristles on a fence, and gun ports dot a concrete wall beside 
the gate. Inside are two lines of trenches topped with sandbags. Then 
chest-high barricades of sandbags, and a wall of tires filled with dirt, 
protect the broadcast tower and tiny studio. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rebel redoubt isn't quite complete. Squinting in the bright sun, Le 
Roux points at five armor-plated structures in a nearby field. "We've got gun 
towers that will be mounted in each corner," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 A khaki-clad guard with a pistol on his hip scurries up, salutes and asks if 
another journalist can pass the gate. "Never heard of him," Le Roux says. "Send 
him back or shoot him." 
</P>
<P>
 He continues: "If the government attacks this station, they will have war, and 
war with a capital 'W.' We will fight on an economic front; we will fight on 
the labor front; we will fight on the military front. And remember: Our guys 
don't fight for a salary or for a government. They fight for their very 
survival." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to Radio Pretoria, the voice and the symbol of right-wing white 
opposition to black majority government. Spoiling for a fight and beating a 
daily tattoo of martial music and pro-apartheid propaganda, the 4-month-old 
unlicensed FM station has become the rallying point -- if not the last stand -- 
for the dwindling number of white South Africans determined to cling to racist 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapping a longing for the past and a fear of the future, the pirate 
broadcasters -- plus three new copycat stations -- blare a shrill message of 
white supremacy and resistance to democratic change just as apartheid prepares 
to join Nazism, communism and other discredited one-party states in the 
junkyard of history. 
</P>
<P>
 The threats of violence, and the station's refusal to obey court orders and 
government decrees to shut down, have sorely tested President Frederik W. de 
Klerk's government at a time when South Africa is striving to put its racist 
past behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 The government controls broadcasting until a new, independent commission 
regulates the nation's airwaves, after democratic elections April 27-29. 
</P>
<P>
 "Radio Pretoria expects one set of rules to apply to it and another set of 
rules to the other estimated 200 aspirant radio stations" that have applied for 
licenses, Home Affairs Minister Danie Schutte told reporters. "This is not 
acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Short of armed assault, however, no one has figured out how to silence the 
pirate station. And that's just fine with the conservative farmers, housewives 
and commandos who see it as the next best thing to apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we think is happening here is suddenly there's hope," said the 
ever-cheerful chief announcer Anieta Armand, the "Voice of the Volk." "We were 
feeling pushed out and neglected. And then came Radio Pretoria and our people 
had hope again." 
</P>
<P>
 Her people are Afrikaners, the 3 million descendants of early Dutch, German 
and French settlers. They are more than half of the whites here, who make up 
14% of South Africa's 40 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Infused with a strict Calvinist faith, the Afrikaners are united by a harsh 
history and a bitter sense of persecution: beaten by British colonialists, 
despised by the modern world for the enforced racial segregation and 
exploitation of apartheid and, in their view, betrayed by white reformers like 
De Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the legal structure of apartheid has been steadily dismantled since 
1990, many Boers, as the Afrikaners are also called, now see an even more 
insidious chipping away of their culture, language and myths. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Afrikaans, their Dutch-derived language. It became an official state 
language, along with English, in 1925. Hated by blacks as the voice of 
oppression, however, Afrikaans will be one of 11 official tongues in the new 
South Africa. Its use will almost certainly decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Afrikaners already see their language being eclipsed. The local Coca-Cola 
franchise and SA Breweries, the monopoly beer brewer, announced that they would 
stop printing Afrikaans on their cans. The national railway has dropped 
Afrikaans from its tickets. The national anthem, "Die Stem," is sure to be 
replaced. Schools, television shows and businesses are using less Afrikaans. 
Even the new constitution was printed only in English until right-wingers 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
 "Afrikaans is going to be a little kitchen dialect within 20 years," Johan 
Combrink, a professor of Afrikaans at Stellenbosch University, griped in the 
Cape Town daily Die Burger. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the announcement last November that women and nonwhites will be 
eligible to join the Afrikaner Broederbond, an exclusive secret society whose 
members are required to swear fealty to white rule and the "eternal existence 
of a separate Afrikaner nation." 
</P>
<P>
 The society, founded in 1918, once invited as members only well-connected, 
white, Afrikaans-speaking Protestant males. As its influence grew, membership 
was virtually required for leaders in the ruling National Party, church, 
academia, media and law. By the 1960s and 1970s, critics said, the elite 
fraternity controlled much of South African life and was a mainstay of the 
apartheid regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with its influence waning, the group is adjusting to a new reality. 
</P>
<P>
 New members still must speak Afrikaans. But the roll call will no longer be 
secret and meetings may be public. Even the group's name will change. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was time to come out of the shadow and into the light," said Jan Pieter de 
Lange, a former rector of Rand Afrikaans University who recently retired after 
10 years as chairman of the Broederbond. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his successor, Tom de Beer, see a black-led South Africa as an 
opportunity, rather than a death knell, for whites. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may be disillusioned, but fundamentally we have come to terms and said we 
want a solution," said De Beer, who heads a major investment firm. "We want to 
be part of a free-market system and the First World way of doing things." 
</P>
<P>
 And public support for the extremists appears to be fading. 
</P>
<P>
 Witness last month's Day of the Vow, which celebrates the 1838 massacre of an 
attacking Zulu army and is the Afrikaners' most emotional holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-wing leaders had predicted a massive show of force at the Voortrekker 
Monument outside Pretoria. More than 100,000 people had come as recently as 
five years ago. This time there were about 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, emotions ran high. Potbellied men in camouflage fatigues rode horses 
and carried rifles. Khaki-clad women, their faces twisted in hate, marched with 
children under swastika-like flags. Under a tree sat a bearded 28-year-old 
former South African commando with mirrored sunglasses, a ponytail and a 
grinning death's head symbol on his black beret. Race war is inevitable, he 
warned. "It's survival of the fittest." 
</P>
<P>
 But the right wing is hardly healthy. About 60 parties and fringe groups have 
gathered under the political umbrella of the Afrikaner Volksfront. The 
coalition has refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the transitional 
executive council, the new constitution or the coming democratic elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the group has demanded the right to create a "Volkstaat," a white 
state carved out of the new South Africa. It's unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader who is expected to be the 
country's first black president, has offered to allow a vote on a white 
homeland. But he would also retain the right to veto the results. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear what or where the Volkstaat would be. Despite more than a decade 
of debate, most rightist groups can't even agree on the proposed borders or who 
should be allowed to live there. And polls show only a tiny fraction of whites 
would want to move there anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we are still struggling to demarcate or identify an area where 
self-determination can be established," said Carel Boshoff, a right-wing leader 
who has tried to create a racially pure Afrikaner homeland in Orania, 600 miles 
southwest of Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few hundred whites have moved to the desolate desert town since a 
Pretoria businessman bought the property in 1991 and invited other whites to 
move to the promised land. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced the Volkstaat will emerge from the chaos and succeed," Boshoff 
insisted in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the far right will be marginalized in the new South Africa, as the Ku 
Klux Klan and other hate groups are in America, remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, an attempt by 30 armed right-wingers to take over an abandoned 
fort -- an effort to rally the faithful -- ended, instead, in mass surrender 
and humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 But threats of sabotage, terrorism and worse can't be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Afrikaners control the military, police, civil service, power installations 
and other key institutions. Government officials fear providing a flash point, 
such as an attack on the rebel radio stations, that could mobilize the 
extremists among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have the capability to do what they say," warned Dr. Wim Booyse, a 
political analyst and expert on the right wing. "An IRA (Irish Republican 
Army)-style campaign is very possible. . . . What is lacking so far is the will 
and the commitment to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Commitment is not lacking, however, at Radio Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Built on a barren hilltop about 20 miles east of the capital, the station 
began broadcasting with donated records and equipment four hours a day last 
September. It's now on the air 14 hours a day, sometimes more. 
</P>
<P>
 The format is a mix of homey banter, call-in shows and music that ranges from 
"White Christmas" to polkas to German military marches. 
</P>
<P>
 No black artists are played. 
</P>
<P>
 The broadcast radius is about 50 miles, but word has spread far beyond. 
Indeed, Afrikaner fans arrive like pilgrims each weekend to stand guard, dig 
trenches and bring gifts for Armand, the chief announcer. 
</P>
<P>
 Her honey-sweet tones soothe the guttural rasp of Afrikaans. By her microphone 
is a book about the late prime minister Hendrik Verwoerd, the mastermind of 
apartheid. His speeches and other Nazi-like calls for racial purity are played 
frequently. Armand tried to explain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole culture is being threatened," she said. "We feel Christianity is 
being taken away from us. And communism is taking over." 
</P>
<P>
 She grew up on a farm where Afrikaners were "caring" and black laborers were 
"happy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then they came with politics, these politicians, to sow distrust between us. 
Oh, we used to be so happy," she said dreamily. 
</P>
<P>
 "The blacks are a singing people, a dancing people," she said. "We respect 
that. But then you'd see them saying, 'We demand, we demand.' And you get so 
sick and tired that, God, you don't want to see them anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Armand said she wishes only the best for the 28 million mostly poor, 
mostly jobless, mostly illiterate blacks who will be guaranteed basic freedoms 
for the first time, including the right to vote, after decades of Afrikaner 
power and privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want a happy, laughing South Africa again," she said with a smile.

COWBOYS REPEAT BILLS DEFEAT IN DEJA VU BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending a year of upheaval in matters ranging from labor relations to 
expansion, the National Football League staged a football game Sunday that 
proved nothing has really changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys are still champions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo Bills are still chokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys overcame a 13-7 halftime deficit by scoring two of their three 
second-half touchdowns after Bills mistakes, giving them a 30-13 victory in 
Super Bowl XXVIII. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid pageantry and emotion at the sold-out Georgia Dome, the Cowboys became 
the fifth team in NFL history to win consecutive Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 They also extended the NFC's winning streak over the AFC in Super Bowls to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know one thing . . . our mission is now completed," said Emmitt Smith, 
Cowboy running back who added the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award to his 
league MVP award by rushing for 132 yards and two touchdowns. "We came into 
this season with the intent of getting back here and doing the same things we 
did today." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills, meanwhile, cemented their legacy as losers. 
</P>
<P>
 They have tied the Denver Broncos and Minnesota Vikings as the only teams to 
lose four Super Bowls, while becoming the first team to lose four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year in Pasadena, after a 52-17 loss to the Cowboys, they were the first 
team to lose three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 This first Super Bowl rematch was just a glorified instant replay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we get to the big game, we blow up," running back Thurman Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 More specifically, he blows up. 
</P>
<P>
 After hurting the Bills with several mistakes in the previous three Super 
Bowls, including an important fumble early last year, Thomas lost a 
first-quarter fumble Sunday that led to a Cowboy field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, 55 seconds into the second half and with his team leading by a 
touchdown, he made his biggest blunder yet. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Bills driving from their 43-yard line, the ball was stripped from 
Thomas' hands by Leon Lett, the Cowboy defensive tackle who is infamous for his 
own blunders. 
</P>
<P>
 James Washington, the Cowboy safety who said he was playing the game for his 
childhood friends in South-Central Los Angeles, picked up the fumble and ran 46 
yards for a game-tying touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 After the stunning score they ran three plays, punted, then watched as Smith 
accounted for all but three yards on a 64-yard Cowboy drive that resulted in 
the go-ahead touchdown. Smith scored it on a 15-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 In a matter of five minutes and 22 seconds, the Bills had gone from one 
touchdown ahead to one touchdown behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "No offense, but all along we knew we had it won," said Nate Newton, Cowboy 
guard. "All we had to do was get the lead, and we knew they couldn't touch us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys clinched the victory with Smith's one-yard touchdown run on a 
fourth-down gamble with 9:50 remaining. The run capped a 34-yard drive after 
Washington's interception of one of several forced passes by Bills quarterback 
Jim Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kelly completed 19 of 26 passes in the first half for 176 yards, he 
threw for just 84 yards in the second half and again was the loser in a battle 
with younger counterpart Troy Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first year was more disbelief . . . this year was something that we could 
thoroughly enjoy," said Aikman, the first quarterback in history to win two 
Super Bowls in his first five seasons.

AMID QUAKE AID, SHELTER IS ELUSIVE FOR CHRONIC HOMELESS; RELIEF: TEMBLOR RAISE 
NEW QUESTIONS ON THEIR PLIGHT. ADVOCATES COMPLAIN THAT NEWLY DISPLACED TAKE 
PRIORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN and NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<P>
 When homeless activist Len Doucette sought a cot the night after the 
earthquake in a Red Cross emergency shelter in Santa Monica, he was turned away 
because he was homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the federal government distributes emergency housing vouchers to those 
displaced by the disaster, people who were homeless before the Northridge 
earthquake -- including some who have been waiting years for federal housing 
subsidies -- are learning that they do not qualify for shelter assistance 
because they did not have a home prior to the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the growing homeless population and the limited government aid 
ordinarily available, homeless advocates say they are not surprised at being 
left out in the cold. But they are frustrated by what they say is a Catch-22 
situation that dramatizes the impediments the long-term homeless face. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's being said is that the earthquake victims matter and they don't," said 
Alice Callaghan, director of Las Familias del Pueblo, a Skid Row-based 
community service agency. "When the homeless are without food, shelter and 
water -- too bad. But the minute San Fernando Valley residents become homeless, 
we couldn't imagine them making it through a night without portable toilets." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the long-term homeless did not lose any housing -- except for those 
who lived in a handful of homeless shelters shut down because of earthquake 
damage -- the temblor did unleash a host of practical, political and 
philosophical questions concerning their plight. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading government officials say it is simply a matter of solving one problem 
at a time. Besides, they say, without a swift response to the quake emergency, 
the chronic homeless problem could be exacerbated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is impossible to solve every problem in the entire metropolitan area under 
the guise of earthquake relief," said Housing and Urban Development Secretary 
Henry G. Cisneros during a news conference last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (must) act expeditiously on the earthquake or there will be a new class of 
homeless people who become homeless as a result of the earthquake," Cisneros 
said. "And unfortunately, many of those are going to be families if we don't 
act strongly." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica homeless activist Ron Taylor counters that the government and 
social service agencies are engaging in a form of segregation by treating the 
pre-quake homeless differently than the quake-made homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "HUD, FEMA, they're all doing a great job," he said. "But what I see here is 
that they are separating citizens. Do you really lose your citizenship because 
you've lost your house (prior to the quake)?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the temblor, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has sprung 
forth with disaster assistance for displaced renters and homeowners, regardless 
of their incomes. The FEMA aid includes individual cash grants of up to $12,200 
for emergency provisions, two-month rental subsidies for renters and 
three-month rental subsidies for homeowners. By late Thursday, FEMA had issued 
8,917 rent checks totaling $27.6 million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD has made 10,000 temporary Section 8 housing assistance vouchers available 
to low-income earthquake victims -- subsidizing a portion of their rents for up 
to 18 months. They will receive these temporary certificates while more than 
40,000 city of Los Angeles residents remain on a waiting list compiled four 
years ago for a different type of Section 8 assistance, this one providing 
long-term housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got 80,000 applicants back then and we've been working that list down ever 
since," said city housing authority spokesman Marshall Kandell. 
</P>
<P>
 Days before the quake, Cisneros announced that the city and county of Los 
Angeles, and Glendale and Long Beach, would be the sites of the nation's second 
"Homeless Initiative" and would receive a significant increase in aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no amount was specified, Washington, D.C., the first recipient, was 
awarded $20 million over three years. However, the funding is but a single step 
in solving the massive problem, homeless advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a report prepared for the Los Angeles City Council placed the 
pre-quake countywide homeless population at 80,000. While many are alcoholics, 
criminals or mentally unstable, recent studies have estimated that as many as 
5,600 families are homeless at any one time in Los Angeles, including 10,700 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County has only 10,000 shelter beds for the homeless, 2,000 of 
which are only available in cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the homeless have little political power, it is not surprising that 
their problems fester in the wake of the quake, advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think that it's business as usual," said Jeff Dietrich, a 23-year 
worker for the Los Angeles Catholic Workers. "The voters who vote are going to 
get the money. The homeless do not vote so they're not a viable constituency." 
</P>
<P>
 USC geography professor Jennifer Wolch, co-author of "Malign Neglect," a study 
of the homeless in Los Angeles, says the problem goes beyond the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of Americans feel that in one way or another, people who are homeless 
for reasons other than a natural disaster are somehow implicated in their 
situation," she said. "In a natural disaster, it's obvious no individual has 
any kind of culpability for their situation. That makes a difference in terms 
of how people respond." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolch said that cash grants or housing subsidies similar to those offered 
earthquake victims would not solve the problems of every long-term homeless 
person. But there is little difference, some experts say, between quake victims 
who had been living paycheck to paycheck and some members of the homeless 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 "Various studies suggest about one-third of the homeless population is working 
either in day labor, regular full-time employment or part-time jobs," Wolch 
said. "A significant portion of this population, were they to be more stably 
housed and provided with support, could probably do OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake struck, few complaints have come from the long-term homeless 
as they have watched federal disaster programs swing into operation and 
National Guard-run tent cities and Red Cross shelters sprout up across the Los 
Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in Santa Monica, where rights of the homeless are a key municipal 
issue, acting City Atty. Joseph Lawrence said his office has received daily 
reports from homeless people turned away from a Red Cross shelter in the Santa 
Monica Community College gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Len Doucette was the first, Lawrence said. He had been told of the shelter by 
Lawrence at a City Council meeting the day after the quake. Deputy City Atty. 
Marty Tachiki gave Doucette a ride to the shelter and witnessed him being 
turned away for lack of a permanent address. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, officials of the Santa Monica chapter of the Red Cross insisted that 
Doucette's experience was an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Lawrence said the organization has been open to the concerns of 
his office about discrimination. Moreover, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles 
chapter of the Red Cross said the organization does not discriminate against 
the chronic homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Red Cross shelter director John Keema confirmed Friday that the 
policy in his shelter at the Santa Monica gym has been to demand IDs and to 
refer the long-term homeless to social service organizations elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ask for an ID and we have asked for some proof or indication of 
residence," he said. "The Red Cross policy is that this shelter is here . . . 
to help people displaced because of a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why the shelter is open to people who are afraid to return to their 
habitable homes while the homeless are referred elsewhere, Keema said: "I don't 
want to respond to that." He added, however, that the shelter has allowed about 
28 long-term homeless residents who "slipped through" the registration system 
to remain indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Doucette, who publishes a newsletter for the homeless, said government and 
social service agencies are frequently "concerned about people being caught in 
a natural disaster. But those caught in a political, social and economic 
disaster aren't even treated as human beings."

THE TIMES POLL; DAMAGE, NOT ANXIETY, KEPT MOST IN SHELTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Severe damage to their homes -- not mere nervousness about their safety -- 
prevented the vast majority of earthquake victims stuck in emergency shelters 
and tent cities from returning to their residences, The Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 70% of the predominantly poor and Latino population housed in a 
network of emergency housing sites countywide fled homes that had been 
condemned, or suffered serious damage, the poll found. Only about one in five 
said their primary reason for not returning home was that they felt unsafe and 
nervous there, or feared aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings, drawn from a major Times survey conducted Thursday through 
Saturday in more than 30 shelters and tent cities across the county, run 
counter to a notion that has become engrained in Southern California earthquake 
folklore in recent years: that Latinos are more reluctant to return to 
residences after a major temblor. This fear is often attributed to experiences 
with major quakes in Latin American countries, where less stringent building 
codes routinely make structures more vulnerable to powerful quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that Latinos remaining at shelters were generally no more 
likely than shelter residents overall to cite nervousness about the safety of 
their homes as their primary reason for staying in a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the poll found is people are in these shelters because they have to be 
there," said Times Poll director John Brennan, who supervised the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 While news media images of the poorer minorities stranded in tent cities and 
school gymnasiums have come to symbolize the quake's human toll, Brennan noted 
that an apparently far larger group -- what he terms the "invisible quake 
victims" -- found refuge with relatives and friends across Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate countywide telephone poll by The Times last week found that about 
6% of adults -- which could equate to hundreds of thousands of residents -- 
have someone staying with them who was displaced by the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll of shelter residents is based on 581 interviews conducted in English 
and Spanish at emergency housing sites from the Santa Clarita Valley to Santa 
Monica. Although it is not possible to calculate a precise margin of error for 
the survey, the poll provides the most comprehensive portrait to date of the 
6,000 quake victims who remained in shelters while the survey was conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 At the peak, before The Times conducted its survey, the shelters and tent 
camps housed more than 15,000 people. Their reasons for leaving sooner -- 
whether they took up residence with friends and family, went back into their 
own homes or found new quarters, or were so unnerved that they left the region 
altogether -- cannot be measured. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that the shelter residents were predominantly minorities, 
younger people, renters, and skilled and semiskilled workers with very low 
incomes. Fifty-eight percent were Latino, 23% white, 14% black and 2% Asian 
American. Forty-six percent of those surveyed -- including three-fourths of 
Latinos -- are not U.S. citizens. The poll found that few shelter residents are 
new arrivals and that the majority have lived in Southern California six years 
or longer. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of those in shelters said they had jobs when the quake struck, and 
about one-third continued working after moving into emergency housing. More 
than half of the workers were either unable to go to work or lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, those staying at shelters appear to have been hit the hardest by 
both physical damage to their homes and psychological aftereffects of the 6.6 
temblor, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-two percent said their homes suffered shattered windows, cracked or 
broken walls or worse, the poll found. By contrast, a Times poll last week 
found that just 10% of respondents countywide -- and more than one in three 
within five miles of the epicenter -- suffered similar damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, among shelter residents 39% said they suffered "severe" 
psychological aftereffects, such as sleeplessness, an unusual fear and 
edginess. The countywide poll last week found 15% of adult respondents reported 
such aftereffects, including 31% who suffered major damage to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 On the positive side, government relief programs appear to be reaching the 
needy quake victims at the shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Fully 60% of adults in the shelters said they have received emergency housing 
vouchers, or have applied and are waiting for them to arrive. Nearly half say 
there is a good chance they will relocate to housing of their own within a few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings seemed to clash with the fears of some housing experts and urban 
planners, who believe that many of the poor forced from their homes by the 
quake will end up permanently homeless. However, a sizable minority, 37%, said 
their chances of obtaining their own housing soon were not good. 
</P>
<P>
 Even among those who remain stuck in shelters, the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, the lead entity in distributing aid and emergency housing 
grants, receives high marks. Nearly 7 in 10 tent city and shelter residents say 
they approve of the way FEMA has handled the disaster response, a more 
favorable rating than the agency received in last week's countywide Times poll. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the clearest contrasts to surface in the survey involved ethnicity, 
families and the shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Among whites, 75% of those staying at the sites had no children with them, and 
59% were alone. Among Latinos, 80% had their children with them, and just 11% 
were alone. THE TIMES POLL: Life in the Shelters 
</P>
<P>
 A Times poll of 581 earthquake shelter residents finds that damaged homes -- 
more than just jittery nerves -- have forced them into the encampments. Almost 
half say they have a good chance to get housing in the next few weeks. Shelter 
residents are predominantly young, poor and Latino; most have lived in Southern 
California for more than two years.

U.S. AID TO RUSSIA FARMERS FAILS TO MAKE IT TO THE SILO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Viktor S. Kuzmin, one of Russia's pioneering private farmers, had a brave new 
idea: Break the state grain monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials approved, and in September, Kuzmin and 12 other farmers in 
the southern Russian region of Saratov were given a no-interest loan to build 
grain storage and milling facilities that would allow them to market their own 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 But what happened next bears out some U.S. policy-makers' suspicions about the 
fate of American aid to Russia: The Russian bureaucracy -- and its new 
commercial partners -- keeps most of the aid from reaching the new private 
sector it is meant to nourish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got snookered," said Brian M. Foster, an Iowa dairy farmer who heads the 
Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance (VOCA) agricultural program in 
Russia. "That's the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 Bureaucratic and banking delays at the Russian Humanitarian Commission, which 
administers foreign aid, kept Kuzmin from receiving his money for five months, 
while inflation shrunk its ruble value from the equivalent of $336,000 in 
September to $219,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Humanitarian Commission instructed Kuzmin to open an account at Megapolis 
Bank, a private commercial bank with branches in Moscow and Saratov. He said 
Megapolis also required him to close his accounts at another Saratov bank and 
transfer the money to Megapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Kuzmin said, the Megapolis branch in Saratov told him that before he 
could draw on the money, he would have to purchase -- through Megapolis -- 
insurance for the equipment he intended to buy with the American loan. The 
insurance premium would cost more than 10% of the loan, Kuzmin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is corruption!" Kuzmin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is blackmail!" fumed Foster, whose agency supported Kuzmin's project. 
</P>
<P>
 Anatoly I. Shvedov, chairman of the Megapolis board of directors in Moscow, 
denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Humanitarian Commission imposed conditions on the loan to prevent misuse 
of the money, he said. But Shvedov had not heard of the 10% demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "What insurance?" Shvedov asked. "Why 10%? If there are any complaints about 
our bank in this respect we will sort it out." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States spent about $1 billion on agricultural aid to Russia in 
1993. A team from the U.S. Inspector General's Office is expected to arrive in 
Moscow today for a six-week audit of where the food and the money went. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit follows allegations of profiteering on U.S. agricultural aid by the 
Russian bureaucracy. The complaints began reaching Washington as early as last 
spring, even as American farm commodities were still being loaded onto ships 
bound for Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $1 billion in aid, about $700 million was used to buy U.S. commodities 
and about $300 million was spent to ship them to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 As the food arrives in Russia, the Humanitarian Commission sells it at auction 
and gives part of the proceeds to the Russian treasury. The commission is 
supposed to give the rest of the money in grants to social services, health 
care and agricultural projects, such as Kuzmin's, that are meant to develop 
private farming and food processing. 
</P>
<P>
 The money for such grants should total an estimated $29.5 million once money 
from auctions held in December arrives, said the commission's executive 
director, Georgy K. Maltsyn. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the first auction in August, the Humanitarian Commission has 
distributed $8.5 million, its records show. Of this, $882,000 has been spent on 
agricultural projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither U.S. nor Russian officials could specify how much of the proceeds from 
the original $700 million in commodities was supposed to go to the treasury, 
how much was to be distributed by the Humanitarian Commission and why the share 
given to grants appears to be so small. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows where it all went?" Foster asked. "But it did not support the 
development of market structures." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Congress members have also questioned the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the current Russian Humanitarian Commission is another public 
relations disaster waiting to happen," wrote Timothy J. Penny (D-Minn.), 
chairman of the House subcommittee on foreign agriculture and hunger, in 
September. "If the U.S. government does not diligently monitor the distribution 
of commodities and funds, it will be impossible to maintain congressional 
support for additional assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saratov story is not encouraging. It suggests that the very Establishment 
that Kuzmin is trying to circumvent -- the state grain monopoly, 
Roskhlebprodukt, and its allies -- is working closely with the Russian agencies 
assigned to administer the American aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Farley, a VOCA staffer who attended a number of the auctions in Saratov, 
said the sales were poorly advertised and most of the bidders were regional 
branches of Roskhlebprodukt. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia does have a handful of private grain traders, but they were apparently 
not invited to some of the auctions. The commodities sold at rock-bottom 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was definitely collusion," Farley charged. At a poultry auction in 
December, Farley said, only three buyers showed up. The chicken sold for 
one-third the Russian market price, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials knew the commodities would not be sold at world prices, but why 
were they sold at below Russian market rates? 
</P>
<P>
 Needy Russians did not benefit -- the agencies that serve them receive some of 
the auctions' proceeds, so lower profits reduce their share. Saratov's 13,129 
private farmers didn't benefit either, as the cheap sales only depressed prices 
for their products. 
</P>
<P>
 So who benefited? The same commercial companies with ties to the Humanitarian 
Commission appear to have made money from the sale of the American commodities 
and from the distribution of the proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Farley, the Humanitarian Commission had an agent in Saratov that 
arranged the grain auctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, Povolzhye-S, received a 5% commission, she said. Povolzhye-S is 
also a shareholder of Megapolis Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Povolzhye-S "is a firm we have been in cooperation with from the beginning," 
Megapolis Chairman Shvedov said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said distribution of Kuzmin's money has been delayed because the farmer has 
been unwilling to comply with terms aimed at preventing misuse of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, the commission's Maltsyn called the farmer "a criminal" and a 
manipulator who hoped to use the American loan as collateral for bigger 
financial schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to explain the accusation, Maltsyn said the farmer had put a 
non-functional telephone number and a wrong address on his grant application. 
Kuzmin said he moved his offices, and getting a phone took some time. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Maltsyn and Shvedov remarked bitterly in interviews that Kuzmin had 
complained about them to his American patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Business in Moscow -- even the aid business -- is dangerous these days. 
Maltsyn's well-tailored Italian-style suit hides the gun he wears to work each 
day, and an aide strolled the Humanitarian Commission office with a holstered 
gun strapped over a sweat shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Maltsyn explained that part of his job is to certify humanitarian aid 
shipments arriving at Russian customs. 
</P>
<P>
 He told of an incident in which he suffered "a certain unpleasantness" after 
he refused to certify as humanitarian aid a shipment that clearly wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 For similar reasons, Kuzmin wanted to pick up his aid grant from a Moscow bank 
instead of getting it in small-town Saratov. Bank accounts are not very secret 
in Russia, and Kuzmin feared that when a big deposit arrived in Saratov, local 
extortionists might come calling. 
</P>
<P>
 As of last week, Kuzmin said he had access to only a quarter of the money 
approved for his project via the Megapolis branch in Saratov. The rest will be 
doled out as Kuzmin shows that he is spending it for the grain-storage 
equipment and materials approved in his grant application, Shvedov said. 
</P>
<P>
 The farmer will not receive interest on the money -- though he could have 
earned a 170% annual interest rate during the five months since his grant was 
approved. Instead, while his money sits waiting to be spent, it will continue 
to depreciate by the rate of inflation, which hit 900% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Kuzmin's money probably isn't sitting idle. Russian commercial banks 
are lending money at 200% per year and more. The longer it takes Kuzmin to get 
his money, the more his bankers earn -- and it is the bankers who will judge 
whether Kuzmin is using his loan appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kills me is the interest on the money," Farley said. "You have no 
evidence, but it's obvious to anyone who has lived here that they're lending 
the money out in between at commercial rates." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuzmin worries that if the delays continue, he will have to scale down the 
size of the grain storage facility planned by the 13-farmer Golden Grain 
cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
 In Soviet days, the state collected all the grain at harvest time and shipped 
it off to huge central storage facilities. Now collective farms are being 
privatized, but they are still forced to sell to Roskhlebprodukt at 
artificially low prices. If not, their grain will rot before they find a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuzmin argues that if reform is to succeed in Russia, it must begin with a 
free market for affordable food. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuzmin sees little progress: "Nothing is happening. Reforms are still being 
obstructed."

LEADER OF IRA POLITICAL WING ISSUED U.S. VISA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration issued a visa Sunday to Gerry Adams, leader of the 
political wing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army, overriding a 
two-decade-old policy that had barred him from the United States because of his 
links to terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House statement announcing the decision said President Clinton 
believes that permitting Adams to attend a conference in New York this week 
"will advance the cause of peace in Northern Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the visa, Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal 
political front, may remain in the United States for only 48 hours and must 
stay within a 25-mile radius of the Waldorf Astoria, the posh mid-Manhattan 
hotel where the conference on Northern Ireland will be held Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The conditions also prohibit Adams from engaging in "direct or indirect fund 
raising" while he is in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House said Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, acting on the recommendation of 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, issued a waiver of the U.S. law denying 
visas to anyone connected with the IRA or other terrorist groups. Adams remains 
subject to the statute, the White House said, and will not be eligible to visit 
this country again without another waiver. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department signaled a softening of its policy toward the Sinn Fein 
leader last week when it offered to give Adams a visa if he would renounce 
terrorism and endorse the Northern Ireland peace plan issued Dec. 15 by British 
Prime Minister John Major and Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 After a meeting Friday with U.S. Consul General Val Martinez in Belfast, Adams 
went partway toward meeting the American conditions, although he stopped short 
of endorsing the Major-Reynolds plan. Sinn Fein has said it will agree to 
participate in the peace process only if Britain agrees to some changes in the 
formula. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't advocate violence," Adams said Friday. "It is my personal and 
political priority to see an end to the IRA and an end to all other 
organizations engaged in armed actions." 
</P>
<P>
 He explained that he would agree to disband the IRA, but only after British 
troops are withdrawn from Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the White House described the statement as "constructive." It added 
that Adams "unreservedly condemned three bomb threats on Jan. 27 in San Diego 
reportedly claimed by the Southern California IRA." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the British government objects to giving Adams such a visible public 
forum in the United States, the Administration came under strong pressure from 
backers of the conference, sponsored by the National Committee on American 
Foreign Policy, to permit Adams to attend. Former Secretary of State Henry A. 
Kissinger is honorary chairman of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Irish American members of Congress, including Sens. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.), Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and 
John Kerry (D-Mass.), urged the Administration to give Adams a visa in light of 
the progress toward peace in Northern Ireland represented by the Major-Reynolds 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Sinn Fein in Ireland and the United States were jubilant that 
Adams would be given a visa after having been turned down eight times over the 
last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, Martin Galvin, a spokesman for the Irish Northern Aid Committee, 
which raises funds for IRA causes, said the policy of keeping Adams out of the 
United States "was a damning admission that the British feared an open debate 
in the United States about their rule in (Northern) Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said Sunday that the purpose of his visit is to brief Irish supporters 
on the current peace moves and to learn the views of Irish Americans on the 
subject, Reuters news agency reported from Dublin.

WILSON FINDS ALLIES ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT FUNDS; POLITICS: COMMITTEES OF THE 
NATIONAL GOVERNORS' ASSN. APPROVE RESOLUTIONS CALLING ON U.S. TO PICK UP THE 
TAB FOR SERVICES PROVIDED TO UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS.

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson enlisted his colleagues Sunday in his crusade to compel the 
federal government to pick up more of the costs for services provided to 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Committees of the National Governors' Assn. approved resolutions calling on 
the federal government to assume the costs of providing illegal immigrants with 
emergency medical care and education, as well as the tab for incarcerating 
those convicted of felonies. The states now bear most or all of those costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and the governors of Florida, Texas, New York and Illinois -- all among 
the states with the largest populations of illegal immigrants -- are scheduled 
to meet today with senior Clinton Administration officials to press their case 
for more aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Clinton did not create the problem; the President inherited the problem 
like all the rest of us," Wilson said. "But we are asking that he exercise the 
leadership that we think necessary to help move the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Sunday, Wilson all but slammed the door on a potential bid for 
the 1996 Republican presidential nomination, even if he wins reelection in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he would commit to remain in office through 1998 if reelected, Wilson 
said: "God willing and the voters willing, I would look forward to serving that 
term and doing it with more dollars and fewer disasters than I have experienced 
in the first one." 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigration has emerged as a major issue in Wilson's effort to win 
that second term. Since August, he has repeatedly accused the federal 
government of failing to take sufficient steps to control the border. He has 
also blamed a substantial portion of the state's fiscal distress on the costs 
of providing services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials have largely viewed Wilson's complaints as an effort to 
shift blame for the state's problems from Sacramento to Washington. But the 
issue escalated recently when Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat, also 
pressed for greater reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, states pay as much as half the costs of emergency medical care for 
illegal immigrants through the Medicaid program; Wilson estimates such services 
cost California at least $400 million annually. Also, the U.S. Supreme Court 
has required the states to educate the children of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has authorized payments to states to help with the 
costs of incarcerating illegal immigrants convicted of felonies, but no funds 
have been appropriated. 
</P>
<P>
 These intergovernmental fiscal concerns -- as is typically the case at 
gatherings of state officials -- dominated the governors' meeting Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrying about the impact on their own budgets, the governors took aim at a 
regional prison proposal included in the crime bill the Senate passed in 
November. Under the bill, the federal government would build 10 new regional 
prisons, but only allow states access to them if they reformed their own 
sentencing rules to require that prisoners serve 85% of their time. In 
California, prisoners typically serve half their sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing earlier complaints from state legislators and correctional officers, 
the governors charged that the costs of the so-called "truth-in-sentencing" 
provision -- the heart of the Republican contribution to the Senate bill -- 
would greatly exceed the savings they could expect from moving prisoners into 
the regional prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a reaction by federal politicians to their need to talk tough on 
crime," Oklahoma Gov. David Walters said. "If this happens, it is going to be a 
boondoggle." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has not taken a position on the regional prison proposal, 
but several key White House advisers have said they prefer providing grants 
directly to the states rather than constructing the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 On welfare reform, several governors expressed concerns about the potential 
costs of the Administration's proposal, which is expected to include a two-year 
limit on benefits to most welfare recipients, but then provide public 
employment if they cannot find private sector work. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters, joined by Wilson and Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina, 
supported the two-year limit but said it should not be conditioned on a 
guarantee of public employment. "We are never going to reform the system if we 
accept that (guarantee) as a precondition to time-limited benefits," Walters 
said.

LAWMAKERS JUMP ON '3 STRIKES' BANDWAGON; CRIME: SEVERAL BILLS THAT WOULD PUT 
HABITUAL CRIMINALS IN PRISON FOR GOOD GAIN SUPPORT IN THE LEGISLATURE. ALSO, AN 
INITIATIVE DRIVE IS WINNING SIGNATURES. BUT SOME DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ARE 
SKEPTICAL OF ITS IMPACT. 
</P>

<P>
 Sponsored by a father whose daughter was murdered by a parolee, and favored by 
an electorate angry about crime, the "three strikes and you're out" initiative 
is winning political support up and down California. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren gives it his "unqualified support." Gov. Pete Wilson 
endorses it. So do Democratic gubernatorial hopefuls Kathleen Brown and John 
Garamendi. Legislators are rushing to pass legislation mimicking the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal justice experts say the proposed initiative would create the harshest 
sentencing system in the nation for habitual criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 But in courthouses around the state, district attorneys are skeptical that the 
initiative will do what its backers claim, and many prosecutors are opposing 
the popular idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The root of all of this is fear," said Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. 
"People are fearful for the safety of their loved ones and themselves, and 
angry that people who commit these crimes get out of prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Garcetti believes habitual violent criminals must be locked up, he 
opposes the three strikes initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The way the initiative is worded, Garcetti said, a three-time felon could be 
sent to prison for life without committing any violent crimes. A juvenile age 
16 who commits two residential burglaries and is sentenced in the juvenile 
system would amass "two strikes," Garcetti said. In the extreme, the same 
person caught passing a bad check for $500 a few years later could be looking 
at a sentence of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot afford it," Garcetti said. "We're going to have a tremendous jury 
backlash. Jurors are going to require more proof than (the current standard of) 
'beyond reasonable doubt.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the Assembly Committee on Public Safety, then controlled by 
liberal Democrats, refused to pass a three strikes bill carried on behalf of 
Mike Reynolds, whose daughter was killed by a repeat felon outside a Fresno 
restaurant in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds resorted to an initiative, essentially turning the legislation 
sponsored by Assemblymen Bill Jones (R-Fresno) and Jim Costa (D-Hanford) into 
the proposition heading for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Using much of his life savings, along with donations from the National Rifle 
Assn., the Gun Owners of California, and the California prison guard union, 
Reynolds set out to gather the required 385,000 valid signatures of registered 
voters to place it on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal grabbed attention across the state when Richard Allen Davis, a 
habitual criminal on parole, was arrested for the murder of Polly Klaas, a 
12-year-old Petaluma girl kidnaped from a slumber party while her mother was at 
home. If the initiative had been law at the time of his earlier crimes, Davis 
would not have been on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days after Davis' arrest, so many people called Reynolds' 800 number 
that the entire 800 system became jammed in Fresno, where he lives. On some 
days, 20,000 people have signed his petitions. Reynolds, who has gathered more 
than half the necessary signatures, said he will drop the initiative only if 
the Legislature approves and Gov. Wilson signs the Jones-Costa bill. 
</P>
<P>
 With the signature-gathering continuing, the Legislature has had an apostasy. 
At its first hearing of 1994, the Assembly Public Safety Committee revived and 
approved the Jones-Costa bill endorsed by Reynolds, and passed four other 
pieces of "three strikes" legislation, each of which would put three-time 
losers behind bars for life. They differ primarily in the kinds of crimes that 
are counted for each strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly Ways and Means Committee approved the same five bills last week, 
even though no fiscal analyst knows how much they would cost -- except that it 
will be in the billions. The full Assembly is set to vote on the measures 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the bills would dramatically toughen the laws under which California 
judges sentence habitual criminals, and keep repeat felons like Davis in prison 
for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, California has had a statute that provides for life sentences for 
habitual criminals. But the law is so narrow that fewer than 50 people have 
been sentenced under it. An aide to Garcetti could find no instances in which 
it had been imposed on a repeat felon in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The statute says judges can impose life sentences on felons who inflict "great 
bodily injury" on their victims, but only if the criminal has served two 
previous prison terms for violent felonies. That combination of crimes and 
sentences is rare. 
</P>
<P>
 California ranks 17th among states in its rate of imprisonment and has the 
largest prison population in the nation -- 120,000. The Little Hoover 
Commission, a government watchdog group, reported recently that 43% of the 
state's inmates are violent offenders, down from more than 60% in the 1970s. At 
the same time, the number of felons in prison for burglary and drug offenses 
has risen sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds' three strikes initiative proposes to imprison for life people who 
commit violent or serious crimes, which are enumerated in the Penal Code. They 
include crimes such as murder, rape, arson, child molestation, some property 
crimes such as residential burglary, and some drug offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of felons who would fall into the initiative's net is not known. 
But the initiative's proponents say several thousand criminals a year could 
receive life terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections is working on an estimate, but is not expected 
to complete its work for another week. The legislative analyst estimates the 
expense at several billion dollars in prison construction, plus additional 
costs of incarceration that over time could reach more than $1 billion 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 In another part of the initiative, Reynolds seeks to double the sentences of 
people who commit a second serious or violent offense. He said the two-time 
loser provision may be the initiative's most important component. Its goal is 
to keep violent second-time offenders behind bars until they pass age 40. 
Statistics show that criminals become less violent once they reach middle age. 
</P>
<P>
 But the public focus of the initiative is on three-time losers. Criminals who 
have been convicted of two serious or violent felonies would face a virtual 
lifetime behind bars if they commit a third felony. The initiative pegs the 
sentence for three-time losers at 25 years to life, or three times the current 
prison term for the third felony, whichever is greater. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative says the third crime may be any felony, though Reynolds said 
prosecutors would not be compelled to seek life sentences against people who 
commit minor crimes on a third offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "District attorneys will make the legislation work, no matter what," said 
Fresno County Dist. Atty. Ed Hunt, who supports the initiative. If a crime is 
minor, he said, "You don't have to file it as a felony." 
</P>
<P>
 For three-time losers, the initiative would mean a return to the system of 
indeterminate sentencing in which felons are given open-ended terms of up to 
life in prison and must win release from parole boards. The Legislature did 
away with most indeterminate sentences in 1977 when it passed the determinate 
sentencing system, which set specific terms for almost all crimes other than 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 At a minimum, someone sentenced to life under the initiative would serve 20 
years. Reynolds says most three-time losers would die in prison, or spend 
virtually all their lives behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents believe repeat felons will demand jury trials if they face life 
sentences. In San Mateo County, 45 prosecutors tried 85 jury trials in 1993. 
Dist. Atty. Jim Fox estimated that under the initiative, 400 people a year 
could face life terms in his county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at judicial gridlock," Fox said, adding that he would need 
more than twice the number of attorneys to handle the new work. Given that 
criminal cases take precedence over civil lawsuits, he said, "the civil system 
as we know it will no longer exist." 
</P>
<P>
 California's proposed initiative borrows the name from the three strikes 
initiative passed by voters in Washington state last November. But unlike the 
California measure, Washington's initiative requires that three-time losers 
commit one of 25 "most serious crimes" before receiving life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is a step up from (Washington's) three strikes," said John 
Carlson, a radio commentator in Seattle and sponsor of Washington's measure. He 
estimates that 50 to 70 criminals a year will be sentenced to life under 
Washington's new statute. Washington prisons house about 11,000 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida may have the most widely used statute aimed at habitual criminals. 
Prosecutors use it 2,000 times a year, said James Austin, executive vice 
president of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency. Of the 55,000 
inmates in Florida prisons, 15,000 have life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 As an alternative to the initiative, the California District Attorneys Assn. 
is backing a bill by first-term Assemblyman Richard K. Rainey (R-Walnut Creek). 
A former sheriff of Contra Costa County, Rainey fashioned a bill that would 
impose sentences of life or life without parole for violent and serious 
habitual criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) is pushing a separate bill that would 
impose life without parole on people who commit a second crime against 
children. Felons who are convicted of a third violent felony also would receive 
mandatory sentences of life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Placentia) has a less detailed proposal. It simply 
states that people who commit a third violent felony shall be sentenced to life 
without parole. In the upper house, Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) and Sen. 
Phil Wyman (R-Tehachapi) have bills identical to the initiative and the 
Jones-Costa bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainey's measure appears to have the most legislative support. It would impose 
sentences of life in prison without parole on criminals convicted of a third 
violent felony. It also would impose life with the possibility of parole for 
someone who commits a serious felony as a third offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are only talking about the most violent people in society -- the people we 
have not been able to turn around and who have proven they are going to 
continue to commit violent crimes," Rainey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainey estimated his bill could result in the imprisonment of perhaps a few 
hundred to a few thousand habitual criminals annually, although no detailed 
analysis has been done. Had Rainey's bill been law, it would have kept Richard 
Allen Davis, as well as the killer of Reynolds' daughter, off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal justice experts, meanwhile, remain skeptical that more prisons will 
have much impact on the overall crime rate. The number of people in California 
prisons has quadrupled since the 1970s, but the crime rate has remained 
relatively unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts say the emphasis should be placed on diverting young people from 
gangs and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin at the Nation Council on Crime and Delinquency warned that the three 
strikes movement could end up worsening the crime problem by forcing the 
government to take money from prevention programs to pay for prisons. The three 
strikes measure also could result in the incarceration of aging felons who 
often are of little threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "While there may be moral justifications for locking up offenders, 
imprisonment appears to have little impact on the amount of crime experiences 
in local communities," Joan Petersilia, a criminal justice expert at the RAND 
Corp., wrote last year. 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that much predatory crime is committed by juveniles too young for 
prison, or by young adults unlikely to be sent to prison for most first-felony 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 People under age 18 account for a fifth of the population but 30% of the 
arrests for the seven most serious crimes. Statewide, 19% of the homicide 
arrests in 1992 were of juveniles under age 18, and 16.6% were of young adults 
age 18 or 19. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hall of Justice in Los Angeles, Garcetti supports Rainey's bill but has 
doubts that any three strikes measure will dramatically cut crime, unless there 
is more help for troubled youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we are willing to go after youngsters at a much earlier age," Garcetti 
said, "the three strikes initiative and building all the prisons in the world 
is not going to make this a better place to live. We have to restore hope, 
especially for our ethnic minorities. . . . Three strikes is needed. But if 
that is all we're going to do, we truly are spitting in the wind." 'Three 
Strikes' Proposals 
</P>
<P>
 There are at least half a dozen proposals being offered to impose life 
sentences on three-time losers. Each targets people who commit violent or 
serious crimes, which are defined in the California Penal Code. 
</P>
<P>
 * Violent felonies include murder, mayhem, rape, child molestation, a felony 
in which a defendant uses a gun, a felony in which a defendant inflicts great 
bodily injury, robbery in a home, some arson, use of a bomb, kidnaping and 
carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 * Serious felonies include residential burglary, robbery, attempted murder, 
assault with intent to rape or rob, grand theft of a gun, assault with a deadly 
weapon against a police officer and selling, giving or offering heroin, 
cocaine, PCP or methamphetamine to a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MAJOR PROPOSALS 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the proposals and the series of crimes that would make a 
defendant subject to a 'three strikes' penalty:  
</P>
<P>
 THREE STRIKES INITIATIVE 
</P>
<P>
 * First offense: Any serious or violent felony. 
</P>
<P>
 * Second offense: Anyone convicted of a second serious or violent felony must 
be sentenced to twice the prison term now in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 * Third offense: Anyone convicted of a third felony, whether or not it is 
serious or violent, would be sentenced to three times the term or 25 years to 
life, whichever is greater. There is no requirement that the first two stem 
from separate prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Juvenile offenses: Serious or violent felonies committed by youths 16 or 17 
count as strikes, even if the juvenile was not tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ASSEMBLY BILL 971 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblymen Bill Jones (R-Fresno) and Jim Costa (D-Hanford) 
</P>
<P>
 * Identical to the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ASSEMBLY BILL 1568 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard K. Rainey (R-Walnut Creek) 
</P>
<P>
 * First offense: Any serious or violent felony. 
</P>
<P>
 * Second offense: Imposes 10 years more in prison beyond the current sentence 
for a second violent felony, and five more years for a second serious felony. 
</P>
<P>
 * Third offense: Life without parole for anyone convicted of a violent felony, 
or anyone convicted of a serious felony if the first two were violent. Life 
with possible parole for anyone convicted of a serious felony. 
</P>
<P>
 * Juvenile crimes: Not counted as strikes unless the juvenile was tried as an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ASSEMBLY BILL 167 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) 
</P>
<P>
 * First offense: Any violent or serious felony, excluding burglary and 
furnishing drugs to a minor. Requires additional job training and education, 
and intensive parole supervision upon the felon's release. 
</P>
<P>
 * Second offense: Life without parole for anyone convicted of a second violent 
crime against a child under the age of 14, including molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Third offense: Life without parole for criminals convicted of third violent 
and serious felonies, excluding burglary and furnishing drugs to a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Juvenile crimes: May be counted as prior felonies.

NUNN WARNS OF RESTRICTING CHINA TRADE; DIPLOMACY: THE GEORGIA DEMOCRAT TAKES 
NOTE OF HUMAN RIGHTS. BUT HE SAYS BEIJING IS NEEDED TO HELP COUNTER NORTH 
KOREAN NUCLEAR THREAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trade restrictions against China because of its human rights record are "too 
heavy a weapon" when the United States needs China's help in stopping the North 
Korean nuclear threat, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to understand here the stakes are very high," the chairman of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee said on NBC's "Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's keep the pressure on human rights, but that is not our top priority. 
Our top priority has to be in that region of the world to prevent 
proliferation, to prevent the nuclear arms race." 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn said China's backing is crucial in the event the United States asks the 
United Nations to impose economic sanctions on North Korea for refusing to 
allow inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think using total cutoff of MFN (most-favored nation trading status) is too 
heavy a weapon, particularly when we have the other stakes in northeast Asia, 
as we've just mentioned with North Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration says it will not renew MFN status, which gives 
China the low tariffs enjoyed by most U.S. trading partners, when it comes up 
for review in June if Beijing does not make significant progress toward 
improving its human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, after a meeting with the Chinese 
foreign minister in Paris last week, acknowledged that China has taken some 
steps to improve its human rights record but said more needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Administration in recent weeks has also indicated that it wants 
to avoid a trade war with China that could jeopardize billions of dollars in 
American sales to China and undermine Chinese cooperation in stopping North 
Korea from developing nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
 National Economic Council Chairman Robert E. Rubin said last week that while 
the United States must keep leverage on human rights, ending the link between 
human rights and trade "is a very good objective to shoot for." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about a report that Japan is close to developing its own nuclear bomb, 
Nunn said that Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa summed up his 
country's nuclear policy to him in Tokyo 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will not develop a nuclear weapon no matter what the North Koreans do," 
Nunn said. "But what we have to realize, though, is that this is what I 
consider an interim, temporary position and they have the capability and could 
develop nuclear weapons very rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn also said he did not agree with the State Department's expected plan to 
retain Strobe Talbott as special adviser on Russia and the other former Soviet 
republics once Talbott, nominated to be the new deputy secretary, is confirmed 
in his new position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strobe Talbott is a good man, but to try to do both those jobs is too much," 
Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the United States should continue providing aid to Russia for specific 
investment and nuclear dismantlement programs. But, "I think we also have to be 
a little bit more muted in our economic advice," he said. "I'm afraid that the 
things that are going wrong now in Russia are being blamed too much by the 
Russian people on America."

PRO-RUSSIA CANDIDATE TAKES EARLY LEAD IN CRIMEA VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MYCIO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian nationalist Yuri Meshkov became the first elected president of 
Ukraine's Crimean republic Sunday on a politically explosive promise to join 
the strategic Black Sea peninsula with Russia, early returns showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Meshkov has retreated in recent days from the position that Crimea 
should formally secede from Ukraine and become part of Russia, his election is 
likely to stir nationalist passions in both countries and raise the odds 
against Ukraine's promised surrender of its nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 With one-third of the ballots counted, election officials said early today 
that Meshkov, a 45-year-old lawyer, was winning 70% of the vote in a runoff 
against Crimean Parliament Speaker Nikolai Bagrov, who favors Ukrainian rule of 
the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Long a geopolitical prize and balmy seaside playground, Crimea was seized by 
Russia from the Turks in the 18th Century and transferred to Ukraine in 1954, 
when both countries were part of the Soviet Union. Ethnic Russians still make 
up 68% of its 2.5 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1991 Soviet collapse, Russian nationalists have campaigned to regain 
the fleet and the peninsula, raising ethnic tensions among Russians, Ukrainians 
and Tatars in Crimea. Four political figures were assassinated during the 
two-month election campaign, including a fleet officer and two Tatar leaders 
who opposed Russian rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters leaving the polls Sunday suggested that Meshkov had won not only by 
appealing to fellow Russian nationalists but also by capitalizing on general 
discontent over Ukraine's soaring inflation. He promised that life would be 
better in alliance with relatively prosperous Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been little doubt about the winner since the first round of the 
election two weeks ago, when Meshkov outpolled Bagrov 2 to 1 in a field of six 
but fell short of an absolute majority. Bagrov was hurt in the runoff by his 
Old Guard Communist image. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest uncertainty of the runoff was Meshkov's exact position on Crimea's 
political status and what would happen if he tried to change its status. While 
Russian leaders kept silent, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk warned on Jan. 
20 that he will overrule any move to redraw Ukraine's borders. 
</P>
<P>
 After some waffling, Meshkov said Crimean voters should decide their future in 
a referendum March 27, when Ukrainians elect a new national Parliament. He said 
the question to voters would be: "Are you for an independent Crimean republic 
in a union with other states?" 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the candidate further clarified his position as he voted in the 
company of six bodyguards. He said his earlier calls for secession were "simple 
talk for the voters" and that he favored only a currency union with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no confrontation," he said. "We will not break away from 
Ukraine." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Meshkov's foes believe that he will assert de facto independence from 
Kiev, tempting a forceful showdown in which the Russian-dominated Black Sea 
Fleet would come to Crimea's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "For six months, we'll have a war of laws, with Crimea adopting laws and Kiev 
rescinding them," said Vitaly Fesenko, a Ukrainian political activist in 
Crimea. "Then we might have a civil war." 
</P>
<P>
 Fesenko doubts that Ukrainian leaders will prevail. "We've sent them dozens of 
appeals to stop what's happening down here, and they've done nothing," he said. 
"We feel betrayed."

 Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, leader of Russia's nationalist opposition, said 
Sunday that his party would consider any North Atlantic Treaty Organization air 
strike against Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina to be tantamount to a declaration of 
war against Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "As leader of the main opposition party in Russia, the party that won the 
elections, I want to warn all governments of Western countries that bombing any 
towns in Bosnia means declaring war on Russia," he told a news conference 
during his visit to Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky renewed calls for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the 
former Yugoslav federation. He also said international sanctions against 
Belgrade should be lifted.

 Explosives and gunfire erupted at polling centers in Dhaka during local 
elections Sunday, killing at least two people and wounding 200. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters cast ballots for mayors and city council members in Dhaka, Chittagong, 
Rajshahi and Khulna, the four largest cities in Bangladesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the wounded were shot, doctors at hospitals said. Election officials 
were among the wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting was suspended at eight places in Dhaka, the capital, after police fired 
tear gas and clubbed activists who had attacked the polling centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The government deployed 17,000 police and paramilitary troops in Dhaka and 
13,000 security forces in the other three cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The two people were killed when activists for Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's 
party attacked polling centers in Dhaka, opposition leader Sheik Hasina Wajed 
said at a news conference.

DEFENSE CHIEF PICKED BY PANEL TO LEAD ALGERIA 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A secretive army-backed committee named Algeria's hard-line defense minister 
as president Sunday, tightening the military's control of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The High Security Council named Lamine Zeroual to a three-year term.He takes 
office today, succeeding a five-man, military-backed committee that took power 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The new president is supposed to be a transitional figure who will lead the 
country back to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeroual, a 53-year-old retired general, has a reputation for espousing 
hard-line policies against Islamic radicals. He said in a speech Jan. 16 that 
he hoped for a "political solution" to Algeria's crisis, but insisted that 
Muslim militants "must renounce violence forever." 
</P>
<P>
 A national conference last week was to have chosen the president but failed 
after all major political parties boycotted the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 All were protesting the exclusion of the Islamic Salvation Front, the banned 
fundamentalist group that has waged a two-year insurgency against the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the front's apparent victory in elections two years ago that prompted 
the military to step in, oust the government, cancel the elections and ban the 
front. Since then, about 3,000 people have died in the insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeroual's powers will include being head of the military and being able to 
declare a state of emergency.

AMERICAN ALBUM: LEGOS, THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF LIFE BEYOND MIT; PLASTIC ROBOTS 
DO BATTLE ON AN AUDITORIUM TABLE. STUDENTS WILDLY CHEER. AND RECRUITERS KEEP 
WATCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Wastoid! Wastoid! Wastoid!" 
</P>
<P>
 That strange cheer rose from a standing-room-only audience inside the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Auditorium 26100 as two small robots 
made of multicolored plastic Legos tangled on a table at the front of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems almost comical that some of the nation's brightest engineering 
students could become so intensely involved in a game using a common toy. But 
MIT's annual 6.270 Lego competition is anything but child's play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lego is deceptive," said Lynn Andrea Stein, assistant professor of 
computer science at MIT. "These students are really doing something that is 
state-of-the-art robotics." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in the eight years since the 6.270 Lego competition began here, 
educators have come to see the contest as a remarkable breakthrough in the 
field of technical education, because it combines all of the elements of a real 
engineering project. 
</P>
<P>
 "This contest offers the students practical, real-world experience in a short 
amount of time," said Janet Snyder, a Motorola Inc. engineer who assisted in 
running this year's competition. "These Lego robots are the same as any big 
industrial machine. It has everything they will encounter in industry." 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps even more important, the 6.270 competition is fun . 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Yishai Lerner of Beverly Hills, Benjamin Caldron of Stockton and 
Mihir Shah of Dover, Del. -- the winners of the 1994 competition, held last 
week. The trio of 19-year-old engineering students built a robot -- nicknamed 
Wastoid -- that not only performed better than 50 other entries but also won by 
defying the traditional wisdom about the safest way to approach the 6.270 Lego 
contest, which this year was based on a pirate theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, Wastoid was a showoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the other robots, which approached their assigned tasks in a cautious 
and deliberate manner, Wastoid boldly crossed into its opponent's territory, 
picked up a sponge representing a pirate's treasure chest and hurled it high 
into the air -- something no other robot had attempted to do in the entire 
history of the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Wastoid's crowd appeal was unmatched. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience chanted Wastoid's name whenever it was time for robot No. 49 to 
enter another round of combat. And when Wastoid masterfully survived the final 
skirmish with robot No. 19, the cheers and applause were deafening. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was our goal," Lerner said. "We were sitting up late one night, trying 
to figure out what to do, and someone asked: 'What would happen if we threw 
it?' It was different. We didn't think we would win, but we knew everyone would 
like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pankaj Oberoi, the principle organizer of the 6.270 competition, said he had 
warned Lerner, Caldron and Shah that they were making a big mistake by breaking 
one of the sacred principles of engineering known as KISS: Keep it simple, 
stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them the first day: 'You've got too many gears. It'll never work,' " 
Oberoi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, even though Wastoid had never successfully tossed the sponge 
prior to the final competition, it worked flawlessly in the decisive matches. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6.270 Lego competition (the number 6.270 is sort of an inside joke among 
MIT students) was the brainchild of an undergraduate student and continues to 
be an entirely student-run activity, even though participants get academic 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of January, each team of contestants receives a box full of 
Legos, a microprocessor, sensors and other devices needed to build an 
autonomous robot. Working long hours -- often through the night -- they produce 
their entries in little more than three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest's 130 participants were chosen by lottery from 340 entries. In 
addition, according to Oberoi, the percentage of robots that actually work has 
increased every year, reaching 90% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides winning a plaque, a $50 gift certificate and the admiration of the MIT 
students, the victors achieve a lucrative status in the wider world of 
technology. In fact, Microsoft, one of several corporate sponsors (including 
Motorola, Polaroid and, of course, Legos) has been known to recruit from the 
ranks of the 6.270 contestants. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, students now see the contest as so important to their future that they 
continue tinkering with their robots until the moment the competition starts. 
Their hands tremble with excitement and fear as they carefully bring their 
creations to the tables in the front of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half the people lose because they are so nervous they push the wrong button," 
Oberoi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of the losers are never forgotten. It seems that everyone involved 
in the 6.270 contest remembers how a 1993 contestant was so overjoyed when his 
robot finally worked that he shook it hard -- and it fell apart.

 SUPER BLOWOUT: Jack Kemp, the former NFL quarterback and perennial 
presidential prospect, threw a long, scoring bomb in the fund-raising arena 
during Super Bowl festivities in Atlanta. Nearly 300 affluent supporters eager 
to see Kemp dive into the White House end zone in 1996 handed off $5,000 apiece 
for the right to party all weekend with the chatty Republican. . . . They got 
to attend a reception Friday night, and Saturday afternoon they rubbed 
shoulders with NFL legends Johnny Unitas, Jim Brown and others at a lunch. That 
was just the first quarter. There was a big entertainment show Saturday night, 
a pregame lunch Sunday with ex-Washington Redskins Coach Joe Gibbs and the 
Georgia Tech band and cheerleaders, tickets to the Bills-Cowboys clash and a 
postgame buffet. . . . Sal Russo, a spokesman for Kemp's presidential political 
action committee, wouldn't say how much he hopes to clear after expenses. But a 
guess starts at a hefty $300,000.

 HERALDED HOOSIER HEEDS HIMSELF: Top Indiana Republicans believed that they had 
just the recipe to help fellow Hoosier Dan Quayle win the '96 GOP presidential 
nomination. Sources say they urged the former vice president to run for 
governor of his home state before bolting off in pursuit of the White House. 
That way, his friends reasoned, Quayle could fashion a reputation as a 
competent executive and shed the rap that he's a lightweight. As an 
alternative, they suggested, he could create the same impression by serving for 
a while as the high-profile chief executive of his family's influential 
newspaper chain, Central Newspapers Inc. . . . So far Quayle has spurned the 
counsel of the Indianians. Instead of shooting for the open governor's seat in 
1996, he is already plotting his run for the presidency.

 LOBBYISTS' LAMENT: Lobbyists are moaning over sharply reduced tax breaks for 
lobbying expenses. Congress last year ordered a crackdown on deductions for 
meals and entertainment -- and for corporate executives' trips to Washington to 
strategize with their lobbyists. The Internal Revenue Service has just issued 
interim regulations, and many small lobbying operations fear that they will be 
pushed out of business. . . . An agricultural lobbyist figures big clients will 
be willing to keep paying the bills despite reduced tax breaks because 
"lobbying is such a small part of their total budget. But the small- and 
middle-size outfits, for whom lobbying is an optional thing, may decide it 
ain't worth it now." . . . A California lobbyist said he hasn't changed his 
ways, although he pays a price. "I used to deduct 80% for schmoozing" with 
lawmakers and aides, he said, "but now it's only 50%, and I have to eat it. It 
ticks me off, but it's a major part of my business."

 COVER-UP: The government is buying dozens of wigs to advance the cause of 
science. They are offered to people who volunteer for tests of experimental 
anti-cancer drugs at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. . . . 
In many clinical trials, the chemotherapy causes total baldness. So volunteers 
are given a voucher to present at Amy's Hair Studio nearby. Owner Amy Cordaro 
charges the government $200 on a wide selection of wigs regularly priced at 
$550. . . . "It makes people feel good about themselves and, therefore, easier 
for them to join our trials," an NIH official said. Virtually all the women 
take up the offer, but only about half the men do. PAUL HOUSTON and SARA FRITZ

MANDELA OFFERS WHITES A VOTE ON A HOMELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The African National Congress offered Sunday to let pro-apartheid whites vote 
for their own homeland -- but said a black government would retain power to 
veto the results. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC President Nelson Mandela appealed to militant whites to accept the offer 
and avert bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the right-wing Afrikaner Volksfront angrily rejected the proposal and 
vowed to establish its own homeland by force if necessary to avoid living under 
black rule. 
</P>
<P>
 That militant stance could be fatal, Mandela told a crowd of several thousand 
squeezed into a stadium in the black township of Khuma. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know how to fight," he said, referring to the ANC's 30-year guerrilla war, 
suspended in August, 1990, after the white government introduced reforms to end 
apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ANC proposal, whites could vote April 27 on whether to establish a 
whites-only homeland. The ballot would be separate from national elections 
April 27-29 for a new, multiracial government. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly elected government would have final say on the homeland issue, a 
condition unacceptable to white extremists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to appeal to the right wing not to do anything that would drag our 
country into a conflict that would kill many innocent people, black and white," 
Mandela said. "We are appealing to the right wing not to talk about violence so 
easily. We know what war means."

HEALTH REFORM MIGHT WIPE OUT STATE EMPLOYEES' PLAN; INSURANCE: CALIFORNIA 
OFFICIALS LOBBY CONGRESS TO PRESERVE A SYSTEM THEY SAY PROVIDES QUALITY HEALTH 
CARE AT LOW COST. EVEN THE ADMINISTRATION PRAISED IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's health benefits plan for public employees, often hailed by the 
Clinton Administration for providing quality care while curtailing inflation, 
would be wiped out if the President's health care reform package is approved by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The 926,000 active and retired public employees, together with members of 
their families, are enrolled in a single statewide system. But they would be 
divided among new regional health alliances under the Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most efficient programs in the country would be eliminated," said 
Assemblyman Sal Cannella (D-Modesto), who is visiting Washington today to lobby 
members of Congress to preserve the state system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything the President wants to do in the nation, we're doing successfully 
in California," said Cannella, chairman of the Assembly's pension committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton health blueprint requires that all government workers be included 
in the regional health alliances, along with most workers in private companies. 
The President originally proposed that firms with more than 5,000 workers could 
remain independent, but Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen recently suggested 
that the threshold could be much lower, an effort to attract business backing. 
</P>
<P>
 But on enrollment of government employees, the Administration has refused to 
compromise despite repeated appeals from California officials, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The health benefits program is a division of the California Public Employees' 
Retirement System, which runs the nation's largest public pension fund. There 
are 850 government units enrolled in the health program, ranging from the 
California public employees' group -- with 626,000 workers, retirees and family 
members -- to the two workers at the Antelope Valley Mosquito Abatement 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS negotiates on their behalf with health maintenance organizations and 
insurance companies. It has required all firms to offer a standard package of 
benefits and has held total spending increases to just 1.4% for the current 
program year. Firms in private industry, by contrast, have been facing 
double-digit hikes in their health costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly very proud of what we've been doing," said William Crist, 
president of CalPERS. "This year we expect to have another demonstration of the 
power of tough bargaining and large-scale purchasing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crist will join Cannella here today in trying to persuade members of Congress 
that CalPERS and other successful public-employee health programs should be 
allowed to remain intact. They want an exemption from the Administration's 
insistence that all public employees must be placed in the proposed health 
alliances, which would negotiate with insurance companies, HMOs and networks of 
doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to take our case to members of Congress, " said Crist, professor 
of economics at Cal State Stanislaus and one of the six elected members of the 
CalPERS board. "It's not like we're going around the Administration. We'll 
continue to meet and discuss with both the Administration and Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 The message he offers is a simple one: Don't mess with success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our program cuts across the whole state, with a large group of people neatly 
tied together," he said. CalPERS spends $1.6 billion a year in premium payments 
on behalf of members, giving it strong financial leverage throughout the state 
in dealing with HMOs and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Clinton plan, "people would go into different regional alliances, 
and some of them would not be able to negotiate as good deals as others," he 
said. "You also would have a lot more bureaucratic problems." 
</P>
<P>
 California law makes members of the CalPERS board legally responsible for the 
program. "If somebody gets cheated or harmed by the system, we can be sued, we 
are all personally liable," Crist said.

Presbyterian Church, Kevorkian spoke of the "right not to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor Thomas Egglebeen invited him to speak.

'ULTRA-FEMINISTS' RULE POLITICS, NORTH CHARGES

<P>
 Senate candidate and Iran-Contra scandal figure Oliver L. North on Sunday 
charged that an "arrogant army of ultra-feminists" dominates U.S. politics. 
</P>
<P>
 North, who is campaigning for the GOP nomination in Virginia, also said any 
President has a right to conceal covert actions from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," North acknowledged that one of his 
fund-raising letters said an "arrogant army of ultra-feminists opposed to 
traditional values has captured the political process with little or no 
effective political opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed to identify these "ultra-feminists," he gave no names but said: "I 
would suggest to you that there are people appointed in this Administration who 
do not represent traditional family values." 
</P>
<P>
 The former member of President Ronald Reagan's National Security Council staff 
acknowledged that he had lied to members of the House Intelligence Committee 
who were inquiring in 1986 about reports that he was involved with assisting 
the Nicaraguan Contras. 
</P>
<P>
 North denied to the lawmakers that he was assisting the rebels when in fact he 
was running a clandestine operation to keep the Contras supplied with weapons 
during a congressional ban on U.S. military assistance. Funds for the weapons 
came from the sale of arms to Iran in an attempt to get U.S. hostages in 
Lebanon released. 
</P>
<P>
 North said he would not oppose any similar secret Clinton Administration bid 
to go behind Congress' back to get aid for, for example, Russia.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; 5 ARRESTED IN CRACKDOWN ON FOOD STAMP FRAUD; 
RELIEF: FEDERAL OFFICIALS VOW TO ENSURE THAT ONLY THE NEEDY GET DISASTER AID. 
MEANWHILE, CALTRANS ANNOUNCES MORE IMPROVEMENTS TO HELP WITH THIS WEEK'S 
COMMUTE.

<P>
 Federal officials vowed Sunday to crack down on fraud in emergency food stamp 
and disaster relief programs, the day after five men were arrested on suspicion 
of illegally buying food stamps from quake victims outside a South-Central Los 
Angeles assistance center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had identified rather large-scale trafficking going on there," said Dave 
Dickson, regional inspector general for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
which administers the food stamp program. "We will not tolerate this action 
anywhere in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Quake victims leaving the food stamp distribution center were approached by 
men offering cash for food stamps, usually half the face value, Dickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickson believes the five may have had a tie-in with an unidentified small 
retailer who would redeem the coupons for full face value. 
</P>
<P>
 He said officials want to discourage food stamps from "becoming a second 
currency on the street" in the aftermath of the earthquake. By Friday 
afternoon, more than $25.4 million in emergency food stamps had been approved 
for quake-affected areas. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 112,000 individuals had applied for emergency food stamps through 
Saturday, when reports of double-dipping and padding of claims prompted 
officials to close down the application process for a day. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 90,000 applications had been approved by Saturday afternoon, the 
same day federal and county officials imposed a three-day waiting period 
between applying for and receiving food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first of several mechanisms to screen out unqualified applicants. 
After the quake, the county had lifted its food stamp screening procedures to 
speed help to quake victims. But a flood of false and inflated claims prompted 
officials to impose the waiting period and heighten scrutiny of applications. 
</P>
<P>
 A special computer system began operating Sunday to screen out fraudulent or 
duplicate applications. Even before that, a total of 2,168 applications had 
been rejected 
</P>
<P>
 The five men arrested are to be arraigned today in federal court on charges of 
unlawful acquisition and possession of food stamps. If convicted, they face 
maximum penalties of five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 When they were taken into custody by USDA investigators and LAPD officers, the 
men had about $5,000 in food stamps and $2,500 in cash, Dickson said. Five 
others were questioned and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Ludwig, administrator of USDA's Food and Nutrition Services, said the 
agency intends to do whatever is necessary to "ensure that emergency food 
stamps only go to eligible people." 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency food stamp offices are expected to reopen today at 7 a.m., but the 
number of sites has been reduced from 29 to 16 to help law enforcement 
consolidate its crowd control. Scuffles broke out at several sites last week 
where lines of more than 1,000 people waited for hours to get the food coupons. 
</P>
<P>
 To make up for the closed sites, four large centers will be opened at Dodger 
Stadium, Whittier Narrows Recreation Area, Victoria Park in Carson and the 
county building in Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials emphasized that only low-income people who suffered such earthquake 
losses as residential damage or power failures that spoiled food are eligible. 
A family of four which meets those criteria and certain income limits can 
receive up to $375 in food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 USDA officials asked for the public's help in reporting any suspected food 
stamp fraud through a toll-free number, (800) 424-9121. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing experience in previous natural disasters, officials from other federal 
agencies pledged to be vigilant in checking other earthquake relief 
applications to ensure that only those affected by the quake and in need will 
receive aid. Several hundred investigators from a number of federal agencies 
are working throughout the quake-affected areas. 
</P>
<P>
 James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said more 
than 208,000 applications for disaster assistance have been received since the 
6.6-magnitude quake Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials intend to search for duplicate applications, verify the 
occupancy and ownership of damaged buildings, and double-check the scope of 
property damage. 
</P>
<P>
 John Carey, the agency's general counsel, said FEMA will pursue all 
allegations of fraud and abuse received through its special toll-free phone 
number, (800) 323-8603. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have filed a claim and later found that the loss is less or greater 
than estimated should call (800) 462-1069. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said 
they are watching for evidence of post-quake rent gouging, but have not seen 
any yet. HUD teams will also be checking for racial discrimination in housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials were heartened Sunday that the number of people living in emergency 
shelters and tent cities dropped to about 4,800 despite a magnitude 5.0 
aftershock early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tents are going down," Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are starting to realize that aftershocks are a very normal part of 
what happens after a major earthquake," said Paul Flores, deputy director of 
the state Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake victims in the Fillmore area of Ventura County will be offered emergency 
housing in trailers because of the lack of other housing in their towns, Witt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more FEMA disaster assistance centers are to open today at Coast Federal 
Bank, 18000 Chatsworth St., Northridge, and at William S. Hart Park, 24151 N. 
Newhall Ave., Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
 As the region enters its third week of coping with crippled freeways, Caltrans 
officials said traffic should move more smoothly today around damaged portions 
of the Golden State Freeway (Interstate 5) in the San Fernando Valley, thanks 
to a new 2 1/2-mile detour along The Old Road from Weldon Canyon Road to 
Calgrove Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, two southbound lanes connecting the Antelope Valley Freeway 
(California 14) to I-5 reopened Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a new Metrolink station set to open today south of Palmdale is the 
first in a series of train and bus improvements in the works for the coming 
months -- including an ambitious plan to link the Antelope and Santa Clarita 
valleys to the West San Fernando Valley with Metrolink service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vincent Grade/Acton station is little more than a large parking lot with 
two long boarding platforms. But officials say that because it is closer to Los 
Angeles and San Fernando Valley areas than either the Lancaster or Palmdale 
stations that opened a week ago, it will save commuting time for south Antelope 
Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Other upgrades are expected in the next several weeks: 
</P>
<P>
 * Next Monday, two Metrolink train stations are slated to be opened -- one in 
Canyon Country on Via Princessa, the other in Northridge at Parthenia Street 
and Wilbur Avenue -- and a third train will be added each weekday to the 
Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Feb. 14 or 21, Metrolink officials hope to open another station in 
Camarillo, extending the Ventura County train line terminus about 13 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 * By the end of February, Metrolink executive director Richard Stanger said, 
the agency hopes to have developed a train connection allowing passengers to 
transfer from north county lines to trains heading for the West San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments, rebuilding work began on the collapsed Gavin Canyon 
bridge on the Golden State Freeway near Santa Clarita, meaning that the freeway 
route should be open before summer, Caltrans officials said. A bypass is now 
being used.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; WILSON BACKS BONDS TO PAY FOR RECOVERY; 
FINANCING: GOVERNOR SAYS HE DOES NOT SUPPORT A TAX INCREASE TO FUND 
RECONSTRUCTION. DEMOCRATS SAY HIS STANCE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE LOBBYING 
EFFORT TO PASS CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S $6.6-BILLION AID PACKAGE. 
</P>

<P>
 Unwilling to support tax hikes of any kind for the moment, Gov. Pete Wilson 
said Sunday he prefers that the state sell government bonds to cover its share 
of earthquake recovery costs in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not eager to increase taxes really for any purpose, and certainly not 
for people who suffered a devastating natural disaster," Wilson told reporters. 
"You don't want to tax people any more heavily than you absolutely have to in a 
recession." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has come under sharp criticism from Democrats here and in Sacramento 
for insisting that the federal government pay 100% of some earthquake costs. 
They say his refusal to acknowledge the state's financial obligation could 
adversely affect the lobbying effort on Capitol Hill to pass the Clinton 
Administration's $6.6-billion earthquake aid package. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson, who is attending a National Governors Assn. meeting here, said he 
is protecting the state's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't apologize for pressing to make the best deal we possibly can," he 
said. "Whatever the federal government doesn't pick up, the state government 
has exposure for. I'm trying to minimize that exposure." 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican governor cautioned the state's congressional delegation against 
rushing to submit an aid package based on premature estimates that are certain 
to rise as the full extent of the quake's damage is calculated. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration sources said Sunday that Clinton will announce a new figure 
this week -- possibly today -- that will exceed the $6.6-billion proposal to 
rebuild California highways, repair government buildings, provide housing for 
victims left homeless and rebuild small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he recognizes that the state must pay its fair share of federal 
programs to reconstruct highways, help families left without household goods 
and provide other assistance. But Wilson said he is pressing for the 
Administration to pick up all costs to clean up and repair public buildings, 
just as it did in Florida after Hurricane Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) proposed a 
half-cent sales tax increase for 13 months beginning March 1, which would raise 
an estimated $1.5 billion. A quarter-cent sales tax hike levied after the 1989 
Loma Prieta earthquake raised $761 million and was supported by George 
Deukmejian, Wilson's Republican predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of raising taxes, Wilson wants the state to sell bonds toward its 
portion of the damages, estimated to exceed $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Jan. 17 temblor, Wilson had intended to focus this trip on enlisting 
the governors of six other large states to pressure the federal government to 
pay the costs of providing medical, social, education and incarceration 
services for illegal immigrants. Wilson's budget proposal for the next fiscal 
year calls for federal reimbursement to California of $3 billion in immigration 
services, a figure most legislators consider overly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is to join the governors of Florida, New York, Illinois, Texas, Arizona 
and New Jersey in meeting with Budget Director Leon E. Panetta today to push 
for more federal money for soaring immigration costs. In four years, Wilson 
said, California's cost of providing emergency medical services for illegal 
immigrants has increased eighteen-fold. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, immigration costs will create a bigger drain on the state's 
treasury than the earthquake recovery, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quake is a onetime disaster, hopefully," Wilson said. "Illegal 
immigration is a growing and recurring disaster, and the dimensions in terms of 
impact on the state's financial resources have been and will continue to be 
even greater." 
</P>
<P>
 While Wilson has suggested cutting off health, welfare and education services 
to illegal immigrants, he said he does not support legislation by Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) to prohibit federal earthquake funds for 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 During the interview, Wilson could not resist taking shots at Democratic 
gubernatorial candidate John Garamendi, the state insurance commissioner, who 
has called for raising taxes for earthquake recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not sure there is a tax that Garamendi has failed to mention," Wilson 
said. "He seems simply hellbent to tax people. He has said property taxes, 
sales taxes, income taxes (should be raised) and he is seemingly eager, which 
to me doesn't make much sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Republican leaders here said they will introduce legislation next 
week that could divert another $4.5 billion to earthquake aid beyond the 
Clinton Administration's $6.6-billion package. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican plan would impose a moratorium on mandates -- federal spending 
requirements -- for the earthquake disaster area. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP leaders would offer legislation in March to repeal about half of the 
mandatory spending requirements in Los Angeles, or about $1.5 billion a year, 
said House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Georgia). 
</P>
<P>
 Without some relief, Los Angeles would receive roughly $7 billion in 
earthquake aid -- but would have to pay about $5 billion to meet unfunded 
federal requirements over the next three years, Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that is well worth exploring," Wilson said of the idea Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), whose district was hit hard by the 
quake, characterized it as "a cheap gimmick" to score election year political 
points. Waxman wants Congress to pass the earthquake package and then review 
whether to lift federal mandates passed on local communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Big-city mayors have long complained about financial burdens placed on them by 
rules in such legislation as the Clean Water Act and the Americans With 
Disabilities Act. Unfunded mandates cost the city of Los Angeles about $1.75 
billion a year, Mayor Richard Riordan has told lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. David Dreier (R-San Dimas) said he hopes to use Los Angeles as a pilot 
project to relieve communities nationwide of unfunded federal requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking for every possible bit of relief for California governments, 
which are going to be stretched to the limit when it comes to the recovery 
effort of this earthquake," Dreier said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plan puts as risk federal laws written to provide health care to 
low-income residents, safe drinking water, clean air and other environmental 
protections, Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get suspicious when I hear Republicans simply say, let's no longer have 
mandates fulfilled," Waxman said. "If there are federal requirements that 
certain activities have to be done by cities, counties and states, it is 
usually for public protection."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; AGENCIES ACTED FAST, STILL OVERWHELMED; 
AFTERMATH: OFFICIALS SAY DISASTER RESPONSE WAS LARGEST IN U.S. HISTORY, YET WAS 
NO MATCH FOR THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS. INNOVATIONS HELPED COPE WITH THE CRUSH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Barely 48 hours after the Northridge earthquake ripped through Los Angeles, a 
task force of local, state and federal officials convened a hurried meeting to 
address a critical question. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people had taken to sleeping in parks and the task force had to 
decide whether to pitch tents to shelter the frightened masses. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials had voiced strong objections to erecting tent cities of the 
kind that sprang up near Miami in 1989 after Hurricane Andrew. But there were 
forecasts of rain and cold, and no one was eager to see earthquake victims 
suffer further by being drenched. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the state, 
local officials relented, and four days after the magnitude 6.6 quake, National 
Guard units began raising the tents in the hardest-hit areas. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of hundreds of decisions with wide-ranging impact that would be 
made in the days following the Jan. 17 quake. Led by FEMA, which coordinates 
government response to disaster and administers emergency aid, authorities have 
mounted what they say is the largest urban disaster relief effort in U.S. 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The response has been at times both chaotic and inspired, with FEMA under 
intense pressure to avoid the delays and mistakes that provoked so much 
criticism after Hurricane Andrew, the Loma Prieta quake and the Los Angeles 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems presented by the earthquake are especially daunting because of 
Los Angeles' urban nature and the extent of damage to the region's roads, 
schools and utility lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is one reason why there was so much damage and devastation," said FEMA 
Director James Lee Witt. "But you've got one of the most incredible federal 
response teams here that you have ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there have also been missteps. Authorities concede that in the rush to 
open disaster application centers -- "to show we were being responsive," said 
one official -- they exceeded their capacity to staff them and likely increased 
the frustration level of victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the decision by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. 
Cisneros to dispense rental assistance vouchers at the FEMA centers may have 
increased the volume of traffic incalculably, officials now speculate. FEMA 
officials concede that many victims were confused about what to expect at the 
assistance centers and were disappointed to learn that immediate cash 
assistance would not be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials were also caught by surprise when tens of thousands of people rushed 
to apply for food stamps, a federal welfare program that authorities decided to 
make available to earthquake victims. At times, authorities had to call in 
police to subdue unruly crowds, and by week's end officials were forced to 
delay issuance of food stamps to crack down on fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 But if there have been snags, the relief effort has also generated innovative 
thinking, a greater willingness to cut red tape and an emphasis on getting 
information to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson released state workers from their duties to act as emergency 
volunteers. So far, 500 have signed up and will continue to receive state pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The response has included an unprecedented display of communications 
technology to get vital information to victims and the media, including FEMA's 
Recovery Channel, televised from FEMA's Pasadena field office. 
</P>
<P>
 And the call for help has produced people such as Angela Tabar Svennefiord, 
32, a trilingual Angeleno just returned from Sweden, who arrived at the FEMA 
office with a resume hoping to help somewhere. Ninety minutes later she took 
the oath of office as a FEMA reservist -- proof, said a glowing official, that 
FEMA is ready to cut through red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews with state and federal officials and a review of FEMA's daily 
internal news summaries provide a look at how the emergency response unfolded 
in the hours and days after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 15 minutes of the 4:31 a.m. quake, FEMA's regional office in San 
Francisco and Richard Andrews, director of the state Office of Emergency 
Services, were on the phone alerting Witt that this was not your garden-variety 
Southern California earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 By midday on the East Coast, after several conversations with President 
Clinton, it was decided that Witt, Cisneros and Transportation Secretary 
Frederico Pena would leave immediately for California to assess the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in California, meanwhile, Andrews, with little information about the 
extent of damage, had made a number of critical decisions, among them to begin 
assembling California's urban search-and-rescue units and to ask FEMA to make 
ready to provide tents and water. Both would be needed as thousands of quake 
victims camped out in parks and thousands more were faced with undrinkable 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 In Denton, Tex., it was a little after 7 a.m. when Glen Garcelon turned on CNN 
and learned of the quake. No damage or casualty estimates were available, but 
Garcelon, in charge of FEMA's tele-registration phone bank, realized that there 
was a potential calamity in the making and called his 136 staffers to work. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the rest of the nation was learning of Southern California's 
latest catastrophe, Art Botterell, a communications specialist with the state 
Office of Emergency Services, had been at work for hours on his home computer 
in Davis, near Sacramento, cranking out information over the state's emergency 
news wire service. 
</P>
<P>
 In those early hours, Los Angeles city and county officials, the Red Cross, 
FEMA and others would utilize the service to relay to the public essential 
information about what to do. It would be the beginning of the most massive 
display of communications technology ever employed in a disaster response. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the major decisions made during the first days of the emergency were 
when and where to open the disaster application centers, which serve as focal 
points for officials to divine the needs of the community and for victims 
seeking aid. Officials were eager to open the centers quickly to "demonstrate 
that we were being responsive," Andrews said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was the difficulty of balancing that desire against the limitations of 
what we knew we could put in place in two days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after the temblor, 11 centers opened in quake-ravaged areas. 
Officials were overwhelmed as thousands upon thousands of quake victims formed 
lines and the full extent of the suffering began to dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time during the disaster, FEMA became the target of criticism as 
many victims voiced frustration at the slow pace in the centers and confusion 
about what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was while looking at the lines on that first day that we fully began to 
realize the dimensions of what we were dealing with," Andrews said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lines were unbelievable and overwhelmed all of us," Witt said. "We came 
back and set out very quickly to open up new centers and hire new staff." 
</P>
<P>
 By Jan. 21, a 12th center had opened in Van Nuys and another was being readied 
in South-Central Los Angeles, as dozens more volunteers were recruited. 
Officials say that up to 150 people each day were volunteering for duties 
ranging from interpreter to courier. Officials had also decided to eliminate 
questions on the application forms that were slowing down the process. 
</P>
<P>
 That first Friday would also prove to be the day of reckoning for Garcelon 
back in Denton, as quake victims began to heed pleas to apply for aid by phone. 
Through the week, officials had steadily increased the number of phone lines as 
the stream of calls turned to a deluge. That Friday, though, 205,000 quake 
victims jammed phone lines. At the peak of the frenzy, officials were recording 
15,000 calls per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 During the weekend, Garcelon hired hundreds of phone recruits around the 
country to staff more phone lines, including about 100 that were added at 
FEMA's Washington headquarters. The new hires were given quick orientation 
lessons covering disaster assistance programs. Still, complaints began to 
filter back from some earthquake victims of ill-informed operators dispensing 
misleading information. 
</P>
<P>
 That first Friday would also see the first tents being erected to shelter 
thousands of homeless quake victims. The decision had not been easily arrived 
at. The tent cities thrown up in South Florida in the wake of Hurricane Andrew 
stood for months, becoming a locus for crime and breeding unsanitary 
conditions. Officials here devised a strategy of emphasizing that the tents 
would be temporary and sent out teams of social workers, health and mental 
health officials to urge occupants back to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to be very proactive in our outreach, to find out where people 
lived, get their homes inspected and get them into the application process," 
Andrews said. By Jan. 23, the number of those camped out in parks and tent 
cities had begun to dwindle. 
</P>
<P>
 Also by that Sunday, FEMA's relatively newfound priority of "getting the word 
out" was in full swing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Information is as important to people as food, water and shelter," said FEMA 
spokesman Mike Allen, who with 55 staffers is responsible for disseminating 
information to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The blitz would include thousands of reports, memos, summaries, advisories and 
updates faxed to dozens of media outlets, government and business offices and 
establishment of the Recovery Channel, which was first tried during last year's 
Midwest floods but is getting its biggest tryout here. The channel's first 
broadcast on Jan. 23 featured a FEMA official explaining tele-registration and 
disaster aid application procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The feeds are being made available to television and radio stations and can be 
picked up on two networks by anyone who owns a satellite dish. Television 
station KLCS, Channel 58, has been running the broadcasts nightly and FEMA has 
placed broadcast monitors in disaster application centers. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA would also decide to use another idea first tested during the Midwest 
floods, a weekly newsletter, Recovery Times, which was scheduled to begin 
publication by the end of the second week of the disaster. This time, FEMA 
officials will set up their own mini-printing plant to handle the immense flow 
of information and are looking for more office space in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, officials began to voice guarded optimism that the emergency 
response phase of the operation was ending and that they would soon be able to 
devote full time to recovery efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has asked Congress for $6.6 billion to finance relief efforts, and 
officials said they have have set about prioritizing the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have to begin to monitor people who have gone through the process to 
see that money is being disbursed quickly," Andrews said. "But the issues are 
going to continue to be complicated. I've seen no sign that demand has begun to 
taper off . . . and until that happens we are in the general posture of 
increasing activities rather than winding down."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; PARAMEDICS' POST-QUAKE PROCEDURES MAY BECOME 
PERMANENT; MEDICINE: EMERGENCY WORKERS TREAT VICTIMS WITHOUT FIRST CALLING 
HOSPITALS FOR INSTRUCTIONS, RESULTING IN FASTER CARE. LIFESAVING ADVANTAGES ARE 
SEEN.

 By the time paramedics arrived, the 65-year-old man lay lifeless on the floor 
of his Northridge home. He had been eating a bowl of cereal when a 4.6 
aftershock rattled his house and left him suffering from a severe heart attack. 
Breathless, with no pulse, the man seemed destined to become yet another 
quake-related fatality. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was blue in the face -- basically he was not with us," said the first 
emergency service worker on the scene, paramedic Ron Lingo of the Los Angeles 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Working under an emergency order implemented after the earthquake, paramedics 
were able to treat the man differently from the way they typically treat heart 
attack victims: They were not required to call a hospital for instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lingo and his partner Mike Walker performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 
inserted an IV, defibrillated the man's heart and then, relying on their 
training and years of experience instead of on hospital nurses, they 
administered medication. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got pulses back with him, and we got a good blood pressure," Lingo said. 
"We saved his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Just hours after the magnitude 6.6 quake struck Jan. 17, paramedics with the 
city Fire Department began operating under what they call "communication 
failure protocols." The protocols, used primarily during a disaster, allow 
paramedics to treat certain types of patients without first calling a hospital 
for instructions -- an adjustment that emergency officials say saves time 
without diminishing the level of care. 
</P>
<P>
 "The advantages are much quicker patient care," said Alan R. Cowen, chief 
paramedic and commander of the city Fire Department's Bureau of Emergency 
Medical Services. "It doesn't make sense that when you have a cardiac arrest 
the first thing you need to do is run over and pick up a telephone. You should 
be treating the patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the protocols were rescinded last week as the demands on the 
emergency system declined, county Emergency Medical Services officials say it 
might not be long before the procedures become standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the quake, county EMS officials were studying the idea of eliminating 
the mandatory call to base hospitals for some patients. For nearly a year the 
Long Beach and Burbank fire departments had been conducting a pilot program 
giving paramedics more autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw that there was no change in the patient care," said Dr. Samuel 
Stratton, medical director of the Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of that study, which will be reviewed by the Emergency Medical 
Services Commission at its next meeting, possibly in February, along with the 
experiences of paramedics during the quake, demonstrate that contact with 
hospitals is not needed in most instances, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake was a devastating, terrible thing, but there's a number of 
things we're learning from it and this is one of those things: That we can 
function well under this type of system," Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, requests for Fire Department service -- including many for 
paramedics -- increased from an average 1,000 calls a day to 2,200 the first 
day, and 1,600 the next. While the demand on paramedics grew, their ability to 
contact hospitals declined. Several hospitals in the San Fernando Valley were 
damaged and two of the three base stations were unable to accept calls from 
paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paramedics weren't calling base stations because there were no base 
stations," Cowen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, paramedics are required to call a base hospital whenever they 
encounter patients experiencing chest pain, acute shortness of breath, symptoms 
related to hypertension and other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 In such instances, the paramedic team will note the patient's medical history, 
take vital signs and assess the patient. While one paramedic remains with the 
patient, the other relays the information by phone or radio to the base 
hospital. Typically, a registered nurse orders a treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the Northridge man, paramedics would -- under normal 
circumstances -- have called a hospital first before administering medication 
and then relayed the victim's response to the nurse after each dose of 
medication, Lingo said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after undergoing intensive training and years of experience and continual 
updates, paramedics say that call is unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know exactly what they're going to say," said Walker, a 12-year department 
veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes it is more than a tedious formality, paramedics say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hindrance to patient care," said paramedic Charles Barnett, who has 
been with the department 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days since the quake, paramedics such as Lingo and Walker have answered 
calls ranging from the mundane to the extraordinary. They have patched cuts and 
bruises suffered in falls during the quake, resuscitated heart attack victims, 
and assisted Salvador Pena, a janitor who was trapped for more than seven hours 
in the rubble of the Northridge Fashion Center's parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're dealing with a life-or-death situation, your No. 1 enemy is 
time," said Lingo, a 20-year department veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 And during times of disaster, when the flow of calls is seemingly endless, 
less time spent with one patient can mean the difference between life and death 
for another. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can treat, transport and clear, then you're available for the next 
call during a disaster like this earthquake," Capt. Steve Johnson said.

STREET SMART: CALTRANS SAYS IT'S UP TO OXNARD TO MAINTAIN BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I frequently drive down Oxnard Boulevard in Oxnard and, compared to other 
major streets around the county, it is in very bad condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The bumps and holes all along the road aren't huge, but I don't see them 
getting repaired, and the heavy load of cars and trucks rolling down the 
boulevard every day is only making matters worse. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems like the boulevard could use a good repaving, and maybe a few extra 
lanes to help traffic move along better. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there any plans to fix the road? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Garcia, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Yes and no. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, Oxnard Boulevard, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, is the 
responsibility of Caltrans. But Caltrans pays the city of Oxnard about $15,000 
a year to fill potholes and otherwise maintain the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard traffic engineer Joe Genovese says the city spends that much and more 
each year, and that it is up to Caltrans to do the major improvements the road 
requires. 
</P>
<P>
 Genovese says the city has asked Caltrans to fund extensive repairs, but has 
received no response. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials say they expect Oxnard to continue maintaining the road and 
there are no plans for a major overhaul. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 With the opening of the new connector between the Moorpark and Simi Valley 
freeways, traffic has increased on both freeways. This is good news for 
residents of Simi Valley, Moorpark and Thousand Oaks, who have less congestion 
on their city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But for us commuters, the freeway traffic is starting to get pretty bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now the commute-hour traffic causes many dangerous surges and stops 
because of large packs of cars entering the freeway all at once. 
</P>
<P>
 The installation of meters would stagger the incoming flow and make for a slow 
but safe drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you tell us road warriors when the on-ramps to the Moorpark Freeway in 
Thousand Oaks will become metered? 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Leaver, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 You'll have to tough it out for another year or two. That's how long it will 
probably take before meters will be installed at on-ramps to the Moorpark 
Freeway, says Caltrans traffic engineer Bob Houle. To figure out whether there 
is enough traffic to warrant meters, Caltrans has to count cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans was just beginning to install traffic counters under the freeway when 
the earthquake hit, bringing the work to a halt. Road crews have focused their 
attention on repairing damaged roadways, Houle says. As traffic in Ventura 
County gets back to normal, traffic-counter work should resume. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 As far as I know, it is illegal to make a left turn from Warwick Avenue in 
Thousand Oaks onto Wilbur Road. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I see vehicles make this turn on a daily basis anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Could the city of Thousand Oaks look into making this turn legal? 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Graziano, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Left turns from Warwick onto Wilbur are illegal and will stay that way, at 
least for now, says traffic engineer John Helliwell. 
</P>
<P>
 The no-left-turn rule was implemented about seven years ago after a series of 
accidents at the intersection, Helliwell says. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists speeding toward the nearby Wilbur-North Moorpark Road intersection 
would often run into left-turning traffic, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 To stop the smash-ups, the city posted no-left-turn signs on Warwick and 
extended the median strip to make left turns even trickier at the intersection, 
which does not have a traffic signal. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the occasional offender, the system has worked pretty well, 
Helliwell says, and it wouldn't make sense to change it back. 
</P>
<P>
 Helliwell also says traffic patterns would not allow a signal to be installed 
at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 He offers two, rather circuitous, alternate routes for motorists who are 
trying to turn left onto Wilbur to get onto Moorpark Road. Head north on 
Warwick to Mayflower Street, turn right, and you're at Moorpark Road. Or turn 
right from Warwick onto Wilbur and turn left onto Hillcrest Drive.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; 'SHINDIG': CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO ANARCHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Wally George's Outrageous Rock 'n' Roll Shindig" shaped up as an interesting, 
if not terribly enlightening, exercise in culture clash. Bring in Orange 
County's arch-conservative talk-show host to preside as emcee over a bunch of 
anarchic kids steeped in the signature sound of Young O.C., which is punk rock. 
</P>
<P>
 But George was absent due to illness, and too many of the new-generation punks 
who turned out at the Ice House on Friday night have managed to transform punk 
anarchism into their own form of arch-conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
 On a bill featuring five emerging local acts playing for a mostly teen-age 
audience, the band that played to the densest pack of stage-crowding bodies and 
drew the biggest response was Guttermouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Musically there was almost nothing to distinguish Guttermouth, 1994, from the 
Circle Jerks or Black Flag circa 1980. This was straightforward, Southern 
California-style hard-core punk: damn the melodies, full speed ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Guttermouth was extremely effective at playing old-style hard-core, as you 
could tell from one glance at the crowd. The tumult directly in front of the 
stage looked like a football goal line on fourth-and-1 a second after the ball 
has been snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Guttermouth ranted and blitzed without much differentiation, but there were a 
few more palatable departures. The set's best number was a mysterious, surf 
rock-influenced song apparently called "No Such Thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Musically this was an old ritual, but so, in their way, are trad-blues shows 
and '50s rockabilly revival bills. What soured the proceedings wasn't so much 
the familiarity of the music as the calcified attitude that went with the 
recycled sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Guttermouth's singer, Mark Adkins, was a cheerfully obnoxious ringleader whose 
lack of seriousness made his more outrageous pronouncements easier to take. But 
Adkins, in his sardonic, joking way, did seem earnest about upholding the punk 
orthodoxy that says the music has to be hard and fast, that certain boundaries 
of fashion must not be crossed, and that to deviate is to sell out. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his targets was a kid in a Bad Religion shirt. Formerly the darling of 
hard-core punks, the Los Angeles-based Bad Religion has now fallen from favor 
among the ultra-orthodox for daring to tint its anti-authoritarian tirades with 
poppy melodiousness, and for becoming sufficiently popular to have signed a 
major label deal. Adkins alluded mockingly to all of this. 
</P>
<P>
 He also harangued a stage-front fan who had the temerity to wear his hair at 
near-shoulder length. "Let's make an example of this guy. Obviously a KROQer," 
Adkins said, before facetiously urging the crowd to beat the kid up. 
</P>
<P>
 The longhair was in no danger; no one was about to do him any harm. In the 
early 1980s, brawling between shorn punks and shaggy rockers was commonplace in 
Southern California, in a replay of the Rockers vs. Mods mid-'60s youth-culture 
warfare recounted in the Who's "Quadrophenia." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Punk was new in those days. Not to condone the brawling, which was stupid, but 
punk at that time was a statement, and it had conviction and teeth. Today, it 
is a fashion to put on, a ceremonial rite to attend. This young crop of punk 
fans is sensible enough not to regard it as anything worth fighting over. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk to Orange County's punk rock godfathers, people like Jack Grisham of 
T.S.O.L. and Mike Ness of Social Distortion, and they'll tell you their share 
of tales about youthful brawling. But they'll also emphasize that punk's truest 
mission was to free up personal expression, not to enforce orthodoxy. 
</P>
<P>
 As stale as it may be artistically, punk orthodoxy remains sufficiently 
volatile to cause some real unpleasantness. A month ago, when Kurt Cobain of 
the hot-selling, punk-influenced band Nirvana, pulled up a chair on stage at 
the Forum and began playing an acoustic ballad, some troglodyte(s) in the 
audience scored two direct hits on him with flung sneakers. Cobain's laudable 
desire to stretch his musical reach made him not punk enough in some quarters.  
</P>
<P>
 Those who feel that way are one with the doddering folk music purists who 
booed Bob Dylan on the day in 1965 that he went electric. They complete an 
inter-generational circle of stuffy, artistically deadening conservatism. To 
paraphrase Pete Townshend, chronicler of England's Mods versus Rockers wars, 
"Meet the new jerks, same as the old jerks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wally show's headliner, Sublime, offered a more promising example of what 
can happen when hard-and-fast music serves as a spark but not an all-consuming 
flame. The Long Beach trio, playing to a somewhat thinned-out, but highly 
receptive audience, gave its fans an excuse to mosh with hurtling hard-core 
punk passages. But those were just the punctuation, not the entire grammar, of 
a band that also took significant cues from the reggae of Bob Marley and the 
reflective songwriting of Elvis Costello. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Singer-guitarist Brad Nowell was most effective in getting across emotions in 
quieter, lighter-textured passages in which his smoky voice took on a 
Costello-like hue. While much of what he sang got lost amid the Ice House's 
vastness and echoing, bare-brick surfaces, Nowell showed some promise as a 
lyricist in a character portrait of a fellow lost in drugged fog: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm too drunk to light the bong, I'm too stoned to sing this song. . . . 
Drunk by noon but that's OK, I'll be president someday."  
</P>
<P>
 The third-billed Nuckle Brothers offered a ska-punk mix and a frat-rock 
sensibility. Three horns, a rhythm section and two voices growling and shouting 
in tandem made for a hard to decipher din under the circumstances, but the 
on-stage energy and fast-hopping ska beat gave the audience all the cue it 
needed to bounce along. 
</P>
<P>
 Gameface turned up with a flawed game plan: An utterly foreseeable 
happenstance, a broken guitar string, brought its performance to a seven-minute 
halt. Handy replacements are available at reasonable prices at any music store, 
fellas. Try sticking an extra set in your guitar case before your next gig. 
</P>
<P>
 After finally solving the broken string dilemma by borrowing another band's 
guitar, Gameface played a reasonably sharp set that included the evening's most 
consistently melodic songs. The band paid for it: "We're not punk enough for 
these guys in the front who were throwing (stuff) at us all night," singer Jeff 
Caudill said as Gameface finished.  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, they could benefit by going more pop: a cover of the Cyndi Lauper 
ballad, "Time After Time," speeded the tempo and narrowed the melody to the 
point where the song's emotional core of longing was lost. Live, as on its new 
CD, "Good," Gameface sounded just like the better-established O.C. punk-pop 
band, Big Drill Car. 
</P>
<P>
 Listening to the opening band, One Eye Open, was like hanging out at a 
Laundromat. Rap, reggae and metal bits were spliced together in rapid 
succession in a cycle of churn-soak-spin that allowed for neither melody nor a 
coherent form.

BUMPY RIDE ON PLAYHOUSE'S 'ROAD TO MECCA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a performance during the world premiere run of "The Road to Mecca" at 
Yale Repertory Theatre in the late '80s, Athol Fugard said "Mecca" was 
something new for him. The South African playwright felt his prior works had 
said everything he had to say against apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't get rid of an obsessive social subject that easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Road to Mecca," at the Camino Real Playhouse, doesn't, it is true, deal 
with apartheid per se. But it does closely examine the mind-set that continued 
that racial injustice and that condones its fallout to this day in South 
Africa, just as racism remains an American shame. 
</P>
<P>
 That mind-set -- the tunnel vision that can only see a future for those who 
fit into a mold created by the socially empowered -- is embodied in the 
character of Marius Byleveld, the dominie and social arbitrator of the village 
of New Bethesda in South Africa's Great Karoo. He is kindly, understanding and 
a great friend of Miss Helen's. 
</P>
<P>
 What Byleveld can't accept is Miss Helen's dedication to the construction of 
concrete statues of Wise Men, owls and various other images in her garden, all 
pointing east toward Mecca. She is different. The villagers can't accept her, 
either. They want her like them -- or they want her destroyed by placing her in 
an old-folks home. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this frightening and frightened attitude against those who are different 
that is at the core of racism and of Fugard's drama. This production, under 
Nancy Jane Smeets' direction, almost misses that point in the director's 
casting of Odette Derryberry as Miss Helen. 
</P>
<P>
 Derryberry acquits herself quite well as far as she goes, but she lacks the 
hard spine of a woman who, like Simon Rodia and his Watts Towers, fought 
community opinion and official obstinateness for a dream that was both mystic 
and personal. Derryberry's own aura is gentle, making Miss Helen befuddled 
rather than torn, disenchanted rather than disenfranchised. This casting turns 
the play into a story about whether or not to put away a dotty old lady, 
instead of one about taking away the freedom of the only spiritually free 
person in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Smeets has staged the piece effectively -- despite the too open, boxy setting 
(albeit decorated nicely in Miss Helen's eccentric style) -- but hasn't 
captured the suspense, tension and mystery of the script. These are ingredients 
that mark the exceptional writing of Fugard, the depth beneath the simplicity 
of his surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of that quality, and all of the power of this flawed but valid production 
of the play, is in the performances of Jill Cary Martin as Elsa Barlow, the 
young woman who has befriended and become intimate with the driven widow, and 
Gene Fiskin as Byleveld. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin has a gritty texture that fulfills the total honesty of her Elsa, which 
finds its source in the text despite Derryberry's softness. And Fiskin's sense 
of respectability and purpose barely cover his inner fear of Miss Helen's 
mystic journey and the peace it has brought her, a spiritual peace Byleveld 
cannot conceive. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Fugard was not, and is not, done with racism or bigotry -- even as society 
tries to reconstruct itself -- in "Mecca" or in such a more evolved example of 
his art as "Playland," which just opened at South Coast Repertory. (Review, 
F1). A comparison of the two dramas shows how far we have gone, but how short a 
distance we have traveled.

FIRM SPENT $12,000 ON WATER DISTRICT WORKERS; AGENCY: 2 SANTA MARGARITA 
ENGINEERS WERE ENTERTAINED BY PRIME CONTRACTOR AWARDED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN 
JOBS.

<P>
 An engineering firm that was awarded millions of dollars worth of contracts by 
the Santa Margarita Water District spent nearly $12,000 entertaining the 
district's top engineer and his chief assistant between 1989 and 1992, The 
Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Dye, the district's top engineer since 1979, and Dan Ferons, his chief 
assistant, were reportedly treated to hundreds of meals and at least two hotel 
stays in resort towns by the Irvine-based engineering firm of Robert Bein, 
William Frost & Associates, which was awarded nearly $14 million in no-bid 
contracts over the past five years, more than any other engineering firm doing 
district work. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye, 58, has never reported receiving anything of value from any contractor on 
the statements of economic interest he has been required to file every year 
under state conflict-of-interest laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferons, 34, who sometimes functions as the district's chief engineer in Dye's 
absence, thus far has not been required to file statements of economic 
interest. But because he is second in charge in the engineering department, the 
district's board of directors is deciding whether he should have to file such 
statements in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the district designates him as one of the officials who must file, 
Ferons can accept gifts of any value and is not required to report them. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's Political Reform Act makes it illegal for certain designated 
officials who receive gifts worth more than $250 in any one year to use their 
influence to steer any business to the gift-giver in the succeeding 12 months. 
Bein-Frost's spending on Dye surpassed that amount in each of the four years. 
</P>
<P>
 In his capacity as chief engineer, and as a member of the district's 
engineering committee, Dye has made hundreds of recommendations to the board of 
directors for all district engineering work, including that of Bein-Frost. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, Dye was treated to meals and other gifts valued at more than 
$5,000 between the beginning of 1989 and the close of 1992, while Ferons was 
the beneficiary of gifts totaling more than $6,000 during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye did not return calls for comment, nor did Robert Kallenbaugh, the 
president of Bein-Frost. Ferons directed inquiries to the district's new 
general manager, John J. Schatz, who said he had not had time to investigate 
the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bein-Frost has worked as a consulting engineer to the district since 1970, 
primarily for planning purposes and to perform engineering work on the 
district's water distribution system. 
</P>
<P>
 The volume of gifts raises questions about the relationship between the 
district's top two engineers and the district's chief engineering firm. 
Although the district has decided to curtail spending on the services provided 
by Bein-Frost and other outside consultants, the company was awarded nearly $12 
million in contracts during the time it treated Dye and Ferons to nearly 
$12,000 in gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Bein-Frost's gift-giving is well documented. Former general manager Walter W. 
(Bill) Knitz reported receiving $8,230 in gifts from the firm between 1989 and 
1993, including trips to Cabo San Lucas, meals, golf games and air show 
tickets. Michael P. Lord, the former assistant general manager, reported 
receiving $14,646 in gifts from the company, including pheasant hunting and 
fishing trips, golf games and assorted meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men resigned after The Times disclosed their excessive spending of 
district funds and the volume of gifts they had received from contractors who 
benefited from district work. 
</P>
<P>
 Knitz and Lord are the targets of a criminal investigation being conducted 
jointly by the district attorney's office and the FBI, which are examining 
possible violations of state conflict of interest laws. The Securities and 
Exchange Commission is conducting a separate inquiry into the district's 
portfolio and Lord's role in handling its finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, longtime board Chairman Don B. Schone resigned on the same 
day The Times disclosed that he had taken two trips to Cabo San Lucas at 
Bein-Frost's expense, but never reported them on his statements of economic 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether the criminal investigation involves anyone other than 
Knitz and Lord. Last April, the district attorney's office asked the district 
to hand over the expense accounts of Knitz and Lord, as well as those of Dye, 
Finance Director Jim Clark, Controller Carol Megara and former Operations 
Director C.J. DiPietro. 
</P>
<P>
 District attorney's investigators also requested information related to the 
salaries, benefits and other compensation for Knitz, Lord, Clark, Megara, 
DiPietro and operations chief Bob Regan. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace J. Wade, assistant district attorney in charge of special operations, 
would only say that the criminal investigation was continuing and is expected 
to be completed in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye was hired in April, 1979, as district engineer, and he now commands a 
15-member engineering staff and is paid $97,020 a year. Ferons, second in 
charge, was hired in October, 1985, and now makes $68,591 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 As district engineer, Dye is more directly involved with the contracts of 
Bein-Frost than any other employee. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last March, Dye explained that he negotiates consulting 
contracts with engineering firms. Dye said he figures out what work is needed, 
negotiates a fee with the consultant and then makes a recommendation to the 
district's seven-member engineering committee. Dye himself was a member of that 
committee until last April. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, acting general manager Dan Miller removed staff members from the 
engineering and finance committees because of potential conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought it was inappropriate for staff members to sit on committees," 
Miller said last week. "Staff members should make recommendations only. They 
should not be voting on committees." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he saw a conflict of interest in having a staff member analyze a 
potential contract and then later vote on the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to removing staffers from board committees, Miller also drew up a 
new procedure for awarding professional services contracts, allowing only the 
general manager to approve contracts under $10,000, and requiring multiple 
proposals for contracts above $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before that, there were no thresholds and nothing written," Miller said. "It 
was up to the discretion of the staff as to what went to the board and what 
didn't go to the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, following the resignations of Knitz and Lord, Miller authorized a 
$5,000 seminar to teach all board members and top district employees how to 
comply with the gift-reporting requirements enforced by the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 According to some who attended the seminar with Dye, the engineer challenged 
the need for him to even file financial disclosure forms, arguing that state 
guidelines called for the "district engineer" to file, instead of the "chief 
engineer," as he is called. 
</P>
<P>
 In a board of directors meeting with staff last May to discuss a draft code of 
conduct that prohibits district employees from accepting any but nominal gifts, 
Dye complained that he often attended working lunches and breakfasts with 
contractors and couldn't understand why they shouldn't be expected to pay for 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a concern that maybe he couldn't conduct a breakfast meeting or lunch 
meeting and would have to meet with these contractors at some other time that 
would make his day longer," Miller said. "We tried to say, 'No. Continue to 
hold those meetings, but you have to pay for your own meal.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Hart, a public relations consultant hired by the district last year, 
suggested having an attorney conduct the seminar on how to file state financial 
disclosure forms. He said many staff members didn't know what was required. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, there was a real lack of understanding and obviously, it was a shock 
and surprise as to what was required of them," he said. "It was more 
frustration and surprise than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the problems that have surfaced in the past year over financial 
disclosures, Dye has never amended his statements of economic interests to 
reflect the gifts that Bein-Frost has given him. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller praised Dye's work for the district in the eight months Miller acted as 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill is a very knowledgeable engineer," Miller said. "He's a catalogue of 
historical facts and knowledge about the water distribution and sewer 
distribution systems." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferons, Miller said, has played a greater role in developing the engineering 
department and running the day-to-day operations of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see him as a chief engineer some day," Miller said.

SUPER BOWL XXVIII / COWBOYS 30, BUFFALO BILLS 13; SUFFERING SMITH IS TOO TOUGH; 
COWBOYS: HIS CONSTANT PAIN FROM SEPARATED SHOULDER ONLY MAKES HIS 132 YARDS 
RUSHING MORE IMPRESSIVE. 
</P>

<P>
 He ignored the pain, but it was gaining on Emmitt Smith Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 He separated his shoulder weeks ago, but instead of allowing it to heal, the 
NFL's most valuable player and rushing champion had chosen to play on against 
New York, Green Bay, San Francisco and finally Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit after hit, and as he had to admit after Sunday's 30-13 victory in Super 
Bowl XXVIII, the pain had become too much to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a possibility I have worsened the injury," said Smith, who was 
selected the game's most valuable player after running 30 times for 132 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith ran for 108 yards in 22 carries in last year's Super Bowl victory, and 
became the first running back since Larry Csonka in Super Bowls VII and VIII to 
run for more than 100 yards in consecutive Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought (safety) James Washington had the MVP sewed up," Smith said. "I 
mean he had a great game. I wish it could have been co-MVPs." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington had a brilliant game, but Smith's heroics have almost become 
superhuman during postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was forced from Super Bowl XXVIII because of the pain, but then it 
became apparent -- as it has all season -- that the Cowboys needed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas opened the season without the unsigned Smith and fell twice. Smith 
signed, and the Cowboys went on a winning binge. 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime Sunday, while the Bills enjoyed a 13-6 advantage, the Cowboys 
adjourned to their locker room and talked about running the ball more in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had gotten away from it," quarterback Troy Aikman said. "We had become too 
one-dimensional. We were throwing the ball, and they were getting to us." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Cowboys' offense waited to take the field in the third quarter, 
Washington turned the momentum in Dallas' direction with a 46-yard fumble 
recovery for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the turning point," said Cowboy tight end Jay Novacek. 
</P>
<P>
 What came next -- after a Buffalo punt -- was the punishment: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Smith right for nine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Smith right for three. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Smith right for nine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Smith left for seven. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Smith right for 14. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Smith right for four, 
</P>
<P>
 -- Aikman three-yard pass to Daryl Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Smith right for 15 and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who announced after the game that he will skip the Pro Bowl next week 
because of his sore shoulder, gave way to Lincoln Coleman late in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had taken some shots and I wasn't sure I could even get up," Smith said. "I 
have taken a couple of shots over the past few weeks, and it hasn't been 
pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome, however, remained in doubt at the start of the fourth quarter. 
Washington intercepted a pass by Jim Kelly at the Buffalo 46-yard line and 
returned it into Smith territory at the Buffalo 34. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to (offensive coordinator) Norv Turner," Smith said. "I said, 
'Coach, get me the ball, get me the ball.' He said, 'How do you want it?' I 
said, 'it don't make no difference; get me the ball.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys got Smith the ball seven times on a nine-play scoring drive to 
finish off the Bills. Smith ran left for the final yard and a touchdown on 
fourth and goal from the one. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we scored, I said, 'Coach, Coach, you've got to find someone else to 
get the ball to.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to go for it on fourth down turned out to be an easy one with 
Smith ready to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Emmitt when we went for it on fourth down, 'I believe in you and 
you're going to put it in the end zone,' " Coach Jimmy Johnson said. "That was 
big." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's reputation continues to grow. He has won three consecutive rushing 
titles, two straight Super Bowls, has been selected the league's MVP, and now 
on the same weekend in which former Cowboy running back Tony Dorsett earned 
entry to pro football's Hall of Fame, Smith has been selected Super Bowl MVP. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a dream trying to be the best I could possibly be, and when you're 
chasing after legends like Tony Dorsett, Walter Payton and Eric Dickerson, if 
you can accomplish anything close to what they have accomplished, you've been 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is still waiting for birthday No. 25, and yet he already has a place in 
NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
 "To win the Super Bowl two times in a row and be the only running back to win 
rushing titles and win the Super Bowl is something very very special to me," 
Smith said. "But as for history, I don't think about that. The only thing I'm 
concerned about is winning games and winning championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe one day I'll look back and say, 'I did all this, wow.' But I won't give 
it a thought until it's all over." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hall of Fame also awaits that day.

SUPER BOWL XXVIII / COWBOYS 30, BUFFALO BILLS 13; IT'S A FOUR-GONE CONCLUSION; 
PRO FOOTBALL: COWBOYS DOMINATE SECOND HALF IN 30-13 VICTORY AS BILLS' 
FRUSTRATION REACHES NEW LEVEL. SMITH IS MVP.

<P>
 The NFL brought back instant replay for one smoke-filled, emotion-wrought 
evening Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon further review, the Dallas Cowboys are still high-stepping toward 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Buffalo Bills are still falling all over themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 For a second consecutive Super Bowl for the Cowboys, Emmitt Smith ran 
tirelessly, Troy Aikman threw effortlessly and Jimmy Johnson got his hair 
messed up. 
</P>
<P>
 For a second consecutive Super Bowl for the Bills, Thurman Thomas lost a big 
fumble and then hid on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 For a second consecutive year, the Bills were screaming and flinging their 
helmets while the Cowboys were turning over Gatorade coolers, this time in 
celebration of a 30-13 victory in Super Bowl XXVIII. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that this is getting old, but the Cowboys showed almost as much sympathy 
as swagger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt sorry for them," Dallas receiver Michael Irvin said of the Bills. 
"But we couldn't help them." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, it appears nobody can. This makes four Super Bowl losses in a 
row for the Bills, extending their record streak while tying a record for most 
losses overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Including their 52-17 loss to the Cowboys in last year's Super Bowl, they have 
been outscored by 66 points in those losses, an average of 16.5 points per 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that anybody was surprised, but the 17-point margin Sunday equaled the 
number of points the Cowboys scored after Bills mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you feel like you are beating your head against the wall," Buffalo 
special teams veteran Steve Tasker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest of those mistakes this year was a fumble by Thomas that Cowboy 
safety James Washington returned 46 yards for the tying touchdown early in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does it feel like?" Bill linebacker Darryl Talley asked. "It's a bitch, 
that's what it is. It hurts. And it hurts deeply." 
</P>
<P>
 What does it feel like to be a Cowboy? 
</P>
<P>
 "Utterly unbelievable," defensive end Jim Jeffcoat said. "I think people are 
going to remember this for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 If for no other reason than that Johnson and owner Jerry Jones actually 
hugged. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of talk this year about us being at each other's throats," 
Johnson said. "Well, after this kind of thing, the only thing you do with each 
other's throats is hug them." 
</P>
<P>
 If you are the Bills, you grab your throat. 
</P>
<P>
 This first happened in the first minute of the second half, with the Bills 
leading, 13-6, after dominating the first two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys had had trouble adjusting to the Bills' no-huddle offense. Jim 
Kelly had thrown for 176 yards. Emmitt Smith had been held to 41. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Thomas had committed a fumble that had led to a Cowboy field goal, but 
then Nate Odomes had stopped a late Cowboy drive with an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Bills thought the Cowboys were worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shoot, there was nobody screaming or anything in our locker room," Cowboy 
guard Nate Newton said. "Not to be cocky, but we already thought we had the 
game won. We knew we would beat them down eventually. And when we did, then it 
would be over." 
</P>
<P>
 The beginning of the end came when Thomas, working from the Bills' 43-yard 
line on the first possession of the second half, took a handoff and ran smack 
into Leon Lett. 
</P>
<P>
 Lett did what Johnson teaches all of the Cowboys to do. He grabbed for the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Thomas was carrying it one-handed and loosely, it was an easy pick. 
The ball bounced toward the sideline and into the arms of Washington, who 
weaved through the stunned Bills for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly the score was tied. And Thomas was, strangely, tired. 
</P>
<P>
 He carried only two more times the rest of the game, spending most of it on 
the bench with leg cramps. He finished with 16 carries for 37 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thurman will be Thurman," Kelly said later. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Washington is to be believed, sections of South-Central Los Angeles 
will be celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is for everybody I know back in Watts," said Washington, a former Ram 
who grew up there before attending UCLA. "I want them to see me showing people 
that I can do it, and do it for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lett, known primarily for gaffes in last year's Super Bowl and on 
Thanksgiving, wouldn't gloat, he also proved a point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody thinks the guy is a real dummy," defensive end Charles Haley said. 
"Just watch that play and you see the real Leon Lett." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lett: "We try to do that every day in practice. They tell us to make a 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who bounced his helmet off the carpet and shrugged off teammates' 
attempts at consolation after the fumble, admitted it was more than a 
head-turner. It was a game-turner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The momentum was all for us, then all against us," he said. "It didn't just 
change it then, but for the rest of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly changed it for the next six minutes. During that time, with a 
haze still hanging underneath the dome after halftime fireworks, the Cowboys 
made the Bills' hopes disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 Now caught in a 13-13 tie, the Bills lasted only three plays on their ensuing 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the Cowboys were fired up, but Jeffcoat and Haley muscled past the 
Bills' offensive line and sacked Kelly for a 14-yard loss on third down, their 
first sack of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys took over on the 36 and took off on the go-ahead drive, a 64-yard 
march conducted almost exclusively on the back of Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a play known in the Cowboy playbook as "Power Right," Smith ran behind 
pulling guard Newton, fullback Daryl Johnston, and regular right-side offensive 
linemen Kevin Gogan and Erik Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ran about the same play every time," Newton said. "Why not? They weren't 
moving." 
</P>
<P>
 The drive was so overwhelming, Bill defenders Bruce Smith, Phil Hansen and 
Talley all left the field with injuries before it was finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were breathing hard, we knew they were whipped," Newton said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the drive ended, with Smith's 15-yard touchdown run that pretty 
much clinched his MVP award on the spot, the Bills knew they were done. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just couldn't stop them," Bruce Smith said. "They ran the same plays, but 
we just couldn't stop them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys put the game away with a 34-yard drive early in the fourth 
quarter. Dallas had claimed the ball on an interception by Washington, who said 
he would have complained about not winning the MVP except for one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Smith were in the same fraternity, even though Smith was at University 
of Florida. It was Phi Beta Sigma. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I take care of my frat bro'," Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith then took care of everybody, making it 27-13 by scoring on a one-yard 
run on fourth and goal with 9:50 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt if we went for it then, we could pretty much nail that coffin," 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 And so what about nailing down a place in history? 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys are only the fifth team to win consecutive Super Bowls. They have 
tied the Pittsburgh Steelers and San Francisco 49ers as the only teams with 
four Super Bowl victories. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jimmy Johnson is now 7-1 in the postseason -- second best in history 
behind Vince Lombardi's 9-1 -- while Aikman is 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Did anybody say dynasty? 
</P>
<P>
 "Dynasty?" Newton said, eyes wide. "That's a TV show, man. We don't care about 
last year or next year. We're having too much fun now." 
</P>
<P>
 He would get no arguments from the Bills. Not last year, and not now.

 The Buffalo Bills lost the Super Bowl here Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 And a pie is round, water's wet, roses are red, the sky is blue and what else 
is new? 
</P>
<P>
 Dog bites man. Don't hold the presses. Put it on Page 12. The underdogs lost. 
They usually do. 
</P>
<P>
 They had a great first half. So did the German Army. So did Robert E. Lee. So 
did King George, Napoleon. 
</P>
<P>
 Back up the truck. Buffalo was "b-a-a-a-ck!" as they liked to say. Deal with 
it America. Well, deal with it Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 The guys in the cowboy hats and the boots beat the guys in the hard hats and 
the blue collars. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo's Steve Tasker said they were "looking forward to next year." Wait 
just a darn minute, guys. Give us a break. 
</P>
<P>
 They sandwiched the game between exploding fireworks, dancing chorus lines, 
high-kicking cheerleaders, rap musicians, Roman candles. Busby Berkeley would 
have loved it. You hated to interrupt it with something as mundane as a 
football game. The game had a good chance to be a big anticlimax. Super Bowls 
often are. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't. It was a very exciting. For 45 minutes. After that, order was 
restored. 
</P>
<P>
 It will come as no surprise that Buffalo was undone by a turnover. The Bills 
are like a sailor on leave with three weeks' pay in a waterfront dance hall. 
Sooner or later, they find a way to self-destruct. 
</P>
<P>
 They hit the button for it when the second half had scarcely begun Sunday. 
Pretty soon, here they were lying in a ditch again with their hair singed, 
clothes torn, nose bleeding and teeth loose again. 
</P>
<P>
 Here was their Waterloo: they were leading a Super Bowl game at the half, 
13-6. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was really fooled. It was like watching Little Red Riding Hood on her 
way to Grandma's. You couldn't bear to look. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, it happened. On the third play of the second half, Buffalo's 
Thurman Thomas crashed into Dallas' Leon Lett. The ball popped loose. James 
Washington picked it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, in a sense, crossed his Delaware, too. He kept letting would-be 
tacklers fly by him as he got in the end zone for the tying touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, that was the old ball game. Buffalo never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas was too fast, too tough, too lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, it looked as if the Cowboys were finally going to be undone by a 
foine broth of an Irish lad and a venerable tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 The "shotgun" is an offensive scheme that was introduced in the '60s by a San 
Francisco coach, Red Hickey, who had three quarterbacks of limited mobility. 
Notably one -- Bill Kilmer. Instead of having his quarterback crouch under the 
center and then begin a mad dash backward with the ball, he took a direct pass 
deep. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't work long. The defenses caught up with it by the second month or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo's canny old coach, Marv Levy, dusted off this hoary old maneuver, 
which is ordinarily used on third down and long. He used it on every down. He 
figured to save his quarterback from the ferociously fast Dallas pass. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for a long time, it did. Dallas looked like a bunch of guys running for a 
passed bus, and Jim Kelly threw the ball for 176 yards with 18 completions in 
25 passes in the first half. He was having the time of his life. The Cowboys 
were running around like cattle in a thunderstorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas even threw in the dumbest play in football. This is the gaffe where a 
defensive player runs into the kicker on a punting situation. Why? You're going 
to get the football anyway. The other guys are about to give it to you with 
ribbons around it. Running into the kicker is like returning a present to 
sender. Pros shouldn't do it. 
</P>
<P>
 A pro named Dave Thomas did. The picture was this: Buffalo, trailing, 3-6, had 
just flamed out. It was fourth down and three to go on its own 41. Punter Chris 
Mohr kicked the ball to the Dallas 22. But Dave Thomas had crashed into the 
kicker. Buffalo got the ball back, first down on the 46-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 That's all the break Kelly needed. Eleven plays later, Thurman Thomas had 
scored Buffalo's first and only touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 That might have been the pivotal play except for Thomas' fumble. That fumble 
for an enemy touchdown seemed to take the heart out of Buffalo. More important, 
it put the heart back into Dallas. It put the John Wayne back in the Cowboys' 
makeup, the swagger back in their walk. They were the guys in the white hats 
again. America's team. Wyatt Earps in charge of the town. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith miraculously reappeared. After a first half in which 10 carries 
produced only 41 so-so yards, he came back in the second half to carry 20 more 
times for 91 yards. He caught four passes for 26 yards. He scored two 
touchdowns. He carried the ball six consecutive times, then a seventh for 15 
yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 You can move over Red Grange, O.J. Simpson, Walter Payton and other football 
forces of nature. Emmitt the Eminence may be as good as any. He gains more 
yards with tacklers hanging on him than most guys can get in a clear field. 
</P>
<P>
 So, it was ultimately a victory again for the brash upstart, Jimmy Johnson. 
The word dynasty begins to creep in on his charges. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem it takes something more than Buffalo to rate you a Dynasty. It's 
not a series, it's a Punch-and-Judy show. Buffalo should be punchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it should be like the fight game. When you've had a lot of early-round 
KOs, the boxing commission suspends you. Waits until the doctors can certify 
you healthy. Buffalo may be healthy enough on the stethoscope, but on a 
psychiatrist's couch the Bills may come up seeing shadows and hearing voices. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the rest of their conference isn't much better. The AFC not only lost 
Super Bowl XXVIII, it lost Super Bowls XXVII, XXVI, XXV, XXIV, XXIII, XXII, 
XXI, XX and XIX. It's officially in a rut. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe for Buffalo, the Super Bowl should have handles on it. For sure, the 
football should. 
</P>
<P>
 If they make it again, maybe the Bills should just mail the loss in. If they 
come again next year, they should at least blindfold them. They don't execute, 
they get executed.

SUPER BOWL XXVIII / COWBOYS 30, BUFFALO BILLS 13; ANALYSIS / BOB OATES; ERIK 
WILLIAMS ALSO PLAYS A LEAD ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the end it was another Super Bowl rout, 30-13, but the score was only 13-13 
when Emmitt Smith went to work Sunday in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying the ball on one down after another, the best player in the league 
also carried the Dallas Cowboys on his back on the long touchdown drive that 
finished off the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Or that's the way it looked. 
</P>
<P>
 Is that the way it was? 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 As great as Smith is, that drive -- the most memorable interlude of Super Bowl 
XXVIII -- belonged to Dallas right tackle Erik Williams, the NFL's best 
blocker. Using his 324 pounds adroitly -- yes, adroitly -- Williams opened a 
long sequence of big holes through Buffalo defensive end Phil Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
 On almost every play of that awesome, decisive drive, the Cowboys not only 
called on the same player, Smith, the NFL's MVP this season. They kept calling 
the same play: Smith off tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith off Williams, that is -- with 325-pound Cowboy left guard Nate Newton 
pulling to his right every time to widen the hole just a bit just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeatedly, Smith followed Williams through Hansen. Or, more exactly, through 
where Hansen was supposed to be. Outweighed by 50 pounds, Hansen fought 
Williams gamely, but couldn't do it, and on the touchdown play he paid for his 
gameness with a sorely injured knee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills had won the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt and Erik won the game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For all but Buffalo fans, watching Emmitt Smith was the most entertaining way 
to spend the Sunday evening in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 In a quarterbacks' league -- a quarterbacks' era -- he has become the dominant 
player as a 5-foot-9 running back. 
</P>
<P>
 What does Emmitt have? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Because he isn't a sprinter, Smith, a bodybuilder, has built himself a 
stronger pair of legs than those of any other running back. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He has also built himself a left arm so strong that nobody can strip the 
ball away. Thus, unlike Thurman Thomas, he rarely fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A nearly perfect scrimmage runner, Smith combines instant acceleration with 
his power, and he finishes off almost every run by cutting right to left. That 
way he can always carry the ball in his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He fakes just enough to keep each tackler off balance, meaning he almost 
never absorbs a square hit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With uncanny vision, Smith sees the whole scrimmage scene from weak-side 
tackle across to the tight end, and, unlike many backs, invariably hits the 
hole. On any scrimmage play, there's only one hole, which might be anywhere, 
but no matter where it is, Smith finds it. 
</P>
<P>
 And finds it quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a sport in which the coaching is otherwise about as effective in one 
franchise as it is in another, Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson has pulled so far in 
front of his competition that he doesn't really have any competition any more. 
</P>
<P>
 There's probably no doubt in any rival's mind now, in fact, that Johnson is up 
there with the better coaches of the last half century, Vince Lombardi and Bill 
Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, he is accomplishing things that they couldn't. At Lombardi's peak, the 
Green Bay Packers never smashed good opponents flat with the flair that 
Johnson's Cowboys have exhibited in the last two weeks against the San 
Francisco 49ers and Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo's Thurman Thomas is taking the blame today for the fumbles that seemed 
to turn the game around -- but he should quit apologizing. The defeat wasn't 
Thomas' fault. Turnovers didn't beat Buffalo. The Cowboys were always going to 
win this one easily no later than the moment they could get themselves 
interested in an inferior opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 And as it happened, that was in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting everything together after a listless first half, the Cowboys dominated 
Buffalo once more with the NFL's simplest defense and offense. 
</P>
<P>
 They faced the Bills' fast break with their usual zone defense behind a 4-3 
front that worked, as usual, because Johnson reasons that defense is two things 
only: speed and reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 He therefore recruits one kind of defensive player only -- the man who runs 
fast and loves to hit. Johnson won -- and has usually won, college or pro -- 
for these reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He motivates astutely. In both college and pro ball, he has consistently 
fielded a wild, crazy, aggressive kind of team. And in the emotional sport that 
football is, emotion was much of it again in the second half Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He is a better judge of football players' skills than other coaches are. So 
he always has the better of the talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's offensive line is the biggest ever. He has the most successful 
off-tackle running game ever brought into the NFL. And though his offense is 
painfully simple, Dallas' play-calling is more imaginative than that of any 
rival. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, with the finest running back of our times, Johnson uses Smith 
as a counter- puncher . 
</P>
<P>
 Against Buffalo, the Cowboys attacked with Troy Aikman's passes, then sneaked 
in the winning punches with Smith's runs. 
</P>
<P>
 As a way to play football, that has been as successful as it is unique. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This can be said for the Bills, four-time Super Bowl losers. The most 
difficult thing to do in football is to keep winning big games -- year after 
year -- and the Bills are still doing that. Every season, for four long 
seasons, they've won all but one big game. And that's tougher to do than it 
sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Champions rarely repeat. For runners-up it's even even harder. For runner-up 
players have to get over the bitter disappointment of losing before they can 
start winning again. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly and his coach, Marv Levy, are alike in one 
respect. They have a rare perspective on what's really important. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is living -- and winning -- next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, anyway.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: SUPER BOWL XXVIII / COWBOYS 30, BUFFALO BILLS 13; 
TRUMPY ADDS TOO MUCH TO TELECAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Buffalo Bills failed on two counts Sunday. They couldn't hold a halftime 
lead and they couldn't reduce the verbiage by NBC analyst Bob Trumpy. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the first half, Trumpy complained the Bills were running their 
hurry-up offense so quickly that "it's difficult to get a comment in here." 
</P>
<P>
 In front of televisions across the country, viewers no doubt were yelling, 
"Faster Bills, faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpy, despite a shaky start, didn't have a bad day. At least not as bad as 
Thurman Thomas. He made some good points. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just that he talked too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he suffers from that dreaded Dan Dierdorf disease. Or maybe he thinks he 
gets paid by the word. 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpy is hardly alone when it comes to over analyzing. Word economy seems to 
be a lost art in broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Pat Summerall, there aren't many who practice it any more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first time Trumpy appeared on camera -- during the pregame show -- he no 
doubt made viewers say "ouch!" 
</P>
<P>
 After drawing lines all over the screen while trying to explain the Bills' 
two-deep zone, he said: "If they have to go a man-to-man against the lead draw 
with Emmitt Smith, it's Dr. Kevorkian for Buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
 The standard "it's lights out" cliche would have sufficed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpy appeared nervous at the start of the game telecast. Maybe all the talk 
about John Madden coming to NBC had an effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Trumpy: "Last year Jimmy Johnson said he thought he had a royal flush. 
He's got a small straight this week ." He probably meant year, but that's a 
ticky-tack. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he was unclear if the small-straight comment was Trumpy's opinion or 
Johnson's. Later, he made it sound as if it was Johnson's. 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpy then said, "I think Dallas, ah, Buffalo has a chance to win this game." 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpy did settle down later, but not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Enberg was his usual sharp self. No major gaffes, although he did seem to 
go out of his way to mention his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that Emmitt Smith might win the Rozelle Trophy as the game's most 
valuable player, Enberg said: "For the first time, former commissioner Pete 
Rozelle is not in attendance at a Super Bowl. He and his wife Carrie are 
watching on television back at their home in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's become of Bob Costas? Isn't he supposed to be NBC's main man? 
</P>
<P>
 He sure didn't appear to be on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 He was reduced to doing a taped interview with Jimmy Johnson and Jerry Jones 
during the pregame show and baby-sitting Mike Ditka and Joe Gibbs after the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Jim Lampley was host of the two-hour pregame show and got to 
interview all the main principals after the game as well as monitor a call from 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Costas didn't even get to make a pregame prediction, as did just about 
everyone else on NBC's staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh well, at least Costas will be NBC's prime-time host of the 1996 Summer 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The piece Costas did with the Johnson and Jones indicated they were 
semi-lovey-dovey. 
</P>
<P>
 After it ran, Ditka came up with the line of the day: "If I didn't know better 
I'd say one of them is lying, but since I know better I know both of them are 
lying." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The postgame question that begged to be asked of Buffalo Coach Marv Levy was: 
"What happened to Thurman Thomas, was he injured or was he pulled from the 
game?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was mentioned during the game that Thomas had leg cramps, but the question 
still needed to be asked. O.J. Simpson didn't ask it. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Simpson did two nice pregame pieces -- one with the Cowboys' Leon 
Lett, who at first was so nervous about doing the interview he wouldn't answer 
his hotel-room door, and another with the Bills' Bruce Smith, who talked about 
his concern for his father, who is suffering from emphysema, has a pacemaker 
and has lost most of his eyesight. 
</P>
<P>
 Best pregame piece was the one on the New York Jets' victory over the 
Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. Second best was the one on the Minnesota 
Vikings, 0-4 in Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmad Rashad, the former Viking wide receiver who did the piece, made the 
point of the day: "If the Bills fall behind, it's over. They'll be saying to 
themselves, 'Here we go again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest snafu of the day didn't belong to NBC. It belonged to ABC, which 
didn't schedule enough time between the Senior Skins golf and its regional 
college basketball telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 A sudden death is fairly common in skins play, and Sunday was no exception. So 
ABC didn't join the UCLA-California game until 11:28 remained in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Making things doubly bad, it left the golf after the first sudden-death hole 
even though the final skin wasn't decided until the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Palmer dropped out on that first hole, thus clinching the overall money 
title for Raymond Floyd, and ABC used that as an excuse to cut away. 
</P>
<P>
 But missing the start of Sunday's UCLA game wasn't as bad as what Prime Ticket 
did on Thursday night. First of all, the Bruins' game against Stanford was 
delayed. Then Prime Ticket didn't begin showing it until after 11 p.m., more 
than half an hour later than the listed starting time. 
</P>
<P>
 But the worst thing was giving the score without warning viewers who didn't 
want to know it. Prime Ticket should have known better.

SUPER BOWL XXVIII / COWBOYS 30, BUFFALO BILLS 13; PRACTICE DOESN'T HELP; THE 
BILLS HAVE HAD TO EXPLAIN AWAY SUPER BOWL DEFEAT OFTEN, BUT IT NEVER GETS ANY 
EASIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Again the familiar pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Again the same old questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Again the anguished answers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo Bills know this routine all too well. 
</P>
<P>
 How does it feel to lose a Super Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
 How does this one compare to the others? 
</P>
<P>
 Who's to blame for this defeat? 
</P>
<P>
 Will you be back? 
</P>
<P>
 First, the Bills tried to answer those questions for themselves after losing 
Super Bowl XXVIII to the Dallas Cowboys, 30-13. Then they tried to answer them 
for the media, which hung on every word, every expression. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were no definitive answers. There never are. 
</P>
<P>
 Each player tried to deal with the defeat on his own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurman Thomas sat on the bench in the closing minutes of the game and stared 
off into space. He could see the numbers 0-4 in his mind. And his two fumbles 
that proved so crucial. Then he put his head in his hands and looked inward. 
</P>
<P>
 When the game was over, Thomas, who rushed for only 37 yards and averaged only 
2.3 yards per carry, trudged across the field to offer his congratulations to 
his good friend Emmitt Smith, the Dallas running back who emerged as the game's 
most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith introduced Thomas to his young goddaughter as "the best running back in 
the National Football League." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you even try that," he told Smith. "You know you are the best running 
back in the National Football League." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Buffalo locker room, Coach Marv Levy, one of the league's most 
articulate and most educated coaches, was at a loss for words, a rarity. No 
references to Winston Churchill, his favorite historical figure, this time. 
</P>
<P>
 The blood, sweat and tears in the Buffalo locker room said it all. Levy simply 
went around shaking hands with his players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted them to know the regard I retained for them," Levy said. "And I 
wanted them to know that, had they won, I would have had no greater regard for 
them as people." 
</P>
<P>
 In another corner of the locker room, defensive lineman Bruce Smith quietly 
dressed. 
</P>
<P>
 His thoughts were mixed. The loss of a fourth consecutive Super Bowl certainly 
hurt. But the end of the game takes his mind to an even bigger hurt. His 
father, George, lies in a Virginia hospital in intensive care because of a 
heart problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith visited his father Monday on his way from Buffalo to Atlanta, but hasn't 
spoken to him since. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be time to analyze what happened Sunday night in the Georgia Dome. 
But not today. Smith plans to fly back to his father's bedside. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo owner Ralph Wilson paced at the entrance to the locker room. Outside, 
Levy was addressing the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson planned to talk to the man who has been his coach for seven years upon 
Levy's return to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 And what would Wilson say to him? 
</P>
<P>
 He had no idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is down," Wilson said, "but I'll tell you, I'm very proud of what 
this team has done." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas has had his problems with the media, flaring over real or perceived 
criticism on more than one occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 But not Sunday. He talked as long as anyone wanted to talk, and he was 
willing, almost anxious, to accept the criticism for yet another Bills' Super 
Bowl defeat. Thomas had hoped to carry the team to victory on his broad 
shoulders. Instead, "I want to tell the Buffalo fans," he said, "that I take 
the blame for this loss. I'm sorry and I hope to do a better job next year." 
</P>
<P>
 What frustrated Thomas most was the turnaround in his production from the week 
before. He had led the Bills to the AFC title by rushing for 186 yards and 
three touchdowns against the Kansas City Chiefs seven days earlier, then 
declared that game, "the best of my six-year career." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Super Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did I have to pick this time," he said, "to have one of my worst games? 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a matter of me being careless with the football. It was just that 
at certain times when I got the football, I had somebody around me and didn't 
have time to tuck it away." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' first fumble came in the first quarter and resulted in a Cowboy field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammates came up and told him not to worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, early in the third quarter, Thomas fumbled again, James Washington 
picking the ball up and going 46 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a great job of stripping the ball," Thomas said. "Throughout my 
career, I've never been a fumbler. I can't run with two hands around the 
football. That's just not my style. I just did what I normally do, and they did 
a great job of knocking the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas didn't return for several series after his fumble because of leg 
cramps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was frustrated that I couldn't get back out there," he said. "I tried 
warming up, stretching and drinking a lot of water. It finally went away, but, 
by then, it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone asked Thomas if the real reason he didn't return immediately was his 
fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our coaches are not like that," Thomas said. "If Jim Kelly threw four 
interceptions, they would not take him out. That's not the Buffalo Bills' 
style." 
</P>
<P>
 Some players talked of making yet another run at the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll still keep fighting," Kelly said, "until we get it right. We came back 
for four. Why can't we come back for five?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Smith: "I see no reason to break up this football team." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas knows it won't be easy next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to take our lumps," he said. "There'll be a lot of jokes. Nobody 
wanted us here and they probably don't want us next year, but we are going to 
try."

 In the Buffalo suburb of Hamburg, Karen Tomasik and her husband decided to 
turn their snow-covered front lawn into a shrine to the Bills. They tore down 
their daughter's swing set and made goal posts and placed a small statue of a 
Buffalo over the fallen effigy of Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman. Next to the 
Aikman effigy was ketchup sprinkled on the snow, emblematic of blood.

 Those of you who were involved in football pools will need to know these 
numbers: Dallas 6-3 (first quarter and halftime), Buffalo 3-0 (third and 
final).These pools are illegal in California and most neighboring states. 
However, if you win, you should declare it on your income tax (remember, April 
15) because it was income tax evasion that the feds used to send Al Capone up 
the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Bud Bowl pool numbers were Bud 7-7 (first), Bud Light 7-4 (half), Bud 
4-4 (third), Bud 4-0 (final). In case you care, Bud Light won, 20-14.

 About 75 people demonstrated outside the Georgia Dome because Atlanta police 
tried to sweep the homeless off the streets during Super Bowl week.The same 
tact was used by LAPD when the Pope visited Los Angeles in 1987. . . . About 
100 protesters demonstrated against the the flying of the Georgia state flag 
outside the building. The flag contains the Confederate battle emblem. About 60 
reporters left the press box during the national anthem in support of the flag 
protest.

 Jimmy Johnson's hair actually jumped up and down about an inch while he ran 
through the tunnel during pregame introductions. . . . Natalie Cole's 
unforgettable (pun intended) rendition of the Star Spangled Banner, with a 
touch of America the Beautiful, ran 2:39. . . . The game's actual kickoff was 
at 3:21.0737 PST according to The Times' computer-calculated clock, give or 
take a millisecond. . . . President Bill Clinton watched the Super Bowl but 
would not say for which team he was rooting. An unconfirmed, unreliable and 
unsubstantiated report said that Bob Dole decried Clinton's action. . . . Best 
moment of the telecast was Emmitt Smith and Thurman Thomas hugging after the 
game.

 A blue-ribbon panel of Times editors and reporters, consumers all, rated the 
best commercials of this Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 1. First place goes to the two-part Steve Martin shoe commercial, where he 
discovers that Michael Jordan has faked his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Next is the fast-food commercial starring Charles Barkley, Jordan and Larry 
Bird. Barkley wants to play with the retired ones, but they won't let him. 
</P>
<P>
 3. The soft-drink commercial in which many of today's yuppies return to 
Woodstock for the anniversary of the famous concert. Incredibly clever and 
uncomfortably real. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Cindy Crawford is put into a soft-drink deprivation tank by scientist 
Kramer of "Seinfeld" for one month and comes out Rodney Dangerfield. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Two chimps drink competing soft drinks for six weeks and come out with 
different personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercials 3, 4 and 5, all made by the same soft-drink company, collectively 
would rank first. 
</P>
<P>
 The most disappointing was the potato-chip commercial with Dan Quayle. In the 
commercial, some kid in the nosebleed section offers each person in the row in 
front of him that the person can't eat just one chip. The bet is for the better 
seat. Well, the kid works his little scam all the way to the first row, where 
he encounters the former vice president. This is where the commercial fails. 
The kid makes the same bet with the ex-VP. But what he should have said was: 
"Bet, you can't spell potato (chip)." To paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen, circa 1988, 
we know good commercials and that was no good commercial.

 One more step, a better throw, a crushing block and Kevin Williams, Dallas' 
favorite son, becomes a household name in places he doesn't know even exist. 
Kevin who? Williams, a rookie from Miami, was on his way to scoring a 100-yard 
touchdown on the opening kickoff.If Williams goes the distance he's an 
overnight sensation flooded with endorsement opportunities, while trying to 
decide if he'll spend Monday night with Jay Leno or David Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
 "My eyes were so big and my heart was pumping like crazy when I saw it opening 
up," Williams said. "I was there, I was gone, I was thinking this is just how I 
dreamed it would happen the other night." 
</P>
<P>
 But then a party-pooper named Kurt Schulz stepped in. Kurt Schulz -- shoot, he 
doesn't even spell his name right. He has no business rewriting history, but 
the last man to stop Williams nudges him out of bounds and the Cowboys have a 
50-yard kickoff return. It takes more than that to make folks forget about 
Emmitt Smith. T.J. SIMERS

 About 600 football fans from Mexico were cheated out of about $500,000 in a 
phony Super Bowl ticket scam.About 80 police from College Park, Ga., were 
called to a hotel ballroom Saturday night, where angry fans had created a 
disturbance after learning that they had no Super Bowl tickets. The fans had 
bought a travel package that was to include air travel, lodging and tickets. 
The fans didn't buy the theory that two out of three ain't bad. After police 
escorted the Atlanta travel representative, who police say was also a victim of 
the scam, out of the building, the crowd quieted.

 Memories of Leon Lett haunted Dallas safety James Washington as he carried a 
Buffalo fumble 46 yards to the game-tying score."The person I was looking for 
was (Don) Beebe," Washington said, laughing. "But he flew by me, and Thomas 
(Everett, Cowboy safety) took out two guys with blocks. All I had to do was 
keep running." Lett forced the fumble, a point Washington made to the assembled 
media again and again and again. T.J. SIMERS

 Georgia Frontiere, owner of the Rams, gave her first interview in eight years 
recently. Jerry Jones, owner of the Cowboys, cannot go eight minutes without 
speaking to a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one doesn't mean anything more, but just as much," Jones said, while 
occupying the same interview booths reserved for players after the game. "The 
other one was a great comeback from being on your knee and criticized and a 
little bit ridiculed. That was a wonderful feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a confirmation; this is the good housekeeping stamp of approval." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said nothing is impossible, but he said, "in my mind it's zero 
probability" that Coach Jimmy Johnson will leave the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like each other," Jones said. "We have a lot of water under the bridge. We 
have no problem working together. Some of this stuff started when people 
thought of us at first as buddies that would lay awake and drink. That was not 
the case.

 Highs and lows from Super Bowl XXVIII you won't find on any game sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Best reported offer for a ticket: $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Best attempt to get a ticket: A women standing outside the Georgia Dome just 
prior to game time held up a sign that read, "Need five free tickets. I'm from 
Raleigh-Durham." When last spotted, she was still five tickets short. 
</P>
<P>
 Best ticket scam: Some fans, desperate for tickets, were willing to buy media 
credentials. Unfortunately, they turned out to be counterfeit. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Super Bowl week shopping spree: Donya McKeller, wife of Buffalo Bill 
tight end Keith McKeller, spent $2,690 on clothes and several accessories in a 
mere seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Best news of Super Sunday: Fan Man was a no-show. The paraglider who had 
already disrupted a heavyweight fight and a Raider game, had promised to invade 
Super Bowl XXVIII. Maybe he didn't know at the time that the game was indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Best postgame question: A man with a media credential walked by a booth where 
the Bills' Thurman Thomas was speaking. "Who's he?" the man asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-best question: Told it was Thurman Thomas, the man said, "Who does he

 Saturday night, former heavyweight boxing champion Ken Norton had two tickets 
to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 That made him one ticket short, because his mission was to take his children, 
Kene Jon, 10, and Kenesha, 17, to watch their brother, Ken Norton Jr., play 
linebacker for the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 All three had made the trip to Atlanta, not knowing if they would be able to 
see the game or Norton Jr., who has been estranged from the family for two 
years because of a disagreement with his father. Friday, businessman Ray 
McClendon came up with two ticktets.  
</P>
<P>
 Sunday morning, a few hours before the kickoff, the third ticket came through, 
from NBC, which provided Norton Sr. a seat on the 50-yard line where a network 
camera could find him during the game. 
</P>
<P>
 It was worth much more than a great view. After the game, according to 
Newsday, the Nortons, father and son, got together in the Cowboys' locker room 
and embraced. JIM HODGES

 James Washington just made Pat Terrell's day. Terrell, who plays safety for 
the Rams, just like Washington used to, figures he's about ready to walk down 
the same path Washington took in 1990 when the Rams decided he wasn't one of 
their best 37 players under Plan B free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington moved on to sign with Dallas, and in Super Bowl XXVIII he made a 
strong pitch for MVP consideration after returning a fumble for a touchdown and 
intercepting a pass to set up another score. "James played lights out," Cowboy 
guard Nate Newton said. "He was in the running for MVP until Emmitt Smith 
turned up his load a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 The first person to greet Washington as he emerged from the Cowboys' locker 
room was Terrell. "It makes me happy and keeps me positive to see what can 
happen to somebody who doesn't get treated fairly," said Terrell, who becomes 
an unrestricted free agent as of Feb. 18. "Am I bitter? Yes, I am. I hear James 
wants to come back to L.A.; I wouldn't mind at all taking his spot in Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington made the play of the game when his 46-yard fumble return for a 
touchdown turned the game toward the Cowboys. Washington, who has donated money 
and time to a homeless shelter in South-Central Los Angeles, was angry with the 
Cowboys when he lost his starting job at the beginning of the season to rookie 
Darrin Smith. But Sunday he was a surprise starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just let me play, and I can make things happen," Washington explained. They 
did and he did. T.J. SIMERS

 OK, be honest. How many of you understood Bob Costas' mind-boggling comparison 
of the Buffalo Bills to Sisyphus? How many of you know who Sisyphus is? Or was? 
Or whatever? We went to Webster for help: "a greedy king of Corinth doomed 
forever in Hades to roll uphill a heavy stone which always rolled down 
again."Besides, any moron knows the Bills are more like Prometheus and Dallas 
is like the vulture.

 The Ban the Bills movement swings into high gear again -- it's now and annual 
event -- but don't ask Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson if he has any sympathy for 
0-4 Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone did after the game and Johnson's retort was as direct as it was cold: 
</P>
<P>
 "No." 
</P>
<P>
 When a few reporters flinched, Johnson attempted to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just being honest about it," he said. "I could cry about it, but I'd be 
crying my eyes out if it was us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't feel sorry for them. I don't want to be on the other side. I'm 
glad we won and they lost." T.J. SIMERS

HARDING'S EX-HUSBAND REPORTEDLY HAD TO BE COAXED TO IMPLICATE HER

<P>
 Tonya Harding's ex-husband decided to divulge the champion skater's role in 
the attack on Nancy Kerrigan after authorities convinced him Harding had turned 
on him first, his brother told The Associated Press on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Gillooly was surprised when he found Harding had not stuck with the cover 
story the two had made up, John Gillooly said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Gillooly said his brother's attorney, Ron Hoevet, tried to convince his 
client Harding had turned on him, but Jeff Gillooly didn't believe it until he 
read a 46-page deposition the skater had given the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoevet confirmed John Gillooly's account, telling The Oregonian, "Jeff would 
have fallen on his sword for Tonya if Tonya had told him the truth. But she 
didn't." Hoevet did not return calls Sunday from the AP.

IT'S A DONE DEAL: BO JACKSON'S AN ANGEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels made it official Sunday, announcing a contract agreement with Bo 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 The American League's comeback player of the year in 1993 will have his 
artificial hip examined by Dr. Lewis Yocum this morning and later attend an 
Anaheim Stadium news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, providing he passes the physical, will receive a major league 
contract for $1 million, with incentives that can take it to about $2 million. 
He will receive about $475,000 if he is released before opening day, but his 
attorney, Arn Tellem, said: "From all our discussions (with the Angels), he'll 
be on the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson was paid $2.41 million in salary and bonuses by the Chicago White Sox 
when he returned from almost two years of inactivity stemming from the hip 
injury and subsequent surgery to hit .232 with 16 homers and 45 runs batted in 
85 games. He was 0 for 10 with six strikeouts in the AL playoffs and left the 
White Sox as a free agent when he rejected their offer of arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bavasi, Angel general manager, said Jackson's acquisition strengthens the 
outfield depth and provides both competition for left fielder Eduardo Perez and 
insurance if Perez is not 100% after elbow surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be in position to make some possible (trade) moves in spring 
training," Bavasi said of the need to improve the outfield depth. He added that 
he will continue to scan the free agent list and is believed to have interest 
in Dwight Smith, Lonnie Smith and/or Ivan Calderon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can fill some holes without going out on a financial limb (we'll do 
it)," he said, also confirming that he continues to hold contract talks with 
Jeff Moorad, the agent for free-agent relief pitcher Gregg Olson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in there, still alive," he said of the Olson talks. "For how long 
I don't know."

BUENA PARK'S SIBRIE IS ANYTHING BUT YOUR AVERAGE HEAVYWEIGHT; WRESTLING: SENIOR 
WHO WILL PLAY FOOTBALL AT ARIZONA STATE, IS INTIMIDATING ON THE MAT, 
SOFT-SPOKEN OFF IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You don't have to look farther than Wali Sibrie to prove the old adage that 
looks are deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
 Sibrie, of Buena Park, is the perfect example of why it's a mistake to judge a 
book by its cover. He is a gentle giant masquerading as a hulking heavyweight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone sees him as aggressive," Buena Park wrestling Coach Rick Zabala 
said. "On the mat he really goes after an opponent. But he's really a gentle 
guy. Off the mat, he's soft-spoken, easy to talk to." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant coach Dan Coates, who has been instrumental in Sibrie's development 
the last three years, described him as "the complete gentle giant." 
</P>
<P>
 A veritable lamb in wolves' clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The image is contrary to Sibrie's 6-foot-3 1/2, 260-pound frame. But it's the 
persona the state's second-ranked wrestler is eager to convey. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I want people to know most of all is that I'm not a mean guy," he 
said. "I'm not the stereotypical big guy. I like to pal around with the little 
guys. But if someone doesn't know me, all they see is this big guy, and they 
get intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why Sibrie, a senior, prefers his conversations sitting down. "That 
way, you're not looking down on people. You're on an equal level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the mat, not many wrestlers can say they're on a level equal to his. 
</P>
<P>
 In his relatively short wrestling career -- he didn't start until his freshman 
year -- Sibrie has made astonishing progress. As a sophomore, he qualified for 
the State tournament, where he defeated the two top-ranked wrestlers from the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he lost the league championship to Sunny Hills' Josh Miklos, but 
bounced back to finish second in the Southern Section and the State tournament 
and won the Masters title. 
</P>
<P>
 Sibrie used the league loss to re-access his mental approach to matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emotions took over instead of my instincts," he said. "After that, I learned 
to keep my emotions off the mat." 
</P>
<P>
 Zabala was pleased and relieved Sibrie reacted so positively. "We were able to 
use that as a way to push him to another level," Zabala said. "Whenever 
something like that happens, kids can either retreat into a shell and say to 
heck with it, or they can say, 'Hey, I'm going to work harder to make sure 
something like that doesn't happen again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sibrie chose the latter. He did extra weight training with Coates. He entered 
freestyle tournaments and won the State Greco-Roman tournament last summer. He 
became a student of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got bit by the bug," Coates said. "Hard work and dedication," more than 
any specific physical talents, have made him the wrestler he is today. 
</P>
<P>
 And today, he's sporting a 23-2 record and won last weekend's Canyon Springs 
tournament, with a second-period pin against the section's fourth-ranked 
wrestler, Sean Burbick of Ventura. Although his goal of an undefeated season 
was dashed with a loss to Whittier's Greg Ford, who has defeated him twice, he 
still hopes to add a league title, a Masters' victory, section and State 
tournament crowns and a trip to nationals to his 1993-94 achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 Coates sees no reason Sibrie's lofty goals can't be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's only been in the sport four years and already he's near the top. He 
could be one of the best heavyweights ever ," said Coates, a former Pacific 
Coast Athletic Assn. champion from Cal State Fullerton. "But it has to be 
something he really wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's the hitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Sibrie loves to wrestle, but he's also hopelessly devoted to football, which 
he plans to play next fall at Arizona State. He hasn't decided if he wants to 
pursue both sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, I can do both," said Sibrie, a starting defensive lineman for the 
Coyotes the past three years. "But football's my first love." 
</P>
<P>
 Painful words coming from such a talented wrestler. But Sibrie won't commit to 
something he can't follow through with, and his coaches don't want him to 
spread himself too thin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he can do real well (wrestling) at the Division I college level, he 
should give it a shot," said Zabala, who added Sibrie is enrolled in honors 
classes and is no slouch in the classroom. "But it's tough to do both at that 
level, especially wrestling and football, and with school . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Sibrie derives different joys from either sport, but admitted he has a focus 
in wrestling that has yet to follow him onto the football field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to get in that zone in wrestling," he said. "It's harder to get 
that focus in football because there are other guys you have to think about." 
</P>
<P>
 Off the playing field, Sibrie's thoughts cover a dozen subjects . . . 
</P>
<P>
 On food: "Another common misconception is that I eat a ton," said Sibrie. But 
when he does, a plateful of fettuccine alfredo from the Olive Garden satisfies 
as much as a 10-second pin. 
</P>
<P>
 On animals: "I like pets and wild-life shows," he said. Sibrie favors sharks 
and his pet Akita, a Japanese fighter dog whom he named "Splinter" after a rat 
from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fame. "It was the first thing that came 
to my head," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On children: "I like kids," he said. "I did some community service at a boys' 
club for a school project, and they invited me back. I like to talk to them, 
help them out." 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy help from the gentlest of giants.

HOULDER GETTING BETTER AT PICKING HIS SPOT; HOCKEY: DUCK DEFENSEMAN FINDS 
DISCRETION IS HELPING HIM SCORE AND SET UP GOALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Houlder's job description sounds like an oxymoron: Offensive defenseman. 
How contradictory can you get? 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it's a little confusing to Houlder, too, which might explain why 
he's often in hot water with Coach Ron Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks want, and sometimes desperately need, Houlder to score and 
set up goals. But never at the expense of bottling up opponents' scorers. 
</P>
<P>
 They want him jumping into the offensive action, unleashing that powerful slap 
shot of his, particularly on power-play opportunities. But they don't want him 
getting carried away, thinking he's Bobby Orr. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a role that requires a delicate touch, and after 53 games it's difficult 
to say whether Houlder has been a success or a failure. Certainly, he's been a 
little of each at different times this season. 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, he's the Ducks' third-leading scorer with 30 points (11 goals and 
19 assists). 
</P>
<P>
 On the other, his plus-minus rating is minus 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson couldn't be happier with Houlder's offensive contributions, 
occasionally marveling at his goal-scoring skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is he has 11 goals and that's as many as most of our forwards," 
Wilson said. "He's on our power play because of his shooting and passing 
abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not enough to keep Wilson happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's also a minus 18," he said. "OK, he's playing on a first-year team, but 
he's far and away the worst on the team. He has moments where he forgets he's 
in a game. But (lately) those moments are fewer and fewer." 
</P>
<P>
 Harsh criticism to be sure, but it's nothing Houlder hasn't heard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks don't want him to dramatically alter his game, only to refine it and 
pick his spots better. They need his offensive skills, but they want more from 
him defensively. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got to put more pressure on himself not to be satisfied and he'll be 
fine," Wilson said. "It takes some guys a while to learn. You just hope they 
learn before it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many of the Ducks, Houlder has bounced from the minor leagues to the 
NHL and back to the minors throughout his career and now he's getting his most 
extensive ice time. 
</P>
<P>
 There were bound to be a few kinks to work out for Houlder, a former Buffalo 
Sabre and Washington Capital who had never played more than 41 NHL games in one 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 He is grateful for the opportunity to showcase his skills after spending six 
seasons as a part-time NHL player. But he's not about to relax, not when 
there's so much improvement to be made. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows what needs to be done, even how to do it, but getting it accomplished 
hasn't been easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think things have gone fairly well, but I've struggled at certain times," 
said Houlder, who was selected from Buffalo in the 1993 expansion draft. 
"Normally, you'd get sent down (to the minors). But they've stuck with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, he's surpassed his offensive goals for this season. And if that's all 
that mattered to him, then he could walk away happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Offense is what they were expecting out of me," Houlder said. "It seems to 
come (easily). As long as you have an offensive sense you're never going to 
lose it. It's the defense you always have to work on." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that philosophy, there have been times when the Ducks have had to 
remind Houlder to keep shooting the puck, defenseman Randy Ladouceur said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were concerned where the goals were going to come from," said Ladouceur, a 
12-year NHL veteran. "He's effective when he's jumping up in the play. That's 
what made him so successful at San Diego last year and what's helped him in the 
NHL. He's got a great shot. When he shoots, it's going in there hard." 
</P>
<P>
 On the flip side, Houlder seemed to get caught out of position far too often 
early in the season. Again and again, the right time for a charge up the ice 
seemed to elude Houlder. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents would counterattack and Houlder would be hopelessly lost on the 
play. His mistake invariably led to a goal for the other team. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson stewed on the bench and Houlder wondered when things would go his way. 
It certainly wasn't this difficult in San Diego, where he had 72 points and was 
a plus 50 in 64 games with the International Hockey League's Gulls last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was just endless fun," Houlder said. "You come to the rink and you're 
always winning. We took offense that any team would have the gall to beat us." 
</P>
<P>
 Houlder knew the Ducks wouldn't win like the Gulls, who were 62-12-8, but he 
was in for a rude awakening nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in a mini-slump there for a while," he said of the early part of this 
season. "No one seems to be happy with you. You have to reassess everything. 
But you have to stick with your game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just not that good enough of a player where I could force things. 
Usually, they blow up in my face." 
</P>
<P>
 In those cases, Ladouceur was there, in Houlder's words, to "pick you up and 
dust you off." 
</P>
<P>
 Houlder is learning from his mistakes, which makes Ladouceur happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's realized as the season's gone on that when we're up a goal or two, he's 
not needed to help offensively," Ladouceur said. 
</P>
<P>
 In those cases, it's best to sit back and let the forwards pursue the scoring 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has to play within his limitations, be smart and focused," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds simple, even to Houlder. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to be particular about picking your spots," Houlder said. "You 
don't want to be caught with somebody behind you. Before, I was jumping up at 
the wrong time and it seemed to always cost us a goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Houlder believes he's smarter now, more willing to wait for the right time to 
capitalize on someone else's mistake.

RANDALL, CHAVEZ TO DO IT AGAIN; BOXING: EX-CHAMPION SALUTES CONQUEROR, BUT 
REFUSES TO CONCEDE DEFEAT AS MAY 7 REMATCH IS SET UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Late Saturday night, an hour after the furious fight, two battered boxers sat 
before a news conference audience that was still struggling with the reality of 
the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankie Randall beat Julio Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 How does anybody explain that? 
</P>
<P>
 "I always knew I had talent, I always knew I was a great fighter," said 
Randall, 32, the new World Boxing Council super-lightweight champion. "I just 
didn't have the opportunities. This is one of the moments I had to prove it, it 
didn't matter who I fought. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chavez is the one who happened to take the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Randall, who almost retired in 1987 after a second-round knockout loss to 
Primo Ramos, has already agreed to a rematch May 7 at the MGM. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saturday night, both men looked haggard and beaten -- especially Chavez, 
who has gone through wars before but never has the result been so visible on 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
 For 12 crackling rounds, using a variance of what Pernell Whitaker did to 
Chavez last September, Randall fired jabs into Chavez's face, then lashed him 
with heavy counterpunches every time Chavez lunged toward him. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men scored heavily with brutal power, but Chavez was the only one to hit 
the canvas in a stunning 11th-round moment that brought the MGM hotel crowd to 
near-silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were both throwing hard, sharp, crisp punches," said Randall, whose most 
impressive fight before Saturday was a knockout of Edwin Rosario. "My right 
hand is pretty sharp; (I) caught him with several earlier in the fight. It was 
that punch that just happened to get there before he got off what he wanted to 
get off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had to keep stepping it up because he was stepping it up. If I 
didn't step it up he would always come in. I had to keep on going, keep on 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 The knockdown happened about a minute after referee Richard Steele penalized 
Chavez a second time for low blows. Without the two penalty deductions, Chavez 
would have won a split decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall, using wisdom that eluded Meldrick Taylor in his 1990 12th-round 
knockout loss to Chavez, kept moving throughout the final round, having faith 
that the judges would not be overly biased toward Chavez. He was right, winning 
a tight, split-decision victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would've accepted whatever came out," said Randall, who is from Morristown, 
Tenn. "I fought a hell of a fight, a hell of a person, a hell of a champion. I 
showed God and the world I can fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez, who mocked Whitaker after their controversial fight, saluted Randall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I respect Frankie Randall tremendously," Chavez said. "He took a lot of 
punches. And it certainly surprised me when I hit the canvas." 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, Chavez, who many believe was saved from defeat only by Steele's 
sudden stoppage of the Taylor fight and who had a draw handed to him last 
September against Whitaker when Whitaker clearly was the dominant fighter, 
protested both Steele's actions and the scoring late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sorry -- he fought an excellent fight -- but out of 12 rounds, he won 
three," Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will see everyone the weekend of May 5. I have lost the battle but not the 
war."

'BLANKET MAN' FINDS CUPBOARD NEAR BARE; CHARITY: QUAKE AID HAS DEPLETED RAYMOND 
FICO'S STOCK OF COVERINGS FOR COUNTY'S HOMELESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Raymond C. Fico, known as "Blanket Man" because of his efforts to keep 
homeless people warm and dry, sprang into action when this month's earthquakes 
left people on the streets, quickly handing out 14,000 blankets in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the 74-year-old humanitarian said Friday, the effort has 
severely depleted his warehoused stock of coverings and clothes intended to 
help Orange County's street population. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our funds are real low now, too," Fico said. "But when we saw on television 
those (earthquake-affected) people, my heart just jumped out to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Fico and his squad of volunteers have made four trips to the quake-rocked San 
Fernando Valley, handing out 5,000 of his space-age survival blankets, shiny 
silver tarpaulins outfitted with hoods and snaps so they can double as ponchos. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day after we handed out a lot of them, the rains came," said the retired 
minister from Anaheim Hills. "And we saw all these people in lines for food, 
and all of them were wearing the blankets. It was such a joy to see that." 
</P>
<P>
 A van packed with 1,000 survival blankets left Fico's cluttered but neat 
headquarters in Huntington Beach on Thursday. "That cleaned us out. We've only 
got about 250 left," he said Friday. "And the phone keeps ringing with people 
asking for more." 
</P>
<P>
 Fico's private campaign to help the homeless was sparked in 1985 when he saw a 
televised report depicting huddled street people shivering at Christmastime. He 
and his wife decided to forgo holiday gifts and instead buy 250 cotton and 
polyester blankets for the disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Fico's generosity extended past the Yuletide season. He founded the nonprofit 
Covering Wings Inc., and soon devised the silver polyurethane blankets, which 
fare far better when exposed to the elements than similar-shaped cloth 
coverings. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his assistants have since given away more than 260,000 of the 
5-by-7-foot blankets. Covering Wings, funded primarily through private 
donations, has now spread its operation to more than a dozen states, and the 
durable coverings have even been handed out in Mexico and parts of Europe and 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, the blankets are becoming ubiquitous among the displaced 
Angelenos who have gathered at emergency centers and tent cities in the days 
since the powerful temblors. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people spread one out on the ground in their tents to keep the 
moisture out, then they wrapped another one around themselves," said Fico, who 
plans at least one more trip to the San Fernando Valley. "We only got a few 
left, but it's so good to see people using them. It's great to be a help." 
</P>
<P>
 Fico and his volunteers also distributed 5,000 pairs of socks, 4,000 T-shirts 
and 3,000 knitted hats to help quake victims fight off the chill of the 
Southland's rainy season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Covering Wings quake relief effort was done in cooperation with the Fred 
Jordan Mission in downtown Los Angeles. The mission's assistant director, 
Walter Contreras, said while his group handed out a variety of items -- 
including inflatable mattresses, milk, juice, shampoo and bread -- the 
metallic-looking coverings drew the greatest interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were hundreds and hundreds of people in line in just a few minutes 
after we set up," Contreras said. "And the National Guard, too. The soldiers 
came up to us so they would have something to wear at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Fico's son-in-law and longtime associate, John Contreras (no relation to the 
mission director), said he and Fico patrolled the streets of affected areas, 
passing out the coverings to people who had set up shelters of their own in 
deserted lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an unbelievable scene," he said. "They were so grateful. I wish we 
could have done more. But we helped a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Fico said he's certain divine intervention had his warehouse stocked full when 
the disaster struck. But now, he said, he must find a way to spread more warmth 
here in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We helped all those people, but now we're taking away from the homeless here, 
all this stuff was to go to them," Fico said. "But I'm not worried, God will 
provide for us. He always has." 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about the survival blankets, or to volunteer or make 
donations, call Fico at (714) 968-3358, or write to Covering Wings, P.O. Box 
17984, Anaheim Hills, 92817-7984.

DECISIONS ON ICE; JUDGE RULES IN COURT AND AT HOCKEY RINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's nothing quite like a day in the life of Judge William W. Bedsworth: 
It's two parts "Night Court," one part "Wide World of Sports." 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge who had not a lick of experience in the 
sport of hockey, Bedsworth managed to persuade the Mighty Ducks hockey team to 
hire him as a home-game goal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding over some of the justice system's most weighty matters has precious 
little to do with determining whether a whizzing hunk of rubber crosses a thin 
red line. But Bedsworth convinced the Mighty Ducks that, at a minimum, his 
years in the courtroom had prepared him to deal with the many, er, objections 
he would receive from players. 
</P>
<P>
 After 28 games, this 46-year-old father of three, who manages to be sanguine 
about nearly any topic, including his recent brain surgery, may be the most 
uniquely qualified goal judge in all of professional hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually," Bedsworth says, "there's more in common about the two jobs than 
you think: For one thing, in both jobs you're required to start out perfect and 
get better with experience." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While sitting on the criminal bench is as tough a job as it sounds, a goal 
judge's task isn't. Basically, the charge is to never take one's eyes off the 
disc-shaped puck, also known as The Biscuit. When the puck crosses the line in 
front of the goal, the goal judge presses a button that triggers a swirling red 
light atop the net. 
</P>
<P>
 The tricky part comes in trying to keep up with the puck as it caroms off 
walls and players' sticks at speeds up to 100 m.p.h. and gets trapped in the 
hurly-burly of a hockey game. Occasionally, there is a fuss, to put it nicely, 
when one team thinks a goal is a goal and the other squad thinks it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Already this year we had one . . . where the Ducks screamed bloody murder," 
Bedsworth says. "It's OK, though, because I'm used to working in an environment 
where people yell at me." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Bedsworth is all business at both jobs, he is more Judge Harry T. Stone 
from "Night Court" than Justice Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
 On one wall of his stately 10th-floor courtroom in Santa Ana, just a few feet 
from the "Great Seal of the State of California" plaque, hangs a framed poster 
of "The Great One," hockey player Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedsworth's chambers contain nearly as much hockey and sports paraphernalia as 
law books. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the building's hockey freak," he says, and he doesn't need a lawyer to 
prove it. Among his decor: hockey puck paperweights and a pair of autographed 
hockey sticks, one by members of the Mighty Ducks and another by the Los 
Angeles Kings players. 
</P>
<P>
 A 15-year Kings season-ticket holder, Bedsworth landed the job with the Ducks 
last fall when he sent in a resume and letter on a lark. Confessing he had no 
experience, he claimed he possessed unusual qualifications on the grounds that 
he had an undying passion for the game and a mind fine-tuned in the science of 
what he calls "dispassionate observation." 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them I had attended somewhere in the neighborhood of 700 hockey games 
and had seen a lot of pucks in my time," Bedsworth recalls. "I also was used to 
performing under fire," he says, motioning to a stack of cases on his desk, the 
corner of which is occupied by a foot-high, ceramic, black-cloaked wizard. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was elected in 1986, that's what somebody told me I would need to do 
in this job," he says, "wear a black robe to work every day and perform magic." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a recent weekday, and eight hours from now Bedsworth will be seated 
ringside in a plexiglass kiosk at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim, judging the 
accuracy of slap shots from the Mighty Ducks and the Hartford Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, though, he's on the bench, listening to a defense lawyer try to 
keep his client, a 48-year-old man convicted on cocaine charges, out of state 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer, armed with a Probation Department report recommending leniency, 
asks Bedsworth to "be merciful." 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing both sides, Bedsworth acts decisively. "The amount of respect I 
have for Mr. McDonnell (the defense lawyer) is only outweighed by the amount of 
respect I have for the Probation Department. But in this case, I disagree with 
both of them," Bedsworth says, as he meets the man's gaze and sentences him to 
three years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up: a young man who has pleaded guilty to his first felony. Bedsworth, 
noting the man's lengthy list of aliases, leans toward the shackled prisoner 
and says: "First of all, what is your true name? You have several." 
</P>
<P>
 Before pronouncing judgment, Bedsworth admonishes the man not to violate his 
probation, something he has done in the past. "If you do that again, you are on 
your way to state prison. Do you understand that?" 
</P>
<P>
 And with that, Bedsworth sentences him to nine months in county jail and bids 
him "good luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, he kicks his black leather cowboy boots up on his desk in his 
chambers and sighs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toughest part is always the sentencing," he says. Though he doesn't 
second-guess himself, he harbors mixed feelings about the sentence he gave the 
48-year-old: "The guy had led a blameless life. But with eight kilos of 
cocaine, you'd have to be Mother Teresa to stay out of state prison." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's an hour before the opening faceoff and the pregame pandemonium at the 
Pond in Anaheim seems an ocean away from the order in Courtroom 37. 
</P>
<P>
 As Bedsworth dines with other off-ice hockey officials, most of whom have 
played organized hockey, it becomes clear that the job provides a healthy 
distraction for a man who suffered a close call in 1988, when an aneurysm 
ruptured in his brain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have fully recovered, although there are people in the defense bar who 
would argue otherwise," Bedsworth says. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, fans who have come to recognize Bedsworth's familiar face 
playfully suggest that he consider giving the Ducks, who play worse at home 
than on the road, a few breaks. But when the puck starts flying, Bedsworth 
adopts the no-nonsense, decisive persona those in his courtroom have grown 
accustomed to. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming his position in one of two goal judge boxes -- each at opposite ends 
of the ice -- he is the picture of concentration, his eyes darting to and fro 
with every slap of the puck. 
</P>
<P>
 The wait is not long. Twenty-nine seconds into the game, the visiting Whalers 
tap in a goal at Bedsworth's end and his crimson light flickers to life on cue. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Whalers' goal follows a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is nothing," Bedsworth says during a break in the action. "New Jersey 
came into town one night and scored five goals in six minutes. I picked up the 
phone, called the referee's table and said I wanted to renegotiate my 
contract." Which, by the way, amounts to a modest sum for Bedsworth, who earns 
$104,000 a year as a Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the first 20-minute period, the teams have attempted a combined 
28 shots on goal -- more than one per minute -- most of which have come at 
Bedsworth's end of the ice. Twice, the puck gets lost in a melee of players in 
front of the net, but Bedsworth's light remains unlit. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a goal judge's nightmare," he says, "to push the button when no goal 
is scored." 
</P>
<P>
 Another goal judge's nightmare happens 11 minutes into the second period, when 
Bedsworth rules in favor of the Ducks on a shot that the Whalers' goalie thinks 
he saved. The goalie, who looks to be about twice Bedsworth's size with a 
temper to match, repeatedly skates up to Bedsworth's see-through box and 
scowls. 
</P>
<P>
 If Bedsworth, who doesn't so much as twitch at his accuser, has any doubts 
about his call, he doesn't show it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably the angriest man in the building right now," Bedsworth says a 
few minutes later. "But there's no question in my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do have to concentrate," he says. "But that's another similarity: I'm 
used to sitting in court for three hours at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 When the final buzzer sounds, the Ducks have notched a rare home victory, 6-3, 
an outcome that pleases Bedsworth the fan. Bedsworth the goal judge wonders 
aloud whether the National Hockey League might frown on his affection for the 
home team. But, he says, "I can't believe the 260 off-ice officials in the 
league don't have favorite teams." 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, Bedsworth says his supreme view from the goal judge's box has 
given him a greater appreciation of the game and of certain Ducks players, like 
No. 7, Anatoli Semenov, who is more cagey than the judge had believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Quizzed on how he has observed such things when his unofficial job description 
requires he keep his eyes glued to the puck, he replies: "Hey! If you're going 
to ask questions like that, I want a lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Bedsworth expects to receive his first job evaluation by the NHL any day now. 
But until then, the jury on his performance is, in his words, still out.

FANS FOLLOW THEIR TEAMS TO BITTER -- OR SWEET -- END; FOOTBALL: IN TRUE SUPER 
BOWL TRADITION, THE COUNTY'S DALLAS AND BUFFALO DEVOTEES FLOCK TO BE WITH THEIR 
FELLOW FOLLOWERS.

 By time-honored custom, Mark Epperson rose early Sunday morning, donning his 
team uniform: a straw, stiff-brimmed, white cowpoke's hat, a Marlboro man 
T-shirt and butter-yellow lizard boots with pointy toes as sharp as the Dallas 
native's attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 By time-honored custom, Joe Brown rose early Sunday morning, donning his team 
uniform: a lucky dollar bill, a duck-billed cap and a pair of lucky shorts worn 
so frequently that in deference to humanity he accessorized his attire with a 
peeled clove of garlic stuffed in his sweat pants pocket. On Sunday, the two 
McDonnell Douglas mechanics sped north and south on Beach Boulevard in 
Huntington Beach in search of team spirit and its usual companions, cold draft 
beer and wide-screen TV.  
</P>
<P>
 The wide boulevard was something of a reverse Mason-Dixon line with Dallas 
Cowboy fans like Epperson seeking Texas-style solidarity in the cool, dark 
quarters of Denim & Diamonds in north Huntington Beach. Some 100 loyal and 
long-suffering Buffalo Bills fans headed south to the flat, tiled quarters of 
Buffalo Wings N Things, where they tasted medium spicy, deep-fried wings and -- 
once again -- that bitter tang of defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 In tribute to the game, Denim & Diamonds silenced the boots of two-stepping 
and line-dancing cowboys so that sports fans could watch their heroes with 
complete and utter concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 Epperson, of Huntington Beach, leaped so many times from his table during the 
game that finally one of the restaurant's smiling managers pleaded for calm.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're America's team," Epperson explained his unswerving loyalty. "They're 
a working class, blue-collar team, and I come from a working-class family."  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because they've learned to struggle with so many losses, the Bills 
fans were even more exuberant than the Cowboys'. They wore their heart on their 
sleeves -- and their sweats, sneakers, earrings and hairbows. Not to mention 
their unmentionables. 
</P>
<P>
 The night before the game, hard-core members of the Southern California 
Buffalo Boosters swept through the Buffalo Wings restaurant, decorating the 
wood rafters with helium-filled red and blue balloons and grainy banners spit 
out by computers that spelled out their wistful sentiments: "We Billieve." 
"We're back . . . Deal with it America." 
</P>
<P>
 During those sweet, fleeting moments when the Bills were ahead, superstitious 
fans rose from their seats, reverently touching a stuffed football doll like a 
holy water font. One man seized a fake head of a horned buffalo, parading among 
the tables that faced a huge, wide-screen television with flickering images of 
their beloved Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past four years, Jim Perry has been coming religiously to this 
shopping strip haven for upstate New Yorkers who ride out their occasional 
defeats on the wings of chickens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I have a little different attitude about this," said Perry, whose 
lucky charm strategy of avoiding the washing machine for four weeks apparently 
had failed the team. "At least we got to the Super Bowl. I'm just glad to be in 
it. Being a Bills fan is more than rooting for a football team. It's part of my 
family, the city where I came from." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here five years now," added his tablemate, Brown, 28, whose lucky 
dollar bill lay near the amber drippings of his beer. "And I've never changed 
team allegiances. That's my only team."  
</P>
<P>
 As the game progressed and the pile of cold, gnawed chicken wings grew, some 
fans became philosophical, remembering the sting of past defeats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to support the Bills and show them our love," said Patti Myers, a 
Buffalo native and booster who helped organize the party of New Yorkers. "These 
people from Buffalo are such a close group. Every time they've lost they go 
into a deep depression."

COUNTY'S 1ST FELONY STALKING TRIAL TO BEGIN; CRIME: MAN IS ACCUSED OF 
THREATENING EX-GIRLFRIEND'S LIFE AS WELL AS OTHER ACTIONS. CHARGES HAVE BEEN 
FILED AGAINST TWO OTHER LOCAL MEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After Ojai Valley resident Lisa Hale ended a relationship with her boyfriend 
last January, prosecutors say he began stalking her. 
</P>
<P>
 They say Harold Owen Edwards twice broke into the woman's house, ransacked her 
bedroom and shredded her lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records show he also made repeated threats on Hale's life and once even 
said her unhappiness was "worth going to prison for." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Edwards is now facing the possibility of a long prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been charged with felony stalking and other crimes in connection with 
incidents involving his ex-girlfriend. His case, expected to go to trial today, 
will be the first felony stalking trial in Ventura County history, prosecutors 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the Edwards case, local prosecutors have filed charges of stalking 
against two other men in the county. One is accused of stalking the wife of a 
Ventura County fire captain, the other with terrorizing his ex-girlfriend in 
Oak Park, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges of stalking could not have been filed before 1990, when the state's 
first stalking law went into effect. The law was passed after a series of women 
-- notably slain actress Rebecca Schaeffer -- were followed, threatened, 
attacked or even killed. It has been a model for similar statutes in other 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the 1990 law, it was not until this month that prosecutors felt 
confident filing charges in most stalking cases. Some local prosecutors said 
far more than three cases would have been filed in Ventura County by now, but 
the law was too narrowly defined. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to those concerns, state legislators last year designed a new 
stalking law with more bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, the legislation expanded the definition of stalking to cover 
victims who are in reasonable fear of their safety or the safety of their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Before, people were considered victims of stalking only if they were in 
reasonable fear of death or great bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law provides prosecutors with a better chance of winning stalking 
convictions and is expected to lead to more such cases being filed, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It eliminates the requirement of proving severe emotional distress," said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Maeve J. Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox said that element was difficult to prove because not everybody react to 
threats the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even with the new law, Fox does not expect stalking cases to be filed 
routinely. 
</P>
<P>
 "These aren't exactly run-of-the-mill cases," said Fox, who is prosecuting the 
Oak Park stalking case. 
</P>
<P>
 That case has been filed against 33-year-old William Mitchell of Oak Park. 
Between July and September of last year, authorities said, Mitchell "camped 
out" on the condominium grounds of his former girlfriend, whom court records 
identify as Edith Lincoln. She could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 14, Mitchell forced his way into the woman's home, attacked her and 
imprisoned her, authorities said. He continued to stalk her for nearly two 
months after the incident, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In seeking a restraining order, Lincoln told the court that Mitchell 
threatened to "kill me to prevent me from pursuing future relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 At a preliminary hearing in which Mitchell was ordered to stand trial, he 
mouthed the words "I love you" to Lincoln as she testified, Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's attorney, Robert I. Schwartz, disputed the notion that his client 
is a threat to Lincoln's life. "She testified that when he threatened her, she 
thought he might have a gun in his car," said Schwartz, adding that Lincoln had 
never known Mitchell to carry a gun in the five years they were together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good law," Schwartz said of the stalking legislation. But, he 
added, it does not apply to his client's case. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most unusual stalking case in the county involved Matthew James 
Towler, 27. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court testimony, Towler began stalking Lisa Plott, the wife of 
Ventura County Fire Capt. Norman J. Plott. He had gone to junior high school 
with the woman. He had not seen the woman for more than a dozen years but 
started calling her for no apparent reason in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The first call was so bizarre that the victim thought Towler had confused her 
with someone else, and asked him not to contact her again after their initial 
phone conversation, according to court testimony. He persisted on and off 
during the next several years and was spotted looking into the family's mailbox 
last November. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities arrested Towler in December and charged him with misdemeanor 
stalking, making annoying phone calls, making anonymous phone calls and making 
terrorist threats. 
</P>
<P>
 He pleaded guilty to the terrorist-threats charge and will be sentenced Feb. 
18. Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory G. Phillips, who is prosecuting the case, said 
the other charges are expected to be dismissed at that time. The Plotts 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case against Edwards, prosecutors were able to file charges before the 
change in the law because his harassment of ex-girlfriend Lisa Hale was 
blatant, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Donna K. Gissing. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, one morning last April, Edwards, 36, showed up at Hale's house 
just as she was about to go to work and would not leave the yard, court records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 When she returned home for lunch, she found her bedroom in disarray. Trash was 
dumped about, and her lingerie and underwear were shredded, court records say. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, Hale discovered Edwards hiding behind her bedroom door at 5 
o'clock in the morning. She called sheriff's deputies, who served him with a 
copy of a temporary restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 17, the same day Hale appeared in court to obtain the three-year 
restraining order, Edwards phoned her again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miss Hale told the defendant he could not call her, he could not come 
(over)," court records show. "She explained that the restraining order was good 
for three years, that he had to stay away from her, he had to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defendant responded that it would never stop and that the restraining order 
did not mean anything to him." 
</P>
<P>
 The harassment continued for several more months, according to court records, 
until Edwards was arrested and charged with felony stalking and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Stephen P. Lipson said his client is not guilty of 
stalking. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . I think he crossed that line. It's really a fine line, but it's got 
very little to do with stalking. It's got more to do with a long-term 
relationship gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stalking law is probably a good law," he added, "but in this case, they 
are stretching it."

CASA PACIFICA CHIEF A MAN WHO LOVES TO HEAL; CAMARILLO: STEVEN ELSON WILL LEAD 
A FACILITY DESIGNED TO OFFER ABUSED YOUTHS A HOMELIKE SETTING WHERE ALL NEEDS 
CAN BE MET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Steven E. Elson, there are few things in life better than the feeling he 
gets when he breaks through the psychological walls of a child who has suffered 
traumatic abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 And now Elson, the newly named executive director of Casa Pacifica in 
Camarillo, will be able to continue the work he loves in a soon-to-be-opened 
facility, tailored to help Ventura County's troubled kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this project I kind of feel like a farmer with his hands in the soil," 
Elson said. "It's inspiring for me to watch kids come in upset, angry and 
frustrated and then leave in better shape. It's very gratifying." 
</P>
<P>
 The Casa Pacifica project has been designed to offer children suffering from 
physical, sexual or psychological abuse a homelike setting where all their 
needs can be met. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the county's current system, children who are removed from an abusive 
home and made wards of the court are usually taken to one of four foster homes 
around the county. Ten homes serve as backups, and one group home is available. 
</P>
<P>
 But none provide at one place the medical care, counseling, clothing, food, 
shelter and education that abused children will receive at Casa Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
 The $10-million Casa Pacifica project has long been the dream of a 
private-public task force seeking a comprehensive facility to serve as a way 
station between abusive homes and long-term foster families. 
</P>
<P>
 When it opens in July, Casa Pacifica will offer 24 temporary shelter beds and 
24 long-term beds on a campus governed by Elson and a staff of physicians, 
nurses, teachers, psychiatrists, counselors, social workers and others. 
Capacity will eventually increase to 60 beds. 
</P>
<P>
 During its first year, the facility is expected to serve nearly 400 kids, 
ranging from infants to 17-year-olds, officials said. Children in the shelter 
program will stay as long as 30 days, while kids in the residence program -- 
those needing long-term psychological care -- will stay as long as a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Elson, 48, has been executive director of the Sycamores, a well-regarded 
residential-care facility for troubled boys in Altadena, since 1984. He has 
worked on the Casa Pacifica project as a consultant and was attracted to the 
director's job by the challenge of starting a new program and by the high level 
of community and local government support for the project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Ventura County provided $4 million in start-up funding. Since then, 
an additional $6 million has been raised from private sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Pacifica officials estimate that the facility will need a $3-million 
annual operating budget. They expect the money to come from private donors and 
government grants. The county's annual contribution has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "The seamlessness of the public-private partnership that has come together for 
Casa Pacifica is practically unheard of elsewhere," Elson said. "It's very 
unique." 
</P>
<P>
 Elson, who received his undergraduate schooling in California and his 
doctorate in counseling psychology from Michigan State, has led or served on 
several statewide children's services and mental health organizations. He is 
currently president of the California Mental Health Advocates for Children and 
Youth. 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure at the Sycamores, Elson's skills as a clinician, 
psychologist and administrator began to shine, said Toni E. Stone, president of 
the organization's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a person that does his homework and keeps abreast of the trends in 
therapy and funding," Stone said. "Because of this, Steve has helped give us 
the excellent reputation that we enjoy. We're going to miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard H. Goodrich, president of Casa Pacifica's board of directors, said the 
choice of Elson was an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve's clinical and academic experience was a critical factor in our 
decision," Goodrich said, "but so was his ability to deal with the financial 
aspects of running a facility such as this." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodrich added that he and the board felt confident in Elson's abilities to 
deal with the occasional problems that may arise from a close partnership with 
the county. He added that Elson's hire was unanimously approved by Casa 
Pacifica's 30-member board of directors. Elson was chosen from a field of 110 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Elson and Casa Pacifica officials declined to disclose his salary in the new 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Blesener, Ventura County's deputy director of protective services, 
called Elson's selection a smart decision for the nonprofit agency and the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have worked with him for some time in his role as a consultant on this 
project," Blesener said. "I think that because he's been through so much of the 
thought process, he's well-prepared to take this position on. From the county 
perspective, we look forward to working with him." 
</P>
<P>
 In his new job, Elson will use cognitive behavior therapy to deal with the 
outbursts and other behavior problems typical of severely abused children, he 
said. The therapy, which helps abused children learn problem-solving, 
self-management and self-awareness, was conceived in the 1960s by 
psychotherapist Aaron Beck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps them approach problems in a different way other than just lashing 
out. It lets them think through what their actions will be before they occur," 
Elson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elson said he will have to adjust to the administration of Casa Pacifica's 
temporary shelter program and its coeducational setting. The Sycamores is 
strictly a long-term program, designed only for boys who are severely 
emotionally disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Elson, who lives in the San Gabriel Valley, plans to move to Ventura County 
soon, possibly before he starts at Casa Pacifica March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The new director said there is much to do before the first child walks through 
the center's front doors in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's brand new and it's an opportunity to build something from the ground 
up," Elson said. "Existing programs are not quite as clean -- they're not truly 
yours. For that reason and others, I see this position as a tremendous 
challenge and I'm very excited about it."

A SHATTERED REFUGE; SIMI VALLEY: BOYS & GIRLS CLUB WAS HIT HARD IN EARTHQUAKE. 
PARK DISTRICT POSTPONES 50% OF ACTIVITIES IT SPONSORS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Boys & Girls Club of Simi Valley is designed to be a refuge where children 
can escape the pressures of daily life. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Northridge earthquake left the main clubhouse a shambles, causing at 
least $100,000 in damage. Yellow police tape cordons off the entryway in front 
of an overhang that dips in the center and is rippling with cracks. Inside, 
light fixtures and materials are scattered across the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mess," said Executive Director Becca Merrell. "I'm sure you've heard 
it a thousand times, but it was astounding -- like a bomb dropped. Everything 
that had been up was down." 
</P>
<P>
 Damage from the earthquake has disrupted the Boys & Girls Club and several 
other Simi Valley after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District has put 50% of its classes and 
activities on hold because of damage to several buildings. The YMCA must raise 
$16,000 to cover losses it incurred from canceling day care and other 
after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
 To resume some activities, Boys & Girls Club staff have improvised, cleaning 
up the club's recreation room and other buildings that escaped structural 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members said it was important to provide a safe place for the 70 to 90 
kids who are accustomed to spending afternoons at the club after school. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all that's happened, we want this to be at least one place the kids can 
come where they don't have to think about the earthquake," said Paula 
Mackelburg, program director for the Boys & Girls Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The club on Kadota Street in east Simi Valley was among the most damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors told club officials that the 6,000-square-foot main clubhouse -- 
which contained pool tables, couches and art materials -- was lifted off the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came down, light fixtures crashed, supplies spilled from shelves and 
walls separated from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Plexiglass windows also popped out of the 4,000-square-foot recreation room, 
and lights and debris dropped from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Club officials are searching for ways to pay for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boys & Girls Club, however, reopened in conjunction with nearby Simi 
Valley schools. Mackelburg said it is one of only a few places parents feel 
comfortable leaving their children during the hours between school and the end 
of the workday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these kids are latch-key kids, and we consider this a danger time," 
she said. "Especially now, with all of the new burdens and stresses on them, we 
want them to be comfortable here and not have them think they have no place to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping children free from stress has also been a concern of parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment in YMCA activities, which were canceled during the week after the 
quake, rose sharply last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of parents don't want to leave their kids home alone even for a few 
hours," said Jim King, the YMCA's executive director. "The children and the 
parents are still very shaken up." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents have stopped by the after-school programs to check on their children 
and make sure staff members are adequately prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had instructors who have had to pull out every item in the earthquake 
kit to show the parents we're prepared," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 The same has been true at the Boys & Girls Club, where officials have received 
dozens of calls from parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the Boys & Girls Club's parent group, Kathi Fuentevilla, has 
planned a tour of the club this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The staff here knows that parents won't be comfortable unless they see for 
themselves that it's safe," Fuentevilla said. "They know that if we're not 
comfortable our kids won't be comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Alita Martin visited the Boys & Girls Club in the middle of the afternoon 
"just to give my daughters a hug and a kiss." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be with them in case there is another earthquake," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said she has already pulled her two daughters out of an evening karate 
class at the club because the damage there frightened her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying not to show my fear on my face as I looked around, but it scares 
me," Martin said. "Maybe it's because it's at night. I just want to be with my 
kids if there's another aftershock." 
</P>
<P>
 Merrell said the club's attendance was down for a few days, but by week's end 
it was back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are trying to get their work back in order and their lives fixed up, 
and that means they have to let go of their kids for a little while," Merrell 
said. "We tried to get things fixed up here so we could be there for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who planned to enroll their children in classes or programs at the 
Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, still do not know if they will have a 
place to send their kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which runs more than 100 after-school programs for thousands of 
kids, has lost the use of several facilities because of earthquake damage. 
Others have been taken over by disaster relief workers. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the largest programs facing cancellation, said district administrator 
Jeff Anderson, is youth basketball, which involves more than 1,000 children in 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said the program's organizers have been working to arrange the use of 
outdoor courts and other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Johnson, a spokesman for the district, said more than half of the classes 
and programs have been affected. 
</P>
<P>
 "About all we could do, once all this happened, was try to juggle our 
schedules to get some of our programs going," Johnson said. "It's a shame, 
because this would be a great way for kids to keep their minds off all that's 
happened."

VOLUNTEERS RALLY TO OFFER AID TO QUAKE VICTIMS; AFTERMATH: HUNDREDS GIVE THE 
BEST OF THEMSELVES, DISTRIBUTING SUPPLIES AND BRINGING COMFORT. OFFICIALS CALL 
THEIR EFFORTS CRUCIAL. 
</P>

 Barbara Taylor runs one of the major food distribution efforts for earthquake 
victims in Fillmore -- an undertaking so massive that she has to parcel out 
assembly line shifts to volunteer food packagers at St. Francis of Assisi 
Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody needs to give," she said. "So we have people help for a little 
while and then we let someone else help." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, electronics engineer Tim Gray helped set up the American Red 
Cross shelter within hours of the Jan. 17 earthquake. He and his wife have been 
rotating shifts there between their regular jobs ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love helping people," said Gray, 26. "I'm exhausted afterward, but it makes 
me feel really good." 
</P>
<P>
 Alida Albers, 81, also has been helping quake victims in Simi Valley: visiting 
the elderly, bringing them food and water and taking them to the doctor. People 
who can't get out of their homes need her help now more than ever, said Albers, 
whose own mobile home was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take your mind off your own problems, you begin to accept them and see 
you're not as bad off as others," she said. "You have a place to stay and 
people who love you, so you try to help others." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, Gray and Albers are only three of the hundreds of people from Ventura 
County and around the nation who have volunteered to help the area's earthquake 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore Fire Chief Pat Askren and many other officials believe that the 
county's volunteer effort has been crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way we could have gotten through this without them," Askren said. 
But the volunteer effort has not surprised him, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "In every disaster, we see the true spirit of Americans coming out," he said. 
"They have compassion. They take care of each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The people who make up the county's cast of volunteers include young members 
of an Oxnard church group that barbecued hamburgers for 150 people in Piru, 
geologists who have been roaming the San Fernando Valley in search of fissures 
in the earth, and plumbers who used their weekends to go from house to house to 
restore water and gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Even massage therapists are donating their hands and time to help relieve 
stress for overworked Red Cross volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do the head, neck and shoulder massage, usually about 10- to 15-minute 
treatments," said Bernice Austin, a therapist and coordinator for the Ventura 
County Sports Massage Team and president of the local chapter of the American 
Massage Therapy Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's stressful on the hands, so we have to limit the time," she said. "We 
can't work the magic we normally do, but we'll do several techniques to relieve 
tensions that get built up." 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin (B.J.) Fessenden, a Thousand Oaks plumber, has been leading his team 
of volunteer contractors into the hard-hit Northridge area on weekends. They 
have been turning on gas and water so people can resume their lives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are so happy," he said. "The gratification is incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Fessenden said he wants more contractors to help. Those interested can call 
him at 376-2878. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Irvine, a geologist with the California Division of Mines and Geology, 
said her colleagues and others in private industry have offered their time to 
help busy experts affiliated with the U.S. Geological Survey determine whether 
the fault caused any surface ruptures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole consulting community of geologists and engineering geologists have 
been walking the mountains and driving the streets to check for cracks," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Gathering Christian Fellowship in Oxnard bought the groceries 
and then flipped the burgers for residents of Piru last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were needed," said Kendra McLaughlin. "I guess we just like to give of our 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor and Albers were already working as volunteers when disaster struck. 
Taylor organizes a weekly food giveaway for the poor at St. Francis of Assisi. 
</P>
<P>
 They help 150 families with groceries every week, she said. But since the 
earthquake, the lines have been long and constant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just here helping people like everybody else," said Taylor, who is out of 
work because the beauty parlor where she worked crumbled in the quake. She was 
amazed at how people from all over the county and outside rallied to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are going to the Price Club and loading up the station wagon and 
bringing it here," she said. "It's just wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Albers, a widow for nine years, is a stalwart among volunteers at Oasis, a 
Simi Valley organization that coordinates volunteers to visit the elderly in 
their homes and keep them out of institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to help where I can," she said. "The earthquake has brought out more 
sharing and caring for one another." But the work is tiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the earthquake, I feel like I'm 85 or 90," she said. Oasis normally has 
40 volunteers, but that number has doubled in the aftermath of the disaster, 
said Program Director Veronica Spalding. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the Red Cross volunteers, a well-organized cadre of members of 
all professions from all parts of the country. With only nine paid Red Cross 
employees in Ventura County, the volunteers are essential, said Mike Goth, 
director of emergency services for the Ventura County chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Red Cross volunteers "self-activated" according to a preset plan when the 
quake hit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley disaster team went quickly into action, calling City Hall to 
determine if shelters were needed. By midday, Goth said, a shelter was open at 
a local high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelters were also accepting victims in Fillmore by midday, "and we were 
feeding people by early afternoon," Goth said. "It took a lot of people to get 
the shelters together and get the feeding going, and those people were all 
volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
 John Hernandez, 49, of Oxnard has worked for the Red Cross for three years and 
loves the satisfaction that being a relief worker gives him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see a little boy giving you a smile, there's no words to compare 
with that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And veteran volunteer Jack Kelso of Texas isn't hard to miss at a Red Cross 
disaster site, with his white cowboy hat adorned with more than 50 brightly 
colored pins denoting various U.S. disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can look at that and tell you there's a picture or a story or a face for 
every one of those," said the Dallas resident. "My wife and I are retired and 
in good physical shape. We can't afford to write a check, but we can give our 
time and effort." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Simi Valley Federal Emergency Management Agency center set up at the 
Sycamore Community Center, volunteer Margaret Jackson, 62, was in Florida after 
Hurricane Andrew hit in 1992, and traveled three times to the Midwest during 
the floods. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Jackson said, her most important task is to help disaster victims 
keep up their spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's just trying to keep people happy who have lost everything," 
she said. "You can just look at their faces and you can see the hurt. People 
who never expected to be without a home. . . . It's a major emotional and 
financial burden for them to bear."

 During a brief ceremony, three teachers for the Santa Ana Unified School 
District last week accepted prestigious Golden Bell Awards recognizing 
exemplary educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 On behalf of the innovative programs they helped create and implement, Rageana 
Davey, Shirley Lee and Lorna Rocha received the awards, which are bestowed each 
year by the California School Board Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the association awarded eight Golden Bells to school districts 
countywide. Including the three presented on Tuesday, Santa Ana Unified has won 
26 Golden Bells since 1986, more than any other district in the state, said 
spokeswoman Diane Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Praising teachers and school officials for their support of the programs, 
Board President Sal Mendoza said: "It's individuals like you who make a 
difference and inspire kids to do over and beyond what is expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha accepted a first-place award on behalf of the Technology Learning Center 
program at Willard Intermediate. The program is designed to accelerate learning 
for students with limited English skills, as well as nurture computer literacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover Elementary School's "Reaching to the Stars" program won a second-place 
accolade. Taught by Davey, the program teams high school science students with 
children in elementary school during hands-on experiments. The younger children 
also visit high school science labs each quarter as part of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 An innovative biology program taught at Lathrop Intermediate School by Lee 
also received a second-place award. That program has students conduct 
scientific research during field trips and use the data collected to design 
research projects in the classroom. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; TEEN DIES IN GANG DISPUTE, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-ager was fatally shot as he tried to run away following a dispute over 
gang membership, Santa Ana police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old, whom police would not identify because of his age, was shot 
in the 1300 block of South Center Street, said Cpl.Bill Barrett, who said 
police are searching for three suspects in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, who was from Santa Ana, and two friends went to a party on 
Center Street shortly after midnight where they were confronted by several gang 
members, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio tried to leave the party but were followed by the gang members, who 
drove after the group, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A passenger in the car jumped out and began fighting with the victim, who was 
shot as he tried to run away, Barrett said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; SENIORS STEP OUT FOR LINE DANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With her back to the roomful of eager learners, some wearing cowboy boots and 
fringed shirts, others in sneakers, instructor Rhoda Light showed line dancing 
steps that roused these seniors to whoop it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Double left. Double right. Double left. Double right. Shuffle forward with the 
left, shuffle back with the right. With the left foot: heel, heel, toe, toe. 
Quarter turn left. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, you've got it. Let's do it!" Light said to the 69 senior citizens lined 
in rows and ready to shake, wiggle and move their feet to the beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Miller's tune, "Pennsylvania 6-5000" blared from the stereo. Smiles 
creased their faces as they danced, clapped and hollered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crank it up!" the seniors yelled. They wanted a faster song. Light played an 
upbeat country song. 
</P>
<P>
 "The music plays an important part," said Light, who uses a variety of songs 
familiar to the seniors -- oldies of the '40s and '50s, including "In the 
Mood," the "Bossa Nova," polkas and country music hits like "Boot, Scoot and 
Boogie." 
</P>
<P>
 Line dancing has become a popular pastime for the older generation at senior 
centers in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons: it's good exercise, a good time and a dancing partner isn't 
needed -- a plus for single older women and widows who usually outnumber the 
men in the classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the country-style dancing is therapeutic for both their minds and 
their bodies, Light said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's relaxing and it's therapy," said Light, 64, who teaches the 1 1/2-hour 
class Thursday afternoons at the Buena Park Senior Center and at several other 
places in North Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Light, who's been teaching line dancing to seniors for four years and has a 
loyal following, said it helps to relieve depression, ease the pain of 
arthritis, and lower cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
 It helps seniors to forget about their ailments and problems: dancing keeps 
them young. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel happy, exhilarated. It puts you in a positive, good mood," said 
George Bernard, 76, of La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvonne Greenelsh, 62, of Cypress, had never danced in her life until she took 
up line dancing three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's helped my arthritis and other medical problems," Greenelsh said. "It's a 
great feeling. Dancing makes you feel rejuvenated." 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Morgan, 70, a retired chiropractor from La Palma, said line dancing not 
only works the muscles but keeps seniors from being bored. 
</P>
<P>
 "You meet a lot of people here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors learn steps such as the electric slide or the tush-push. But they 
agreed the steps take practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you make a mistake, you just laugh at yourself -- and you do it right the 
next time," Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Odessa Irwin of Anaheim sat out the "Tennessee Twist" at a recent class. 
"That's going to take a few extra lessons," she said, adding that the only way 
to learn the steps is to keep doing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin, who's "over 70," said line dancing "is more fun than anything I've ever 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel like you're part of something. You may not be one, but you feel like 
a Rockette," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors can line dance to the music of the "Country Boys," a senior citizens 
band, on the first Friday of the month from 10 a.m. to noon at the Buena Park 
Senior Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's next performance is Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Light also teaches at the following locations: 
</P>
<P>
 * Yorba Linda, Mondays, 10 a.m., Lake Park Mobile Home Park, 3700 Rose Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anaheim, Mondays, 3 p.m., Anaheim Senior Center, 280 E. Lincoln Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fullerton, Wednesdays, 10 a.m., Fullerton Senior Center, 340 W. Commonwealth 
Ave. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; STUDENT PRAISED FOR SAFEGUARDING GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police and school officials honored a Mitchell Elementary School student last 
week for his role in finding a lost 3-year-old girl earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 During a DARE program graduation ceremony Thursday, Tan Kim, 12, received a 
medal and certificate of commendation for finding the girl and keeping her safe 
until he could tell police where she was, said Principal DeWayne Terry. 
</P>
<P>
 While riding his bike home on Jan. 15, Tan noticed the scared girl standing 
near the busy intersection of Brookhurst Street and Trask Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't know where she was going. She looked nervous," Tan said before the 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing something was wrong, he took her to a pay phone and dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wanted to go before the police got there, but I just told her, 'Wait for 
your mom,' " he said. Before long, the police and the girl's grandmother 
arrived to take her home. 
</P>
<P>
 The police "told me that I should be proud of myself," Tan said, not sounding 
convinced. Still, he added, helping someone out "feels good." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry said Tan's call to authorities was a heroic and thoughtful act of 
kindness. The police and the girl's family "were frantically searching for this 
girl. . . . They were very relieved to get that phone call." JON NALICK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: ACCORD REACHED ON HOME FOR CLINIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of negotiations, Ventura County officials say they have reached 
an agreement to purchase a building owned by Texaco for the new home of the 
west Ventura public health clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 County Public Works Director Arthur Goulet said Texaco will pay to remove 
asbestos ceiling tiles and clean up soil contamination from underground fuel 
tanks at the 133 W. Santa Clara St. site. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the supervisors will hold a final public hearing on the matter at 
10 a.m. Tuesday in their meeting room at the County Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors agreed about two months ago to move forward with 
plans to purchase the building for $1.3 million, pending the agreement with 
Texaco. The building would serve as the new site for the West Ventura Family 
Care Clinic, now operating in cramped quarters at 110 N. Olive St. TINA DAUNT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; ZONE CHANGE CLEARS WAY FOR DEVELOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a zone change that will allow a developer to 
convert the Midway City School site into a planned community of single-family 
homes despite the protest of nearby residents who are worried about traffic 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous vote last week changed the zoning designation from public 
facilities to medium-density residential for the 8.3-acre property the school 
district sold for $3.5 million last year to Kaufman & Broad-South Coast Inc., a 
Newport Beach developer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the type of project that the city needs," said Leonard Crane, a 
resident known in the community for his opposition to most council decisions. 
"We could use the money to fix up other schools." 
</P>
<P>
 But those who oppose the project said the developer's plan to build 73 homes 
on the site will bring "excessive traffic" to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they said that a medium-density designation, which is allowed for 
apartments and condominiums, is not appropriate because the surrounding area is 
zoned for single-family homes. Leonard Cowles, also a resident, said 
schoolchildren may have also gotten the "short end of the stick" because the 
property, which was closed as a school in June last year, may be needed in the 
next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But school district officials said the school site is no longer needed and 
money from the land sale will be used to repair district schools and 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Pohlson, a director at Kaufman & Broad-South Coast Inc., said a study 
reviewed by the city indicated only a minimal increase in traffic. He said 
parking problems will be handled by the homeowners association, although the 
city can enforce its parking ordinances even though the streets within the 
project are private. 
</P>
<P>
 Pohlson said the three- and four-bedroom houses, selling from $190,000 to 
$220,000, will be marketed to young families and professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is likely to begin in April, he said, and be completed later this 
year.BERT ELJERA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COLLEGE DISTRICT MAY FACE $250,000 DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's community college district may have to find up to $250,000 in 
its yearly budget to make up a possible deficit in state funding, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees of the Ventura County Community College District set aside $500,000 
last fall in a reserve fund, anticipating that the state's property tax 
projections might be too optimistic and that state education officials could 
reduce the district's spring appropriations to make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates from the state community college chancellor's office, however, show 
that the state may cut as much as $750,000 as a result of lower-than-planned 
property tax revenue, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would not advise district trustees to take the money from our reserves but 
rather, go to adjustments from our budget," said Jeff Marsee, the district's 
vice chancellor for administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's five trustees ultimately make the decision on where the money 
to make up the deficit would come from, but Marsee said administrators would 
suggest cutting supply budgets and freezing open positions. CONSTANCE SOMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH ; CABLE OPERATORS SAY COMPLAINTS SUBSIDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's two cable television operators told the City Council last week that 
a flurry of residents' complaints -- caused late last year by a change in 
billing procedures and a shuffling of channels -- has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Comcast Cablevision said September's new FCC regulations required 
cable bills to be itemized was enough to touch off thousands of complaint calls 
over a three-month period in the city. Comcast had to hire 20 additional people 
to handle the swarm of incoming calls from subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last 15 years, we have been using the same (format for) billing," 
said Comcast official Greg Mackney. The total payment "was all lumped in one 
sum and people were used to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Comcast's new monthly bills are lengthier documents full of charges and 
discounts that were previously rolled into the lump sum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the overall overload (of complaint calls) was pretty devastating," 
Mackney said. "We just needed time to work things out." 
</P>
<P>
 At Dimension Cable, Newport Beach's other cable operator, confusion was not 
triggered by itemized billing but by last summer's channel shuffling and 
downward rate changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Stucky, general manager of Dimension Cable, a Times Mirror-owned company, 
said: "Our customers didn't know what to expect. But for our customers in 
Newport Beach, our rates went down." 
</P>
<P>
 Stucky said he knows people get confused when channels begin showing up on new 
locations on the dial, but the changes were unavoidable because of FCC rules 
mandating channel space for local broadcast signals. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Ken Delino said the city had received calls last year 
from residents upset by the changes. All parties say that the kinks are worked 
out and that the level of complaints is back to a normal level. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Comcast and Dimension provide cable service in Newport Beach but in a 
non-competitive fashion. The city's neighborhoods are divided and only one 
cable service is available to each household. 
</P>
<P>
 Both operators say that television watchers also will notice this year a few 
new channels being added to their system. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Dimension subscribers this summer will begin receiving a home 
shopping channel, the Los Angeles Unified School District channel and foreign 
language channels. They are also carrying more C-SPAN, CNBC and VH-1 
broadcasts, Stucky said. BOB ELSTON

 Community service and arts organizations in the city can apply for grants

 The City Council has allocated $14,225 for grants to community services 
organizations and $10,625 for arts groups in 1994. Last year, grants ranging

children's shelters, performance troupes and singing groups, said Pamela 
Lawrence, assistant to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 All requests for funds will be considered and reviewed by a council-appointed 
committee, which makes recommendations to the council. Highest priority will be 
given to organizations and programs that provide direct service or benefit to 
the greatest number of city residents, Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications must be received by 5 p.m. Friday at City Hall, 27801 La Paz 
Road, to be considered for funding. Grant awards will be made by the City

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; STATE GIVES $398,000 FOR MENTOR PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Department of Education has given $398,000 in grants to several 
Orange County school districts for a mentor program aimed at new teachers 
overwhelmed by an increasingly demanding job. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators say that first- and second-year teachers often have trouble dealing 
with 150 students a day, especially in schools with large numbers of 
lower-income and culturally diverse students. A simple thing such as sending 
third-graders out for recess becomes a major chore for some teachers fresh out 
of college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried my whole first year of teaching," said Kim Ambrose, vice principal of 
Las Palmas Elementary School in San Clemente. "I just put my head on the desk 
and cried every day. It took me several years to feel like I could handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 The people behind Orange County's Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment 
Program hope to ease that frustration. The group, which includes six school 
districts and UC Irvine, was one of 15 programs statewide to receive grant 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, 120 new teachers will take part. Each will be assigned a fellow 
teacher for moral support. Education consultants from UC Irvine will observe 
each teacher's work and offer suggestions on teaching techniques, including 
subjects such as lesson plans and how to hand back papers more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 The six school districts participating are Santa Ana, Capistrano, Saddleback 
Valley, Tustin, Irvine and Newport-Mesa unified districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The individual districts choose from which schools new teachers can apply for 
the program. Districts officials are focusing on schools where several 
languages are spoken and have large numbers of students from low-income 
families, because those are the most challenging situations for young teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they get left on their own, they get disillusioned, overwhelmed, 
disheartened," said Carol Booth Olson, a coordinator of the beginning teacher 
program at UC Irvine. "They need someone to say, 'I've been there too. I know 
what it's like. You can handle it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second year the state has given school districts money for the 
mentor programs. The Fullerton and La Habra school districts combined to 
receive one of the 15 beginning teacher grants awarded in the 1993-94 school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The money comes from a bill that state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R -- Newport 
Beach) introduced and Governor Pete Wilson signed into law in September, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, schools cannot use the university consultants' criticisms of a 
teacher's style in hiring or firing. The program is solely designed for 
support, not job evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators said new teachers burn out easily these days because they do more 
than teach. Now, they are expected to be emotional counselors and advisers, for 
both children and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can do a great deal in terms of training and attracting people to the 
profession," said Dennis Evans, the Orange County director of the beginning 
teacher program and the associate director of the UCI education department. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think there's a real gap in what happens to those well-trained people 
when they actually get jobs. The induction years are a crucial time for the 
professional teacher." LYNN FRANEY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD, VENTURA; SUPERVISORS WILL CONSIDER GREENBELT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday will decide whether to 
ratify an agreement to establish a greenbelt between Oxnard and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Planning Department is asking the supervisors to sign off on the 
deal, which would preserve 4,575 acres of coastal land between the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the board, the agreement would be forwarded to the county's 
Local Agency Formation Commission for final consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Oxnard and Ventura officials decided to draft an accord to 
protect the land, now mostly used for farming. Both cities pledged not to annex 
the properties or allow development there. 
</P>
<P>
 The move requires the approval of the supervisors, since the land is located 
in an unincorporated county area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are prepared to go forward as the final party," said county Planning 
Director Keith A. Turner. TINA DAUNT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COUNCIL TO WEIGH CURBS ON NEON SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Undaunted by months of marathon hearings on sign-related issues, the Thousand 
Oaks City Council on Tuesday will consider tightening its codes by restricting 
the use of neon window signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's strict sign ordinance, adopted in 1964, contains no mention of 
neon.Several citizens and council members have expressed concern that this 
oversight has spawned a bevy of neon window signs, which they say creates a 
cluttered, urban look. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Mayor Elois Zeanah, one resident listed 318 neon signs on some 
of Thousand Oaks' major thoroughfares. While most establishments stuck with one 
or two signs, he found, some had four or five, and one displayed a dozen. 
</P>
<P>
 To address the problem, city staff has suggested limiting neon signs to five 
per business -- at least during a two-year pilot program. 
</P>
<P>
 But some council members want to impose even more stringent restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Schillo said he would favor a complete ban on neon signs in 
new businesses and a gradual phase-out of existing neon advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're proliferating, obviously, and we need a hiatus," Schillo said. He 
cautioned, however, that he did not want to "put someone out of business for 
having a sign that was completely legitimate at the time they put it up." 
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to consider the sign issue during the early portion 
of its agenda, which starts at 5 p.m. STEPHANIE SIMON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; CITY LOOKING AT PLAN FOR CALL-IN TV SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's Human Relations Committee decided last week to try to create a 
call-in cable television show on which residents may ask questions of public 
officials and others in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Tentatively called "Open Line Costa Mesa," the show would let people talk 
anonymously about their concerns, said committee chairwoman Karen McGlen, who 
is also the director of Share Our Selves, the county's largest direct aid 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will have to approve of the call-in show before it can 
happen, but it already has the approval of Mayor Sandra L. Genis, who serves on 
the Human Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 McGlen said callers might be able to ask the police chief about patrol issues, 
or owners of ethnic restaurants could appear on the show to answer questions 
about their food and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "People seem to have comfort in the anonymity of the telephone," McGlen said. 
"We hope it will be an opportunity for people to learn about their community." 
</P>
<P>
 Other committee members suggested the show could also be used to talk about 
illegal immigrant laborers, gangs, sexual harassment, education and senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the committee, which makes recommendations to the council, said 
they will travel to Burbank to watch the taping of a similar show that city 
produces. 
</P>
<P>
 Genis said the Burbank show started as a call-in show to the mayor, and then 
spread to include other city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee voted to ask the council for $2,600 to spend on the development 
of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members also voted to ask for $250 to continue their work on a city 
quilt. One panel of the quilt is framed on the fifth floor of City Hall, and 
enough pieces have been made by residents and local organizations to sew 
together a second panel, committee members said. WILLSON CUMMERTELEPHONE CALLS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MAN HANGS HIMSELF IN JAIL, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 38-year-old Ojai man committed suicide by hanging himself in his cell at the 
Ventura County Jail, sheriff's investigators said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Fuller, a woodworker who was arrested late Friday near Ojai on suspicion 
of being under the influence of a controlled substance, was found hanging from 
a ceiling fixture by a bedsheet at about 5 p.m. Saturday, said Cmdr.Kenneth 
Kipp. 
</P>
<P>
 Kipp said Fuller had been arrested in Meiners Oaks about 8 p.m. Friday after 
an off-duty Port Hueneme police officer spotted him acting strangely. Fuller 
was booked into the jail shortly before 9 p.m. but gave no indication of being 
despondent, Kipp said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the communications equipment in his cell was working and functioning," 
the jail commander said. "If he wanted anything, we would have responded." 
Fuller, who was in an individual cell because of past confrontations with 
inmates and staff, was last seen alive by a jailer about 1:45 p.m. Saturday, 
Kipp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Fuller had been arrested Jan. 24 on suspicion of possession 
of a controlled substance, possession of narcotics paraphernalia and being 
under the influence. But Fuller was released from Ventura County Jail on Jan. 
27, when the district attorney's office did not file charges against him within 
the three-day statutory limit, Kipp said. The next evening, Officer Dennis 
Fitzgerald told sheriff's deputies that Fuller was acting strangely outside a 
restaurant in Meiners Oaks, Kipp said. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy performed Sunday confirmed the cause of death as asphyxiation, 
Deputy Coroner Craig Stevens said. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; OFFICIAL WANTS SITE FOR TRANSIT 
CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eyeing a parcel near the Civic Arts Plaza as a site for a regional 
transportation center, Thousand Oaks' director of public works will ask the 
City Council on Tuesday to consider purchasing the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2.3-acre lot, on the southwest corner of Thousand Oaks Boulevard and 
Oakwood Drive, could be used as a transportation center for the entire Conejo 
Valley, according to a memo written by Public Works Director Donald Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 The site could accommodate terminals for Greyhound, the Great American 
Stageline, Thousand Oaks Transit and countywide buses and could offer 
passengers sheltered benches and a central ticket counter, Nelson suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "A transportation center has perpetually been on the council's list of goals," 
Councilman Frank Schillo said. "The problem was, we never had any land. Having 
it on Thousand Oaks Boulevard would be ideal." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said he could not estimate how much the land might cost or how 
expensive a transportation center might be. But he pledged to work with the 
county Transportation Commission to secure funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "One good thing that came out of earthquake is that we see the need for public 
transportation, having multiple people in cars and getting people off the 
freeway," Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 The council will decide Tuesday whether to direct staff to begin negotiating 
for the property. STEPHANIE SIMON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; RECALL SIGNATURES TARGET MAYOR, CLERK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents delivered nearly 25,000 signatures to City Hall last week to demand 
recall elections for Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and City Clerk Anne M. York. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Clerk Audrey Culver said a rough count showed 12,636 people are 
seeking a recall election for Catlin because of his vote in favor of a 2% 
utility tax, and 12,312 want to recall York because she earlier rejected recall 
petitions that were longer than the law allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver will give the signatures to the county Registrar of Voters for 
tallying. At least 8,330 valid signatures of registered Fullerton voters must 
be on each list. A recall election could be held June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall petitions aimed at City Council members Don Bankhead and Molly 
McClanahan were filed earlier in the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin, a council member since 1982, defended his vote for the utility tax, 
which ran into stiff opposition during public hearings last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin said his job is to know more about the city's fiscal situation than 
most residents and to make tough financial decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facts were on my side, the law was on my side and my philosophy was that 
I needed to protect the city's investment," Catlin said. He said he will likely 
mount a joint election campaign with fellow recall targets Bankhead and 
McClanahan, who also supported the utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 York has defended her handling of the rejected petitions, which she said 
violated state law requiring that they be shorter than 200 words. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas S. Babcock, chairman of the Fullerton Recalls Committee, said he and 
other business people began to study the 1993-94 budget early last spring and 
believed that a utility tax was not needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had cut 2% across the board, then there wouldn't be a problem," 
Babcock said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the recall campaign was started because the council refused to approve 
an advisory vote on the tax by residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you truly represent the majority of the people, then you should put it out 
as an advisory vote and let the people decide," Babcock said. WILLSON CUMMER

3 ARRESTED IN HUNTINGTON ROBBERY, BEATING 
</P>

 Three transients were arrested on suspicion of armed robbery late Saturday

UCI BENEFIT SERVES FOOD FOR THOUGHT; 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' WRITER KENEALLY ASKS 
GUESTS TO PONDER HOW HOLOCAUST COULD HAVE HAPPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling it the world's "most extreme case of race hate" author Thomas Keneally 
spoke of the Holocaust at a recent gala dinner on behalf of UC Irvine's Program 
in Writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the case in which the organs of a government were devoted to 
producing death of a minority as an industrial product. This was as far as you 
can go in race hate -- the furthest track of the line," said the author of 
"Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 Not your everyday gala topic. But just the kind of point guests had paid $150 
each to ponder. 
</P>
<P>
 "How is it possible that cultured Europeans did this thing?" Keneally asked 
the crowd gathered at Gustaf Anders restaurant in Santa Ana. "And, why can't we 
let it go?" 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity to address those questions and write about the paradoxical 
Oskar Schindler -- "both profiteer and savior, scoundrel and deliverer" -- are 
at the heart of his 397-page book that became the film by Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to comprehend it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Keneally praised the movie, he said he might have changed the ending. "I 
thought it was a bit unlikely that Schindler would have broken down," he noted 
during the cocktail reception. "Schindler went on black marketeering right till 
the end of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, that's a small quibble with what is a massively authoritative film. 
If anyone's going to have a quibble, it's going to be the author of the 
original work. The mother-in-law at the wedding is not permitted to approve of 
the oaf or bimbo their child is marrying, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 Will he and his wife, Judy, attend the Academy Awards? "I haven't heard a 
word," said the Australian who came to Orange County in 1992 to become director 
of UCI's Program in Writing. "We attended the New York and Washington film 
premieres with Spielberg. But I'm not sure the Academy Awards is a place for a 
writer, with all of that sex and drugs and rock and roll." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy thinks it would be just fine. "I called Amblin Studios (Spielberg's 
studio) today to ask them about tickets," she said. "Our daughter, Jane, says 
we should go. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me they don't know what they will be offering until Feb. 9 when the 
Oscar nominations come out." 
</P>
<P>
 Party guests schmoozed with the jovial Keneally, offering comments on the book 
and film, before they sat down to a formal dinner with choices of Chilean sea 
bass or braised lamb shank. Favors were autographed copies of "Schindler's 
List." 
</P>
<P>
 "I read the book in 1983, when it first came out," said Spencer Olin, the 
university's dean of humanities. "I had no idea that I would ultimately be a 
colleague of Tom Keneally's." 
</P>
<P>
 Olin says he is grateful for the publicity that "Schindler's List" has brought 
to UCI's Program in Writing, a graduate course of study that has turned out 
authors such as Michael Chabon ("The Mysteries of Pittsburgh"), Whitney Otto 
("How to Make an American Quilt") and Marti Leimbach ("Dying Young"). 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere Tom Keneally goes, everywhere he gives a reading, every review of 
the film, brings the good name of UCI to international acclaim," Olin said. "He 
is the most unpretentious celebrity I have ever known. I am proud to be his 
colleague." 
</P>
<P>
 Also among guests were Irv and Gloria Gellman, Louise and Howard Adler, 
Hancock and Julia Banning III, Eric and Lila Nelson, Nola Schneer, John and 
Elizabeth Stahr and Jonas and Viviane Schultz. 
</P>
<P>
 University representatives included Vice Chancellor Kathy Jones; Michael 
Clark, chair of English and comparative literature; Paul Silverman, newly 
appointed associated chancellor for the development of health sciences, with 
his wife, Nancy; and novelist Judith Grossman, a professor in the writing 
program. 
</P>

<P>
 Hog Wild for Hoag: Duds befitting a biker bar -- black lace tops, leather 
jackets, head kerchiefs and dangly earrings -- were the last word in gala-wear 
on Friday night when 1,500 people celebrated the Taco Bell Newport Classic 
under a mega-tent at the Newport Beach Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those strutting their biker stuff were Taco Bell President and CEO John 
Martin and his main squeeze, Stefanie Mayer. "I own a Harley motorcycle," said 
Martin, who was Harley-dressed from the top of his head (black kerchief) to the 
tip of his toes (biker boots). 
</P>
<P>
 Mayer wore a see-through lace Harley top she'd purchased at a specialty shop 
in Santa Ana. "It should fit tighter," she said. "But they were all out of the 
smaller sizes." 
</P>
<P>
 While her breezy chemise got the night's lion share of stares, it was Mayer's 
belt that made the biggest fashion statement. "It's made from tire rubber," she 
said, smiling. "And it's studded with Budweiser beer caps." Oh, and the buckle. 
"It's a seat-belt buckle ," she said, snapping it with her thumb. "Don't you 
love it?" 
</P>
<P>
 When guests weren't ogling each others' clothing, they were feasting at buffet 
stations piled with food from area restaurants, getting "engraved" at a tattoo 
parlor, or listening to a concert by Huey Lewis and the News. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected proceeds of more than $200,000 will be used for the expansion and 
renovation of Hoag Hospital's Emergency Care Unit. The annual event is 
organized by Hoag's 552 Club support group.

 When someone blows a "silent" dog whistle, you don't hear a thing. But your 
dog sure does. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs can hear certain sounds a lot better than people can. 
</P>
<P>
 Your dog's ears look very different from those of people. But they work the 
same basic way. A dog's hearing -- and yours -- takes place in a small tube 
deep inside the ear. Within this tube are nerve cells. They send sound messages 
to the brain. A dog's nerve cells are more sensitive than yours, so they pick 
up some sounds when yours can't. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound travels through the air as invisible waves. These waves move back and 
forth, making tiny flutters called vibrations. The faster a sound wave 
vibrates, the higher the sound is. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound waves coming from the dog whistle vibrate very fast. The sound is 
higher than your ears can bear. But your dog's ears can easily pick up the 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Woof!

THE RULES OF THE ROAD; COMMUTING: BE NICE TO THE DRIVER. THE ROACHES DON'T 
BITE. BE ON TIME. HERE, IN BUS RIDING 101, ARE THE IMPORTANT THINGS 
QUAKE-INDUCED ROOKIES SHOULD KNOW.

 Their suits are a little too pressed. Their eyes dance alertly and excitedly, 
maybe out of fear -- but probably because gritty urban experiences are new to 
them and the novelty hasn't worn off. 
</P>
<P>
 I speak of the new breed of bus riders. 
</P>
<P>
 It took an earthquake to get them out of their cars and onto the buses, but 
they aren't committed commuters yet. More like tourists, checking things out. 
</P>
<P>
 They give off an E-ride excitement that screams: "Gee-whiz, I'm actually 
riding the bus. Ain't this fun!" 
</P>
<P>
 And when they're not being wide-eyed, they're packing attitude, arriving on 
board dishing out tons of condescension. This may work in executive suites or 
health clubs, but not on buses. Buses, like earthquakes, are great social 
levelers. It is a wise commuter who remembers that in this world, it is the 
driver who is in charge of dispensing attitude adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the bus culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you learn a few simple rules, things will get a whole lot easier and you 
might even enjoy the ride. Lots of us do. What follows is a 10-point program 
that will help get you there and back with a minimum of aggravation. 
</P>
<P>
 Point One: It pays to be courteous to the driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers are good friends to have. They'll look and even wait for you at pickup 
points, and they'll make sure you don't sleep through your stop. On the other 
hand, riders who openly complain or insult their drivers by telling them how 
they can cut five minutes off the commute had better be ready to step up when 
the bus arrives. And if you're running late, you'd better be wearing running 
shoes because drivers aren't going to wait. They might even give the 
accelerator a little nudge to speed up a bit. Pay-back time. 
</P>
<P>
 Point Two: Look before you sit. You never know what to expect. Gum, puke, food 
crumbs and other stuff may be there. Bring along a rag to give your seat a 
once-over. 
</P>
<P>
 Point Three: The roaches don't bite. 
</P>
<P>
 New riders are sometimes startled to see a fat bug waddling down the aisle, 
blissfully ignorant of the havoc it's creating. Some people have even been 
known to shriek. Not to worry. They are harmless. On the other hand, don't pet 
the creatures. On a bus, you never know where they've been. 
</P>
<P>
 Point Four: Be on time. 
</P>
<P>
 A popular misconception is that buses run late. Wrong. If the bus stops at 
your corner at 5:42, be ready to eat exhaust fumes if you arrive at 5:43. On 
the other hand, don't schedule surgery and expect the bus to get you there on 
time. Buses overheat, break down and get caught in traffic jams just like cars. 
Sometimes they are very late. This usually happens when you need them the most. 
</P>
<P>
 Point Five: No one talks in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Exchanging pleasantries and small talk may be more tolerable during the 
evening commute, but don't try it in the morning. There is a good reason for 
this: Commuting by bus is a no-brainer from start to finish, so people don't 
wake up until they have to. They kind of stumble on board half-asleep. In such 
a state, they don't appreciate being awakened. 
</P>
<P>
 Point Six: Do your nails at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipping nails, putting on nail polish or pulling out an emery board in a bus 
is inviting trouble. Few things seem to bring out the worst in bus riders, but 
doing a manicure is one of them. Nail polish is smelly enough to overwhelm even 
highway stink, which is saying a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Point Seven: Beware the windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing, even nails, can touch off an on-board disturbance like windows. Buses 
have two levels of air conditioning: none or cold enough to refrigerate meat. 
But opening a window for relief, even a crack, can create a monster draft. 
Newspapers fly, bad hair days develop and mini-twisters swirl down aisles, 
picking up dirt, candy wrappers and other bus litter. Best to reach a consensus 
with other riders on this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Point Eight: Buy a pass. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the advice from a veteran driver, who says bus passes can help you 
avoid problems created when you leave your exact change as a lunch tip or have 
only a $10 bill and must beg other riders for change. Besides, pulling out big 
bills on buses can be risky. "Some bus lines are OK. You can carry $1,000 on 
you and not worry. But others, I wouldn't get on with a nickel in my pocket," 
one driver said.  
</P>
<P>
 Point Nine: Learn street-corner camouflage. 
</P>
<P>
 Bus riders do a lot of standing around Downtown street corners, so learning 
how to blend into the background is critical. Grungy raincoats help, 
particularly if they cover up designer suits. Looking prosperous or 
compassionate doesn't work here. You might as well hang a sandwich board around 
your neck saying, "Panhandlers! I'm fresh meat. Molest me." Veteran riders 
avoid eye contact and master these glazed, bored looks that say, quietly but 
firmly: "Go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Point 10: Think about a survival kit. 
</P>
<P>
 When you're all alone out there, with nothing but 20 or so miles of hard road 
ahead, you may find it handy to pack a radio. Earplugs help for the times when 
you get stuck next to a noisy window that wants to shake itself loose or if you 
happen to sit in front of people who shout as if they're in a wind tunnel. 
Maybe add a book or two so you can look busy when some newcomer gets on and 
wants to chat. 
</P>

RUNNING THE RISK; WHY WOULD SOMEONE ENTER A SHAKY BUILDING? TO GRAB ANYTHING, 
EVEN NAILS, LINKING THEM TO AN OLD LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Andre Rogers was trembling and out of breath from his last dash into the ruins 
of his condemned apartment. But he was smiling. "Jesus didn't save me from a 
6.6 quake to kill me now 'cause I came back for my shoes. No sir. No sir. If I 
didn't die at 4:31 a.m., I'm not going to die now. I believe it!" 
</P>
<P>
 In the days after the Northridge earthquake, Rogers, 26, and thousands of 
other survivors continue to risk life and limb sneaking back into the unstable 
rubble they once called home. 
</P>
<P>
 And they are doing it for every imaginable reason -- or non-reason, depending 
on your perspective.  
</P>
<P>
 A young woman climbs through a broken window to rescue a parakeet trapped in a 
collapsed kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 A man slides down the 45-degree incline of his sunken living room to grab a 
stack of CDs he "can't live without." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Taylor, 51, ducks under a newly fallen I-beam in the carport beneath his 
Granada Hills apartment complex to retrieve a can of nails. "I needed them to 
hang some pictures in my new place," he says with a shrug.  
</P>
<P>
 A man in a baseball cap pulls up his truck to the front of a condo on the 
outskirts of Reseda. Without a word, he hands each of his teen-age sons a 
hammer and leads them into the ruins of their home. 
</P>
<P>
 Quickly and quietly, they empty the swaying rooms of what little is left. Ten 
nerve-racking minutes later, the 13-year-old has retrieved two plastic milk 
crates and an old football. His 17-year-old brother has rescued a pink receipt 
for a lottery ticket and a cork bulletin board papered with family messages and 
reminders of long-passed doctors' appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aren't you afraid to go in there?" the older boy is asked. "Oh, well, sure, 
'cause it's unsafe. But Dad says we're not scared -- I mean, Dad says it's OK. 
So we're not scared. . . . You do what you gotta do sometimes, right? That's 
what Dad says." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What makes people take such risks? When is a human life worth a can of nails? 
</P>
<P>
 In the throes of disaster, psychologists agree, people cannot be expected to 
always act rationally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, this sort of behavior is irrational, but it's not abnormal -- not 
for what these people have been through. Emotions are never rational," says 
Carl Frederick, the UCLA professor who wrote the mental health section of the 
national Disaster Relief Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett, 35, has been in and out of his condemned apartment several times. The 
first time was for blankets and water to get through the first day and night. 
The second time was to save his late grandmother's "truly irreplaceable" Bible. 
"I couldn't have lived with myself if I hadn't got that out," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Brett feared for his life when he was caught in his shaky building 
during one of the aftershocks, he says what he feared most was being caught by 
police. "That's why I'm not giving you my last name. I'm an artist and I've had 
to get all sorts of important pieces out of my place, but I don't want to go to 
jail for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Entering a condemned building is a violation of the Los Angeles Municipal Code 
and is punishable by fines of up to $1,500 and six months imprisonment. The law 
is designed to protect displaced residents from their perilous impulses. But as 
fears grow for the safety of those entering buildings severely damaged by the 
quake and aftershocks, building and fire officials are mobilizing inspection 
and escort services to help survivors retrieve belongings from structures in no 
immediate danger of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "But people going in alone past the red condemned signs may very well be 
risking their lives," warns Robert Picott, deputy superintendent of the city's 
Building and Safety Department. "We understand how traumatized these people are 
and we're willing to help them, but our first obligation is to protect them 
from harm." 
</P>
<P>
 Fierce attachments to our belongings are not unique to Americans. Medical 
psychologist Frederick, who has studied survivors' reactions to disaster all 
over the world, says we may indeed be materialistic, but such feelings are even 
more intense in other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "After Hurricane Fifi hit Honduras in 1974, 5,000 people lost their homes and 
it was like losing a part of themselves," Frederick recalls. "When they were 
told they could never return, hundreds of them committed suicide. They died 
rather than leave that piece of land. If somebody in Beverly Hills had lost 
their home and were told to move and get another one some place else, they 
wouldn't kill themselves over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is not unusual in times of great loss for some victims to seem 
possessed by their possessions, says Barbara Blasdel, a San Francisco trauma 
therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pick things that will give us some sense of control. An old pair of shoes 
may be a sign of comfort. It's a way of trying to impose some sort of control 
over the chaos," Blasdel says. "Going back for something is a way of reaching 
back for fragments of their old lives so they can start again. Even if it is 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 But the very danger of going back may be comforting -- or at least distracting 
-- for others, suggests psychologist Keith Johnsgard, who has spent four 
decades studying risk-taking behavior.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sensation-seeking is a basic human trait with a biological component. Some of 
us are just born at the high end of the scale," says Johnsgard, 66, who 
recently gave up parachuting so it wouldn't interfere with his mountain 
climbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cops and robbers, parachuters, mountain climbers all tend to have low levels 
of (the brain chemical) serotonin. Maybe risk is the body's way of adjusting 
for that. We really don't know. But we do know that risk-takers assess risk 
differently than everybody else. And more likely than not, they tend to be 
young and they tend to be men. What would be very scary for many of us would be 
exciting for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Rogers, panting from the last trip into his unsteady apartment, is 
stopped short by a question from the sidewalk. "Would I die for this pair of 
shoes?  
</P>
<P>
 "Whoa. I didn't think about that. What I was thinking was I just got to take 
the chance, got to take the chance."

KING CROWNED WITH SCOPUS AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIDGET BYRNE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I miss my suspenders," said Larry King, explaining that his fiance, Rama Fox, 
had made him wear a cummerbund to keep his formal trousers in place. 
</P>
<P>
 However, King's signature red suspenders were still much in evidence Saturday 
night, adorning the cover of the program for the 24th Scopus Award gala and 
mentioned in various speeches, as the television talk show host was honored by 
the American Friends of Hebrew University. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jackson had been the original choice of honoree for this year but, 
elated that the event is expected to raise over $1 million to endow scholars in 
King's name, Harvey Silbert, chairman of the board of the organization's 
Western States Region, had no wish to dwell on the details of the change. 
Silbert said only that the beleaguered pop star withdrew "when his problems 
suggested he might not be available." The board then invited King to accept. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather be Angie Dickinson," said King, noting that he'd be more 
comfortable standing in Dickinson's slot as the evening's emcee, rather than 
being the focus of all the attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not taking any chances, I'm going to wear my glasses," the 
ultra-glamorous Dickinson told the audience crowding the Beverly Hilton 
ballroom, as she donned glittering black and silver spectacles to read her 
introduction. 
</P>
<P>
 The room around her sparkled too. The tablecloths were fashionably silver and 
on their own Phyllis McGuire's diamonds lit up the head dais. Also seated there 
were Dustin and Lisa Hoffman, dinner co-chairwoman Barbara and Marvin Davis and 
columnist Art Buchwald, who claimed he has known King "since we first worked 
together on the Al Gore Comedy Hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment was provided by Vic Damone, joined in song at one moment by 
Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme and interrupted by quips from Milton Berle. As a 
plus, Connie Stevens, whose Forever Springs beauty products were the party 
favors, led the crowd in a happy birthday greeting to a flirtatious, bantering 
George Burns, who turned 98 on Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Honored for "the art of communication," King credited "the curiosity I've 
always had" for his success as an interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good music. His interviews are rhythmic. He establishes a beat," said 
Hoffman, snapping his fingers as he tried to explain King's skill at drawing 
out his subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 After accepting the award, presented by Davis, Silbert and former Israeli 
ambassador to the U.S. and Hebrew University vice president Moshe Arad, King 
said "I am seldom without a word, but this is one of those seldoms."  
</P>
<P>
 He then paid tribute to his mother, Jennie Zeiger, who died in 1976 without 
having fulfilled her wish to see Israel. "If she was here, or if she is here 
tonight, I know what is going through her heart and mind when she sees her 
little son from Brooklyn standing here," said King.  
</P>
<P>
 He sent the crowd home laughing at his story of the rabbi he met at the 
Western Wall in Jerusalem who asked "What's with Perot?" and a series of Yogi 
Berra jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 The program had moved along so snappily that it never got "late early out 
there," as Berra would have said.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: DOCTOR'S HEALING TOUCH TESTED AMID QUAKE'S 'COMBAT ZONE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 David Frankle is an emergency room doctor who likes to leave them laughing as 
he mends and tends folks at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankle is one of those high-intensity doctors who has handled all manner of 
medical emergencies, from the patient who came in with a barbecue fork stuck in 
his scalp to the suicidal guy who wanted to deck Frankle for saving his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm good for the first 20 minutes of any medical emergency," says the 
44-year-old emergency medical specialist, with his ever-present laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, about 4:30 a.m., something temporarily wiped the smile off his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankle, who had been working the 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift, had been tending to 
the usual assortment of medical problems, including a man suffering with kidney 
stones, a woman with gall bladder problems and a constipated baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with a roll like thunder and a violent series of jolts, Frankle was 
thrown six feet across the room. 
</P>
<P>
 The lights went out and, for a few moments, Frankle lay in stunned silence. 
</P>
<P>
 A few seconds later, the auxiliary generators turned the lights back on and 
Frankle picked himself up and started looking for his patients. The man with 
kidney stone problems had fallen off the gurney. Frankle helped him up and went 
to check on the gall bladder patient and the constipated baby and his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tended to them as quickly as possible and sent them home," he says. "They 
were eager to get out to see what had happened." 
</P>
<P>
 For the rest of the day, the emergency room was jammed with people suffering 
from every imaginable injury, even though the hospital was officially closed 
because no one could be admitted as an in-patient. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were severely crippled," says Frankle, "with broken water pipes and other 
fallout from the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the auxiliary generators could supply lights to the ER, we still had 
little power in the rest of the building," he remembers. "We didn't even have 
X-rays. I was setting dislocated shoulders by administering pain killers and 
then cracking them back into place." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the hospital's in-patients were transferred to facilities in other 
areas. "Most of the hospitals around Holy Cross were either packed to capacity 
or were also shut down," Frankle says. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10:30 a.m. -- then in his 16th hour of emergency doctoring -- Frankle went 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had not been able to reach my wife, so for a couple of hours I didn't know 
how she was and I was worried about our 9-month-old baby," says Frankle. 
</P>
<P>
 The next days in the emergency room saw one crisis after another. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a situation like the earthquake, people need to feel that things will get 
back to normal," says Frankle. "When people are edgy and nervous it is a good 
time to inject a little humor. As the rock 'n' rolling continued, I kept going 
out into the waiting room to thank everyone for being patient and telling them 
to think of the aftershocks as a free Magic Mountain ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankle is no stranger to combat-zone medicine: In 1980, he served four months 
as a medic for the United Nations in the killing fields of Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
 After Cambodia, he took time to enjoy life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a professional ski bum for a number of months," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as things struggle toward normalcy at the Holy Cross emergency room, 
Frankle is still thinking about the morning of the Pretty Big One. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt sorry for all those who were hurt and frightened but the first few 
days were medical magic for me. It is the first time in a long time, I just got 
to treat my patients without worry about the paperwork and without having to 
fight for approval to act," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just pure doctoring," says Frankle. "It was great." No Real Need for 
'Where Were You's' 
</P>
<P>
 For 30 years, people old enough to remember have recited where they were when 
John F. Kennedy was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be little of that with the Northridge earthquake, because unless 
you are an emergency room doctor or some kind of furry night-flying mammal, you 
were probably in bed. Most of us, however, will remember what happened as the 
sun came up and we could see our surroundings clearly. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of us were not happy with the visuals, but were happy to be alive. Most 
of us gave up our long-standing rules about love, but do not disturb, your 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Sullivan of Sherman Oaks is a case in point. She has visited with her 
neighbors once, and only once, a year for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a barbecue in the summer at someone's house," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But the earthquake brought about that old communal feeling. Like neighbors all 
across the Valley, her crowd almost automatically pulled together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all at each other's house to see if everyone and everything was all 
right. That night we had a midseason barbecue for everyone," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Golden of Woodland Hills says her neighbors have always stuck together 
in good times and bad. She was the one, however, who went on the morning 
battery run. 
</P>
<P>
 "By 9 a.m. there was not a battery left in any of the stores around us, so I 
just headed out until I found enough for our neighborhood. In Pasadena," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten days after the quake it was still a mob scene at Winnetka Park, where 
dozens of families where still camping out. But something interesting was 
happening there. 
</P>
<P>
 The once tightly drawn lines between officials and victims were breaking down 
rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus heroes of the park -- the Red Cross and Salvation Army people -- 
were sitting down with those camping out to eat the food the organizations had 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone's exhaustion had made them feel almost like family, one Red Cross 
volunteer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if there was a language barrier, there was a sense of community. 
Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "I resent those East Coast newscasters who presume to know what Southern 
Californians are thinking. I particularly don't like them trying to pump up the 
emotional volume on people who are faced with a lot of challenges just so the 
television programs will get bigger ratings."

SUNDANCE SURPRISES; FESTIVAL: TOM NOONAN'S 'WHAT HAPPENED WAS' IS AN UNEXPECTED 
WINNER, TAKING HOME TWO MAJOR TROPHIES. 'FREEDOM ON MY MIND' IS ANOTHER 
DARK-HORSE VICTOR.

<P>
 In a competition rife with the natterings of disgruntled 20-year-olds, one of 
the few films to deal maturely with adult concerns ended up being the Sundance 
Festival's surprise big winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Happened Was," written and directed by actor Tom Noonan, who also 
co-starred, won both the Grand Jury Prize for dramatic films and the Waldo Salt 
screenwriting award at Saturday night's typically chaotic presentation 
ceremony. Noonan, appearing in a play in New York, could not attend, though 
co-producer Robin O'Hara, who hastened to accept, assured everyone that, "Tom's 
going to go nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Developed by the actor as a break from the chilling villains he's played in 
"Manhunter" and "Last Action Hero," "Happened" is a two-character, one-set 
drama detailing a painfully nervous first date between co-workers (Noonan and 
Karen Sillas) in a Manhattan law firm. Compellingly written and acted, it 
paints an achingly realistic picture of people desperately trying to connect. 
</P>
<P>
 In even more of an upset, the Grand Jury prize for documentaries went to the 
powerful "Freedom on My Mind," a vivid and informative evocation of the 
Mississippi Voter Registration Project of the early 1960s. Co-directed by 
Berkeley-based filmmakers Connie Field and Marilyn Mulford, who said they 
hadn't expected to win, "Freedom" combines archival footage and contemporary 
interviews in a way that is both thoughtful and passionate. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly winning the Audience Award for documentary was the nearly 
three-hour "Hoop Dreams," nominally a movie about sports but in truth an 
examination of a complex, multilayered social reality. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago-based filmmaking team (director and co-producer Steve James and 
co-producers Fred Marx and Bill Haugse) spent four-and-a-half years shooting 
250 hours of film detailing not only the careers but also the private lives of 
a pair of gifted high school basketball players who fantasize about a career in 
the NBA as a way out of the poverty of their surroundings. "Hoop Dreams" 
revitalizes this familiar tale, managing to be surprising and emotionally 
potent as well as offering a devastating look at the realities of life in the 
inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Audience Award for drama went to "Spanking the Monkey," one of the 
festival's many forays into the world of dysfunctional families. "Fun," a 
similarly unhappy scenario despite its title, won Special Jury Recognition for 
its two stars, Alicia Witt and Renee Humphrey, who play a pair of 
bratty-to-the-max teens who make Leopold and Loeb look well-adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
 Also winning Special Recognition for acting was Sean Nelson, the 13-year-old 
star of "Fresh." That unlikely combination of social consciousness and crime 
melodrama also earned a share of the Filmmakers Trophy, voted on by the other 
competition directors, for writer-director Boaz Yakin. 
</P>
<P>
 The other half of the Filmmakers Trophy went to "Clerks," whose odyssey from 
its festival-low $27,575 budget to a distribution deal with Miramax is 
Sundance's most unlikely success story. The film also provided the evening's 
most appropriate acceptance speech, courtesy of 
writer-actor-director-co-producer Kevin Smith: "This is a really cool piece of 
glass." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a clerk himself, told Filmmaker magazine that he one day realized 
"there had never been a convenience store movie." The money for this epic came 
from "a supply of eight or 10 credit cards with $2,000 limits" plus the tuition 
he saved from dropping out of film school. Shooting nights, when the store he 
worked in was closed, Smith usually got no more than one hour of sleep per day, 
and was finally so deprived he slept through the shooting of the film's 
climatic sequence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Filmmakers Trophy, documentary division, happily went to "Theremin: An 
Electronic Odyssey," which seems at first like nothing more than an eccentric 
footnote to musical history that describes the life of a charismatic Russian 
genius named Leon Theremin. 
</P>
<P>
 The instrument he invented and named after himself marked the beginning of 
electronic music, and its haunting, unworldly sound can be heard in everything 
from movies such as "The Day the Earth Stood Still" to the Beach Boys' "Good 
Vibrations." But Theremin's life suddenly took a turn right out of a John Le 
Carre novel, and director Steven M. Martin (a former Nuart Theater 
projectionist) gracefully follows all its fascinating turns with unfailing wit 
and intelligence and turns "An Electronic Odyssey" into the most delightful of 
long, strange trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suture," a film noir knockoff beautifully shot in wide screen black and 
white, took the Cinematography award for drama for director of photography Greg 
Gardiner, while the sepia hues of Morten Sandtroen won on the documentary side 
for "Colorado Cowboy: The Bruce Ford Story," which proves once again that very 
few things are as photogenic as men of the American West. Unfortunately, the 
clip that was shown when the award was announced was stock rodeo footage, 
causing Sandtroen to dryly note as he held the trophy, "I should find out who 
shot that and pass this along." 
</P>
<P>
 Also winning awards were a trio of documentaries. "Coming Out Under Fire," a 
look at gay and lesbian veterans of World War II, received a Special Jury Award 
for Technical Excellence. Both "Heart of the Matter," an examination of women 
with AIDS, and "Dialogues With Madwomen," offering candid tales of terrifying 
mental breakdowns and how they were treated, shared the Freedom of Expression 
Award. "Dialogues" director Allie Light made the evening's most eloquent 
acceptance, talking of "the nature of hope: The more you put it down, the more 
it seems to rise like a wild dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially on its final weekend, when table-hopping at the Barking Frog and 
the Riverhorse Cafe reached epidemic proportions, this was the year when the 
Hollywood presence at Sundance threatened to get out of hand. The crush to get 
into the world premier of the Coen brothers' "The Hudsucker Proxy," complete 
with roped-off seats and Warner Bros.' executives on walkie-talkies, was 
uncomfortably close to an L.A. industry event. 
</P>
<P>
 But for every refugee from Morton's in a parka, there were people like the 
couple from Juneau, Alaska, who planned their vacation around the festival 
because they can't see Sundance-type films at home. And for every 
studio-released film that premiered with reserved seats with executives names 
on them, there were movies like "Darkness In Tallinn." 
</P>
<P>
 This Estonian/Finnish co-production not only kept coming up with new wrinkles 
in its mimeographed posters ("Dare to Cast the First Estone" read one, 
"Starring Sly Estallone and Sharon Estone" read another), it started its 
screenings with a live a capella version of what was claimed to be the Estonian 
national anthem by the film's director and producer. If Sundance can keep 
producing moments like that, it won't have to worry about losing its soul.

COMMERCE, NOT ART, THE GAME AT SUNDANCE; BUT DESPITE ALL THE SALES TALK, IT'S 
STILL THE TOP U.S. FILM FEST FOR INDEPENDENTS, SHORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Steven Soderberg, whose "sex, lies, & videotape" was the toast of the 1989 
Sundance Film Festival, is sitting in a corner of a typically overpacked party, 
grumbling about the "encroachment of commerce" eclipsing art at this important 
annual showcase for independent movies. 
</P>
<P>
 After flying in from his home in Virginia to help promote "Suture," which he 
executive-produced, at this year's festival, Soderberg takes a sip of beer and 
observes, at the risk of sounding arrogant: "Since 1989, it's never been the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, when he emerged as one of the hottest young filmmakers around, 
Sundance "wasn't overrun by agents -- it hadn't become a deal market, a sales 
place," Soderberg says. The shift, he says, came in 1990 when "suddenly this 
festival became this feeding frenzy, and it was no longer about art." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sex, lies," made on a budget of $1.2 million, was the first breakout hit 
discovered at Sundance, grossing $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when everyone started taking this festival so seriously," agrees Fine 
Line Pictures President Ira Deutchman over lunch at one of Hollywood's favorite 
ski hangouts, the posh Stein Eriksen Lodge in neighboring Deer Valley. "The 
next year it was inundated with agents and studio executives." 
</P>
<P>
 Deal makers traditionally descend on this picturesque mountain town during the 
second half of the 10-day January festival, their cellular phones popping up 
like mushrooms in the night. Competition for talent and films is so fierce that 
many contracts are signed weeks, even months, before Sundance begins. Business 
and schmoozing spill onto the streets, the ski slopes and into restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is dismayed by that. Many filmmakers covet the attention they 
receive from Hollywood, foreign buyers and the national press, because it 
increases the likelihood of landing an agreement to get their movie into the 
marketplace. Just about anyone you ask here says the festival, run by Robert 
Redford's Sundance Institute, is still the premier American film festival for 
independent features, documentaries and shorts.  
</P>
<P>
 Beth Swofford of the William Morris Agency, who signed two young filmmakers -- 
Matty Rich ("Straight Out of Brooklyn") and Richard Linklater ("Slackers") -- 
out of the festival three years ago, says agents track projects far in advance 
of Sundance and often sign talent at the script stage. 
</P>
<P>
 One agent left 2 1/2 days early this year "because 90%-95% of the people that 
made movies here were already signed. . . . If you haven't seen the films 
before the festival, I'd say the ship has sailed by the time you get there." 
The same holds for distributors looking for new movies to release. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much more competitive for those few films that distributors recognize 
have the right elements like the right marketing hook," says Howard Cohen, head 
of acquisitions for the Samuel Goldwyn Co., which picked up the popular, edgy 
lesbian movie "Go Fish" early in the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For all the intense deal making and schmoozing, however, Sundance also remains 
a haven for its original following of Hollywood wanna-bes, art-house 
intellectuals and plain old moviegoers -- more than 6,000 of them this year. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not unusual during the festival to overhear participants dissecting dolly 
shots, decrying commercialization of art or sharing production financing 
headaches inside Z Place, the perpetually buzzing festival headquarters. The 
conversations persist inside shuttle buses, where one driver had to break up a 
violent argument between two passengers over the merits of film violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Routine conversation is difficult at festival parties, which are so crowded 
that people can barely breathe or move, let alone speak. Even though the 
parties -- largely hosted by film companies and agents and often held in 
exclusive condominiums -- are by invitation, gate crashing is common. 
</P>
<P>
 Get-togethers take on a frat party-like atmosphere, as lines of young people 
stream up from restaurants and screenings to mingle into the morning hours. One 
of this year's hot tickets was the Disney Channel's Tuesday-night bash for "The 
Who's 'Tommy': The Amazing Journey," a documentary on the history of the rock 
opera. The party, held in a small condo, became so crowded that some people 
left early, fearing the wooden outdoor deck would collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 The next night, the two places to be were Deer Valley parties hosted by the 
Samuel Goldwyn Co. and the William Morris Agency/20th Century Fox. A caravan of 
Ford Explorers -- the rental car of choice here -- steadily made their way up 
to the mountainside bashes in the face of a heavy snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Miramax Films, which is distributing "Sirens," hosted a classy sit-down dinner 
at one of the festival's most popular restaurants, the Riverhorse Cafe, where 
journalists hobnobbed with "Sirens" stars Hugh Grant and Elle MacPherson and 
director-screenwriter John Duigan. A Sony Classics/ HBO-sponsored party with 
live music by Los Lobos evolved into a mob scene so intense that even an 
unhappy Danny DeVito reportedly couldn't get in. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicity stunts are rare at Sundance. But one creative exception was a trail 
ride orchestrated by Clein + White to promote Arthur Elgort's "Colorado Cowboy: 
The Bruce Ford Story," about a renowned rodeo champion. (On Saturday night, the 
film won the festival's award for best cinematography for a documentary.) 
Reporters followed Ford on horseback down a snowy and muddy trail through the 
scenic countryside outside Park City. Director Elgort, a former fashion 
photographer, revealed that he had never been on a horse, but said, "I don't 
play the violin either, but someday I'd like to make a documentary about 
violinists." 
</P>
<P>
 While people at Sundance are supposed to be above star-gazing, there was still 
plenty of buzz about which actors were spotted on crowded Main Street. Heavily 
clothed, but still-recognizable celebrities included Winona Ryder, Joan Chen, 
Tim Robbins, Eric Stoltz, Ethan Hawke, Fred Ward, Rob Morrow, Julie Delpy, 
MacPherson, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Mary Stuart Masterson, Matthew Modine (who has 
a short here and is on the jury), Andie MacDowell and Gena Rowlands, who was 
honored for her work in independent films. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the frenzied nature of many events, there was little complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a chance to hobnob with my fellow film wizards. I get much more done 
here than at the office," says Paul Colichman, president of IRS Media. 
</P>
<P>
 Added David Guc of the Gersh Agency's New York office: "Here, you're 
introduced to people on a much more informal basis. You can make a deal with 
someone just because he likes your skiing. It's a ski-schmooze-a-thon." 
</P>
<P>
 Some movie executives, such as Triton Pictures' owner Jonathan Dana, here on 
vacation, choose to come simply to get away from the grind of everyday 
Hollywood life. This year, Sundance was a particularly idyllic retreat for the 
earthquake-traumatized attendees from Los Angeles. As the festival drew to an 
end during the weekend, more than one Angeleno could be overheard saying 
wistfully, "I don't want to go home."

COMMENTARY; LANNAN SHIFT HITS THE HEART OF L.A. ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a 1959 sculpture by Edward Kienholz satirizing a legendary Los Angeles 
art dealer and curator came up for auction in 1989 at Sotheby's, having stood 
for years in the home of an influential L.A. collector, it seemed a foregone 
conclusion that the sculpture would be whisked away into a European museum or 
another private holding. 
</P>
<P>
 Kienholz has always had his largest following in Europe, while free-standing 
early works are coveted by private collectors. Certainly no local museum could 
step forward to capture this historically significant work of art for public 
display in the city in which it had been made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walter Hopps Hopps Hopps" sold for $176,000, a record auction price for a 
work by the artist. Bidding had been fierce. And the winner was: the Lannan 
Foundation, newly established in L.A. Without fanfare -- without even so much 
as a formal announcement -- the foundation had done what no other institution 
in town had had the conviction and wherewithal to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, those days are over. The stunning recent news that the Lannan Foundation 
has ceased its multimillion-dollar program in collecting contemporary art ranks 
as a 6.6 for the American art world. It's a devastating blow. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a loss not just of cash in a beleaguered market that lately has shown 
hopeful signs of picking up (although the impact of that sudden drain should 
not be minimized). Far more important is the relationship to the larger profile 
of Lannan art programs, which had hitherto been widely regarded as a rare model 
of enlightened philanthropy in the visual arts. 
</P>
<P>
 First, let me begin with full disclosure by acknowledging a past affiliation 
with the Lannan Foundation. Between 1987 and 1989, until I joined the staff of 
The Times, I served on the Lannan's consultative three-member Art Advisory 
Committee, principally advising on exhibition grants and occasionally 
discussing collecting parameters. (I was not involved in the acquisition of the 
Kienholz.) The foundation, then headquartered in Lake Worth, Fla., had decided 
to reconfigure its program and, most dramatically, to relocate to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 With an endowment then in excess of $110 million, the options were many. 
Still, one central attitude was most appealing -- and frankly refreshing -- 
about this complicated and audacious effort. 
</P>
<P>
 In deciding on components for a program in the contemporary visual arts 
(Lannan also sponsors a literary program and a range of charitable activities), 
one crucial question always stood front and center: How can a philanthropic 
undertaking best support artists? The answer to that question was the test for 
every program idea proposed, and it has been the key to the foundation's 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 A competitive program of exhibition grants to museums and nonprofit spaces was 
one significant way to assist living artists through the public display of 
their work, and it was launched early on. With the eventual construction of a 
modest but exquisite gallery of its own at its new offices in an industrial 
park southeast of Marina del Rey, which opened in 1990, exhibitions organized 
in-house or brought from other museums became a staple. And plans to help 
underwrite publishing in art criticism also were developed in order to enhance 
the generally weak climate of public dialogue in which art is made. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, though, the centerpiece of the Lannan Foundation has been the 
development of its collection of postwar art. It was simply understood: There 
is no more important demonstration of commitment and support for an artist than 
the acquisition of his or her work. 
</P>
<P>
 This pivotal understanding was the one thread of continuity between two 
generations of Lannan philanthropy in the visual arts. The foundation had been 
started in 1960 by J. Patrick Lannan, a Chicago financier who had begun 
collecting about four years before. At his death in 1983, several thousand 
works had been acquired. 
</P>
<P>
 That collection could be most politely described as being of mixed quality. 
Like a lot of first-generation self-made millionaires, Lannan's enthusiasm for 
art far outpaced his eye. 
</P>
<P>
 He made some terrific purchases -- an important 1944 Robert Motherwell, a 
spectacular 1958 Clyfford Still, a vaporous 1964 Agnes Martin line painting, 
Frank Stella's monumental 1964 copper-stripe painting, a wonderful 1969 diptych 
by Alfred Jensen, two Brice Mardens from 1970-71, an early Mike Kelley wall 
sculpture and more -- but they were in the distinct minority. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, if the elder Lannan wasn't knowledgeable about the history of modern 
and contemporary art, he did know that he liked artists. He liked their 
independence from the herd and their insistence on a freely inventive voice. He 
supported that spirit by acquiring their work. 
</P>
<P>
 This became the platform for the second, sadly short-lived phase of the 
foundation's collection. Lannan's son, J. Patrick, Jr., sought to sharply raise 
the level of quality without lowering the focus on the guiding spirit. By 
hiring a professional staff and making a string of notable acquisitions, 
including substantial bodies of work by artists both internationally famous and 
under-known, he was succeeding in the noble aim. 
</P>
<P>
 That's over now. The decision to stop collecting and to transfer those funds 
(some $2 million annually) to charities for the poor is hard to understand. As 
with any family foundation, it's impossible to calculate the familial dynamic 
that likely played a role. Nor should worthy philanthropic activities be pitted 
against one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the sudden shift away from a 30-year tradition of collecting art 
inescapably represents a public loss of faith in art's power. Lannan says its 
exhibition grant program will remain in place, along with its own series of 
shows and its underwriting of published art criticism. There are no plans to 
disperse the collection that has been built. 
</P>
<P>
 Those pledges are all to the good. Still, it's not too much to say that the 
heart has been torn from the Lannan Foundation's activities in contemporary 
art. It's a tragedy for the art life of L.A.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: SO YOU WANT NEWS NOW? GET MAD, TUNE OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I don't have to tell you things are bad -- everybody knows things are bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the words of nutty -- well, maybe not so nutty -- anchorman Howard 
Beale in Paddy Chayefsky's "Network." They're applicable just about everywhere. 
For example: 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Will some local TV stations ever stop, or at least curtail, their 
fusion of news and promotion? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: When? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: When viewers stop being suckers. When so many of them protest this 
unholy grail that the offenders will be pressured into reforming. When viewers 
shout (read Howard Beale's lips): "I'M AS MAD AS HELL AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE 
THIS ANYMORE!" 
</P>
<P>
 When they get mad as hell about this: "Tonya Harding makes a startling 
admission." 
</P>
<P>
 That was an "Eyewitness News" promo for its 11 p.m. program that Ann Martin 
read during a commercial break in prime time last Thursday on KABC-TV Channel 
7. And what exactly had the embattled Harding confessed? Viewers easily could 
have inferred from the word startling that she had admitted involvement in the 
assault of fellow skater Nancy Kerrigan. That definitely was the implication. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, if it's news, you report it, right? Wrong. Don't be so musty. 
Join the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 7 viewers had to wait until 11 p.m. to learn that Harding had not 
confessed to participating in the alleged conspiracy against Kerrigan. Instead, 
she had admitted learning after the fact that people "close" to her may have 
been involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Significant? Absolutely. There was speculation that the admission alone could 
cost her a spot on the U.S. Olympic team. Startling? Only if you are someone 
who is easily amazed. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, those "Eyewitness" teases. In the same newscast, Harold Greene reported: 
"One of the most familiar faces on television is dead tonight after a long bout 
with cancer." The familiar name? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, that information (the deceased turned out to be actor Claude Akins) was 
held until after the commercial break that followed. Just in case you were 
thinking of switching channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at KNBC-TV Channel 4, where nearly every news promo advertises a 
"bombshell," the heavy thinkers obviously equate a news story with a play to be 
presented in four acts. Either that or a trail of bread crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently believing that their viewers are either stupid or sit spellbound in 
front of mostly repetitive local newscasts for hours, Channel 4 continues 
trickling out stories, puzzle piece by puzzle piece, across several newscasts, 
the purpose being to keep viewers in so much Hitchcockian suspense that they 
won't switch channels. Anchor John Beard complained of the practice when he 
fled Channel 4 last month for KTTV-TV Channel 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine how this would play out if extended to a truly significant story. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4 p.m., viewers are informed about the assassination of a famous political 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 p.m., they're told where it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 p.m., they're told who did it. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11 p.m., they're told the identity of the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11:25 p.m., sports. 
</P>
<P>
 TV news and marketing didn't merge overnight. What we're seeing is an 
extension of something that began decades ago, when some wise guys in 
broadcasting decided that news -- as one of their fastest-growing profit 
centers -- was far too valuable a franchise to leave in the hands of news 
people . They'd just mess it up. 
</P>
<P>
 So enter the ratings-driven Barnums and Baileys, the showmen and salesmen, the 
pumpers and thumpers, the promoters, the startlers and bombshellers. The 
result? The news team is a sales team. What other label applies, for example, 
when KNBC reporters are instructed to shout "You're live on Channel 4!" when 
asking questions during live coverage of press conferences? 
</P>
<P>
 It's one thing to layer tongue-in-cheek narcissism into a format as a send-up 
of traditional newscasts -- witness the relentlessly irreverent morning news on 
KTLA-TV Channel 5. It's quite another to do it with a deceptively self-serving 
straight face. 
</P>
<P>
 Promotion is now threaded through the very fabric of TV news, from 
chauvinistic stories tied to entertainment programs to intracellular 
backslapping and applause to little things like equipping microphones in the 
field with clips that display channel numbers. It's the foundation, a 
foundation that's spread to the entire building, having become so solidified 
that desensitized viewers tend to accept it as the norm. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it is the norm. But it doesn't have to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Every structure that goes up can come down. If you don't like what you're 
getting, be a human earthquake. Write, call, switch channels, protest. Get mad 
as hell.

WILL QUAKE SHAKE AN EXODUS OUT OF HOLLYWOOD?; AFTERSHOCKS: SEVERE PROPERTY 
DAMAGE AND GENERAL ANXIETY MAKE INDUSTRY PEOPLE WARY OF LIVING IN LOS ANGELES. 
HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY SAY THEY AREN'T PLANNING TO PULL UP STAKES.

 Two years ago, a bridge leading to the Malibu Canyon community of TV producers 
Joel Shukovsky and Diane English, the husband-and-wife team who created "Murphy 
Brown" and "Love and War," was washed out by floods and wound up in their back 
yard. Last November, when fires raged through Calabasas and Malibu, 130 acres 
of their ranch in Hidden Valley burned up. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Shukovsky and English are working out of boxes in converted garden 
apartments across the street from their flooded offices at CBS Studios in 
Studio City. The surrounding area has nearly been reduced to a ghost town after 
considerable damage from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 A little weary from life in Southern California, Shukovsky and English are 
finally taking stock of their options. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not going to go away," Shukovsky sighed. "We're going to repatch and 
re-stucco, and six months from now or a year from now we could have the Big 
One. There's a buzz going around town now with people saying, 'Where else can 
we produce TV shows other than Southern California?' And this is not idle 
chatter." 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, as everywhere else in the area, the 6.6 quake did far more than 
rattle buildings and disrupt the practical side of life. A young industry 
couple, Marc Yobs, 32, an executive with a sound and special effects company, 
and Karen Osterholt, 30, a receptionist at a television production firm, lost 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Some homes, including those belonging to Norman Lear, Warren Beatty and 
Annette Bening, Kirstie Alley, Walter Matthau, Jerry Van Dyke and UA motion 
picture production executive vice president Rebecca Pollack and her husband, 
HBO vice president Hutch Parker, were heavily damaged. Like Shukovsky English 
Entertainment, many companies, including the Santa Monica-based 
Sanford-Pillsbury Productions ("Love Field"), had to evacuate their offices. 
Damage to offices and studios has delayed production for weeks on a number of 
television series, including "Seinfeld," "Dave's World," "Second Chances" and 
several soap operas. As everywhere else, countless numbers lost valued 
possessions, and many more saw their sleep patterns disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, many people have come to see the temblor as the latest 
"payback for living in Shangri-La," as screenwriter Stanley G. Weiser ("Wall 
Street") put it, and wonder if they are getting an even deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Wolf, executive producer of NBC's "Law & Order," said filming in New York 
has never been more tempting. "When the quake was going on, my wife turned to 
me and said, 'Can we leave now?' " said Wolf, a native New Yorker. "We've seen 
the four seasons of L.A. now -- riots, fires, floods and earthquakes. I don't 
know what else is left." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the anxiety, few people are actually planning to pull up stakes. "I 
think Hollywood was paralyzed for more than a week," said producer Howard 
Rosenman ("Father of the Bride"). The randomness of the destruction was 
especially unnerving for an industry populated by "control freaks who think 
they can control everything," he added. "But, with time, you become more and 
more complacent. You become desensitized." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, most people are likely to agree with producer Arnold Kopelson 
("The Fugitive"), who is willing to incur a bit of sleeplessness in exchange 
for good weather and the area's other attractions. "I like it out here," he 
said. "The day after the quake, the sun was shining. I felt good. So, it's back 
to our games, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most people, many Hollywood luminaries call more than one place home, 
and a number of celebrities look upon Los Angeles as just a place to draw a 
paycheck. "Most of them (stars) spend their time here when they're working," 
said publicist Pat Kingsley. "When they're not here, unless their kids are in 
school, they are in their other homes." Kingsley's client Goldie Hawn has been 
able to repair to Colorado, for example, while Bruce Willis and Demi Moore are 
in Idaho, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For those left behind, "the earthquake has allowed Hollywood to gossip about 
something other than whose movie bombed," said screenwriter Shane Black 
("Lethal Weapon"), who was in Seattle when the quake struck. "A lot of people 
are waving their arms, freaking out and relating their stories to each other. 
At the end, they'll go back to stepping on each other and digging the knives in 
as though nothing had happened." 
</P>
<P>
 But TV producer Aaron Spelling believes the quake has brought out the best in 
Hollywood. "I'm kind of proud of the way most of the industry has taken this, 
and the help they're giving each other," said Spelling, who put up 18 employees 
and relatives at his 56,000-square-foot Holmby Hills chateau -- which is built 
on rollers -- right after the quake. The producer said he has no plans to move 
the production facilities for Fox's "Beverly Hills 90210" and "Melrose Place" 
out of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Screenwriter Ron Bass ("The Joy Luck Club") speculates that the need to 
suppress fears about future quakes could impede Hollywood's most precious 
commodity: its creative energy. "As a creative person, it's not a good idea to 
live in denial," he said. "We pride ourselves on being self-aware, in touch 
with our feelings. Yet without a certain amount of denial, it's hard to go 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, as everywhere, the aftermath of the quake seems most distressing 
to parents of young children. Each night since, Connie Sellecca's 12-year-old 
son, Gib, has slept on a futon on the bedroom floor alongside Sellecca and her 
husband, "Entertainment Tonight" host John Tesh. Similarly, Henry Winkler's two 
children have spent every night in bed with him and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The pain and fear they feel is so intense and scary," said Winkler. "If this 
was a 6.6 earthquake, and the big one is supposed to be 200 times worse, you 
have to wonder: Are we playing roulette?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Seymour, star of CBS' "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman," decided not to send 
her two children to a private school outside the county after she and her 
husband, director James Keach ("False Identity"), were separated from them 
after the quake. "I'm just not prepared to have them that far away from us if 
something happens," said Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us know the effects of the stress of this earthquake on our bodies 
physically and mentally yet," said Sellecca, who is 5 1/2 months pregnant and 
slept in a camper with her family in their Hollywood Hills driveway after the 
earthquake. "I think it will be weeks until we realize how we're suffering. I 
worry about how this anxiety and stress is affecting the baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everybody in Hollywood shares these fears, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Screenwriter David Koepp ("Jurassic Park") was relieved that his wife, who is 
about to give birth, did not go into labor after the tremors. That danger 
averted, however, he has moved on with his life. "During a quake, some part of 
me usually wishes it were a little bigger, a little longer, a little better," 
he confessed. "I'm always wishing for a better ride. This is one, though, in 
which I was thinking 'smaller, shorter -- stop!' 
</P>
<P>
 "Still I get irritated with people who can't seem to put it behind them," 
Koepp added. 
</P>
<P>
 A surprising number of people seem to be doing just that, according to 
screenwriter Michael Tolkin ("The Player"). 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake has delivered an emotional concussion whose effects will be 
with us long term," Tolkin said. "Still, it's amazing that most people do seem 
to be putting this behind them already -- returning to business as usual. The 
question is: Is that denial or health? "

'SURVIVING BIG ONE' HOST FARES WELL IN EARTHQUAKE 
</P>

 How did the host of a much-seen TV program on earthquake preparedness fare in 
the Jan. 17 temblor that originated beneath his four-bedroom home in 
Northridge? 
</P>
<P>
 Just fine, says Henry Johnson, the retired fireman who is the host of the 1989 
production "Surviving the Big One: How to Prepare for a Major Earthquake," 
which KCET-TV Channel 28 produced in 1989 and aired repeatedly last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was out of state at the time, but he said that the four family members 
who were home were unhurt and that the house came through "extremely well" -- a 
few cracks and downed cinder blocks but no structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 That their home stood up to the ferocious shaking so well was mainly luck, 
Johnson acknowledged, but the family was well-prepared for the aftermath -- 
which is the point of "Surviving the Big One." They used the radios, 
flashlights and batteries that they had stored for such an emergency, but 
didn't need to tap the 55-gallon water drums because bottled water was readily 
available in stores, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET said that it has sold 6,000 copies of "Surviving the Big One" since Jan. 
17. The tape, which has been updated twice since the original production, is 
available at Home Depot stores or by calling (800) 343-4727.  
</P>
<P>
 The station plans to revise the program again to incorporate information 
learned from this latest earthquake and will broadcast the new version March 5, 
with Johnson again the host. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot make a building earthquake-proof -- I'm convinced of that -- but 
in North America, we have buildings that do very, very well," Johnson said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SUPER BOWL PROVIDES AN ESCAPE; RECREATION: FOR 
MANY AT QUAKE RELIEF SHELTERS, WATCHING THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME ON TV OFFERS A 
WELCOME RESPITE FROM TRYING SITUATIONS. 
</P>

 For about three hours Sunday, dozens of victims of the Northridge earthquake 
put aside their worries about shattered homes, lost jobs and anxious relatives 
as they kicked back and enjoyed a less frightening form of violence: Super Bowl 
XXVIII. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been waiting in a FEMA line all week," said a drawn-looking Jeff Mandel, 
40, as he sat intently watching the game from his cot at a Red Cross shelter in 
Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a lot easier," said Mandel, whose North Hills apartment was condemned 
after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 At 29 shelters throughout the city, people made homeless by the quake cheered 
the Buffalo Bills or the Dallas Cowboys, happy to see somebody other than 
themselves and their families get knocked around for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake victims watched the sports extravaganza on color TVs donated by Circuit 
City and the A. C. Green Foundation for Youth, set up by the former Lakers 
basketball star. 
</P>
<P>
 The TV delivery came just in time for J. B. Cash, 35, who has lived in the 
Canoga Park High School gymnasium since his Northridge apartment was wrecked. 
</P>
<P>
 "That picture tube is messed up," he said, pointing to a dilapidated school TV 
set on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the distractions of a small army of news photographers taking shots 
from every conceivable angle, Cash seemed content to recline on a blue army cot 
and root for the Bills, who lost their fourth consecutive Super Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated on the floor before him were brothers Frank and David Mory, ages 13 and 
10, who, naturally, cheered for opposite sides. David was in Super Bowl heaven, 
carefully selecting potato chips from three different bags and occasionally 
digging into a bag of cheese puffs. 
</P>
<P>
 At Mason Park in Chatsworth, Fernando Delao of Chatsworth held his 3-year-old 
son, Eric, and related how the game was a welcome distraction from the 
Northridge quake and another temblor he survived, the 1986 Mexico City quake, 
which killed 4,700 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I watch the game I forget about the earthquake and how I felt I would 
lose my life at that moment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for others, the Northridge earthquake and the massive destruction it 
caused took the exuberance out of the championship football game. Unlike their 
counterparts watching from their own homes, they enjoyed no booze, no cheering, 
no high fives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game keeps you busy from thinking about everything that's happened, but 
then you look around you and it all comes back," said Giovanni Pacheco, a 
16-year-old North Hills resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacheco spent last week at a shelter in Granada Hills, but his family has 
since moved back into their home. But Pacheco returned to the shelter to watch 
the game with a newfound friend, Inez Becker, with whom he spent much of the 
game smooching. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buffalo is going down," said Pacheco, between kisses with Becker, who was too 
absorbed to talk. "Dallas is going to win." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Clarence Nelson and his friend, Keith Louis, enjoyed themselves 
almost as much as they would have if they hadn't been knocked out of their 
Reseda apartments. Almost. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Budweiser truck got a flat on the way over here," joked Nelson, 42, who 
saw the game inside a Red Cross tent in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, we need a case of beer," cracked Louis. 
</P>

STREET SMART: EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; HOW TO STOP SINGING -- OR YELLING 
-- THE BOTTLENECK BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The earth seems to be settling down -- gradually. Power and water are being 
restored and the rubble is being cleared. But if you're a commuter from north 
Los Angeles County, the weekday travel routine you've learned to love -- or at 
least live with -- is still a shambles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways are a mess, and repairs are 
proceeding slowly. And every day, tens of thousands of commuters head south 
from the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys into one giant bottleneck. 
</P>
<P>
 So if you must drive, here are some travel and safety tips that might make the 
commute a tad more bearable. 
</P>
<P>
 Q.: Are the winding mountains roads through the Angeles National Forest a good 
alternative to the clogged freeways? 
</P>
<P>
 A.: Yes. Some commuters tell us they've been making better time on the 
mountain roads, such as Angeles Forest Highway, Angeles Crest Highway, Sand 
Canyon, Big Tujunga Canyon Road and Little Tujunga Road. These take you around 
the logjam where the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways meet, and dump 
you out near the Foothill Freeway north of Los Angeles. That may be good or bad 
-- depending on where you're going. 
</P>
<P>
 But a few words of caution are in order. 
</P>
<P>
 These detours may become less attractive as more freeway lanes are reopened 
and the two-lane mountain roads become more congested. And because of sudden 
curves and unpredictable weather, these routes require extra attention when 
you're behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. So how can I drive these steep, narrow roads and live to tell about it? 
</P>
<P>
 A. First, you need to know if they're open -- because sometimes they're not, 
which you don't want to learn by halting at a barrier deep in the mountains. 
Radio traffic reports usually tell you if any of these roads has been closed 
because of ice, snow or rockslides. Also, recorded information about Angeles 
Crest Highway conditions can be obtained by calling (800) 427-ROAD. 
</P>
<P>
 If you take to the hills, make sure that your windshield wipers work and that 
your tires are properly inflated and have good treads, and your gas tank is not 
low. Also, at this time of year, "you should have warm clothing," says 
California Highway Patrol Officer Rich Obregon. "If your car breaks down, you 
should have a blanket. It's a very remote area." 
</P>
<P>
 Under normal conditions, the speed limit is 55 m.p.h. But watch for reduced 
speed zones on some curves and slopes. Be prepared for fog and ice patches, and 
be alert for the gravel that has rolled down onto many curves. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that there are no street lights along these roads after dark, and 
only a double yellow line separates you from oncoming traffic. And that 
drop-off on the other side sometimes goes for hundreds of feet. 
</P>
<P>
 When a curve appears or a rock falls onto the road, a driver may have to slow 
down or stop suddenly. So leave at least three car-lengths between yourself and 
the vehicle ahead, suggests Obregon. And if impatient drivers bear down behind 
you, pull over and let them pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Are there any other routes into Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
 A. There are a couple of less hazardous options, but they involve a greater 
distance. From Palmdale, you can head east on California 138, also called 
Pearblossom Highway, into San Bernardino County, then drive south on Interstate 
15. From there you can connect to freeways going toward downtown Los Angeles or 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita residents can take a long-distance detour by heading west on 
California 126 near Magic Mountain. At Fillmore, go south on California 23 to 
connect to the Simi Valley and Ventura freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. If I must use the Antelope or Golden State freeways, will it help to leave 
early? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Maybe. But be aware that congestion at the damaged junction of these 
freeways started to appear last week as early as 4 a.m. One advantage of 
leaving very early, however, is that you will find smooth sailing on most other 
freeways once you get past the Santa Clarita bottleneck. 
</P>
<P>
 George Webb, who drives a commuter van from Lancaster to Long Beach, told us 
he was able to make the morning trip in about two hours by leaving at 3 a.m. 
His mid-afternoon return trip ran into a lot more traffic, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How do I get into a car-pool or set up a van-pool, so I can share this 
miserable commute with a few co-workers? 
</P>
<P>
 A. One thing about pooling, misery loves company -- and it will get you into 
the car-pool lanes that Caltrans is setting up at the Santa Clarita bottleneck. 
These lanes should help you get to work faster than solo commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to car-pool, call (800) 286-RIDE between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. 
weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekends. Tell the people at Commuter 
Transportation Services, a nonprofit corporation formerly called Commuter 
Computer, where you live and work and what hours you're on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Without charge, they'll send you the names and phone numbers of potential 
car-pool partners. You can also request tips on setting up a car-pool, such as 
how to share expenses and how to avoid incompatible riders, such as smokers and 
nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 If you find 10 to 15 potential car-pool partners, you might consider a 
van-pool. Typically, the driver leases the vehicle and divides the cost among 
the riders. A daily 140-mile round trip aboard a 12-seat van might cost each 
passenger about $150 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost can vary widely, however. Also, some companies will help pay the 
expense for employees who ride-share. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuter Transportation Services runs a Van-Pool hot line, (213) 365-6993. 
Leave a message, and they'll get back to you with advice on setting up a 
van-pool. They can also direct you to companies that lease such vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't need a special license if you transport no more than 15 people. The 
van-pool driver often rides for free, as compensation for his or her duties. 
But a van-pool cannot be set up to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Can I get to work faster aboard a motorcycle? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Maybe, maybe not, depending on whether you're a seasoned motorcyclist or a 
beginner. 
</P>
<P>
 A few words of warning. The quake has triggered a motorcycle buying boom in 
the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. Apparently, some frustrated drivers 
think they can just shell out for a two-wheeler and start speeding past the 
rows of creeping cars. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's nowhere near that simple. First, you need a special license to ride a 
motorcycle, and you must pass a written and riding test to get one. If you're 
under 21, you must also complete a CHP-approved safety course. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, lane-splitting, riding down that narrow open space between stalled or 
very slow-moving cars, is not a tactic for beginners, motorcycle safety experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 It requires much more intense concentration generally to ride a motorcycle 
competently and safely than it does to drive a car (veteran motorcyclists will 
tell you that's why they enjoy it). But it takes a long period of dedication, 
perhaps years, to become proficient enough to split lanes safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Even veteran riders with a dozen years or more experience will tell you that 
they work hard to perfect an entire bag of tricks and skills needed to remain 
unhurt. They search for signs to alert them if a driver in front of them is 
going to swing into their path -- watching front wheels, noting if a driver's 
head turns, looking for the reflection of the driver's eyes in rear and side 
view mirrors, gauging relative speeds, keeping track of the growing or 
shrinking space between cars. Many of them work at mastering the technique of 
keeping two fingers tensed on the front brake lever while operating the 
throttle with the thumb and the other two, while simultaneously working the 
rear brake pedal -- lightly -- with their right foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes experience," says Douglas Fitts, manager of the state-funded 
California Motorcycle Safety Program. "You're talking about maneuvering a 
motorcycle in a very confined space." 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to get started, Fitts' program offers 18-hour CHP-approved 
classes, in very basic riding skills, throughout the state. The cost ranges 
from $125 to $160 for age 21 or older, $65 for those under 21. To find the 
class nearest to you, call (800) CCRIDER. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who have the basics down and want to work on advanced skills -- with 
practice sessions on racetracks -- try CLASS, headquartered in Ventura and run 
by respected former racer Reg Pridmore, at (800) 235-7228. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest P. Hansen, who has commuted by motorcycle between Lancaster and 
Chatsworth for 18 years, tried it twice after the earthquake. Then he chose to 
move into a Valley motel until the road conditions improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen began to worry about his safety after several frustrated car drivers 
tried to block his path as he maneuvered around them. "I don't blame them," he 
says charitably. "I know what their nerves must be like." 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a novice motorcyclist and are thinking about lane-splitting, Hansen 
says: "I wouldn't suggest it. It takes quite a few months to pick up the signs 
that people are going to change lanes on you. If you're going to do it, take it 
real easy at first."

 A new Metrolink station set to open today south of Palmdale is the first in a 
series of train and bus improvements in the works for the coming months -- 
including an ambitious plan to link the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys to 
the west San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 New routes and stations planned for the upgrade are part of an unprecedented 
effort to create a new transportation system for the region, to replace the 
travel capacity lost when freeway bridges and overpasses collapsed in the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The station scheduled to open today -- the Vincent Grade/Acton station south 
of Palmdale -- is little more than a large parking lot with two long boarding 
platforms. But officials say that because it is closer to Los Angeles and San 
Fernando Valley areas than the Lancaster or Palmdale stations that opened a 
week ago, it will save commuting time for south Antelope Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Other upgrades are expected in the next several weeks: 
</P>
<P>
 * Next Monday, two new train stations are scheduled to be opened -- one in 
Canyon Country on Via Princessa, the other in Northridge at Parthenia Street 
and Wilbur Avenue. Officials also plan to add a third train each weekday to the 
Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Feb. 14 or Feb. 21, Metrolink officials hope to open another new station 
in Camarillo, extending the current Ventura County train line by about 13 miles 
from its current end point in Moorpark. Ventura County transportation officials 
are due to consider the proposal this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * By the end of February, said Metrolink Executive Director Richard Stanger, 
the agency hopes to have developed a train connection to allow passengers to 
transfer from north county lines to trains heading for the west San Fernando 
Valley. North county commuters could take Metrolink south to the Burbank 
station, then transfer to the westbound Ventura line with stops at Van Nuys, 
Northridge and Chatsworth. Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus service 
from the current Metrolink stations in Glendale, Burbank and Sylmar is also 
being improved, Stanger said. 
</P>
<P>
 To facilitate the Metrolink expansion, Metrolink Chief Engineer John Rinard 
said the agency plans a variety of improvements, including $10 million worth of 
new track between Lancaster and Palmdale. In the end, Rinard said, officials 
expect to cut the current 2-hour-25-minute train trip between Lancaster and Los 
Angeles to about two hours within several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinard said most of the planned upgrades are being paid for with county 
transit funds. He said the agency expects that the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency will reimburse the costs as part of aid payments stemming from the 
destructive 6.6-magnitude earthquake that struck Southern California two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinard, who visited the Vincent Grade/Acton station Sunday, said Metrolink has 
initially committed to serving the Antelope Valley for one year. "But if they 
ride the trains, the service will stay," he said. "What we need is ridership." 
</P>
<P>
 The new station is located on a five-acre site on Sierra Highway south of 
Angeles Forest Highway. It ultimately will accommodate 1,000 cars, Rinard said, 
although initially there is paved parking for about 300 and dirt lot parking 
for about 500. The station cost about $300,000 to build. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinard said Metrolink will use the site on a month-to-month lease at a cost of 
about $3,000 a month. The two morning trains from the Antelope Valley will stop 
there at 4:36 a.m. and 5:17 a.m. The return trains from Los Angeles in the 
afternoon will stop there at 6:02 p.m. and 7:31 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinard said the new station, besides being more convenient for south Antelope 
Valley residents, should also relieve some of the crowding at the current 
Palmdale station. Likewise, officials expect the Canyon Country station due 
next week to relieve crowding at the Santa Clarita station. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Sunday, Caltrans officials said rebuilding began on the 
collapsed Gavin Canyon bridge on the Golden State Freeway near Santa Clarita.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; STUDENTS FROM 2 HIGH SCHOOLS STILL IN LIMBO; 
EDUCATION: MANY OF THE 5,000 YOUTHS WHO ATTEND EL CAMINO REAL AND JOHN F. 
KENNEDY CAMPUSES WORRY ABOUT RESUMING CLASSES, APPLYING TO COLLEGE AND SEEING 
THEIR FRIENDS.

 Jerry Hickman's house has become a math classroom. The El Camino Real High 
School teacher serves practice tests in his kitchen and discusses calculus in 
his living room. His guests are teen-agers eager to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman is trying to maintain continuity for the students in his Advanced 
Placement calculus courses who have no school to attend because it was heavily 
damaged in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't afford to fall behind," Hickman said. "This is a huge inconvenience. 
I've given my students assignments for the next three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 To the 5,000 students at El Camino Real and John F. Kennedy high schools, who 
have no idea when their schools will reopen, the unexpected winter vacation 
caused by the 6.6-magnitude earthquake has been marked by boredom, anxiety and 
a host of unanswered questions. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens to college applications? What about finals? Is the soccer season 
over? How about basketball? 
</P>
<P>
 "At first it was nice to have a short vacation," said David Rand, an El Camino 
senior. "But now it's screwing everything up." 
</P>
<P>
 The two high schools -- El Camino in Woodland Hills and Kennedy in Granada 
Hills -- were hit with the worst earthquake damage of all the secondary 
campuses in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Kennedy's three-story 
administration building suffered structural damage and El Camino's classroom 
walls could fall at any minute. Both schools have been closed since the Jan. 17 
quake and officials say it could be March before they reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the district focuses on the campuses' physical problems, the 
students say they are worrying about their futures. Teachers at both schools 
say they, too, are anxious to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Camino staff and students also are confronting another set of problems. 
Principal Martin King, who has been at El Camino for seven years, filed his 
retirement papers the week before the quake and planned to leave Friday. While 
King says he will stay on as long as he is needed, he says he is ready to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and parents say they are worried about a new administrator taking 
over during the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope they can get someone who can carry the ball -- it's going to be a 
tough job to step into," said Judy Levy, a parent with two children at El 
Camino. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers submitted three names of preferred candidates, but the staff hasn't 
heard who will be selected by Supt. Sid Thompson to take the top job. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite personnel problems, the schools have had to make tough academic 
decisions. Both staffs decided to abandon final exams and grade students based 
on their work before the quake. Students whose grades could have improved by 
taking an exam say they are disappointed that they will not have that 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the college entrance exam, the Scholastic Aptitude Test, was postponed. 
It was scheduled for Jan. 22 at El Camino and nine other campuses in the 
district. The Educational Testing Service, which administers the SAT and the 
Achievement Test, plans to reschedule the exams at different school sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Other school activities, including student council elections and a semiformal 
dance at Kennedy, were scrapped. And students in Advanced Placement courses, 
which culminate in a test in May, say they are worried about the break in their 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether we're in school or not, we're going to have to take that test," said 
Jennifer Gould, an El Camino senior. "This is not fun. Everyone's real 
jittery." 
</P>
<P>
 Some teachers at El Camino and Kennedy are holding special study sessions for 
their Advanced Placement students. And El Camino's Advanced Placement teachers 
agreed Friday to hold optional tutoring sessions in bungalows on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy history and government teacher Richard Sprouse has been meeting his 
Advanced Placement students in various smaller schools. The Advanced Placement 
tests, given in May at schools nationwide, allow students to earn college 
credits if they score high enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students and teachers are concerned that college and financial aid 
applications could be delayed because transcripts haven't been mailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding that problem at Kennedy, officials say, is that the administration 
building -- which houses student records, among other things -- is so badly 
damaged that officials haven't yet decided if records and other materials will 
be salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
 At El Camino, the problem is not structural but potentially dangerous. 
Classroom partition walls are loose and could fall with a significant 
aftershock. Additionally, the ceiling tiles came crashing down and might need 
to be replaced in most classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Camino and Kennedy staffs have agreed unanimously to extend the school 
day by 39 minutes -- and possibly lengthen the school year -- rather than 
transfer students to different schools or try another way to get kids in 
different schools sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 And teachers at El Camino are working on getting school buses to take students 
-- who live in the neighborhood and who are bused from other parts of Los 
Angeles -- on field trips. Other teachers are attempting to put together study 
groups to keep students occupied until their school reopens. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews have been working on both campuses since the earthquake, trying to shore 
up unstable posts and buildings and to check gas lines. The campuses are 
without water and portable classrooms probably will be installed at both. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the harshest critics of the district, however, commend the maintenance 
workers and the district for their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be the first to criticize the district and I can't find anything wrong 
with the way the district has handled this," said Jack Koening, El Camino's 
teachers' union representative and government and economics teacher. "We figure 
it takes something over a 6 (magnitude) to make them cooperative and something 
over a 7.0 to make them congenial." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the unexpected break has left many students home with little to do. 
All but a few schools have reopened, so brothers and sisters have returned to 
classes and parents have returned to work. Still others live far from friends. 
Of El Camino's 2,700 students, 900 are bused from across Los Angeles. About 
1,000 of Kennedy's 2,300 students are bused. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Correa, a Kennedy senior who is bused from her home in South-Central 
Los Angeles to the Granada Hills campus, says she misses her friends -- several 
of whom live in the north Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "You miss them," Correa said. "They're a part of you -- like family. It's kind 
of like I already graduated and I'm never going to see anyone again." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers say they worry that students are not receiving special counseling to 
help them deal with the trauma of the earthquake and the aftershocks. They say 
that the sooner the students return to the campus, the better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think psychologically some of the kids are going to have a real difficult 
time," said David Ptashne, the Kennedy health education teacher, swim coach and 
teachers' union representative. "Some of the kids in the neighborhood are 
living on the streets right now. As soon as there's an aftershock, their 
attention span is going to be shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Even staff members say returning to school might help ease their fears about 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Andreda Pruitt, Kennedy's principal, said she was in tears the day of the 
quake when she saw the devastation at the school, which has become a backdrop 
for politicians. Supt. Sid Thompson and members of the Board of Education held 
a news conference there, and Gov. Pete Wilson also made an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Pruitt said she knew how to handle the disaster at Kennedy after being very 
involved in the cleanup after the 1971 Sylmar quake. Pruitt was a teacher at 
Los Angeles High School at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having had that experience has helped me with this one," Pruitt said. "We 
always find ways to bounce back." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the students sit waiting. "It's just not normal," said El Camino 
sophomore Allison Lehrman. "It's not reality anymore. It's really weird." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the teachers are ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel so disconnected," said Jean Feldman, a Kennedy English teacher and 
student council adviser. "I'm out of my normal routine and I'm sure the kids 
are feeling the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully we can plan a St. Patrick's Day dance -- if we're back," she said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; PULLING UP STAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They had come by the dozens, some carrying the only possessions they could 
scavenge from quake-ravaged houses and apartments, some simply too scared to go 
home. Quickly, these urban refugees turned Lanark Park in Canoga Park into one 
of the lasting images of the Northridge earthquake, a collection of urban 
refugees finding solace first under the stars, later under the tents of the 
National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long for a certain rhythm to develop as the Guard, Salvation 
Army and charitable organizations raced in to help the residents of the tent 
city. New friendships formed amid the food and supply lines. Children played 
with the troops. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, no one thought of leaving the relative security of the tents to move 
back home, especially when the earth still rumbled. On Jan. 21, four days after 
the quake, 3,957 refugees lived in city parks. A week after the temblor, there 
were still 1,300 in Lanark Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But the numbers quickly dwindled with the onset of rain and cold weather. By 
late last week, the number in Lanark Park was down to 169 and then to a 
quake-weary handful. A crew of five or six National Guard troops, without their 
M-16 rifles, strolled casually through the park, chatting with the few 
remaining people as they prepared to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday, the park's last residents prepared to go home or were taken to 
the tent city in Winnetka. When the day was over, Lanark Park was a park once 
more.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; QUAKE SURVIVORS THANK GOD AND THEIR RESCUER; 
AFTERMATH: TWO MEN TRAPPED BY COLLAPSED BUILDING FINALLY MEET THE MAN WHO SAVED 
THEIR LIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many good friends, Jerry Prezioso and Steve Langdon told jokes in front 
of the TV Sunday, trying to relieve the boredom of yet another lopsided Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of discussing the breakdown in the Bills' defense, the former 
roommates -- meeting for the first time since the Northridge Meadows apartment 
building's top two floors collapsed above them -- thanked God that they were 
alive and credited Los Angeles reserve Police Officer Don Stein with saving 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein, who joined Langdon and Prezioso in an emotional but humor-packed 
meeting at the Northridge Hospital Medical Center Sunday night, dug through the 
rubble and found the two men after hearing their pleas for help. They were 
rescued by firefighters shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I really gotta thank you," Prezioso said to Stein, whom he was meeting 
in person for the first time. "We were in there five hours before anyone heard 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Prezioso, 67, a Budget Rent-A-Car employee still bedridden by leg injuries, 
talked with Langdon about the death of neighbors and friends, and the loss of 
personal possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 But through it all, the two men maintained a wry sense of humor -- just like 
they had done when they were pinned face down by the second floor after their 
building collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good way to break a lease, don't you think?" said Prezioso. "Hey, you 
gotta have humor in tragedy. . . . I can't help that. I'm a New Yorker." 
</P>
<P>
 Although nails from a fallen wall punctured his abdomen and the fallen roof 
pinned his head and legs, Prezioso did not panic. He and Langdon, who works for 
a sports clothing manufacturer and whose head was also pinned by the roof, 
talked and told jokes for hours to keep their spirits high. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point, Jerry said, 'Next time we move, let's get an apartment on the 
top floor,' " said Langdon, 45. "I was scared, but Jerry said not to worry, 
that if we were alive, there had to be a reason for it." 
</P>
<P>
 As he was walking around the collapsed building looking for survivors, Stein, 
a 36-year-old car mechanic who works in Panorama City, heard screams coming 
from under the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was horrified of what I would find," Stein said. Nevertheless he went on, 
sending a fellow rescue worker for help. Lifting large pieces of concrete, 
stucco and wood to get to the sound, Stein said he "felt like the Incredible 
Hulk. My adrenaline was pumping, and I wasn't worried about what could happen 
to me if another shaker hit while I was in the rubble." 
</P>
<P>
 Once he reached Prezioso, he was stunned by the man's composure. 
</P>
<P>
 "A building was sitting on this guy, and he wasn't scared or spooked or 
anything!" Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using air bags to raise the fallen roof, firefighters rescued Prezioso and 
Langdon. At that point, Stein was helping other victims, and the survivors 
weren't able to meet him. Langdon was taken to Tarzana Regional Medical Center 
with a broken collarbone, three fractured ribs and a punctured lung. 
</P>
<P>
 Prezioso was sent to Northridge Hospital Medical Center, nails still in his 
body. Langdon was released from the hospital Friday, although his lungs may 
have suffered permanent damage. 
</P>
<P>
 As he was removed from his collapsed apartment building, Prezioso remembers 
saying aloud: "Now I can watch the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 But on Super Bowl Sunday, Prezioso and Langdon paid little attention to the 
game. They were more interested in telling Stein what he meant to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll be a lot of other Super Bowls," Prezioso said. "This night is more 
important."

YOUTH SHOT AFTER FIRING AT OFFICER OUTSIDE RESTAURANT; CRIME: THE CANYON 
COUNTRY 16-YEAR-OLD IS LISTED IN SERIOUS CONDITION. HE IS CHARGED WITH ASSAULT 
WITH A DEADLY WEAPON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-year-old boy was shot Saturday night when he jumped out of a pickup truck 
in the parking lot of a local restaurant and allegedly fired a pellet gun at an 
off-duty Los Angeles police officer, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canyon Country youth, who was booked on assault with a deadly weapon, was 
shot once in each leg and underwent surgery at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial 
Hospital early Sunday morning, said Deputy Diane Hecht, a Los Angeles County 
sheriff's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 He was listed in serious condition, a hospital official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontation began about 10 p.m. in the parking lot of Denny's Restaurant 
in the 16400 block of DeLone Street in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 The juvenile arrived there with three friends. Two were riding in the cab and 
two in the truck bed, Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer, who noticed the truck when he arrived at the restaurant, spotted 
the youth holding the weapon, whereupon he identified himself as an officer and 
drew his weapon, Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth leveled the weapon in his direction and fired once, Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer returned fire, striking the youth, Hecht said.

 Night. Silence. Then the shaking began, 11 miles deep in the ground.In an 
instant, the tremors burst from the earth like a malevolent spirit escaping 
from some infernal region of myth and nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the experts would say the quake lasted only 10 seconds, but in the 
quivering hearts of survivors, it seemed far longer. Instead of fading after 
the first violent spasms, the shaking intensified its destructive work, 
snapping thick, steel beams on freeways like bread sticks, crushing apartment 
buildings and, above all, rewriting the future of Los Angeles.

 Everyone knew the magnitude 6.6 quake was, if not The Big One, at least A Big 
One.But few were prepared for the stark images that emerged with the cool light 
of day. 
</P>
<P>
 Shops and schools, buildings as familiar and hospitable as our own homes, lay 
in twisted ruin. Proof of the quake's injustice, the hand of destruction was 
not only heavy, but fickle. Entire blocks were torn up, while adjacent 
neighborhoods escaped untouched.

 If the serpent in the earth was the enemy, fire was next. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shaking stopped, the first words uttered in apartments and tract 
houses and mobile homes were frequently the almost hysterical command, "Turn 
off the gas!" Often, the order came too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Severed gas lines hissed from cracked foundations. Then, all it took was a 
spark for the flames to appear. Once started, they consumed everything in their 
path while firefighters, deprived of water by the quake, watch hopelessly. A 
hundred mobile homes burned to fragments of hot metal in three Sylmar parks 
alone.

 After the shaking stopped, the rescue began.  
</P>
<P>
 Working amid mountains of broken concrete, firefighters searched for bodies 
and the survivors.Even those with long experience found themselves unequal to 
some of the challenges presented by this disaster. When a child's body was 
found in the Northridge Meadows rubble, one turned away from the mother, 
leaving it for someone else to tell the woman that her son was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 And because there was so much rescuing to do, in many places it fell to 
neighbors to coax terrified people out of buildings that had folded in on 
themselves. Then the good Samaritans handed out food, blankets, even socks to 
one barefoot evacuee.

 Suddenly, the scenes of tent cities and food lines we had watched on

happening next door. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross and the Salvation Army set up shelters and the National Guard 
patrolled the streets for looters. But it seemed that crooks were shaken out of 
their routine along with everyone else. Even with rubble in them, the streets 
were safer than usual.

 When we all were terrified when the quake hit, most of us, even those who had 
lost a home, breathed a little easier when the shaking stopped.

 But for some, the fright yielded to horror when they discovered that loved

we dug out, they made funeral arrangements.

 For them, the Northridge quake will never recede into the past as an anecdote

 Getting back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Just days ago, normal life in Southern California too often seemed 
uninteresting and uninviting. It was too violent, too crowded, too superficial. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, as damage figures spiral upward like numbers on those billboards that 
count the world's population, it's hard not to feel a certain nostalgia for the 
once noisy, now silent mall and commutes that took only an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 As the sound of jackhammers replaces sirens, we have learned that normal can 
be an elusive, precious thing. Photo Editors: Vanessa Barnes Hillian,
