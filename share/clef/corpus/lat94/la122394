MOVIE REVIEW; 'LEGENDS OF THE FALL': A GIANT FILM, IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 Everything about "Legends of the Fall" shouts epic filmmaking and it is not an 
altogether unpleasant sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Bursting with big country Montana landscapes, big music, big emotions, even 
big hair, this is highly romanticized, old-fashioned sentimental filmmaking of 
a type we haven't seen in a while, the kind of movie where ringlets turn white 
overnight and no one rides in quietly on a single horse when leading a 
galloping herd is an option. 
</P>
<P>
 Slow moving and at times foolish, too conscious of its ambitions as an epic 
for its own good, "Legends" does present an easy target. But director Edward 
Zwick has infused it with so much sheer watchability, it believes so earnestly 
in its high-gloss doings, that it's difficult to pull the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it retains the name of the Jim Harrison novella, as admired a piece 
of American writing as the last 20 years has produced, the most telling thing 
about "Legends" is how little it has to do with its nominal source material. 
</P>
<P>
 For while the Harrison novella is primarily concerned with men, their 
loneliness and their relationship to each other, the movie has smoothly turned 
this on its head, both feminizing and Hollywoodizing the narrative by recasting 
it as a story about three men competing for the same woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Expanding some things, condensing others, tossing out a lot of material and 
adding a heap of invention, screenwriters Susan Shilliday and Bill Wittliff 
have, in a way that is almost engaging in its audacity, turned the masculine 
Harrison into a latter-day Edna Ferber, the patron saint of panoramic Western 
romances. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, what "Legends" will remind veteran moviegoers of most is the 1956 
George Stevens-directed version of Ferber's "Giant," with Brad Pitt, Aidan 
Quinn and Julia Ormond standing in nicely for James Dean, Rock Hudson and 
Elizabeth Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitt, Quinn and Henry Thomas play the Ludlow brothers -- the wild Tristan, the 
stodgy Alfred and young idealist Samuel -- all sons of a rugged colonel 
(Anthony Hopkins, as usual making the most of a small role) who retires to a 
remote corner of Montana when he can no longer stomach U.S. Cavalry policy. 
</P>
<P>
 With their mother in permanent retreat back East, the boys grow up under the 
watchful eye of a venerable Cree named One Stab whose tribal affiliation was 
probably changed from Cheyenne to accommodate Gordon Tootoosis, the Cree actor 
who has the role. 
</P>
<P>
 One Stab is also responsible for much of the film's voice-over narration, 
delivered in classic venerable Native American sage fashion. It is One Stab who 
gets to recite "Legends' " topic sentences: "Some people hear their own inner 
voices with great clearness and live by what they hear. Such people become 
crazy. Or they become legends." 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of World War I, Samuel gets the plot in gear by returning home from 
Harvard with his fiancee, the beautiful Susannah Fincannon (Julia Ormond). 
While Alfred and the Colonel dutifully meet the couple at the train station, 
the ponytailed Tristan, a major hunk who has been outdoors forever doing god 
knows what, rides up glistening with dirt and sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as Susannah eyes him and archly comments, "So this is Tristan, and 
does he speak English?" it doesn't take a Native American sage to realize that 
trouble will soon be brewing between these previously inseparable sons. All too 
soon One Stab will be moved to wax aphoristically and say, "You cannot blame 
the water that freezes in the rock and splits it apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Susannah, only lightly sketched in the novella and described by Harrison as "a 
frail, lovely girl" is turned by the film into a robust natural woman who is 
soon roping and riding with the gang. Ormond, whose previous credits include 
the odd mixture of "Nostradamus," HBO's "Stalin" and Peter Greenaway's "The 
Baby of Macon," is the film's major surprise. An energetic actress, she brings 
vigor, charm and reality to a part that might have been no more than 
decorative. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Pitt's trademark virility is not a surprise, though it is a relief to see 
him looking so alive after the gloom, doom and pale makeup of "Interview With 
the Vampire." An instinctive actor who must emotionally feel a role to be 
successfully in it, Pitt is perfectly cast in a traditional heartthrob way as 
the spirited masculine animal whose idea of fun is waking up hibernating bears 
and seeing what happens, and the screen is more alive whenever he is on it. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens to these three brothers, all of whom covet Susannah in their own 
way, is what "Legends" uncovers, and what a story filled with tears, curses, 
passion, suffering and any other larger-than-life emotion you can imagine it 
turns out to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Zwick orchestrates everything with welcome gusto, and though the 
result is not as meaningful as it would have you believe, it is undeniably 
pleasant to have this kind of production to kick around. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for violence and for some sexuality and language. Times 
guidelines: It includes several acts of violence, including the ripping out of 
a heart, and a few chaste scenes of lovemaking.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'READY TO WEAR': LATEST IN ALTMAN'S FASHION LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The skill of the juggler often isn't apparent or appreciated until the moment 
when he can no longer keep the balls in the air. And the main distinction of 
"Ready to Wear (Pret-a-Porter)" is how accomplished it makes director Robert 
Altman's previous work appear. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable even to decide what its title is, "Ready to Wear" is a mass of 
confusion pretending to be a movie, a mess of characters in search of an 
author. Everyone is at cross-purposes with everyone else over everything from 
hotel rooms and lost luggage to sexual orientation and even apparently murder, 
but in a movie in which so much appears to be happening, very little is really 
going on. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than two dozen characters colliding like so many giddy bumper cars 
and actors relying on their skill at refurbishing dialogue, "Ready to Wear" 
sounds like Altman's most recent successes, "The Player" and "Short Cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a difference between creative improvisation and absolute chaos, 
and while those films were delicately balanced balls that magically stayed in 
the air, "Ready to Wear," with a script credited to Altman and Barbara 
Shulgasser, has a haphazard "Let's go to Paris and see what happens" feeling 
that wastes everyone's time and talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Paris is where the annual ready-to-wear shows take place, with the top fashion 
designers displaying their creations to an impatient public during an 
especially hectic week. Many of the industry's most celebrated designers, top 
names such as Issey Miyake, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Thierry Mugler and Sonia 
Rykiel, make obligatory cameo appearances, but despite fashion industry 
paranoia, any satirical intent on the film's part is stillborn. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather Altman and Shulgasser have grafted several increasing sour and feeble 
lines of farce action onto this setting. None of these is strong enough to be 
called a plot, but the centerpiece is an investigation into the mysterious 
death of Olivier de la Fontaine (Jean-Pierre Cassel), head of the powerful 
Fashion Council, who leaves behind a wife (Sophia Loren), a mistress (Anouk 
Aimee) and a shadowy individual (Marcello Mastroianni) who has flown in from 
Moscow just to meet him. 
</P>
<P>
 Intercut with this is the rivalry between three fashion editors (Linda Hunt, 
Sally Kellerman, Tracey Ullman) for the services of a smug photographer 
(Stephen Rea), a rivalry for a single hotel room between journalists Tim 
Robbins and Julia Roberts and random bitchy behavior by cliched gay designers 
Richard E. Grant and Forest Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Other prominent figures, everyone from Lauren Bacall and Lyle Lovett to Danny 
Aiello and Teri Garr, wander through little plotlets of their own, but the 
payoffs to their actions are so lacking that it's not worth the trouble to 
describe who they are or what they do. 
</P>
<P>
 Though actors invariably profess unceasing admiration for Altman, the director 
has cavalierly stranded most of them here with barely an interesting line or 
situation to their name. Lili Taylor as a New York Times reporter does emerge 
with her dignity intact, but only Kim Basinger, thoroughly amusing as an antic 
talking head for FAD-TV with more nerve than sense, gives a performance that 
truly entertains. 
</P>
<P>
 Balancing this is the film's tendency to portray women in a mean-spirited 
light, forcing the actresses who play the three fashion editors to participate 
in a subplot that is interested only in humiliating them. And Altman is the 
latest in a line of filmmakers who think making Julia Roberts look as plain as 
possible is a triumph of cleverness. Enough already. 
</P>
<P>
 Not clever or polished enough to be successful as farce, unwilling to supply 
any reason to care about any of its characters, unable to make the points about 
the role of fashion in society it thinks it is, "Ready to Wear" is madness 
without the usual Altman method. It's always been harder than it looks to make 
his kind of films, and this weak tea proves that point. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for language and nudity. Times guidelines: A key scene 
involves considerable full frontal female nudity, and there are several other 
scenes of partial nudity.

MOVIE REVIEW; NEWMAN TRIUMPHS IN 'NOBODY'S FOOL'; IN THIS, HIS 52ND FEATURE, 
THE ACTOR IS WELL CAST AS A STUBBORNLY INDEPENDENT SCAMP, AND GIVES HIS BEST 
PERFORMANCE IN A LONG TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moviegoing holds few pleasures greater than watching an established star 
completely inhabit a role that exactly suits his personality and abilities. And 
seeing Paul Newman in "Nobody's Fool" defines that pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fool" is Newman's 52nd feature (his debut was in "The Silver Chalice" 40 
years ago), but it's more than the weight of accumulated experience that makes 
his work so satisfying here. 
</P>
<P>
 For Newman is so right for the role of Donald "Sully" Sullivan, an aging, 
stubbornly independent black Irish scamp, that he infuses it with the easy 
enthusiasm and sense of the new usually associated with the young and the 
restless. It's been so long since Newman has been this satisfying that he 
projects the excitement of an undiscovered new talent, the kind you can't wait 
to tell your friends about. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman is so revivified, in fact, that he has sparked his co-stars to give 
better than average performances. Jessica Tandy (always delightful), Bruce 
Willis and Melanie Griffith (both somewhat less reliable) all had to pump up 
the volume just to keep up with their star. 
</P>
<P>
 What Newman can't do, however, is turn "Nobody's Fool" into a truly memorable 
film. Taken from a discursive 549-page novel by Richard Russo set in the 
mythical upstate New York town of North Bath, "Fool" has to contend with the 
predilections of its writer-director, Robert Benton ("Kramer vs. Kramer," 
"Places in the Heart"). 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side is a pleasure in fine writing as well as a concern for 
character. "Nobody's Fool" is a film that cares about its people, addled and 
disheveled though the residents of North Bath may be, a film that revels in the 
cracked qualities of their diverse humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of sentiment, however, is best leavened with something a tad 
grittier, and "Nobody's Fool," as it meanders from one shaggy situation to 
another, is finally too soft and unfocused for too long to consistently hold 
our attention. A little more rigor would have gone a considerable way. 
</P>
<P>
 Described by the novel as "the uncontested master of the futile gesture" and a 
"case study under-achiever," Sully is the center of a variety of relationships 
in North Bath, many of them absentee. A 60-year-old construction work gypsy who 
abandoned his family when his son was barely a year old, he is closest to a 
mental case co-worker nicknamed Rub (for Rubberhead), convincingly played by 
Pruitt Taylor Vince. 
</P>
<P>
 But during this particular holiday season, "a time for normal people to do 
normal things," as someone puts it, Sully, always prone to misadventures, gets 
re-involved with his family with a vengeance. His estranged son comes back to 
town burdened by a failing marriage, he attempts a relationship with one of his 
grandchildren, and he tries finally to deal with the memory of his own errant 
father, long since dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it suffers from its lack of focus, one of the paradoxes of "Nobody's 
Fool" is that when it tries to get more real, when it concentrates on the glum 
dissatisfaction of Sully's overly earnest son Peter (Dylan Walsh), it falls in 
love with its own ordinary wisdom and forfeits part of our interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The best things about "Nobody's Fool" are its sideshows: Sully's verbal 
sparring with his landlady and former eighth-grade teacher Miss Beryl (Tandy), 
his erratic sometime-boss Carl Roebuck (Willis) and his beautiful but neglected 
wife, Toby (Griffith). Sully's ambivalence toward Carl, the kind of demented 
macho tricks they play on each other, turns out to be the film's most original 
and intriguing relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Though, as always with Newman, we never quite feel he could have been as bad a 
guy as the script insists he was, he remains the reason to see "Nobody's Fool." 
The film's various difficulties inevitably fade from memory, but his 
performance lingers, as the great ones always do. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for "some language and nudity." Times guidelines: It 
includes scenes of topless women in non-sexual contexts.

 Clashing Messages: The Rev. Jesse Jackson found himself in the middle of a 
dust-up with Great Britain's leadership this week after Channel 4, the British 
commercial network, booked his prerecorded Christmas Day message attacking 
British racism at the same hour the annual Christmas greeting from Queen 
Elizabeth is slated to air on the BBC and ITV. Jackson said Wednesday that the 
3 p.m. scheduling for both messages on the two British networks was "a matter 
of marketing" by Channel 4 over which he had no control. He said he was asked 
by the commercial network to record the message to the people of Britain and 
that it certainly "was not intended to be an insult to the queen." Jackson said 
he is appealing to the British "to stop the intolerance," which he blames for 
five deaths in the United Kingdom during the year. Home Secretary Michael 
Howard, the Cabinet member responsible for law and order, was quoted by the 
Sunday Times as saying, "We have nothing to learn from Mr. Jesse Jackson on 
these issues." Jackson said he wants to remind people that "Mary and Joseph 
were a homeless couple, and there are people in the same condition in 
Birmingham; Mary, an unwed mother, would have been an outcast."

 Leno Returns a Favor: NBC late-night host Jay Leno is about to turn up on ABC, 
reportedly as an auto mechanic. Leno recently taped a cameo on ABC's "Home 
Improvement" for airing early next year. "Tim Allen has done a number of funny 
bits on 'The Tonight Show' with Jay, and he's always wanted Jay to do something 
on his show," an ABC spokeswoman said. Leno's not ignoring his employer, 
though: He has a couple of cameos in two NBC series -- "Friends" and "Mad About 
You" -- that will also air early in the new year.

 What an Act to Follow: ABC will use TV's highest-rated annual event, the Super 
Bowl, to deliver an audience for "Extreme," a new action-adventure series that 
has been described as "Baywatch" on the ski slopes. "Extreme," shot in Park 
City, Utah, stars James Brolin as the head of a mountain search-and-rescue 
team. The Jan. 29 premiere, immediately after Super Bowl XXIX, will air a full 
month before the series appears in its regular time slot on Thursdays at 8 
p.m., replacing "Matlock." But the huge initial audience "Extreme" most likely 
will receive is no guarantee of success. The last hit series to launch on any 
network after the Super Bowl was "The Wonder Years" in 1988. POP/ROCK

 Doggy Dogg's World: There was good news Wednesday for rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg 
when Anchorage, Alaska, Mayor Rick Mystrom rejected concerns about the 
likelihood of profanity and sexually explicit lyrics and said the performer's 
Dec. 30 concert could go on as scheduled. Mystrom said he was "not in a 
position to legislate morality." Then there was the bad news: Sheriff's 
deputies in Lake Charles, La., who had gone to the rapper's hotel room to serve 
papers in a civil lawsuit, said they smelled marijuana. They arrested the 
performer under his legal name of Calvin Broadus and also took in three of his 
band members. All were freed after posting $2,000 bond each on misdemeanor 
charges. The group canceled a Wednesday night concert it had scheduled in Lake 
Charles, where ticket sales reportedly were slow. Then early Thursday, five 
people were arrested after a brawl. Authorities said some were believed to be 
band members. Broadus, who was not among them, has a bigger legal problem in 
Los Angeles, where he is facing trial on charges of murder next month. . . . 
And in another case, rap star Tupac Shakur, recovering from gunshot wounds, was 
told by a New York state appellate judge Wednesday that he has to come up with 
$3-million bail by today or surrender for sentencing on a first-degree sexual 
abuse conviction. Shakur was shot five times and robbed of $40,000 in jewelry 
on Nov. 30 near Times Square while jury deliberations were still going on.

 Entertainer Liza Minnelli was released from Century City Hospital on Thursday, 
reportedly recovering nicely from hip-replacement surgery. . . . Motley Crue 
drummer Tommy Lee was booked on an abuse charge Wednesday after his girlfriend, 
Bobbie Brown, flagged down a sheriff's cruiser in Malibu and said Lee had 
beaten her, a sheriff's spokesman said. Lee was freed on $50,000 bail about 
three hours later. . . . Dr. Art Ulene, former health reporter on NBC's "Today" 
show, will reappear next month to do a series on weight loss. ART BERMAN

POP MUSIC REVIEW; A NIGHT PLAYING THE BLUES FOR TITO JACKSON AND UNCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After last year's "Jackson Family Horrors" -- uh, " Honors " -- who would 
expect much from a show headlined by any member of the Jackson clan not named 
Michael or Janet? 
</P>
<P>
 Not many people, apparently, judging from the paltry turnout Wednesday at the 
House of Blues for a show featuring Tito Jackson and the Jackson kids' Uncle 
Luther.Even with the questionable hint of guest stars mentioned in ads and 
listings for the blues show, only a couple of hundred people were willing to 
chance a precious evening in this busy season. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who did show up seemed a bit surprised that it was, indeed, a 
straight blues concert, with Uncle Luther fronting his Phoenix-based band and 
Tito merely joining in as guitarist. It was "Hoochie Coochie Man" and "Got My 
Mojo Working," not "I'll Be There" or "Dancing Machine," and a few restless 
fans soon started chanting "Tito . . . Tito." 
</P>
<P>
 But then people began to look past whatever expectations they might have had 
coming in and got into the spirit of the music. Soon the dance floor filled 
with folks shaking to the spirited, although hardly distinctive, performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to just come out and have some fun for a change," said Tito, 41, 
in a pre-show interview, noting that anything the Jacksons do is usually 
surrounded by a circus atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 And on that level, the show was a success. Luther Jackson, who taught his 
famous nieces and nephews blues licks when they were young, sang and played 
with winning fervor, while Tito impressed with lead guitar work straight out of 
the B.B. King book. 
</P>
<P>
 It was nothing to make you forget the Jackson's "Victory" tour. But it was a 
nice diversion that lived up to its modest good intentions. STEVE HOCHMAN

MOVIE REVIEW; FAMILY GATHERING BRINGS OUT FAMILY CRISES IN 'SAFE PASSAGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are so many family crises in "Safe Passage" that it seizes up right in 
front of our eyes. Did even Eugene O'Neill cram as much mother-father-son 
misery into one evening? 
</P>
<P>
 It's about Mag Singer (Susan Sarandon), her seven sons and her estranged 
husband, Patrick (Sam Shepard). The subplots and cross-plots total about 14 -- 
any of them would be enough to fill out a movie. And yet, all together, they 
form a big glob of undifferentiated upset. The film wears you out without 
bringing you deep down into the Singers' predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 The crux of the film is that one of the Singer boys, Percival (Matt Kessler), 
is a Marine stationed in a barracks in the Sinai that has been bombed by 
terrorists. It's not clear whether he has survived. As the family assembles in 
Mag's house to await the news -- all but her youngest, Simon (Nick Stahl), have 
moved out -- they rehash their connection to Percival and to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take long to sort out the players since everybody seems to be 
tagged with just one distinct personality trait apiece. Izzy (Sean Astin) is 
the brainy scientist who figures why his father keeps going periodically blind; 
Alfred (Robert Sean Leonard) is the control freak who is paired with an "older" 
woman (Marcia Gay Harden); Simon puts Jell-O in his hair so he can have 
dreadlocks; Gideon (Jason London) is the star athlete who feels guilty that he 
outran Percival in high school; the college-age twins Merle and Darren (Philip 
and Steve Ross) are, well, twins. Their dad is an inventor -- a tinkerer, 
really. 
</P>
<P>
 Percival we see entirely in flashbacks -- both the childhood and the adult 
variety. We also see him in the home movies and videos from Sinai that 
punctuate the family wailing and cheering. This business of watching home 
movies of a loved one has become such a movie cliche that you'd think the 
screenwriter, Deena Goldstone, and the director, Robert Allan Ackerman, would 
cook up something else. But "Safe Passage" is unafraid of the unadorned cliche. 
It tries to raise cliche to the level of art by sheer voluminous effort. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of Sarandon, and possibly Shepard and Astin, none of the 
performers have much authenticity. Sarandon is excellent -- she takes her wiggy 
Mother Courage role about as far as it can go. Her Mag has a well-worn look; 
you can believe that this women spent all those years mothering and mediating 
her brood. And she has a look in her eye for her husband that's a woozy 
combination of lust and stupefaction. Sarandon makes the movie worth seeing -- 
barely.

MOVIE REVIEW; OLD-FASHIONED FAMILY FUN IN THE 'JUNGLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID KRONKE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though aimed at younger audiences, "Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book" makes 
its case for the nobility of the "wild child" in a manner more entertaining and 
far less condescending than the recent Jodie Foster vehicle, "Nell." 
</P>
<P>
 This is Hollywood's third pass on Kipling's adventures of Mowgli, the young 
Indian raised by wild animals. In Zoltan Korda's 1942 adaptation, Mowgli simply 
wandered from his family before encountering his bestial tutors. This being 
1994, however, gunshots and fireballs and vehicular peril must accompany his 
disappearance from civilization (some of this film's mayhem, in fact, may be 
too extreme for younger moviegoers). 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually the whole of Disney's 1967 animated "Jungle Book" -- paid homage to 
here in a throwaway line about "bare necessities" -- took place in the middle 
of a trick shot here, where the tyke Mowgli steps behind some brush and emerges 
as the fully grown, fully buff Jason Scott Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to civilization, Mowgli is smitten with Kitty (Lena Headey), a young 
woman he knew as a child. Kitty and the jolly Dr. Plumford (John Cleese) take 
to this placid savage, while Kitty's boyfriend, the yuppie-prototype Boone 
(Cary Elwes), clearly does not; her father, Major Brydon (Sam Neill), is 
likewise less than sanguine about his daughter making time with such a raw 
specimen. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever the colonialist, Boone decides to exploit the locals, bullying Mowgli 
into showing him an enormous hidden treasure trove. Mowgli must dispatch Boone 
and his cackling cronies and rescue Kitty, Brydon and Plumford. 
</P>
<P>
 Director/co-writer Stephen Sommers earlier scripted the banal "Gunmen" and 
wrote and directed "The Adventures of Huck Finn." In a strange way, he's 
melding those two pictures into one, and in a stranger way, he succeeds, for 
his "Jungle Book" provides both rowdy thrills and old-fashioned family 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sommers achieves some neat effects here, particularly in scenes in which 
scores of animals react to Mowgli's misadventures in an amusingly 
anthropomorphic fashion (29 trainers are credited). His location crew -- the 
film was shot in England, India and the United States -- found expansive 
panoramas and gorgeous scenery. Yet there's the occasional cheesy process shot 
or unconvincing matte painting, suggesting Sommers overreached a bit on his 
limited budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, not many live-action Disney films in the past few years have been 
accused of being too ambitious, and Sommers offers enough wit to engage the 
adults while kids can enjoy the evergreen premise of Kipling's yarn. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee plays an innocent credibly and expressively in an almost mute performance. 
Elwes' character revels in evil with absolutely brittle wit. One wishes that 
more use could have been found for Neill and Cleese, who seem more than willing 
to play along. 
</P>
<P>
 But even at its most workmanlike, "Jungle Book" entertains in a way both 
contemporary and traditional. And how long has it been since you've seen a 
movie where someone drowns in quicksand? 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA-rating: PG, for "action/violence and some mild language." Times 
guidelines: It includes many scenes of mayhem, including the shooting of people 
and animals, which may upset younger children.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'COLONEL CHABERT': AN IMPRESSIVE DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When cinematographers direct their first films, arresting imagery is to be 
expected. But even by those standards, what Yves Angelo has accomplished in 
"Colonel Chabert" is especially impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 Working here with director of photography Bernard Lutic, Angelo reveals the 
same gift for glowing visuals both intimate and panoramic he displayed in 
shooting "Tout Les Matins du Monde," "Un Coeur en Hiver," "The Accompanist" and 
"Germinal." 
</P>
<P>
 Set in the early 19th Century, "Colonel Chabert's" visual centerpiece is its 
re-creation of 1807's Battle of Eylau, one of Napoleon's costliest triumphs. 
The scenes of the French cavalry charge, the subsequent hand-to-hand combat, 
and especially the wrenching but beautiful sequence depicting the collection of 
swords, helmets, coats and the like from the bodies of the dead that opens the 
film all make up the best treatment of this kind of material since Orson 
Welles' benchmark "Falstaff." 
</P>
<P>
 But -- and this is unusual for a former cinematographer -- Angelo is as 
interested in the interior life of his people as in their appearance. Working 
here with co-screenwriter Jean Cosmos, Angelo was not surprisingly drawn to the 
Balzac story that "Colonel Chabert" is based on. For no writer has a greater 
zest for psychological acuity, for character as revealed in melodramatic 
crisis, than the great French novelist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chabert" proper begins 10 years after Eylau, in the busy (and beautifully 
mounted) Paris office of Derville (Fabrice Luchini), a wizardly lawyer who 
neither sleeps nor loses cases. A strange and distant man (Gerard Depardieu) 
has been showing up at all hours, insisting on a private audience. When it is 
finally arranged, the man tells the astonished Derville that he is Col. 
Chabert, one of Napoleon's favorites, thought killed at Eylau but now returned 
to a semblance of life. "I'd like not to be me," he says somberly, "but here I 
am." 
</P>
<P>
 What Chabert wants is to recover his property from his formidable former wife 
(Fanny Ardant), now the Countess Ferraud. Believing him dead, she increased the 
fortune she inherited from him and married the upwardly mobile Count Ferraud 
(Andre Dussollier) after the post-Napoleonic restoration of the monarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Derville, who is also the Countess' attorney, is intrigued by this tale 
despite himself. Is this man truly Chabert or a deluded impostor? And what 
effect will his reappearance have on the Countess' marriage, potentially shaky 
because her Napoleonic past is getting in the way of her husband's ambitions? 
</P>
<P>
 Director Angelo has brought an elegant and precise style to the working out of 
this dramatic situation that nicely counterpoints the great passions involved. 
He has paid attention to everything, including the beauty of the spoken French 
and the creation of handsome physical settings for characters who worship 
wealth and possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 A former classical pianist, Angelo has also chosen the film's musical 
selections from Beethoven, Mozart, Scarlatti, Schumann and Schubert with more 
than usual care, and gotten seamless performances from his fine actors and even 
seen to it that his narrative has a subtle and haunting finale. If there's any 
more a debut film could accomplish, it's hard to think what it might be. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: Unrated. Times guidelines: It examines mature themes and 
includes scenes of the carnage of battle.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'I.Q.' SCORES MOST POINTS WITH MATTHAU'S EINSTEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I.Q." has one good idea: to cast Walter Matthau as Albert Einstein. Put a 
shuffling, German-accented Matthau in a sweat shirt, a silvery mustache and 
lion's mane, and you've got an amusingly convincing take on the man who devised 
the theory of relativity. Matthau's Einstein, however, dotes on a relative, his 
pretty mathematician niece Catherine (Meg Ryan), not relativity. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, it's writers Andy Breckman and Michael Leeson's notion to have Einstein 
play matchmaker for Catherine. It's the kind of news that automatically makes 
you wary, and "I.Q." wastes no time in confirming your suspicion that we're in 
for a lot of contrived foolishness. 
</P>
<P>
 It's nice to see Matthau make Einstein a mensch, but it's off-putting to watch 
him and his three elderly genius pals (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) 
indulge in exceedingly elaborate ruses to steer Catherine away from an obtuse 
experimental psychologist (Stephen Fry, Peter in "Peter's Friends") and toward 
an ace Princeton auto mechanic (Tim Robbins). 
</P>
<P>
 Matthau himself takes a subtle, gentle nudging approach, but the script calls 
for him to indulge in major interference in his niece's life and to perform 
acts of credibility-defying dishonesty, such as passing off Robbins as a 
scientific genius, not just to Catherine but to the entire world. (The script 
also requires him to come right out and say the deathless phrase, "Don't let 
your brain get in the way of your heart," and it could have emphasized a bit 
more that Einstein wants to prevent Catherine from making the mistakes he 
made.) 
</P>
<P>
 Breckman and Leeson are dexterous in plotting out a finish that's clever 
scientifically, but they've not been able to banish the specter of 
predictability that hangs over the entire film. 
</P>
<P>
 The way the film, which tries hard to evoke '30s romantic screwball comedy, 
tells it, Robbins is a smart, likable guy for whom an encounter with Ryan 
really is love at first sight. Ryan, on the other hand, feels that she must 
make a "sensible" marriage -- well, it is the '50s -- while not completely 
acknowledging to herself just how intellectually daunted she is by her loving 
uncle, how obligated she feels to marry a genius. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthau has the best role, but Robbins and Ryan are finally simply too good 
for their material, which is not nearly inspired enough to do justice to their 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes for director Fred Schepisi, who makes the most of each and every 
situation, but should be expending his efforts on a picture, whether comedy or 
drama, that's more worthy of his proven gifts. 
</P>

of ethically dubious situations.

MOVIE REVIEW; TORTURE, REVENGE, 'DEATH AND THE MAIDEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Death and the Maiden" is about the consequences of torture, and it never lets 
up. Essentially a three-character drama in a single location, it's an expert 
piece of claustrophobic cinema, but after a while you may want to break away 
from it. The film bears down on the audience with an almost sadistic relish. 
It's an unsettling experience, but not a particularly rich one. It's too 
schematic and self-important for that. 
</P>
<P>
 Ariel Dorfman's play, produced on Broadway in 1992 and from which the film is 
adapted, has its roots in the playwright's exile from Chile in 1973 during the 
coup that overthrew President Salvador Allende. Like the play, the film, 
adapted by Dorfman and Rafael Yglesias and directed by Roman Polanski, is set 
in an unnamed country in South America after the fall of a right-wing 
dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins with Paulina Escobar (Sigourney Weaver) pacing like a tigress within 
the confines of her cliffside home as a rainstorm strikes and the power goes 
out. Then her husband, Gerardo Escobar (Stuart Wilson), a lawyer newly 
appointed by the President to head up a commission investigating the human 
rights violations of the overthrown fascist regime, is dropped off at home 
after his car has broken down in the flood. His Good Samaritan is a Dr. Roberto 
Miranda (Ben Kingsley), a convivial physician who professes his admiration for 
Gerardo's leftism. Paulina -- who was blindfolded, tortured and raped 
repeatedly by a fascist physician 15 years earlier -- overhears Miranda's voice 
and freezes in horror. Is this the voice of the man who brutalized her? 
</P>
<P>
 The film is about what happens when Paulina turns the tables on the man she 
believes is responsible for the horrors she still lives with. Strapping him to 
a chair, bludgeoning him, stuffing his mouth with her panties, she demands he 
confess to his crimes -- that's the only way he'll be allowed to survive. Her 
husband, willing at first to believe Miranda's protestations of innocence, 
assumes the role of his defender. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's about it, for 103 gruesome minutes. As we hear more and more 
details of Paulina's torture and Miranda's denials, the film turns into a 
grindingly creepy whodunit. (Even the closed-off, candle-lit set is reminiscent 
of a murder mystery.) But the characters are so ideologically drawn that they 
lose our sympathies -- they're stand-ins in Dorfman's existential morality play 
about justice and revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Polanski, who no doubt connected up to this material on personal levels of his 
own, does a very good job of keeping the creepiness at full boil; there's never 
a moment in this film when you don't feel the threat of sudden violence. But if 
there's a larger dimension to be found in all this, Polanski didn't find it 
(and perhaps it's a good thing he didn't go looking). "Death and the Maiden" -- 
the title comes from the Schubert string quartet played repeatedly while 
Paulina was raped -- works best as a horror movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver plays the role in high-style heroic fashion. She's overwrought with 
vengeance. There's nothing frail or damaged about this woman -- she has become 
pure will. Kingsley, in the film's most difficult role, keeps you guessing 
about Miranda's motives. 
</P>
<P>
 Miranda has such a wheedling, flabbergasted, enraged presence that a few of 
his scenes with Paulina play like a nightmare parody of a bad marriage. She 
accuses him of lying, he pleads innocence, she tortures him. The batterer gets 
battered. Wilson's Gerardo, caught in the middle, has all the ineffectuality of 
a spurned suitor. He wants to believe his wife, but he also -- perhaps out of 
cowardice -- wants to believe Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
 Polanski has rightly resisted the urge to "open up" the play by bringing it 
outdoors. When he finally does move the action cliffside, the ocean vistas are 
as intimidating and closed-off as the Escobar's living room/torture chamber. 
Everything in this film works up to its final ambiguous image, and yet Polanski 
may have overvalued its inexorability. We're supposed to get a case of the cold 
creeps, but a response of "So what?" would be equally appropriate. 
</P>
<P>

RESTAURANT REVIEW; WHERE THEY GET DOWN TO BASIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christmas shopping in West Hollywood, I run into an acquaintance who asks me 
to recommend a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had lunch at Basix," I say. "It's that spin-off of Marix on the corner 
of Santa Monica and Flores." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know, I know," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've eaten there?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Only every single day," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky her. I first stumbled into Basix one rainy night with a friend after a 
particularly inedible dinner. We hoped to grab a bite of something at least 
mildly satisfying -- a muffin, a sandwich -- before heading home. 
</P>
<P>
 I had driven by Basix dozens of times and assumed it was another 
soup-and-sandwich coffee house like so many others that have sprung up all over 
the city. I was surprised, then, to find a cozy, quietly elegant little cafe 
with a full menu, an amiable, relaxed West Hollywood crowd, and the ambience of 
a Paris bistro: marble tables and countertops, dark wicker, antique beveled 
mirrors, French doors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our fortifying snack turned into a three-course dinner including a smooth, 
cumin-scented acorn squash soup, thin pizza made with impeccably fresh 
vegetables and fontina cheese. A beautifully cooked slab of salmon came with 
crunchy-fresh steamed spinach and mashed red potatoes I've longed for ever 
since. And who could resist the old-fashioned dense gingerbread with a lemon 
glaze and/or the serious lemon pound cake? The rain kept up, we drank excellent 
coffees, our young waiter was chipper and witty -- there wasn't a wrong note in 
the whole experience. 
</P>
<P>
 I returned soon, for breakfast. (Basix is open for breakfast, lunch, dinner 
and all-day coffee klatching.) During the day, there's only counter service -- 
table service starts at 5 p.m. for dinner -- but the counter crew is 
surprisingly efficient and unruffled, even with our large, diverse order. 
Again, the baked goods impressed: specifically the bran and the lemon-ginger 
muffins. But a folded omelette with fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil and a 
flat omelette with spicy chicken sausage were nothing to complain about. French 
toast, crisped and buttery and sprinkled with confectioners sugar, made syrup 
optional. 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch, sandwiches come on sturdy-but-soft house-baked rolls. Tuna salad in 
the tuna "tartine" sandwich is studded with chopped sweet peppers and dressed 
with a refreshing vinaigrette rather than mayonnaise. Nothing wrong with a 
plump, juicy turkey burger, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizzas with paper-thin crusts are a big hit here, and for good reason: not so 
bready, with a whiff of good wood-fire smokiness, they look like pretty, 
abstract food paintings and pack a good wallop of flavor. Rock shrimp is paired 
with chipotle sauce, roasted red peppers with tapenade and goat cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad more restaurants haven't caught on that good pasta is the basic 
building block of good pasta dishes; eating Basix's Gorgonzola chicken 
fettuccine I admired the sturdy, tasty noodle itself, and then the restrained 
use of Gorgonzola and inspired addition of arugula. Supple rigatoni baked in a 
creamy red sauce with fresh vegetables is a perfect cold-weather dish. 
</P>
<P>
 There are nightly specials -- a turkey "T-bone," that simple salmon -- and 
otherwise, just two grilled entrees: a vegetable plate and the "Tuscan" 
chicken, a fabulous rosemary-infused breast topped with a light tomato puree 
and hanks of grilled red onion. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 There must be a devoted and talented home cook back in that kitchen turning 
out one terrific item after another: knock-out fat-free chocolate cookies 
called "clouds"; a sugar-free cherry tart; a numinous fluffy, barely-sweet 
pumpkin cheesecake . . . and we didn't get to the layer cakes or other cookies, 
bars and brownies. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, we had to look hard for any shortcomings. Oh, we ordered the last 
slice of a pumpkin cake and it was a bit dry and the fruit salad had sat for a 
few hours. But this is grasping at straws. 
</P>
<P>
 Every neighborhood should be so lucky to have such a gem. In fact, Basix's 
food is so fresh, inexpensive and well-prepared, it seems effortless -- and 
thus raises the question: Why isn't every place this good?

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: AT PLANET EARTH, NO ONE NEEDS TO FEEL DEPRIVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Mother Nature doesn't serve junk food. We don't either. No chemicals, refined 
sugars, animal fats or tropical oils. At Planet Earth, you can have your cake 
and eat it too," reads the statement of intent at Planet Earth, a new natural 
foods bistro in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that's something we'd all like to believe. And with Alex Lombardo in the 
kitchen, it has every chance of coming true. That's because Lombardo, Drago's 
longtime head chef, is into it. He's going all out to reduce the fat content, 
devising ways to make risotto without the butter and cheese, pasta without the 
seductive gloss of extra virgin olive oil. (At Drago, he says, they used to go 
through a case of it a week.) 
</P>
<P>
 In Planet Earth's kitchen, he uses minimal amounts of canola oil instead and 
vegetable and seafood broths to infuse flavor. There's not a speck of butter in 
the house, but he does have some extra virgine stashed away and on request, 
will drizzle a little over your pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 No one need feel deprived with a menu that includes thin crisped tortilla 
"pizza" topped with smoked chicken, roasted garlic and mozzarella, homemade 
gnocchi with wild mushroom ragout or house-smoked salad sandwich or balsamic 
glazed quail and spinach salad. Or specials like turkey osso buco or jumbo sea 
scallops over baby artichokes. No more than 5g of fat per portion? Even better. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts, for which there are a growing number of fans, are the creations of 
pastry chef Kelly Kline, spirited away from the world-famous Golden Door Spa by 
co-owner Cory Forshpan. Three-layer chocolate cake? Mile-high apple cobbler or 
blueberry pie? You got it -- all in low-fat, low-guilt versions. Take that cake 
and eat it. -- S. IRENE VIRBILA

RESTAURANT NEWS: LOUISE'S LOOKS TO ITALIAN ROOTS IN REVAMPING MENU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you've found yourself asking for extra sauce on the side with your 
fettuccine al pomodoro e basilico at Louise's Trattoria lately, you are not 
alone. Co-owner Bill Chait reports requests for side orders of red sauce have 
gone up 25% in the past month. Instead of ladling it over the top, the sauce is 
now tossed with the pasta. Just last week, Chait had five complaints that the 
clams in the popular tagliolini alle vongole weren't fresh . They still are. 
Now the new Italian chef steams the clams open, removes them from the shell and 
then adds them back to the sauce at the very last moment to avoid overcooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Louise's Trattoria, former home of oversauced pastas, overcheesed pizzas and 
oversized portions, has undergone a major make-over. Last year, Chait decided 
to change the chain's image. He and partner Howard Weinberg had their eyes on 
some out-of-state locations and felt Louise's menu could be improved and could 
certainly be more authentic. They decided to prune the excess and upgrade the 
quality of their ingredients. To that end, they brought in Mauro Vincenti to 
work the transformation. The owner of Rex il Ristorante downtown and Alto 
Palato on La Cienega is notorious for his inability to compromise. First step: 
Chait and Vincenti went on a shopping binge in Italy, buying up pasta-making 
machines, extra virgin olive oil, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, Parma ham. They 
even picked up a few chefs along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The new, improved menu was unveiled last month and now the partners are 
holding their breath to see what the reaction will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest part is dealing with customers who have been ordering the same 
items over and over for years," Chait says. "After the complaints about the 
clams, I suggested throwing the shells back in, but Mauro threatened to shoot 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been some concessions, though. One of their bestsellers, spaghetti 
aglio e olio, used to contain mushrooms, olives and Parmesan cheese. Vincenti 
insisted on the traditional version, which includes only extra virgin olive 
oil, garlic and maybe a little dried red chili pepper. But now if a customer 
demands it, they will grate a little Parmigiano-Reggiano over the pasta at the 
table. And penne rigate with asparagus, mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes in 
pesto sauce -- not exactly an Italian classic -- is still on the menu. "We 
couldn't touch this item," says Chait. "People would scream." 
</P>

 Palmimony: Cindy Costner may be walking away with $80 mil from her soon-to-be 
ex-husband, but she and Kevin still haven't settled who gets custody of their 
Pasadena restaurant Twin Palms. Maybe they'll have to split up the trees? "No 
way," says chef-partner Michael Roberts. "The impression I got is that they'll 
take joint custody. But I don't ask too many questions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stats: According to a press release from Terrazza Toscana, white wine drinkers 
(and you know who you are) are the least adventurous customers. . . . The 
latest Zagat survey found 60-year-olds love the Hamburger Hamlet more than any 
other age group. The survey also noted that L.A. diners are cheap tippers 
compared to their New York counterparts. In L.A. 59% said they tip 15% or less 
vs. 39% in New York.

 Mr. October: Brad Johnson, who owns both the nightclub Roxbury on Sunset Strip 
and the Melrose Avenue restaurant Georgia, has a good nose for business. But 
the young entrepreneur has other assets, too. And most of them are visible in a 
pinup calendar published by Baraka Entertainment. The 1995 calendar, which 
features 12 African American hunks, including Johnson, heavyweight boxer Lennox 
Lewis, tennis champ Yannick Noah and actor Wolfgang Bodison ("A Few Good Men") 
is available by calling (800) 600-5026.

 Reinventions: Andre's of Beverly Hills will become Andre's Trattoria. The 
34-year-old landmark is closed for a face lift and is expected to reopen by the 
end of the month. "Andre sold us the restaurant," says Donna Minaise, one of 
the new co-owners. "But he's going to stay on for a year. It's going to be 
very, very beautiful." . . . Pane Caldo in West Hollywood is also undergoing a 
change. Longtime general manager Paul Scalisi, who recently purchased the 
restaurant, has already reduced dinner prices. In April, he plans to close the 
Beverly Boulevard bistro for a few weeks and reopen with a new look and a new 
menu. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Closings: La Grange, a homey fixture on Westwood Boulevard for 26 years, will 
close its doors on Jan. 9. Owners Monique and Rudy Vallee were unsuccessful in 
negotiating a new lease on their old-fashioned French restaurant. . . . Sabor 
Restaurant in Silver Lake folded a month ago but the larger, more ambitious 
spinoff cafe, Sabor Too, is still serving up Cajun and Latin dishes in Santa 
Monica. Meanwhile, Lo Sabroso has opened in the Sabor Silver Lake space 
featuring a Mexican-influenced menu.

THEATER BEAT: 'SNOW MAIDEN' A HEARTFELT HISTORY FABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although not an overtly Christmas-themed play, the second coming of Glorious 
Repertory Company's original work "The Snow Maiden" taps into the holiday 
spirit more eloquently and effectively than many a "Christmas Carol" revival. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's not about shopping and eating too much. But it does deal with human 
connections that endure despite the inevitable changes and separations wrought 
by the passage of time -- precisely the ties we celebrate in our Yuletide 
reunions and remembrances. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly effective is the simplicity and emotional honesty with which 
director and co-creator Debbie Devine presents the story of Anna (Cheryl 
Crabtree), a Jewish girl in turn-of-the-century Russia who grows up to become a 
world-famous photographer. 
</P>
<P>
 The character is loosely based on Life magazine's Margaret Bourke-White, whose 
photos are sometimes used here as illuminated backdrops. But the play at the 
Odyssey Theatre draws just as freely from imagination and from folk tales. This 
is emotional, not literal, history set amid a climate of fear -- first of a 
repressive czarist regime that imprisons and murders Anna's political activist 
parents (Erick Melton, Sharon McMahon), and later of the Nazi occupation forces 
in Paris, where Anna tries to conceal her Jewish origins. 
</P>
<P>
 The story's central theme is symbolized in the Russian fable Anna's father 
tells her about an infertile farmer and his wife who form a child out of snow 
to ease their loneliness. Although the Snow Child melts in the sun, it promises 
the grieving parents it will be with them always, in the tears in their eyes 
and the water that nourishes their crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Characteristically, the pragmatic Anna has little patience for her father's 
romanticized fairy tales -- she's much more interested in the camera her more 
entrepreneurial Uncle Moishe (Bruce Bierman) has brought her. 
</P>
<P>
 As a photographer, Anna becomes obsessed with capturing the essence of her 
subjects in a permanent record, but the direction of her life is in learning to 
appreciate that "some things are not meant for capture . . . but you can keep 
them with you in your heart." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a lesson related with agreeable charm thanks to thoughtful staging and 
polished performances featuring the cast in multiple roles. Nina Minton is a 
flamboyant presence as the Parisian chanteuse Claire Voyant ("Don't laugh -- I 
know what you're thinking"), whose desperate effort to protect her baby 
provides Anna with a chance to absolve her own lingering guilt for hiding when 
her parents were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Although co-author Jay McAdams' exaggerated, drawling, fictionalized portrayal 
of Life's founding editor Henry Luce clashes with the otherwise subtle 
performances, he later shines in a brief scene about a young German soldier 
unable to bridge the gulf of politics as he courts McMahon's French flower 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Goodson makes a suitably smug but witless Nazi commander. Casey Mervine's 
delicate gestures as a silent spirit enhance the story's inner magic, as when 
he strokes Anna's sprouting angel wings at a crucial turning point. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Snow Maiden's" heartfelt message and visual inventiveness are sure to 
appeal to family audiences, provided children are mature enough to appreciate 
the play's historical and interpersonal complexities (10 and over are the 
recommended ages). 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Snow Maiden," Odyssey Theatre, 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd., West L.A.; 
Monday through Friday, 8 p.m.; Starting Jan. 4: Wednesdays - Saturdays, 8 p.m.; 
Sundays, 2 and 7 p.m. Ends Jan. 15. $12.50. (310) 477-2055. Running time: 1

THEATER BEAT: 'TYLER HUDSON': COMEDIC ANGST  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only 20 years old, Jake Kasdan has already written four produced plays. His 
precocity is evident in the latest, "The Behavioral Patterns of Funnyman Tyler 
Hudson," a fairly sophisticated but uneven romantic comedy, which he also 
directed, at the Hollywood Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasdan, son of film director Lawrence Kasdan, has brought Generation X hipness 
to a mundane coming-of-age story concerning young Tyler Hudson (Jason Gedrick). 
Hudson works a day job at the auto club, outlining suggested routes for 
motorists, but his real passion is stand-up comedy, which he pursues as an 
amateur in Los Angeles clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Grist for the comedy routine comes, of course, from Hudson's romantic life, 
which is as tangled as his sheepdog-like bangs. He still carries a torch for 
Emily (Heather Graham), the ex-girlfriend who dumped him for a rodeo cowboy, 
and has also grown fond of Jan (Alexandra Powers), a wispy waitress who 
complains people don't take her seriously because she believes in fairies. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasdan has a clear knack for sharp, off-kilter characterizations. Best is 
Hudson's father (David Doty), a pompous science professor who analyzes every 
real-life problem by making analogies to genetic theory. A lecture in which he 
expounds on the evolution of the winged flying monkey is funny mainly because 
of the professor's breezy confidence in the ability of Darwinism to explain 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the vignettes drag on as Kasdan relies on soap-opera dramatics and snappy 
one-liners, those TV staples that seem so precious onstage. Hudson's comedy 
monologues, delivered in the ironic and urbane style of Paul Reiser and Jerry 
Seinfeld, are steeped in too much young-adult Angst and not nearly enough wit 
or insight. By the end, it's difficult to say exactly what protagonist or 
viewer has come away with. 
</P>
<P>
 The performances and technical credits are as good as money can buy. But as a 
play "Funnyman" proves a slacker, for better and -- more often -- worse. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Behavioral Patterns of Funnyman Tyler Hudson," Hollywood Playhouse, 
1445 N. Las Palmas Ave., Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends Jan. 7.

ALBUM REVIEW; BAKER MIXES IT UP WITH A TRIBAL TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * * 1/2 GINGER BAKER "Going Back Home", Atlantic  
</P>
<P>
 Is there anybody left alive who still finds Ginger Baker's drum solo from 
"Toad" the peak of the percussionist craft? Not likely. But Baker has refined 
his play since his glory days with Cream, recording with such musicians as Fela 
Kuti, Bill Laswell, L. Shankar and Sonny Sharrock over the years. Today his 
sound has a tribal feel -- part Ed Blackwell, part Keith Moon -- that's heavy 
with tom-tom rolls and take-it-to-the-bridge accents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home" finds the drummer in strange company, paired with tweed-suited Ornette 
Coleman veteran Charlie Haden on upright bass and sparky, fly-guitarist Bill 
Frisell. Surprisingly, the three make for a slick synthesis, Haden's hillbilly 
hipness standing solidly behind Frisell's twangy tones while Baker drums up 
accommodating grooves that are wide if not particularly deep. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 tunes cover blues, jazz and rock bases with Baker's own contributions 
giving the date a Middle Eastern flavor. On Frisell's "Rambler," the drummer 
strikes up a march so slack it shuffles. Thelonious Monk's "Straight No Chaser" 
moves with swagger as Baker's tom and cymbal shots stumble along behind 
Frisell's woozy tones. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker's longtime fans will best like his "East Timor." On it, Baker's spoken 
polemics about the island's strife, more solemn recitation than rap, give way 
to a strong rock jam that features hot licks from both drums and guitar. But 
jazz fans looking for pin-point precision and polyrhythmic complexity will find 
this disc too loose and loopy. BILL KOHLHAASE

JAZZ NOTES: PLAY IT AGAIN: REISSUES FLOOD THE RACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As those holiday shopping hours rapidly fade away, gifts that keep on giving 
may be hard to find. But jazz CD reissues are in great quantity now and make 
quick, relatively inexpensive purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are our Top 10 reissues (in alphabetical order) for 1994, most of which 
can be readily found in any major chain store -- Tower, Wherehouse -- or 
independents -- Poo-Bah's in Pasadena, Aron's in Los Angeles, Rhino in Westwood 
and the recently expanded selection at Dutton's Books in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 * LOUIS ARMSTRONG, "Highlights From His Decca Years," (Decca). This is a 
virtual recorded history of the first great jazzman and jazz singer. You hear 
intimations of modernism in the trumpeter's "Wild Man Blues" from 1927, and by 
1935's "Struttin' With Some Barbeque," his horn is regally soaring. Classic 
vocals from the late '40s include "Black and Blue," "You Can't Lose a Broken 
Heart" (with Billie Holiday) and "That Lucky Old Sun." 
</P>
<P>
 * ART BLAKEY, "At the Jazz Corner of the World," (Blue Note). These "live" 
1959 sessions are choice examples of the genre known as hard bop, where blues, 
be-bop and gospel elements shook hands. With Hank Mobley (tenor sax), Lee 
Morgan (trumpet) and Bobby Timmons (piano), Blakey had three crack soloists and 
composers, and the fare is sometimes relaxed and funky, sometimes edgy and 
driving, but always rhythmically supple and melodically winsome. 
</P>
<P>
 * BILLY ECKSTINE, "Everything I Have Is Yours," (Verve). Subtitled "The Best 
of the MGM Years," this two-CD package from 1947-57 finds the magnificent 
baritone in various orchestral settings, exploring ballads ("I Apologize," "My 
Foolish Heart"), blues and a few uptempos, among them "How High the Moon" with 
the Metronome All-Stars. For sheer vocal splendor, Eckstine was hard to beat. 
</P>
<P>
 * DUKE ELLINGTON, "Live at the Blue Note," (Roulette). Ellington's orchestra 
was definitely in a prime period when it was captured in 1959 in this Chicago 
nightspot. The recording is precise and clear, due to extensive overhead miking 
and the performances by Johnny Hodges, Paul Gonsalves, Clark Terry and other 
Ducal favorites on everything from "Sophisticated Lady" to "C Jam Blues" manage 
to mix passion and verve without being florid. 
</P>
<P>
 * HERBIE HANCOCK, "Mwandishi: The Complete Warner Bros. Recordings," (Warner 
Bros.). In the early to mid-'70s, keyboardist Hancock fronted a sextet that was 
one of the most interesting and enterprising bands of the fusion era. Two of 
the three albums reissued here present that ensemble, where Hancock juggled 
atmospheric moods with charged rhythm; the other is a make-you-smile, 
funk-based session known as "Fat Albert Rotunda." 
</P>
<P>
 * JOE HENDERSON, "Four!," (Verve). The sublime rhythm section of Wynton Kelly 
(piano), Paul Chambers (bass) and Jimmy Cobb (drums) enhanced many giants, 
among them Miles Davis and Wes Montgomery. Here, the fellows surround tenorist 
Henderson with easy-chair support, and he wails on "Four," "Green Dolphin 
Street" and others. Kelly's solos are full of melodic gems. 
</P>
<P>
 * MILT JACKSON, JOE PASS, RAY BROWN "The Big 3," (Pablo). The vibist, 
guitarist and bassist freely roam this intimate setting, investigating such 
fare as "Nuages," "Wave" and "Blue Bossa" with a luxurious elan. The virtuosos 
switch seamlessly between background and foreground roles, and their ordered, 
inventive solos serve as paradigms of jazz performance. 
</P>
<P>
 * BUD POWELL, "The Best of Bud Powell on Verve," (Verve). These 17 tracks are 
an ideal introduction to the be-bop master pianist. All selections, recorded 
between 1949 and 1955 when Powell was at, or close to, his peak, are exemplary. 
Most, like "Lady Bird" and "Celia," are at easily digested medium tempos and 
there are some lovely, serene ballads, such as "It Never Entered My Mind." 
</P>
<P>
 * JOHN SCOFIELD, "Life Fire," (Gramavision). Here you can hear Scofield evolve 
from a B.B. King/Hendrix/Jim Hall-influenced, jazz-rock-bluesnik into a 
commanding individualist with a gritty, wires-sparking sound. This collection 
sports two cuts each from six Gramavision albums recorded between 1984 and 
1988, all marked by the guitarist's vigor and attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 * SARAH VAUGHAN, "The Benny Carter Sessions," (Roulette). Her voice at peak 
power, her delivery sure and to the point, Vaughan goes with both heated 
numbers -- "Honeysuckle Rose," "The Trolly Song" -- and emotional, slower songs 
-- "If I Had You," "Solitude" -- on these two early 1960s session. Carter's 
arrangements fit perfectly and Vaughan makes the numbers live and breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What to Do New Year's?: For those who still haven't decided how to celebrate 
New Year's Eve, here are a few more possibilities: At Legends of Hollywood in 
Studio City, it's drummer Frank Capp's quartet with saxman Pete Christlieb,

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; A 'SOUND OF MUSIC' LASER SET TO TREASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a season filled with long-awaited laser-disc releases of memorable films, 
the "30th Anniversary Edition" of "The Sound of Music" (Fox Video/Image 
Entertainment, $120) arrives as a hallmark. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-disc boxed set is a treasure trove for any fan of this extraordinary 
1965 film of the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical. It includes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Five extended-play sides on which the nearly three-hour movie starring Julie 
Andrews and Christopher Plummer unfolds. The gorgeous Todd-AO film, shown in a 
new film-to-tape transfer using the 65mm camera negative and interpositive, was 
supervised by director Robert Wise and produced for laser in clear, carefully 
monitored THX audio and video, with an aspect ratio of 2.2:1. The picture and 
sound are lush, far richer than an earlier (1982) laser release. 
(Intermittently, however, on the copy previewed the color seems to occasionally 
fade in and out slightly, most likely the result of problems with the original 
source material. But there is still no comparison to the earlier disc, which 
literally pales in comparison.) 
</P>
<P>
 * An 87-minute documentary, "The Sound of Music: From Fact to Phenomenon," on 
the making of the five-Oscar winner starts on the fifth side and continues on 
the standard-play sixth side. Unlike most such accounts, this documentary is a 
carefully put together, thoughtful presentation that offers valuable 
information and historical tidbits. 
</P>
<P>
 * A candid, informative commentary by Oscar-winning director Wise on an analog 
soundtrack for the full length of the film, except for the musical numbers. 
During those numbers, you can listen for the first time to the orchestration 
alone on a stereo analog track. In effect, you can have your own "Sound of 
Music" karaoke track at home, accompanied by the lush musical direction of the 
late Irwin Kostal, who also won an Academy Award. 
</P>
<P>
 * Screenwriter Ernest Lehman's ("West Side Story," "The King and I," "Somebody 
Up There Likes Me") incredibly valuable 35-minute track on the set's fifth-side 
analog channel and a booklet detailing "The Saga of the Ernest Lehman 
Screenplay." In combination, along with Wise's discussion, they are an 
invaluable course in screenwriting taught by one of the cinema's premier 
screenwriters. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 24-karat gold CD made from a new 75-minute master and including previously 
unreleased music. The music sounds great, though, it doesn't need gold to give 
it its sheen. 
</P>
<P>
 * An eight-page full-color booklet with pictures of the entire cast, including 
the seven children (who have all remained good friends), a timeline beginning 
with the birth of Georg von Trapp in 1880, and excellent chapter stops so you 
can find any scene or musical number in an instant. 
</P>
<P>
 * A host of interactive still archives tracing the history of the Von Trapp 
family, on whom the story is based, and the making of the film take up the 
balance of the sixth side. And, if you let them, the balance of a well-spent 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, most of the principal players in the film's saga were alive during 
the making of this commemorative edition and cooperated eagerly in the 
production of this laser set, which took more than a year for producer Mike 
Matessino to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the analog track, Wise credits Lehman, who won an Oscar for his 
screenplay, with finding ways of restructuring the original Howard 
Lindsay-Russel Crouse book that turned the successful stage musical into an 
overwhelming cinematic experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely in Hollywood do screenwriters (even top-flight screenwriters) get 
public credit, let alone the respect, they deserve, which makes listening to 
and reading about the screenplay's evolution so fascinating. Lehman, in fact, 
became involved in the translation of stage musical to film musical even before 
Wise, who came onto the project after director William Wyler -- who was never 
that enthusiastic about it -- bowed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman not only suggested the elimination of two songs, but also the addition 
of two others ("I Have Confidence," "Something Good") that an eager Richard 
Rodgers wrote expressly for the film, after the death of his collaborator Oscar 
Hammerstein II. The screenwriter also suggested that several songs be placed 
elsewhere in the film than they were in the stage play, contributing 
significantly to the power of the narrative line. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole thrust, my whole direction toward the film was primarily the 
screenplay itself and my knowledge of the stage show before it," Wise says. Any 
liberties taken with the story of the novice Maria and the Von Trapp family 
came about in the interest not of "telling an untruth" but of developing "a 
more effective and dramatic line." 
</P>
<P>
 The details of how that was done, including the overwhelming cinematography 
and problems on location in bitter-cold Austria, during alternating three days 
of rain and three days of sunshine, make for a wonderful laser disc, put 
together with care and attention. Laserbits 
</P>

MARTIN CAPROW; AIDS PATIENT SUED LAW FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin Caprow, a San Diego lawyer who claimed that he was illegally fired 
because he had AIDS, much like the hero of the popular film "Philadelphia," has 
died. He was 38. 
</P>
<P>
 Caprow died Wednesday in a Los Angeles hospital of the complications of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 His case earned national attention because the film starring Tom Hanks was 
playing in theaters during the trial of Caprow's lawsuit in February. Both the 
Hanks character and Caprow waged their litigation despite poor health to 
protect all gays and lesbians and AIDS victims from employment discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Caprow saw the film on the eve of the trial of his own lawsuit, and told The 
Times it "was like watching my own nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 The film's story paralleled Caprow's in many ways, but ended quite 
differently. Hanks' character won his civil case, but Caprow lost. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Superior Court Judge Vincent DeFiglia ruled March 16 that Caprow 
failed to prove he was fired in 1992 because he was HIV-positive. The law firm 
had argued that the young lawyer was let go because the firm had lost half of 
its clients in the economic downturn and needed to cut its staff of 15 lawyers 
and paralegals to seven. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles law firm later offered Caprow a job at a higher salary, but 
Caprow chose to stay in San Diego and do voluntary legal work for the local 
AIDS Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Caprow graduated from Arizona State University in 1978 and from Western State 
University College of Law in San Diego in 1988. Before attending law school, he 
worked as marketing director for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include Caprow's companion, Terry Everline; his mother, Naomi, of 
Chicago; two brothers, Julian of Los Angeles and Robert of Highlands Ranch, 
Colo., and a sister, Marla D'Avanzo of Murrieta, Calif.

ORVAL FAUBUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The passing of Orval Faubus is significant in that he had outlived his era by 
so many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Faubus was truly a pioneer who drastically altered the social structure of 
America and indeed the world, in one day in September, 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 The actions by Faubus, though scorned by the liberals of that day, were the 
actions of common sense, made by a man who understood history and the mentality 
of the people of Arkansas more so than much of the press and news media. Faubus 
averted possible deaths and a probable "civil war" in Arkansas, and the victims 
would have most surely been the nine black students -- truly pawns on a 
political chessboard! 
</P>
<P>
 Every elected official must make decisions that may not be popular to those 
who don't understand the true motivations behind them, but I'm certain that 
Orval E. Faubus will be remembered by future historians and students as a man 
who made the correct decision.

BUT WILL THE FIGHTING STOP?; CAN CARTER'S TAKEOVER OF LORD DAVID OWEN'S ROLE 
MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today begins a four-month Bosnian cease-fire brokered by former President 
Jimmy Carter. Will the cease-fire be observed? Perhaps: Some say the Bosnian 
winter imposes a natural cease-fire. But perhaps not: On Thursday Bosnian Serbs 
fired two shells into Sarajevo's Old Town, killing two and wounding seven. 
"Large pools of blood could be seen in the fresh snow," the Associated Press 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A cease-fire is, in any event, not a peace but at best only a prelude to 
peace. To what kind of peace is this prelude? 
</P>
<P>
 Official Bosnia, some say and many hint, must accept its defeat and move on to 
formal surrender. If Carter can broker a peace without surrender, the Clinton 
Administration seems to reason, good for him. If not, bad for him, perhaps, but 
better him than President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Concretely, surrender will occur if and when terms like those dictated 
Wednesday by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic replace the 
take-it-or-leave-it peace plan solemnly backed by the five-power "Contact 
Group" since last summer. Karadzic wants more and better territory. He also 
wants the right for a sovereign Bosnian Serb state to make whatever alliances 
it chooses: Greater Serbia, perhaps, but on its own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 If you surrender on these terms, the fighting will stop, the Western powers 
tell Bosnia, with Carter now playing the role once played by Lord David Owen. 
But will the fighting stop? What guarantee can Carter provide Bosnian President 
Alija Izetbegovic that the terms of the surrender will be enforced? Today 
Karadzic wants Sarajevo divided into Serb and non-Serb zones. What if, 
tomorrow, he decides to reunite the city? 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, Carter and the Atlantic powers can offer Bosnia no guarantee but 
Serb good faith. Surrender may not even bring a lifting of the arms embargo. 
Post-surrender, the major powers will not defend Bosnia, and yet they may 
continue to prevent Bosnia from defending itself. If they promise otherwise, 
who, at this point, will believe them? 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia -- on the most realistic, cold-eyed of grounds, abandoning all hope of 
victory and seeking only a guaranteed end to the fighting -- has as much reason 
to reject the surrender terms as to accept them. This is particularly the case, 
of course, since surrender does not mean merely submitting to Serb rule but 
facing death or exile by a Serb regime bent on "ethnic cleansing."  
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic, with a veiled sneer, describes his peace plan as a way for the West 
to save face. It is exactly that, and for exactly that reason Izetbegovic will 
be under intense Western pressure to accept it. If and when he does so, 
however, the Serb-Croat war will quickly resume, and the Bosnian Croats may 
desert Bosnia for affiliation with Croatia. In short, the war will spread, for, 
tragically, peace in the Balkans can no longer be purchased even at the price 
of Bosnian surrender.

FATAL FORCE ONLY AS A LAST RESORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two police shootings this week -- one in front of the White House, the other 
in Montrose -- raise a disturbing question: Whatever happened to the idea of 
shooting a suspect only as an absolute last resort? This is not an easy 
question to ask, for police officers have an exceedingly hard job in dealing 
with sometimes vicious criminals and sometimes homicidal psychotics. Yet in 
both of this week's cases, officers could have chosen not to use deadly force. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law enforcement officials in Washington defended the actions of the 
U.S. Park Police officers who fatally wounded Marcelino Corniel on Tuesday. The 
transient was shot in the abdomen and leg after he menacingly waved a knife at 
officers, then ignored an order to drop the weapon. A police spokesman called 
the shooting "just a normal police reaction to a man with a knife." 
</P>
<P>
 But was that reaction the only one possible? A pistol is standard issue for 
U.S. park police. Batons, pepper spray and Mace are not. In other parts of the 
country such non-lethal tools often have been used to subdue violent suspects. 
An investigation should determine whether they could have been of use in this 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has said little about the killing 
of Aaron Cease, a mentally troubled man who was shot 12 times after he lunged 
at officers with a broken crutch. Twelve shots to subdue a man with a broken 
crutch? 
</P>
<P>
 Officers point out they put their lives on the line daily and rightly complain 
about Monday morning quarterbacking. But since police sometimes are the 
arbiters of life and death, there clearly is a need for good training and good 
equipment and, most important, good judgment.

<P>
 The adjacent editorials of Dec. 12 seem to contradict each other. 
</P>
<P>
 In one editorial you criticize the incoming Republican Congress for advocating 
a 60% majority in order to raise taxes and in the other you want to retain the 
U.S. Geological Survey Program even though it will cost a mere $3.2 billion 
dollars over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the great majority always want to save their pet programs and can give 
hundreds of reasons why they are so beneficial, it is the main reason we have 
such outrageous deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly why the new Republicans want to make it more difficult to raise 
taxes.

HATE GROUPS IN CYBERSPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was dismayed, though not shocked, to learn that the Simon Wiesenthal Center 
called on Prodigy and other on-line services to censor the content of their 
users' bulletin board posts because of alleged incidents of hate speech 
("Bigots' Growing use of Computer Networks Assailed," Dec. 14). Though the 
views of organizations like the National Alliance and the American Renaissance 
are abhorrent, the Simon Wiesenthal Center should counter their efforts with 
bulletin board posts of its own, not blatant attempts to quash free speech.  
</P>
<P>
 Cyberspace should be open to all views. The Simon Wiesenthal Center's attempt 
to destroy freedom in cyberspace should not be applauded, it should be 
resisted. 
</P>
<P>
 KENNETH D. DeGIORGIO 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) shares the concerns of many computer users 
over the exploitation of this technology by groups and individuals promoting 
racism, anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial and other extremist views. The proper 
approach to this complex problem, however, is not as simple as asking the 
federal government to place a traffic cop on the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 Considerations of how to combat computerized hate must take into account 
competing concerns over the protection of free speech and over the spread of 
hateful messages, particularly to young people. Some on-line services have 
sought to promote wide-ranging discussion while fostering, through 
implementation of guidelines for members' behavior, an environment in which 
parents can feel comfortable allowing their children to learn and explore in 
cyberspace. Where such guidelines exist, it is appropriate to urge 
administrators of those systems to ensure that they are followed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to using commercial services, bigots have surfaced on the 
Internet, an unregulated global web of computer networks. They have created 
their own separate computer bulletin boards, which ADL first exposed in our 
report, "Computerized Networks of Hate," in 1985. Experience has taught us 
that, over the long term, exposing the extremists' agenda and educating as to 
the harm it can cause are, jointly, the most effective response. When 
confronted with the views of a bigot or an extremist, computer users should 
seek out assistance that will help them to blunt the messages of hate, from 
agencies such as the ADL.

 Citing the Institute for Historical Review in an article about "hate groups" 
is outrageous. The suggestion that historical revisionism and the IHR are 
motivated by hate is a cheap smear. We are proud of the backing we have earned 
from people of the most diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, including 
Jewish. In fact, Jewish supporters of the IHR have recently come under 
particularly intense criticism, and even physical violence, for their dissident 
views about the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its founding in 1978, the IHR has steadfastly opposed bigotry of all 
kinds in its efforts to promote greater public understanding of key chapters of 
history. Contributors to our journal have included respected scholars.

ASSEMBLY IMPASSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his commentary on the state Assembly speakership stalemate (Dec. 14), UCLA 
law Prof. Daniel Lowenstein asks, "Who is to blame?" The normative judgment 
expressed throughout is that Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga) should have been 
voted Speaker. Why? Because mathematically, there are now more Republicans than 
Democrats in the Assembly. So when Paul Horcher (R-Diamond Bar) bolts from GOP 
ranks and votes for Willie Brown, everything gets murky and cries of 
irresponsibility and unethical behavior ensue. Gone is the tidy little 
rubber-stamp formula where the elephants pick elephants and donkeys pick 
donkeys. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the problems. Only the most naive among us really believe either 
Democrats or Republicans can be held accountable via partisan lines. Whether it 
is matters of policy or procedure, members of both parties switch sides in 
order to leverage some position or broker some appointment. There are some 
tendencies and patterns, but essentially almost everything can be haggled over. 
</P>
<P>
 The good professor also implies that the last election was about replacing 
Willie Brown as the Speaker. Funny, but I didn't recall seeing that issue on my 
ballot sheet, and I'm quite sure no one in Diamond Bar did either. The Assembly 
will organize its own. That is part and parcel of what you get with 
representative democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Speaker of the Assembly is really about, indeed politics itself, is 
power. Willie Brown. Almost enough said right there. Love or admire him, all 
will agree he is a personal embodiment of power. Arguably, Brown has been the 
most powerful person in the state for the last 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe we should focus a bit on Brulte. Does he possess the influence, skill, 
and leadership to become the Speaker? Can he persuade enough members that he 
does to win the post? Willie Brown persuaded all the Democrats to vote for him. 
Did Brown persuade Horcher, maybe cut him a deal? Or did the GOP and Brulte 
fail to? Whatever the answer, it is a matter of people, persuasion and power, 
not a "concern nowadays about . . . government accountability." 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln once said the "politicians are the lifeblood of our democracy." He was 
right and the latest developments in Sacramento confirm this more than ever.

 Re "Legislative Games Shortchange Voters," Commentary, Dec. 14: 
</P>
<P>
 By stating that Paul Horcher betrayed the voters of his district, Daniel 
Lowenstein implies that elected officials must march "lock-step" with the most 
conservative or most liberal factions of their party, even when they disagree 
with them. Sixty-one percent of the voters in the 60th Assembly District voted 
to return Horcher to Sacramento, presumably based on his past representation of 
their interest. Nowhere on the ballot was a statement that dictated how Horcher 
was to vote on each issue before the Legislature, including the speakership. 
</P>
<P>
 These voters have a right to expect Horcher to use his best judgment to fight 
for what he believes will benefit his district. In this case, based on past 
experience, Horcher believes that going against his party's right-wing 
leadership is in the best interest of his constituents. He might be wrong. He 
might be right. But his decision is neither irresponsible nor unethical, as 
Lowenstein calls it.  
</P>
<P>
 Horcher may lose in a recall effort. However, unlike regular elections, 
recalls are not indicative of the voters exercising their voting rights. 
Recalls are the manipulation of regular voters by wealthy, outside special 
interests whose only stake in democracy is to undermine it. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the National Rifle Assn. financed the failed effort to 
recall David Roberti. And now, the Rev. Louis Sheldon, head of the Traditional 
Values Coalition, an ultra-conservative organization based in Anaheim (not part 
of the 60th District), says his group will finance the recall effort against 
Horcher.

 Let me get this straight, Prof. Lowenstein. Richard Mountjoy (R-Arcadia) 
submits two declarations under oath, one that he intends to serve in the 
Assembly if elected and one that he intends to serve in the Senate if elected. 
Inasmuch as one declaration or the other must be false, Mountjoy is morally, if 
not legally, guilty of perjury. On the other hand, you describe Horcher's 
conduct as "legal but irresponsible." Your ultimate conclusion: Horcher (whose 
conduct is legal) is much more culpable than Mountjoy (a person who submits a 
false declaration under oath).

PERSPECTIVE ON POLITICS; THE DEMOCRATS' TROUBLED SALES JOB; THEY CAN'T WIN THE 
WHITE HOUSE AS GOP-MODERATE CLONES; MAYBE A PURE LIBERAL STANCE ISWORTH TRYING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS K. BAKER, Ross K. Baker is a professor of political science at Rutgers 
University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine taking on the job of Middle East sales rep for Virginia ham, or 
exporting tea to Brazil. How about managing a skateboard store in a retirement 
community? This gives you an inkling of the thoughts that have been haunting 
Democratic strategists: Maybe we're in the wrong business.  
</P>
<P>
 Scanning the presidential elections since World War II for evidence of 
convincing Democratic victories -- popular-vote totals that we denominate as 
mandates -- we find that only once did the winner go much above 50%. That was 
in 1964, when Lyndon Johnson, the successor of the martyred John Kennedy, 
trounced the ultraconservative Barry Goldwater by 23 points. During the same 
postwar period, however, Republicans won smashingly in five of their seven 
victories. Only Richard Nixon finished with less than 50%, and that was in the 
three-way race with Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace in 1968. Bill Clinton's 
43% in 1992 was the lowest of all. 
</P>
<P>
 In their effort to reclaim their market share of the electorate, some 
Democratic groups -- most notably the Democratic Leadership Council -- have 
argued, quite plausibly, that only a move to the political center will save 
Clinton's presidency and, indeed, the party itself. They argue that a 
forthrightly liberal Democratic Party would be nothing more than a stunted, 
isolated leftist sect -- a stark denial of the fact that the country seems 
headed resolutely in a rightward direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest support for a centrocentric Democratic Party comes from its last 
two presidential victories, in 1976 and 1992. The moderate appeal of Jimmy 
Carter and Bill Clinton, it is argued, enabled them to win. But another way to 
look at those two victories is that Carter and Clinton would have won no matter 
where they were situated ideologically (barring, of course, flagrant 
extremism). Anger with Watergate and the pardon of Nixon would have propelled 
any of the 1976 Democratic primary hopefuls into the White House. Likewise, the 
readiness of the public to trade in recession-weary George Bush in 1992 could 
have benefited anyone from Paul Tsongas to Tom Harkin had they been more 
successful than Clinton in the primaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Difficult as it may be for Democrats to accept, they tend to win the White 
House when Republicans get into trouble. The Democratic Party is America's 
standby equipment. It is the relief pitcher, the national escape clause, the 
voice when we dial 911. While the Democrats until this year had been able to 
dominate congressional elections, the presidency with its high moral symbolism 
and patriarchal majesty has been Republican real estate in normal times. 
</P>
<P>
 And what did the last two Democratic beneficiaries of voter rejection of 
Republicans do? They picked up the precepts of the men they had just defeated. 
Carter plunged ahead with the deregulation agenda set by Gerald Ford and 
Clinton went all out for NAFTA and GATT, which may have been good public policy 
but Republican policy all the same. For his troubles, Carter got what 
Democratic presidents can expect when they govern like Republicans: a challenge 
from the party's left. Clinton courts the same fate if his definition of New 
Democrat varies in no substantial measure from garden-variety Republican. (As 
for a challenge from the Democratic right, that is ludicrous. Who would mount 
it, Sen. Howell Heflin?) 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing that has any political significance for the Democratic Party is 
its liberal wing -- the unions, the poor, the minorities, the old men who got 
their first paycheck from the New Deal, the middle-aged women in Birkenstocks, 
the bald guys with pony tails fixing up old VW buses in Berkeley and, at least 
potentially, a whole lot of new voters turned off by the GOP's puritanical 
tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Democrats, finding, much less capturing, the elusive political center 
is a task more metaphysical than political, more the stuff of necromancers than 
pollsters. When Republican presidents blow it and Democrats have a chance to 
govern, the last thing in the world they should contemplate is taking the 
stance that the voters have just repudiated. They should use these 
opportunities to demonstrate the virtues of liberalism, not repent of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Political survival alone dictates that the standby equipment be made of 
different stuff than the gear that has broken down. Democratic presidents who 
are forthrightly liberal, however, are far more able to conciliate those 
elements in the party who can be counted on to cause the most sleepless nights: 
a sullen and rebellious left.

SOME NEVER MADE IT HOME FOR CHRISTMAS; KOREAN WAR: THEIR WINTERS WERE JUST AS 
COLD, THEIR FIGHTING JUST AS ARDUOUS AS ANY WAR'S, BUT THEY WERE THE FORGOTTEN 
SOLDIERS.

Korean War veteran.

<P>
 We sleep in Arlington, forgotten soldiers who died in a forgotten war.  
</P>
<P>
 It was cold in Korea that Thanksgiving of 1950 and the GI's joked as the hot 
turkey drumsticks turned into Popsicles before they could be eaten. Still, it 
was a traditional Thanksgiving meal, and we had been promised that we would be 
home for Christmas. The turkey dinner made the barren Korean hills seem a 
little less desolate and perhaps a little more like Iowa and Kentucky or 
wherever there were families at holiday time. 
</P>
<P>
 We moved out for the North, proud warriors who, in just five months, had saved 
South Korea from communist attack, pushed back the North Korean army and made 
an "end run" landing at Inchon. We had gone into combat as civilians hurriedly 
pushed through training, reservists who were converted from weekend warriors to 
the real thing. Now we were combat veterans. We were the first to confront the 
communists with arms; the first to fight under the pale blue U.N. flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Douglas MacArthur ordered the final drive north of the 38th Parallel in 
spite of misgivings in Washington. He promised his troops that this drive would 
end the Korean War and that we would be "home for Christmas," a battle cry not 
quite as dramatic as "I shall return" but still, good for a headline. But what 
MacArthur didn't tell us was that his own intelligence reports were describing 
a massive buildup of the Chinese People's Army just beyond the Yalu River and 
that advance units had already crossed into Korean territory. The GI's were 
marching into a trap and the high command knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the Chinese attacked in force. Bugle-blowing infantry charged in 
waves, overrunning U.N. positions all along the front lines. At Chosin 
Reservoir, 15,000 of us, 1st Marines along with British and Korean units, were 
entirely cut off and outnumbered. Lt. Gen. Ned Almond, 10th Corps commander, 
flew in from Tokyo and conferred with Maj. Gen. Oliver Smith, the 1st Marine 
commander. Almond advised Smith to destroy his artillery, burn his supplies and 
order us to flee on foot, every man for himself. Stunned, the Marine commander 
refused and made plans to fight our way out of the trap. He told news 
correspondents that he was not going to retreat, that he was merely going to 
"attack in another direction." 
</P>
<P>
 We moved south in bitter cold made deadly by a fierce Siberian wind. Under 
constant attack, we began to take heavy casualties. Of the 15,000 troops who 
fought at bloody Chosin, 12,000 were wounded or dead before we reached U.S. 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 We fought south to Hagaru, then Chinhung-ni, where we linked up with an 
advance relief column. Then we moved on to Hungnam, where the cruiser Rochester 
and a squadron of destroyers covered the evacuation with a ring of fire. The 
pitiful village of shacks was destroyed by salvos from the naval guns. The 
ships ghosted out of the black harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 The war dragged on for three more years while we died at Kansong and Porkchop 
Hill and in dozens of other engagements. MacArthur was fired by President 
Truman, but returned to the United States to receive a hero's welcome. All the 
while, the coffins were arriving in Riverside, the Punch Bowl and Arlington. 
Some of us were buried not far from where we fell: the U.N. cemetery in Pusan. 
There were no parades, but there was an honor guard and a bugler and the 
presentation of a folded American flag. 
</P>
<P>
 We sleep in Arlington, brave warriors who died in a long-ago war. On the grass 
next to the Lincoln Memorial, across the Potomac in Washington, a monument is 
finally rising. After four decades, America is remembering us -- 30,000 brave 
young men who never made it "home for Christmas."

LOT OFFERS FREE TREES TO PEOPLE IN NEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Two recent stories regarding Christmas tree sales in the Valley highlighted 
Cicero Farms, but there are other Christmas tree entrepreneurs in the Valley, 
including some which are nonprofit organizations with philanthropic motives. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the oldest is the Reseda Y's Men's Club, which has sold Yule trees 
since 1950 at the same location.With a name often confused with the biblical 
Wise Men, the club and its co-ed members are dedicated to the support of the 
West Valley Family YMCA (also nonprofit) and operate quietly, without fanfare, 
like the fabled shoemaker elves. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's property and tree lot are next to the YMCA in Reseda, just east of 
Wilbur Avenue and the West Valley Police Station. Tree lot labor is over 90% 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, just as a year ago, the tree lot will be left open at 4 p.m., Saturday, 
Christmas Eve, to those less-fortunate members of the community who could not 
afford to buy a tree for their family, to pick up a free tree from any unsold 
tree stock at the site.

TO BOLSTER CALIFORNIA'S RECOVERY, LOWER THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX BURDEN; 
ECONOMY: THE CORPORATE BITE IS 60% ABOVE THE NATIONAL NORM AND THE WEST'S 
HIGHEST, WHILE COMPETITOR STATES ARE BOOMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNELISE ANDERSON, Annelise Anderson is a senior research fellow at the 
Hoover Institution and a member of the Governor's Task Force on California Tax 
Reform and Reduction. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's economic recovery is well under way. But a major source of 
California's growth in the 1980s -- the revolution in computers and 
communications -- has made businesses across the country footloose: The new 
plant need not be near the old one; the plants need not be located near the 
corporate headquarters. States are competing more and more to attract new 
enterprises and keep the pieces of the ones they have. 
</P>
<P>
 In this environment, California's high taxes put it at a disadvantage. The tax 
on corporations, at 9.3%, is the same as Arizona's, but higher than that of New 
Mexico (7.6%), Oregon (6.6%) and Utah (5%). The state of Washington? Zero. 
Nevada? Zip. Texas? The same. 
</P>
<P>
 In corporate tax dollars collected per $100 of personal income (the relative 
measure that's usually used), California is fifth in the nation, first among 
its Western competition and more than 60% above the 50-state average. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition is tough on the personal income-tax score. Washington and 
Nevada have no tax on personal income (neither does Texas). California imposes 
a tax of up to 11% on personal incomes, the highest marginal rate (although 
scheduled to decline to 9.3% Jan. 1, 1996) of any state except Massachusetts 
and Montana. In dollars collected per $100 of personal income, California was 
15th in the nation in 1993 -- 27% above the 50-state average. The overall tax 
burden per household in California is 19% above the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when economists found no relationship between state taxes and 
economic growth. State and local taxes were low enough to be swamped by other 
important influences -- labor availability, infrastructure and so forth. But 
the state and local tax burdens have risen steadily and are increasingly 
becoming a significant cost to business, either as a tax on profits or through 
their influence on the cost of labor. 
</P>
<P>
 More recent studies show that states that have cut their tax burdens have 
stronger economic growth than those that have increased them. The changes in 
tax burden seem to signal a favorable or a hostile environment, what the 
executives making locational decisions call the "tax climate." And the tax 
climate ranks second only to labor availability and labor costs (which are 
themselves affected by taxes) in determining location. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger for California is the possibility that the recent economic upturn 
is merely a cyclical upswing, not a strengthening of the basic economic 
structure. The communications revolution has made it easier for the structure 
of an economy to change -- easier for new enterprises and new jobs to move in, 
but also easier for them to move out. Thus the decline in the national defense 
budget is not fatal for California; with appropriate policies, California, with 
all its other advantages, can attract new businesses. In the same way, it can 
lose more than its defense industries. 
</P>
<P>
 In the year ending this past September, California ranked 49th among the 
states in growth in non-farm employment, actually losing jobs while its Western 
competition added them. Non-farm employment increased 6.7% in Utah, 6% in 
Nevada. New Mexico was up 5.2%, Arizona 4.4% and Oregon and Texas 3.1% 
</P>
<P>
 All of these states have tax burdens less than California's. If California is 
to compete effectively, it must lower its tax rates significantly.

HEARTFELT ADVICE ON 'KILLER DOGS'

 As a kid growing up in Iowa in the early '30s, I had firsthand knowledge about 
this revolting situation.Our small dairy farm was located on the edge of a 
small town of 4,000 souls, and dog packs would form in town and my dog would 
join them as they went by our house on their way to sheep farms north of us. We 
would have absolutely no idea that our sweet lovable dog would join in a 
vicious group of canines bent on killing animals. It would be an unbelievable 
shock to us when a farmer would tell us that he had seen our pet in the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 I lost several dogs to the shotgun when my dad received the distressing 
information. Never did any of our dogs show any sign of being a killer, but I 
guess when they joined the pack their instincts took over. 
</P>
<P>
 My suggestion to Rosamond is to concentrate on enforcing the leash law and 
plead with the residents to lock up their dogs at night, as dog packs never 
form during the daylight hours.

WHO BENEFITS FROM BURBANK AIRPORT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reader Bunnie Strassner's complaint (Letters, Dec. 11) that Burbank, Glendale 
and Pasadena receive "revenues" from the Burbank Airport is dead wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Laws governing every airport in the country mandate that airport revenues can 
be used only for airport-related costs.Owners, whether they be cities, counties 
or states, get no direct dollars from airport operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who benefit from airports are the people who use them. In Burbank's 
case, that'll be nearly 5 million passengers this year, around two-thirds of 
whom live in the city of Los Angeles or who are visiting that city. Shutting 
down or scaling back the airport, as Ms. Strassner proposes, would do serious 
economic harm to the eastern San Fernando Valley she purports to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the new terminal building, that's needed mainly for safety and for 
future passenger convenience, not primarily to handle more flights. By my 
calculation, the 14 active gates now in place could handle several hundred 
flights at half-hour intervals during each of Burbank's 16-hour operating days. 
The airport this year will average around 77 commercial jet flights each day, 
and the best estimate for the year 2010 is around 150. 
</P>
<P>
 What are inadequate now, and must be improved, are the passenger facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 If reader Strassner knows of some better location for a replacement for the 
Burbank Airport, one that will bring noise to no one yet be quickly accessible 
to several million travelers, I'd sure like to know about it.

PUTTING COUNCIL VOTES TO THE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your "On the Issues" question of Oct. 28 was, "Should the public be allowed to 
sue City Council members because of the votes they cast?" 
</P>
<P>
 I believe the answer is a wholehearted "yes!" -- especially if and when these 
votes are tainted, politically motivated, unfair, predetermined and in 
violation of public policy and the law. No one -- not even politicians -- 
should be held to be above the law.

BERNSON STANDS UP TO CRA 'BUREAUCRACY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congratulations to City Councilman Hall Bernson for standing up to an 
intractable bureaucracy, the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 After many meetings, lots of input, approval by community leaders in the 
hardest-hit area of the city by the earthquake, a proposal to meet the needs of 
the Northridge, Granada Hills and Chatsworth areas was submitted.Included were 
safeguards so that a Downtown Los Angeles agency could not, once again, use its 
economic power for sociological and economic experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the CRA was more interested in power than in responding to the 
needs of the 12th Council District in the San Fernando Valley. Happily, 
Councilman Bernson understands what happens when the CRA takes over an area 
without limitations. Finally, he said no to the CRA power grab, to protect the 
jobs and residents of his district. This took courage. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is time to rein in the power of the CRA and change state laws so that 
local communities can control their own destinies. That was the message of the 
election on Nov. 8. It is too bad the CRA did not hear it.

MORE PROPERTY TAXES ARE NOT THE ANSWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the enactment of Proposition 13, opponents have found a variety of ways 
to circumvent the will of the voters. The new method of increasing taxes is 
through assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 Assessments are in addition to your property tax, which is limited by 
Proposition 13. There are at least 19 different types of assessment districts. 
What is common to most is that those who pay do not always have the opportunity 
to vote on the assessment or to register a meaningful protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Assessments were once for capital improvements (such as sidewalks), which are 
a direct benefit to a particular parcel of property. However, assessments now 
have come to mean that property owners pay for services that do not directly 
benefit their property. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of assessments today are nothing more than thinly disguised property 
taxes. Taxpayers generally first learn they have been "assessed" when they see 
it on their property tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no wonder that the government spenders prefer assessment districts. Once 
an assessment district is in place, the money "assessed" frees up revenue that 
is frequently used by local officials for their pet projects. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 30, the County Board of Supervisors voted 3-2 to set up a "community 
facilities benefit assessment district." This will impose a $28.50 fee on all 
property owners in both unincorporated areas and cities that join the 
assessment district. This may not sound like a lot of money, but when it is 
added to others, it can add up to hundreds of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing to stop the future creation of unlimited new and overlapping 
assessment districts. Any present or future local agency can tag property 
owners with additional assessments. During the 1991-1992 year, California had 
nearly 5,000 assessment districts. Look at your property tax bill. You probably 
have five or six special "assessments" tacked on to it. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill recently passed both houses of the Legislature and is on the governor's 
desk that would allow any city or county to set up a benefit assessment 
district with majority voter approval. This contradicts the two-thirds vote 
requirement mandated by Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Our county is strapped for funds because the state transferred billions of 
dollars from the counties to Sacramento; taxes have increased on business so 
tax revenue has decreased in our community, and taxpayers are leaving the state 
in droves while welfare recipients increase. More taxes are not the answer. The 
answer is in ending this fiscal lunacy.

Minnesota last year. "But I've prepared every week like I'm going to play.And

 The Vikings (9-6) can win the NFC Central title by beating San Francisco

 Greyhound Gets Enough Bondholders to Complete Swap: With the threat of a 
second bankruptcy reorganization behind it, the Dallas-based bus line is 
looking to bill itself as a cut-rate alternative to the cheapest airlines.Just 
more than 90% of Greyhound Lines Inc.'s bondholders agreed to swap their debt 
for stock in the company. Greyhound had said that if 90% of the investors 
didn't go along, it would take the reorganization effort to Bankruptcy Court. 
The out-of-court restructuring is key to the company's efforts to reduce 
expenses so it can deal with lower ridership and reverse losses. Greyhound also 
said it will give shareholders more time to take advantage of rights to acquire 
more stock in the company.

AROUND TOWN: REALITY SOLIDLY BASED IN FANTASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 " 'We're going through!' The commander's voice was like thin ice breaking . . 
. the crew, bending to their various tasks in the huge, hurtling eight-engined 
Navy hydroplane, looked at each other and grinned, 'The old man'll get us 
through . . . The old man ain't afraid of hell . . . . ' "  
</P>
<P>
 " 'Not so fast! You're driving too fast!' said Mrs. Mitty. 'You know I don't 
like to go more than 40. ' . . . Walter Mitty drove on toward Waterbury in 
silence, the roaring of the SN202 through the worst storm in 20 years of Navy 
flying fading in the remote, intimate airways of his mind."  
</P>
<P>
 -- JAMES THURBER 
</P>
<P>
 "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" 
</P>
<P>
 In each of us, John Alexander knows, there dwells a Walter Mitty. An 
accountant who fantasizes about being a jet pilot, a duffer who dreams of 
teeing off with Arnold Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it was that a decade ago he created Dreams Come True, an L. A.-based 
fantasy factory that brings smiles to the faces of even the done-that, 
seen-that, had-that set. 
</P>
<P>
 He has arranged a jazz club gig for tone-deaf twins (they blew on muted 
instruments while the real musicians played behind a curtain) and has sent two 
people to Egypt for a sleep-over in the king's chamber of the Great Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 You name it, Alexander will try to do it "if it's fun, legal, doesn't require 
an act of God or a date with a celebrity." 
</P>
<P>
 He adds, don't bother to ring up if you're "really crazy." You'll be 
transferred promptly to the miracle department, which doesn't exist, on the 
ninth floor, which doesn't either. 
</P>
<P>
 But if a golfer on your Yule list yearns to play in the prestigious pro-am 
tournament at Pebble Beach in February, that can be arranged, "for the first 
person whose check clears." That check should be for $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And, the recipient must have at least an 18 handicap. If the price seems a bit 
steep, Alexander reasons, "It's the equivalent of being the quarterback on an 
NFL team in an NFL game, a one-and-only chance to be one of the big boys 
without being a big boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a New Ager on your list? There's still time to pick up one of those 
pyramid slumber parties. The tab: $20,000 (air fare extra). Both Napoleon and 
Alexander the Great are said to have done it -- and had life-changing 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 For a slightly slimmer budget, Alexander suggests 90 minutes as co-pilot of a 
fighter jet, "the complete 'Top Gun' thrill" for any armchair pilot -- loops, 
spins and all -- for just under $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander, who has a master's in marketing and "the sort of mind that works to 
embellish the obvious," hit upon his idea about 14 years ago, fed up with 
last-minute Christmas shopping frenzies for his family in Pennsylvania and with 
the "wrong size, wrong color, throw it in the back of the closet" syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked himself, "Why not give people what they really want?" So he took 
everyone by stretch limo to dinner and the Ice Follies, for which he'd bought 
front-row seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Los Angeles, his first big hit was his chef-for-a-day package, wherein 
dedicated foodies stirred soup alongside Wolfgang Puck at Spago. 
</P>
<P>
 For a carpenter, he arranged an insider's tour of Howard Hughes' wooden flying 
ship, the Spruce Goose, with a member of the team that built her. And he sent a 
client around the world by private jet to ride all the great roller coasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the latter, Alexander says, "I'd rather eat glass or set my hair on fire." 
</P>
<P>
 For big band fan Frank Freed's 65th birthday, his wife, Evelyn, made his dream 
come true with a bash in the arboretum of the Crystal Cathedral, with a big 
band and a line of dancing girls, Rockettes-style. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 80th birthday of Evelyn Freed's mother, Naomi Wilden, Alexander 
provided the entertainers for an English tea on the tented tennis court of the 
Freeds' Santa Ana home. Among them: a cowboy to sing "Red River Valley," a song 
Wilden's late husband used to croon to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Guest look-alikes included Marlene Dietrich, Fred Astaire and Elvis. Said 
Freed, "I wouldn't have picked Elvis for my mother, but this young man was 
wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Franz Birkner of Encinitas, a telecommunications executive and amateur pilot, 
had "always dreamed of flying a jet fighter plane." So last May, for a 
decade-marking birthday, girlfriend Portia LaTouche made his dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
 For 75 minutes, he "ripped up the skies north of Van Nuys" as co-pilot of a 
Yugoslavian-built Soko. "A whale of a lot of fun," said Birkner of his 
adventure, which included high-flying acrobatics and "strafing of unsuspecting 
farmhouses and cows." 
</P>
<P>
 How does Alexander make dreams come true? Are there People in High Places with 
palms to be greased? His answer is one he once heard from a magician: 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you keep a secret? So can I." 
</P>
<P>
 He adds, "If people knew how I do what I do, they wouldn't need me." But, he 
acknowledges, "there's always a price to be paid" to access the inaccessible. 
</P>
<P>
 Even he is occasionally frustrated. He's been unable to arrange for one 
couple's fantasy, dinner in a formal European garden with Luciano Pavarotti. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows, "It's easy for a dream to turn into a nightmare." Once, a charter 
helicopter was to deposit a couple Downtown for an anniversary dinner. The 
copter never showed up. "Those people went ballistic. They're going to carry my 
name to their grave." 
</P>
<P>
 At 40, Alexander is still dreaming. "My absolute fantasy is an 
around-the-world trip on a private jet," with gator-watching on the Amazon, 
breakfast in bed at Mad King Ludwig's castle, Neuschwanstein, and "turning the 
pages for a famous pianist" at the Tchaikovsky competition in Moscow. Hot Tea 
Time With Wedgwood 
</P>
<P>
 Lord Piers Wedgwood flings a fine Wedgwood saucer onto the carpet to watch it 
bounce. Not a chip. But, he cautions, "I wouldn't advise doing that on a stone 
floor." 
</P>
<P>
 We are taking tea at Geary's in Beverly Hills, where his lordship -- a direct 
descendant of Sir Josiah Wedgwood, the father of English potters -- is signing 
Wedgwood Christmas gifts while fielding queries such as whether the china is 
earthquake-proof (alas, no). 
</P>
<P>
 His lordship is the genial, rather portly fellow in the pin-striped suit and 
teddy-bear necktie, serving up Wedgwood tea in Wedgwood cups and sharing his 
tea tips: 
</P>
<P>
 Never reboil the water, lest you get "a sort of soapy-looking tea." Always 
warm the pot, to avoid china crazing. Don't skimp on those leaves -- "one 
teaspoon for everybody, and one for the pot."  
</P>
<P>
 But Lord Wedgwood, 40, hasn't journeyed here from London just to talk tea. 
He's an international ambassador for Waterford-Wedgwood. About one-fourth of 
Wedgwood sales are in the United States and "we've been struggling through the 
recession." 
</P>
<P>
 There is Wedgwood, the familiar blue-and-white stoneware, and there is 
Wedgwood bone china, which has graced tables from Buckingham Palace to the 
White House (Teddy Roosevelt commissioned Black Colonnade with a gold 
presidential seal).

 Lord Wedgwood, the only family member now in the business, is a staunch 
conservative and a member of the House of Lords, having inherited his title and 
his seat, from great-grandfather Josiah. "I try to get back at the critical

<P>
 As Wedgwood spokesman, he's known the anger of collectors of discontinued

</P>
<P>
 He can talk patterns: Prince Charles has "Wild Strawberry." "Napoleon Ivy?" 
"We supposedly sent it off to St. Helena when he was exiled." And, he'll tell 
you, all of them can go in the dishwasher, but for the china's sake, no lemon 
in the detergent, please.

BEHIND THE WHEEL: IT'S PURE ITALIAN GLORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home building can be a quick ticket to riches if the competition is producing 
nothing cozier than Hearst Castle or friendlier than Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Such appears to be the happy future for Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
 For the only nocturnal fantasies opposing the pace, price and chest-thumping 
vanity of Ferrari's new 456GT coupe are Lamborghini's fearsome Diablo and the 
brazen Bugatti EB110. 
</P>
<P>
 All play at or beyond 200 m.p.h. Each is an instant collectible with a 
six-figure sticker. These are racers in street clothing and the most 
prestigious of production super-cars. 
</P>
<P>
 But driving a Diablo is a neck-cricking, back-aching, ear-shattering exercise 
in self-flagellation. It is difficult to reverse the car without a papal 
blessing and two fender-walkers. Any journey exceeding 30 minutes should be 
considered a human rights violation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bugatti offers only tiny seats for the vertically challenged, maybe 
retired jockeys with $350,000 to invest in an exotic that has no connection to 
a storied past beyond recent purchase of the name. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this 456GT -- the first all-new Ferrari since Enzo himself went out of 
production -- is a pure Italian glory. For lyricism and classical substance it 
should be set alongside Pavarotti and Buitoni pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 The machine also represents another attempt at a brave change of direction for 
Ferrari: a move from slightly primitive, maschio two-seaters to a softer, 
larger touring car that can be driven without wrestling harsh mechanicals and 
ducking spray from its flared nostrils. 
</P>
<P>
 The dark side is that this Ferrari may not earn deafening praise from purists, 
whose enthusiasm has been known to include prancing stallions on red pajamas. 
</P>
<P>
 The 456GT, for heaven's sake, comes with such delicate touches as 
speed-sensitive power steering and anti-lock brakes. The suspension is 
adjustable from inside the car -- sport, intermediate and touring settings -- 
and none will threaten cheap bridgework. There are two air bags. It is possible 
to shift gears without looking down. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the big aluminum knob and chrome shift gate still represent too much 
manual labor, the 456GT can be ordered with automatic transmission. That 
rumbling and groaning you hear is not from Vesuvius, but from whichever end of 
eternity is now home to Enzo Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
 The 456GT is a 2+2 coupe, which means two occasional seats behind driver and 
co-pilot. They are shaped well, but smaller than adult requirements. La dolce 
vita is likely to disappear on long trips from Venice to Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrari, of course, hasn't had too much luck with its larger four-seaters, in 
particular the V-8 Dino of the '70s and the V-8 Mondiale of the '80s. The 
biggest problem was an engine mounted amidships. It upset balance while 
overheating the lower portions of rear seat passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "So one importance of the 456GT is being a four-place car with the engine 
mounted in the front," says Gian Luigi Buitoni, president and CEO of Ferrari 
North America. "Also, the car represents Ferrari's return to the tradition of a 
V-12 engine, which we haven't done since Daytona in the '70s." 
</P>
<P>
 The car also is part of a post-recession, post-Enzo re-engineering of Ferrari 
with deliberate expansion of the lineup to offer different cars to a broader 
buyer base. 
</P>
<P>
 So is this why the 456GT comes in grays, greens, blues and silvers and will be 
sold with automatic transmission in apparent defiance of the scarlet and manual 
traditions of Ferrari? 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely," says Buitoni. 
</P>
<P>
 Buitoni was in Northern California recently presiding at the morning opening 
of Ferrari of San Francisco in Mill Valley. He took the rest of the day off to 
play with close friends, potential customers and a pearl-gray prototype 456GT 
at nearby Sears Point Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 The car is softer, rounder, and at rest appears to be at absolute peace. There 
are cooling ducts on the hood and sides to suck hot air from the engine and 
front brakes -- but no sharp vanes suggestive of Testarossa testosterone. 
Shoulders are wide, the stance low -- but major curved surfaces show character 
lines put there by sculptor Pininfarina to set the gran tourismo look of long 
distances covered in a great hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 Glances in passing will not immediately identify the 456GT as a Ferrari. In 
its rounded bustle and sloping hood there appear hints of another 2+2: 
Porsche's 928GT. 
</P>
<P>
 Longer looks, however, will notice its touch of menace, the egg-crate grille, 
four exhaust pipes peeking from the rear skirt, the double clusters of rear 
lights and black prancing horses in yellow badges on hubs and hood that belong 
to no other legend than Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Ferrari tradition is prices guaranteed to produce gasps. At $207,000 
the 456GT might create seizures. Possibly the only way to rationalize it is by 
knowing that only four dozen 456GTs a year will be shipped to this country and 
exclusivity never comes cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, you could buy a dozen Jeep Wranglers for the same price. Or a 
condo in Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The car has a two-word interior. Simple. Elegant. 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand . . . it's as though nothing has changed since the '40s and the 
first Ferraris. 
</P>
<P>
 Two large analog dials sit dead ahead, tachometer and speedometer to deliver 
instant information on road speed and engine efficiency, which become cardinal 
when touring grandly. Secondary gauges -- fuel, clock, oil pressure, water and 
oil temperatures -- are centrally mounted, in a line, with vital signs 
constantly feeding a driver's right eyeball. 
</P>
<P>
 The overview is an interior that is clean and ageless and will never tire its 
viewer. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand . . . with automatic air conditioning and remote releases 
for fuel and trunk, these insides are as modern as tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Seats, front and back, are upholstered in Connolly leather. For the first time 
in Ferrari history, a sound system comes with the car. The trunk contains a 
five-piece matching set of pigskin luggage, embossed with the car's model 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 And if this sounds just too cuddly and suburban for Ferrari, key the ignition, 
blip the throttle and shiver to the old opera that is a 12-cylinder exhaust 
ripping from alto to soprano. 
</P>
<P>
 Dual personalities are at work here. 
</P>
<P>
 On U.S. 101, moving smartly from Mill Valley to Sears Point, throwing down no 
gantlet to accompanying traffic, the 456GT purrs and prowls. There is no 
tugging, so familiar to Ferraris, when leaving one gear for the next. The power 
assist allows steering by hand and wrist, not both shoulders and body weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, you shift down. Then roll in just enough right foot to make 
needles leap and the engine note change from growl to bark. Just to make sure 
the V-12 isn't taking a nap. 
</P>
<P>
 On its softer side, if it weren't for the slight tautness of ride, if not for 
the car's sense of untapped might, this could be a Lexus SC400. 
</P>
<P>
 Nah. The 456GT is a devil in waiting, eager for the mild treachery that is any 
length or turn of Sears Point with its adverse cambers and decreasing radii. 
</P>
<P>
 The car is not designed for this kind of thrashing. But it's a Ferrari. Pur 
sang prevails. It's in suspension geometry, nicely weighted steering, a tubular 
steel chassis and aluminum body panels, a 456-horsepower V-12 spinning six 
forward gears, and an underside flap that changes pitch to reduce rear-end lift 
once the car reaches 75 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 None is a unique setup. But each system is honed to world standards in a 
Ferrari as its legacy of a half-century of competition wherever cars are driven 
in anger. 
</P>
<P>
 So the 456GT made Sears Point its playground. It wasn't geared for the 
wriggling circuit. Suspension was on the soft side and the tail prone to twitch 
naughtily in corners. 
</P>
<P>
 But it accelerates from rest to 100 m.p.h. in a wink over 12 seconds, 
incredible for a two-ton road car. On the short pit straight, inches before 
hard braking on Testarossa discs and downshifting twice for the hairpin, the 
456GT is nibbling 140 m.p.h. while lounging in fourth gear. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a virtuous, balanced, stable car that comes to a halt as briskly as it 
moves into the next county. It is capable of committing enormous interstate 
illegalities, but is equally happy on Sunday ambles to Ojai. Such qualities 
make this four-place adrenaline stirrer quite the most civilized car ever to 
come from Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
 And the 456GT is available as we drool. 
</P>
<P>
 But hurry. Ferrari of Beverly Hills and Ogner Ferrari in Woodland Hills will 
be closed Christmas Eve.

TECHNO WATCH: THE GOODS; WHITER AND BRIGHTER, FASTER

<P>
 Now there's a new electric toothbrush that's about six times faster than 
anything on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Just introduced by Teledyne Water Pik, the SenSonic Plaque Removal Instrument 
-- that means toothbrush -- operates at a speed of 30,000 brush strokes a 
minute. Other automatic brushes clock in at 3,000 to 5,000 per minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Through an electronic feedback system run by a microchip, SenSonic 
automatically adjusts the speed. If you aren't brushing hard enough, it 
increases its speed; it decreases it if you're applying too much pressure. The 
speed, say Teledyne reps, also makes toothpaste foam more so it penetrates 
hard-to-reach places. 
</P>
<P>
 During in-house testing, Teledyne found the high speed of the contoured brush 
not only removes plaque, but also reduces stains such as those caused by coffee 
and tea. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar favorable results were found in outside clinical testing that has just 
been completed, but not yet released, according to Sara Harms, vice president 
of oral health at Teledyne. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver dentist John Abrams, was among a number of dentists the company invited 
to try SenSonic (the dentists were not paid). He says SenSonic "has a lot of 
potential. I never endorse anything, but they asked me to try it and I do feel 
that my teeth are cleaner than with manual brushing." 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams says, "Most people do not spend as much time brushing as we'd like. The 
speed of sonic technology means that patients can save time brushing and still 
do an effective job of cleaning their teeth and massaging their gums." SenSonic 
has a rechargeable battery that enables the brush to last up to two weeks 
without its plug-in base if you charge it for 24 hours before taking it on a 
trip. SenSonic ($129-$149) is available in the Los Angeles area at 
Robinsons-May. To order from Teledyne Water Pik in Fort Collins, Colo., call 
(800) 706-2266. Your Car as a Source of Power 
</P>
<P>
 Pocket Socket is a unique little gadget that plugs into a car's cigarette 
lighter and lets you run appliances ranging from lights and small drills to 
TVs, VCRs, laptops and fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
 An eight-ounce power inverter, Pocket Socket would be ideal for camping or 
useful in a power failure. Plugging it into the cigarette lighter converts the 
car's 12-volt DC battery to the same 115-volt AC power that comes out of the 
electrical outlets in your home, so you can run a lamp or TV with an extension 
cord from your car until power is restored to your house. 
</P>
<P>
 About the size of a garage door opener, Pocket Socket can provide 100 watts of 
electricity, enough for lights, or deliver the 800 watts of ultrasurge needed 
to start up PCs, TVs, VCRs, faxes and small power tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Pocket Socket ($79) is manufactured by PowerStar Products in Sunnyvale, Calif. 
It's sold at Camping Word and REI stores and selected auto supply, hardware, 
department, sporting goods and RV stores nationwide. Or order it from the 
company by calling (800) 645-4004 or (800) 922-3410. Tools Literally at Your 
Feet 
</P>
<P>
 In the category of "why didn't somebody think of this before" is Rubbermaid's 
clever Step Stool Tool Box, a 13-inch step stool you can fill with tools. 
</P>
<P>
 The stool, which can support up to 300 pounds, has a lift-out tray inside that 
can hold a hammer, screwdrivers, pliers, tapes, glue gun, scissors and more. On 
top is a recessed handle for easy carrying. 
</P>
<P>
 Weighing 6 1/2 pounds empty, Step Stool Tool Box ($20) comes in gray or navy 
and is available nationwide at Home Depot, Kmart, Wal-Mart, Fedco, Target and 
Builders Square mass merchandise stores and True Value and Ace hardware stores.

MY TURN: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; GIVE THE GIFT OF LIFE: DON'T DRINK 
AND DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVE WINNICK, Eve Winnick is a junior at Loara High School in Anaheim, where 
this article first appeared in the student newspaper, the Saxon Shield. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With end-of-the-year and New Year's parties coming up, this is a reminder to 
buckle up and avoid the drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Often statistics don't mean much to us, but these should: 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, there were 902 injuries and 62 deaths involving California 
teen-agers, ages 15 to 18, who were driving under the influence. Just among 
15-year-olds, there were three fatal accidents and 29 that resulted in 
injuries. This is a difficult fact to accept, considering that 15-year-olds 
can't legally drive. Then again, they can't legally drink either. 
</P>
<P>
 If these statistics don't faze you, read on. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of teens -- drivers or passengers -- involved in alcohol-related 
accidents in California in 1993: 
</P>
<P>
 Age 15, 9 fatalities, 432 injuries.  
</P>
<P>
 Age 16, 24 fatalities, 720 injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Age 17, 23 fatalities, 924 injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Age 18, 40 fatalities, 1,278 injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 These were all teen-agers who could have been your friends. 
</P>
<P>
 It is against the law to drink if you are under 21. If you care about your 
friends, it's your responsibility to warn and to help them. If they don't stop, 
their drinking could catch up with them. They too could become another 
statistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Last New Year's weekend (from Dec. 31 to Jan. 3) 30 people were killed in 
alcohol-related accidents in California. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no way to predict how many accidents will occur this New Year's. But 
just a month ago, during the Thanksgiving holiday, 60 people in California died 
in traffic accidents. Nine of those were pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's make an effort not to increase the statistics for 1994. Over the 
holidays (or at any time, for that matter), don't drink and drive. Instead, 
buckle up and drive safely.

BOOK REVIEW: NONFICTION; A LOOK BEHIND THE SCENES OF BLACK FILM; BLACKFACE: 
REFLECTIONS ON AFRICAN AMERICANS AND THE MOVIES BY NELSON GEORGE ; 
HARPERCOLLINS PUBLISHERS; $22, 224 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BANKS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the past decade, African American-inspired or produced films have gone from 
sporadic oddities to regular features of our cinematic landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson George's behind-the-scenes look at the people and films that prompted 
this transformation is what makes his "Blackface: Reflections on African 
Americans and the Movies" so fascinating. In this personal and anecdotal book, 
"more a memoir than a critique," George uses his life and experiences to open a 
window into the current role of blacks in the making of many recent black 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, the former Village Voice columnist, Billboard black music 
editor, renowned cultural critic and steadfast film fan entered the filmmaking 
business himself, co-writing two movies: the romantic comedy "Strictly 
Business" and the rap music parody "CB4." 
</P>
<P>
 The book begins with George recounting his early love affair with movies and 
the black images he found there. Intertwined with his movie memories, George 
traces, in broad strokes, the development of black film from the regal and 
refined positive images of Sidney Poitier to the blaxploitation flicks of the 
1970s and the ascent of Richard Pryor, "the only African American film star 
whose career was spawned during the blaxploitation era and who continued on as 
a leading man after that tide had ebbed." 
</P>
<P>
 George was especially affected by Poitier's screen images: "Sidney's heroic 
bearing, that face full of character and intelligence made him the man I wanted 
to be." When George saw Poitier at a Hollywood event, he realized, "that regal 
quality that leaped off the screen at me when I was a kid was no act. The man 
moved like a king . . . I froze and just looked up at him." 
</P>
<P>
 During the late '70s and 1980s, George's music industry connections brought 
him into contact with the emerging group of black filmmakers, igniting his own 
film career and generating personal relationships with many of those shaping 
contemporary black film, including the Hudlin brothers, Spike Lee, Robert 
Townsend, Keenen Ivory Wayans, Leslie Harris, and black music moguls Russell 
Simmons and Andre Harrell. 
</P>
<P>
 George recalls his budding friendship with Brooklyn neighbor Lee in the 
pre-"She's Gotta Have It" days. While working on that film, "Spike lived . . . 
in a cluttered two-room hovel dominated by an editing board, a bed, a stereo 
and an early Michael Jordan poster," George recalls. "In piles along the floor 
and in shelves were tapes, records, papers, photographs, you name it. . . . 
There was ambition manifest in that room that held the seeming chaos together." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, George watches an early version of "She's Gotta Have It" (a film he 
supported with an investment) and concludes: "While I was watching the film in 
his crowded little space, I realized (I lived) around the corner from one of 
the key artists of my generation." 
</P>
<P>
 The book's biggest weakness is that George fails to address an important 
question suggested by his own observations and reflections. He understands that 
viewers, as evidenced by his own youthful idolization of Sidney Poitier, look 
to movies for models of how to live and who to be. 
</P>
<P>
 He realized long ago that "cultural products (are) not disconnected but (are) 
part of an on-going dialogue that reflects and/or molds their time," and that 
different cultural images may be in "aesthetic conflict." Indeed, George's own 
movie, "CB4," mocks what he terms the "ghettocentricity" of rap music's 
performers and audience. 
</P>
<P>
 What, then, of the images produced by the current generation of black 
filmmakers? How can their work be characterized? What characters, themes and 
settings will they or, more important, should they explore? Other than 
predicting "further innovation" and discussing the financial pressures and 
marketing difficulties black films face, George offers little analysis of 
contemporary black cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the excitement surrounding the surge in black film and the prominence 
of black filmmakers springs from the vaguely felt hope that they will refashion 
the big screen representation of black life (and maybe of the American 
experience more generally). 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lee has demonstrated remarkable versatility, many recent 
black-oriented films already show signs of the mindless trend following that 
created the opportunity for fresh perspectives in the first place. "New Jack 
City," "Boyz in the Hood," "Menace II Society" and "Juice" (among many others) 
represent the most prominent thematic thread of recent black films, the 
manchild-in-the-ghetto-fighting-to-survive story. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the new black filmmakers will refashion movie making by crafting 
culturally meaningful films that are commercially viable. Or maybe they will 
simply color Hollywood's stock characters black, with a tint of racial 
stereotyping. Either way, black film, at long last, does seem here to stay.

INK: ROTATING EXECUTIVES STUN USA TODAY STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Part of the Gannett Co.'s corporate culture is to change executives 
unexpectedly at its 83 daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was last Thursday when staffers at USA Today were summoned to a meeting 
and told Peter S. Prichard was resigning as editor of Gannett's flagship 
property and David Mazzarella had the job. The next day's weekend edition was 
Prichard's last; Mazzarella's name topped the masthead on Monday. The staff was 
stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 Prichard, 50, who will become a senior vice president in the Freedom Forum 
(formerly known as the Gannett Foundation) and executive director of a news 
museum the foundation is developing, spent six years as editor. He hardened 
news coverage at the multicolored daily, whose bite-size stories and dazzling 
weather map originally earned USA Today the derisive nickname "McPaper."  
</P>
<P>
 In the 56-year-old Mazzarella, USA Today gets a veteran newsman and manager 
who says he intends to build on the news strength and give the paper "more 
relevance on national and international issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzarella spent several years as an Associated Press reporter and bureau 
chief in Europe and covered the 1967 and 1973 Mideast wars before becoming 
editor of the Daily American in Rome. After returning to the United States in 
1976, he became foreign editor of the Gannett News Service and then editor of 
the chain's central New Jersey paper, the Courier-News. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzarella worked on the prototype for USA Today, launched in 1982, and in 
recent years has hopscotched the map as president of the paper's multifaceted 
international publishing division, a job he will continue to hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see more enterprise in the paper, but I was not brought in to 
turn the place topsy-turvy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 USA Today reportedly ended a decade of red ink by producing a small profit 
last year. However, the belief among the paper's reporters is that Mazzarella 
represents a drive toward greater profitability initiated by Gannett Chairman 
John Curley (with whom Mazzarella started out in the AP three decades ago) and 
his brother, USA Today Publisher Thomas Curley. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzarella sidestepped a question about revenues, saying, "Certainly my goal 
is to produce a newspaper that more and more people will want to read and 
advertise in because it's a good paper. Other things grow from the quality of a 
paper." 
</P>

 On the Racks: The Martha Stewart media juggernaut -- books, weekly TV show and 
Martha Stewart Living magazine -- rolls on. Martha Stewart Living Weddings 
($5), the first special-edition spinoff of her successful monthly magazine, 
will appear on newsstands for three months beginning Monday. It's a 272-page 
mag that offers tastefully Martha ideas on all things nuptial. 
</P>
<P>
 The never-ending tour of Bob Dylan has produced more than just the singer's 
arrangements of old songs. "Drawn Blank" (Random House) is the first published 
collection of Dylan's artwork -- "sketches for paintings that either never were 
painted, have yet to be painted (or more likely never will be painted)," as he 
explains in a brief foreword, which is the only text in the $30 book except for 
the title on the cover. His untitled sketches show nudes, interiors and 
exteriors framed by what could be hotel windows.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; A WARMTH OF HOLIDAY SPIRIT AT 'COLORS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Holiday cheer, pop hits and smooth showmanship produced an evening of 
feel-good entertainment Wednesday at the Cerritos Center for the Performing 
Arts, as the "Colors of Christmas" concert came to the stylish venue's 
in-the-round stage for a second season. 
</P>
<P>
 Peabo Bryson, Roberta Flack, James Ingram and Sheena Easton -- each performing 
separately and in a variety of duets in the first of three sold-out nights -- 
were indeed colorful.But Christmas classics were given short shrift, with more 
time spent on the performers' individual greatest hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Flack paid tribute to baby Jesus with a tender, hushed "What Child Is This?," 
but James Bond also got his due with Easton's hyper-intense "For Your Eyes 
Only." Ingram also made an odd choice of material in performing his hit "I 
Don't Have the Heart," a song pretty short on glad tidings. And the evening's 
showstopper wasn't any Santa tune, but "A Whole New World" from Disney's 
"Aladdin," sung by Bryson and Easton. 
</P>
<P>
 The performers were backed with serviceable, workmanlike arrangements from a 
small orchestra. They were better served by the stirring support of the 
Crenshaw High School Choir on several tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert closed with all four headliners on stage, tearing into a rousing 
gospel number that brought the house to its feet. "The Colors of Christmas" 
offered a bill heavy with chart-topping singles rather than tree-topping 
carols, but the warmth of spirit from the stage and in the crowd made it hard 
for even dedicated Scrooges to hold on to much humbug. CHUCK CRISAFULLI

O.C. TO CUT BUDGET $40 MILLION; HUNDREDS MAY LOSE THEIR JOBS; BANKRUPTCY: LABOR 
REPRESENTATIVES SAY UP TO 1,000 POSITIONS COULD BE ELIMINATED. VACANCIES COULD 
EASE BLOW. UNION LEADER ASSAILS SUPERVISORS. 
</P>

<P>
 Hundreds of Orange County workers are expected to lose their jobs in early 
January under a sweeping plan, passed by the Board of Supervisors on Thursday, 
to slash $40 million from the county's budget over the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the cuts will come from salaries and nearly every county government 
service -- from the courts to health care to social services programs -- will 
be targeted. More reductions may follow if the county's financial situation 
deteriorates. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no easy way . . . to say someone died or you're fired and that's what 
happened today," said Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who is retiring this month 
after 16 years on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows exactly how many jobs could be cut. But the head of the Orange 
County Employees Assn. estimated that 800 to 1,000 positions could be lost. One 
supervisor said there are several hundred county jobs currently unfilled, which 
might help out. 
</P>
<P>
 John H. Sawyer, the union's general manager, charged that supervisors acted 
prematurely and unjustifiably in approving the cutbacks, which suspend a number 
of collective bargaining agreements with local unions, asks that some employees 
volunteer to retire and puts a halt to all raises and promotions.  
</P>
<P>
 The board also gave broad discretion for county managers to fire employees, 
regardless of seniority, and to cut salaries. The move came just three days 
before Christmas -- and was timed by county leaders to head off raises that 
were due to some workers Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are shocked and disappointed that the county would treat its employees so 
cavalierly, particularly in the face of this march of folly," said Sawyer, 
whose union represents 11,000 of the county's 16,000-member work force. "This 
is a disastrous approach. This has all the aspects of a steamroller." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * A federal bankruptcy judge approved an interim plan that lets Orange County 
and more than 180 cities and districts withdraw up to $1 billion to pay 
emergency bills and make payrolls through Jan. 31. The plan limits the county 
and each investor to 30% of their investments in the county's troubled bond 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * Supervisors demoted Matthew R. Raabe as acting treasurer and named former 
Oklahoma State Auditor Thomas Daxon as treasurer for the next four months. 
Daxon was named two weeks ago as the county's special consultant to the 
treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 * The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, one of several agencies 
investigating the county's financial debacle, has sent 10-page questionnaires 
to investors, inquiring about their dealings with the county pool and whether 
the risks were adequately explained. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salomon Bros., the brokerage handling the liquidation of Orange County's 
portfolio, said it had auctioned off $405 million more in corporate securities 
Thursday but it was not immediately known how much was raised in the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 * Former California treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, the county's top financial 
adviser, said that although the sale so far of $3.3 billion in holdings by 
Salomon Bros. had succeeded in bolstering the troubled portfolio, "it is still 
very risky" and still vulnerable to losses from increases in prevailing 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other factors, exotic derivatives now make up nearly 80% of the residual 
portfolio, compared to 60% as recently as Dec. 13. That's because the 
investment advisers have focused on selling off the most easily marketable 
securities first to raise cash quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes said those moves have succeeded in raising the county's cash balance by 
more than $1.8 billion while paying off $1.53 billion in loans. At the same 
time, the potential loss to the portfolio from a 1-point rise in interest rates 
is now $220 million, down from $300 million Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes made his remarks in interviews with reporters from several newspapers 
before the Board of Supervisors held its emergency meeting Thursday to announce 
widespread budget cuts. 'Giant First Step' 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing crammed with anxious county workers, department managers and 
residents, Sheriff Brad Gates was the first to announce what had been rumored 
for days. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates was part of the county's three-member management council that has spent 
the past nine days considering where to cut spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff called the $40 million in cuts "a giant first step," that is "the 
necessary starting point to resolve our financial crisis."  
</P>
<P>
 "These are unique circumstances," he said. "We are on unchartered waters. What 
we need to do is different from what we've done before. It is important that 
all of us . . . must renew our commitment to steer the county through these 
troubled times." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the county is already six months into its budget year, Gates said, the 
council's ability to reduce spending was limited. The $40-million reduction 
represents nearly 20% of the county's general fund budget through June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply cannot cut any more this year without seriously jeopardizing 
mandatory levels of health and public safety for our residents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he emphasized that the first round of cuts "must be done immediately," and 
cautioned that the overall recovery would take several years. "The longer we 
delay action, the deeper and more Draconian the cost-saving measures will 
become," he warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi and Health Care Agency Director Tom Uram 
met with individual department heads several times, as well as with the 
county's legal and financial advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without exception we found our entire county family ready, willing and able 
to assist in solving the current financial situation," Gates told the board. 
"If there was ever a problem for us it was that so many in our county family 
offered more help than we were able to or had the time to accept." 
</P>
<P>
 The management council refused to discuss specific numbers of people that may 
be laid off, and suggested that with the proper amount of budget juggling in 
each department, the impact could be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a scare tactic to just make up a number," Capizzi said. "I think 
my department is going to try to minimize laying people off." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said: "These are not easy decisions and we know it. There is 
anguish. There is frustration. it will be years before the county completely 
recovers from this situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Several Orange County judges on Thursday privately raised questions about 
whether Gates and Capizzi -- elected officials who run large departments of 
their own -- had any authority to be part of an impartial body overseeing 
countywide budget cuts.  
</P>
<P>
 "They have no business being there, first because they don't have the 
authority and secondly because it clearly appears to be a conflict of 
interest," said one judge who declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department was reduced 0.7% while the district attorney's office 
was reduced 1.1%. Other departments were targeted for 12% to 18% salary cuts. 
Lawyers Program Hit 
</P>
<P>
 By far the hardest hit program in the county is "alternate defense," which 
provides attorneys for indigent people and pays for other court costs in those 
cases. The program, whose 1994-1995 budget was under $13 million, must slash 
$3.7 million -- or 29% of the total budget -- from its program, according to 
the management council plan. The county's public Defender's Office will pick up 
the slack, with no extra budget.  
</P>
<P>
 The General Services Agency will also suffer big losses, with a reduction of 
$4.5 million, more than 12% of the annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big number," said Bert Scott, said head of the GSA, which maintains 
county facilities. "It's a significant number. Obviously we have to do whatever 
it takes to get this done." 
</P>
<P>
 Other areas ordered to cut the greatest chunks from their budgets include 
human resources, which will lose about 18% of its 1994-1995 budget, and the 
offices of Supervisor William G. Steiner and incoming Supervisor Marian 
Bergeson, whose staffs will be trimmed 14% and 20% respectively. But because 
those offices have relatively small budgets, the cuts will yield only about $1 
million in savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Several departments with large budgets will take smaller hits that will 
nevertheless go far to make up the overall county shortfall. The county 
Probation Department was ordered to reduced its budget by $9.2 million, the 
Social Services Agency by $10 million and the Health Care Agency by $3 million. 
For all three, though, the cuts are under 5% of their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's administrative office expected 30 layoffs alone. The county 
counsel expects to cut jobs as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have that many legal pads to cut back on to make up the difference," 
said Terry Andrus, the county's top attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders said the Board of Supervisors had rendered their labor contracts 
useless and feared they would be powerless to have any say in how the cutbacks 
will be implemented. They were particularly incensed that the board's action 
allows anyone to be laid off, regardless of seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 "County employees are the only asset that remains intact," Sawyer told board 
members as many in the audience cheered loudly. 
</P>
<P>
 One angry resident pointed the finger at county supervisors, who have come 
under attack since the bankruptcy and criticized for failing to prevent it. She 
said county workers should not take the hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had these people working in our county and they are not the cause of 
the problem," said Madelene Arakelian of Laguna Hills. "What are you going to 
give up? You should all resign." 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Pickett, field representative for a union that represents 500 county 
workers, suggested an across-the-board pay cut of 10% rather than layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no fairness or equity in the layoff," she said. "Why make 800 to 
1,000 employees go out the door when there is an alternative where everybody 
contributes to solving the problem without anybody losing their jobs? The wrong 
people are paying the price for the mistakes they had no control over." 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said Thursday's vote was a 
tough one. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the decision we make here today will have very real and I'm afraid 
negative consequences for some of our county family, all of the decision have 
been weighed and all have been difficult, as most would understand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's announcement of massive cuts was the culmination of three weeks of 
nearly non-stop meetings and widespread worry over the financial crisis. Loss 
Announced Dec. 5 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis surfaced Dec. 1, when former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. 
Citron and Raabe, his top assistant, announced a $1.5-billion "paper loss" to 
the county's investment pool. Citron resigned Dec. 5, one day before the county 
became the first in history to file for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 As investing agencies and the county have hired financial advisers, bankruptcy 
attorneys and other experts to help them hash out the situation, local and 
national groups have launched sweeping investigations of the treasurer's 
office. The county's loss has reached more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 County leaders said the financial crisis left them no choice but the slash the 
budget and move toward layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected that it would come to this point," Steiner said late Thursday, 
exhausted by the day's events. "It's regrettable. This is the low point of the 
investment pool calamity. From this point on, I hope we're going to see 
recovery."

 RIDE ON: Security was increased aboard Southland commuter trains Thursday 
following the New York City subway firebombing (A4). Still, commuters at the 
Northridge Metrolink station didn't seem fazed. . . . "The train is still a lot 
safer than the freeways," said Phil Salzwedel, 47, of Moorpark. "You can get a 
sniper on the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 PARTING SHOT: At her last press briefing Thursday, departing White House Press 
Secretary Dee Dee Myers was critical of Newt Gingrich's book deal (A1). . . . 
She also spoke of her Washington tenure. Somehow, no reporters asked if she'd 
look for work in her native Valencia. Her mom, Judy Myers, has the answer: "I 
don't think that's in the cards". . . . Mom says she's glad her daughter is 
leaving the White House because for three years, "she couldn't have another 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 SITTING STILL: During the holidays, children often are taken to live events. 
But how to get them to sit still? And what age is appropriate for a live show? 
Today's Valley Life! (page 10) reports that if you plan ahead, you can have a 
nice time at many live cultural events. . . . Maria Gutierrez and her nieces, 
above, attend a recent performance of "The Nutcracker." 
</P>
<P>
 KEEPING SCORE: Burbank's Jonathan Wolff is one hot composer. A few years ago, 
others tried to score Jerry Seinfeld's new TV series, but it was Wolff who came 
up with the idea of finger snaps, lip pops and tongue clucks for the theme 
song. . . . He now scores "Dave's World" and "Married . . . With Children." See 
Valley Life! Page 3. 
</P>
<P>
 TRIPLE THREAT: It's not hard to argue that soccer runs in the George family. 
Three of the top players on the powerful Chatsworth High girls soccer team -- 
Melinda, Michelle and Pamela -- are sisters. . . . At first, though, dad Dennis 
George didn't have soccer on his list of family goals: "I'd always thought, 
'What a stupid thing to do,' " he recalled. "But then we got hooked" (C10).

Winston. . . . "It's a minor, minor role," said Ventura County Dist. Atty. 
Michael D. Bradbury, who will portray the "gentleman on the street" character 
in a Christmas Eve radio broadcast of the holiday favorite. "They keep telling 
me I'm perfect for Scrooge," Bradbury quipped . . . The booming voice

released from the hospital Thursday after hip surgery, is still scheduled to 
perform next spring at Thousand Oaks' Civic Arts Plaza, said a spokesman for 
Avalon Attractions, which booked the act. The surgery was scheduled around 
Minnelli's tour dates to give her "sufficient recovery time". . . . The singer

house will go to a single father from Oak View and his four children -- as soon 
as it's completed. . . . Former President Jimmy Carter is the group's 
best-known helper, but most of the volunteer builders -- including the future 
occupants -- are regular folks.

CALIFORNIA DATELINE / PATT MORRISON: SNAPSHOTS OF LIFE IN THE GOLDEN STATE. ; A 
BIOLOGICAL GRINCH TRIMS THE CHRISTMAS TREE CROP

 Remember the phrase pitch canker disease; this time next year, it may be as 
familiar as deck the halls.  
</P>
<P>
 Christmas tree farms in California are reeling from an advancing fungus which 
in Southern California has already wiped out up to 40% of the crop, especially 
among such conifer species as Monterey pine and Douglas fir--big Christmas 
sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 From the first ooze of resin at the base, it is only a matter of weeks before 
pitch canker spreads to the branches, bringing wilting and death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to inform our members they should cut out diseased trees and 
stop the spread by either burying them or burning them," said Mike Wade, 
executive director of the 300-member California Christmas Tree Growers group. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rio Dell, a town near California's timber coast, the official Christmas 
tree didn't last long enough to fall ill. Star, lights, extension cord and tree 
vanished from outside City Hall less than a week before Christmas, in spite of 
precautions that included steel rods to protect the tree from "hackers." With 
splendid Yuletide contradiction, city worker James Hale declared, "Somebody 
needs to be made an example of. This is Christmas."

 Americans bought more than 56 million pots of poinsettias last year, and 
California produced more than any other state. Most sell in the six weeks 
before Christmas. Red is still by far the most popular color, but in the last 
five years, pink, white and other colors have risen in popularity. In Southern 
California last year, pink outsold white for the first time. 02,19,33 STATE

 Hello, you're on the Arianna: The name hasn't been nailed down yet--"Beat the 
Press," maybe, or "Do Not Face the Nation"--but the other Huffington could be 
returning to the airwaves very soon.  
</P>
<P>
 Arianna Huffington has been taping a pilot for a new television program to be 
shopped around imminently, a satirical program taking on the news media. Its 
first guest . . . Newt Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Huffington has already done another cable show this year, "Critical 
Mass," and is at work on a journal-style book on the U.S. Senate campaign her 
husband lost. U.S. News and World Report says the show will examine what the 
creators call the liberal bias of the press, but Mrs. Huffington's people say 
she would like the program to be bipartisan. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Nov. 8 election, Mrs. Huffington told Larry King that if she had 
been running the campaign, "I would have been 20 points ahead." Let's see 
whether that holds for Nielsen ratings, too.

 Jesse Richardson, native Californian, wants to move back here from Boise, Ida. 
Loves the place . . . the people are another matter. Even after two years, he 
feels unwelcome, taunted for his Califorbears, insulted when he and his fiancee 
went roller-blading downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 So he's giving Idahoans the opportunity some had wanted all along: to get rid 
of him. His ad in the Idaho Statesman read: "Native Californian needs to move 
home. Needs help defraying moving costs. All donations welcome." Within three 
days, he got $75. He needs only another $1,425, and he'll be out of there like 
a hot famous potato.

 Gorilla in the midst: More cutting controversy over Koko the gorilla. A

<P>
 Officials have already said no to one logging plan after the foundation argued 
that it would disturb Koko, the most accomplished ape since King Kong, just as 
they try to breed her to find out whether she can pass on her language skills 
to offspring--difficult words like "chain saw."

 Drawn, then quartered: Salvatore Bono soon takes his place in the odd-name 
Congress. Bono shares the same party with Newt, but not nearly the same exalted 
quarters. The new Republican congressman ("Sonny" to those of us who still 
believe music comes on albums) lost the freshman drawing and wound up in office 
Siberia, the fifth floor of the Cannon Building, the attic of the Capitol, 
where even elevators hardly go. 
</P>

 He took it like a Southern California fitness stoic: "I don't care. Whatever. 
If I have to walk a flight of stairs, that doesn't bother me. I'll get some 
exercise." 
</P>
<P>
 And, revenge being a dish best eaten cold, the veteran and vocal GOP 
Congressman Robert K. Dornan's new quarters were lately the personal offices of 
ex-Speaker Thomas Foley, thus passing the outgoing on to the outrageous. EXIT

U.S. TO REVIEW SHOOTING IN FRONT OF WHITE HOUSE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT TO EXAMINE PROBE OF POLICE ACTIONS THAT LED TO KILLING. MOVE 
REFLECTS CONCERN OVER QUESTIONS OF EXCESSIVE FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Justice Department, reflecting government concern about questions of 
excessive force by U.S. Park Police, said Thursday that it will review the 
shooting death of a man who brandished a knife in front of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal section of the department's civil rights division does not 
usually get involved in potential brutality cases at such an early stage, but 
chief department spokesman Carl Stern said that representatives of the division 
and of U.S. Atty. Eric H. Holder Jr.'s office agreed to review an investigation 
of the matter conducted by the Metropolitan Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcelino Corniel, 33, the knife-wielding man shot Tuesday in the abdomen and 
right leg, died Wednesday night after undergoing two lengthy surgical 
procedures at George Washington University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions were raised after a videotape of the incident, broadcast repeatedly 
on television here, showed Corniel standing still in front of a ring of Park 
Police and Secret Service officers on Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White 
House. He fell to the sidewalk as he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 However, an affidavit by FBI agent Scott M. Salter, filed in connection with 
federal charges against Corniel on Wednesday, described him carrying a large 
knife in his left hand and pursuing a Park Police officer shortly before he was 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we're saddened by anybody being killed in a random act of 
violence," said Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary. "It again 
underscores the nature of violence in our society and that nobody is immune." 
</P>
<P>
 Myers would not be drawn into a discussion of the propriety of the incident. 
"I'm certainly not going to stand here and second-guess the decision of a law 
enforcement officer made in a difficult time and neither is the President or 
anyone here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milton Grimes, a Newport Beach attorney who said that he would investigate 
Corniel's death at the request of Corniel's family, said: "It appears to me 
that he was not physically able to pose a threat to a kindergartner, much less 
a police officer. . . . It looks as though there was excessive force." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Salter's affidavit, throughout which Corniel's name is misspelled, 
said that Park Police Officer Stephen J. O'Neill observed him in Lafayette 
Park, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, about 6:30 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Corniel was sitting on blankets with four cups of McDonald's coffee, the 
affidavit said, and O'Neill, recognizing him as a regular visitor to the park, 
"acknowledged" him and continued to make his rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 About half an hour later, O'Neill assumed his foot patrol assignment on the 
sidewalk directly in front of the White House and minutes later "observed a 
sudden movement from Lafayette Park which caught his attention," Salter's 
affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill saw Corniel running toward him, holding "a large knife in his left 
hand. O'Neill ordered Corniel to stop and then ran to the east, away from 
Corniel, toward where he knew there were U.S. Secret Service Uniform Division 
officers stationed. Corniel pursued O'Neill, chasing him at a close distance." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill called for help on his radio and, after running 150 feet, was joined 
by Secret Service officers and another Park Police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, Corniel stopped and he was confronted by O'Neill and the other 
officers, who ordered him to drop the knife and then ordered him to lie on the 
ground," Salter's affidavit said. Corniel refused both orders and "was then 
shot twice by one of the other officers" who had joined O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 He then was disarmed and taken to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Salter said that the affidavit was based on his own investigation and the 
comments of other FBI agents as well as officers of the Park Police, Secret 
Service and Washington Metropolitan Police. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere Thursday, the Associated Press reported that more of Corniel's 
background came to light from court records in Southern California. He was 
charged in 1984 in Los Angeles County Superior Court in Compton with attempted 
murder, assault with a deadly weapon -- a knife -- and with intent to inflict 
bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Probation officer Aubrey Dunn said that Corniel had stabbed David Chavez in a 
gang-related fight that began when Corniel and friends were looking for a 
party, the AP said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corniel served four months in jail before pleading guilty before Superior 
Court Judge Kurt Lewin, who placed him on probation and ordered him to stay 
away from the gang. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Bay Daily Breeze reported that Corniel also had been arrested for 
armed robbery in Santa Monica in 1985 and for assault with a deadly weapon in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1992, Corniel was arrested in Carson and charged with violating curfew 
during the Los Angeles riots. He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to the 
five days he had already served. 
</P>
<P>
 The AP reported that Corniel was nearly killed in August, 1992, when the car 
he was driving crashed and caught fire in Wilmington, Calif. He was treated for 
second- and third-degree burns over 80% of his body at Torrance Memorial 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Corniel had extensive reconstruction surgery but failed to appear last Aug. 3 
for scheduled additional surgery. His sister and her husband, with whom he had 
lived, filed a missing-person report on Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Thursday, the White House confirmed that an unarmed man was arrested by 
the Secret Service on Wednesday for allegedly attempting to force his way 
through a guard booth at the perimeter of the White House grounds. "He never 
made it onto the grounds," a White House spokeswoman said.

JUDGE SENDS RAPIST TO PRISON FOR 30,000 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge who said he was weary of criminals serving only a portion of their 
time sentenced a man convicted of raping children to 30,000 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury that convicted Charles Scott Robinson on Dec. 14 had recommended 
5,000 years in prison for each of the six counts against him.Jurors, who 
couldn't sentence him to life without parole, said they wanted Robinson behind 
bars for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's previous convictions were for nonviolent crimes of burglary, 
attempted burglary, concealing stolen property and possession of a stolen 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 District Judge Dan Owens on Thursday chose to order the sentences 
consecutively instead of concurrently, meaning that the 30-year-old Robinson 
probably couldn't be paroled until he is at least 108 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "By doing that, I think I can assure that you will spend the rest of your 
natural life in the confines of the Department of Corrections," Owens told 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone calls seeking comment from the public defender's office, which 
represented Robinson, were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corrections Department will compute the sentences as six life terms, each 
worth 45 years. Most people become eligible for parole in 13 to 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 If Robinson were paroled on the first count in 15 years, he would have to wait 
13 to 15 more years before parole on the second count, and the same for the 
remaining counts. Even if he were paroled on each count every 13 years, he 
would be in prison for 78 years.

ANGER GREETS THE BAD NEWS; COUNTY WORKERS DERIDE REFERENCES BY OFFICIALS TO 
GOVERNMENT 'FAMILY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 From the start, the hemorrhaging had seemed almost inevitable -- the massive 
cutbacks, the wholesale layoffs, the ruined holidays. Yet when the word finally 
came down Thursday, it met nonetheless with anger and disillusionment from 
Orange County workers who bitterly derided the notion they were still part of a 
government "family." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are innocent victims just sitting over here doing our jobs, and now we're 
done," said Donna Baird, who supervises clerks in the tax collector's office 
and implored her staff of a dozen workers Thursday not to panic over the day's 
news. "I don't want to have to tell anybody they don't have a job. I hope I 
don't have to go. After 33 years (working for the county), I'm not ready to 
retire." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the county's 16,000 workers could be certain Thursday whether they 
would be laid off, but a somber tone was set by the Board of Supervisors' 
afternoon decision that hundreds of jobs will be eliminated in the next six 
months in an effort to slash $40 million from the county budget. The moves come 
three weeks after the county was forced to declare bankruptcy in the midst of a 
financial crisis that is taking $10 million a month out of county coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Top officials -- including some county supervisors who have said they will 
consider a 5% pay reduction and loss of other perks -- spoke repeatedly 
Thursday of "the county family" as they discussed the need for financial 
sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert D. Wilberg, a union activist who works as a county parks 
groundskeeper, was unconvinced. "This county family crap is totally unreal," he 
said. "We're not a family. We're the workers." 
</P>
<P>
 Employees facing layoffs are among the first to feel the sting of the 
cutbacks. But the long-term impact could be wide-ranging, affecting everything 
from county parks and beaches to waste disposal and law-enforcement services. 
</P>
<P>
 In the courts, for instance, Presiding Orange County Superior Court Judge 
James L. Smith said administrators will scrutinize every element of operations 
and will make cuts that could hit hardest in the county's ability to provide 
defense attorneys for the poor. Public defenders, already strained, will 
probably have to take on even more work. 
</P>
<P>
 "By golly, if someone can come in here and tell me how the public defender's 
office is going to do $3.7-million more worth of work with the same resources, 
it will be the modern-day equivalent of the fishes-and-loaves miracle," Smith 
said. County officials defended the cutbacks as a crucial step in combatting 
the worst fiscal disaster in Orange County history, but few employees were 
mollified. 
</P>
<P>
 "A dark day in the county has just been made darker by the Board of 
Supervisors," said John H. Sawyer, general manager for a labor union that 
represents more than 11,000 county workers. "I'm shocked and disappointed that 
the county would treat its employees so cavalierly. This is the most 
destructive action the board could take." 
</P>
<P>
 Word spread quickly through the day about the impending layoffs. Some county 
employees left their offices to hear county officials announce their plans, 
then hustled back to work to give co-workers the bad news. It was worse than 
many expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's worry, there's fear, there's frustration," said Robert D. Wilberg, a 
union activist who works as a county parks groundskeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Some workers blamed union representatives for allowing the county to bypass 
normal contract protections and ignore the seniority system when it comes time 
for layoffs. "We have no rights as far as the union," Baird said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deepest resentment was targeted at the Board of Supervisors and at 
former Treasurer Robert L. Citron, widely blamed for the risky investment 
decisions that led to a $2.02-billion loss in the county's investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is it that no one is interested in the justice of this?" asked a longtime 
recorder's office employee, who declined to give his name for fear of 
jeopardizing his job.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are only five to six people who had authority over Citron, and they 
seem to be the only people emerging intact," he said. "I accept responsibility 
for my actions and I'm wondering why I have to accept responsibility for 
theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Hall of Administration, four employees from the treasurer's office 
sat waiting to hear how severe the cuts would be. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman in the group, who asked that her name not be used, scanned a 
document outlining the salary cuts and said sarcastically: "What a merry 
Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ken Carlson, a county mechanic for 15 years: "They (the supervisors) 
should all be fired. . . . This whole thing is ridiculous. Now I've got to go 
back to my shop and tell the guys the bad news." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson said the prospect of being laid off could change his plans to be 
married in July. And he worried that he might not be able to pay the tab for 
his three children's Christmas presents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how I'm going to pay my credit cards if they cut off my salary," 
said Carlson, who earns $44,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what they should do is cut top management," said Johnny Saavedra, who 
works in the employee benefits department. "It's always the little people that 
are hurt in these things. It's unfortunate that one man created so much chaos 
and pain in this county. He (Citron) was not thinking of his fellow residents, 
just about moving money around."

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; SHOULD MOTOR VOTER LAW BE 
IMPLEMENTED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson filed a lawsuit against the federal government Tuesday in an 
attempt to stop the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 from taking effect 
in California until Washington has financed the cost of its scheduled Jan. 1 
implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 Commonly known as the motor voter bill, the new law would allow citizens to 
register to vote when they apply for a driver's license, welfare or other 
public assistance. At least two other public agencies, such as libraries and 
public schools, would also be designated by the state Legislature as locations 
to register new voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Long sought by Democrats as a means to expand the national voter pool, the 
motor voter law is aimed at attracting largely disenfranchised groups such as 
minorities and youths back into the political process. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and his supporters contend that the federal government is 
unconstitutionally imposing new costs and duties on states without the money to 
pay for them. Estimated costs for the law's implementation range from $5 
million to $35 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the motor voter law be implemented in California?  
</P>
<P>
 Harold Ezell, co-author of Proposition 187 and chairman of the Voter Fraud 
Task Force 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't first reform the California election system, motor voter will be 
disastrous. It does not do a thorough job in identifying who that person is who 
will suddenly register to vote. I'm not against making it easier for people to 
vote, but the problem is that, if you don't require that an I.D. be shown up 
front, the dogs, cats and 2-year-olds can still vote. The privilege to vote 
should not be given away carelessly. Under the current system, you can almost 
become automatically registered without even a citizenship status check. Just 
because someone is qualified to have a driver's license doesn't make him 
qualified to be a voter. There's a better way than to get people registered at 
the welfare office. Is that where you want to register people?" 
</P>
<P>
 Max Hobbs, president of the Verdugo Hills Democratic Club 
</P>
<P>
 "If it goes through, we would be a better democracy. The more people you get 
to participate in the system, the better the democratic process is in our 
country. If somebody wanted to abuse the system that badly, there are many ways 
to do that. Those sorts of things will happen from time to time and the people 
who do that should be prosecuted. But this is a democracy and people should 
remember that. This measure was passed by both houses of Congress and some of 
them were Republican. If they wanted to block it, they could have filibustered 
it. Now, it's the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Di Camillo, director of the California Field Poll 
</P>
<P>
 "The public is somewhat unpredictable in their voting practices, so it's 
merely speculation as to what impact any change in registration laws would 
have. One positive advantage is that since people have to, at various 
intervals, re-register, it would probably update some of the old address 
listings that are on file in the register rolls. We can also do "hard purges," 
which means that people who are registered at an address they are no longer 
living at would be struck from the list if they failed to respond (to 
government mailers.) What Wilson is doing is a further way of avoiding to make 
the rolls more accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 Janene Baluntac, legislative analyst for Assemblywoman Paula Boland 
</P>

 "No one can determine to what extent the measure would increase efficiency or 
voter turnout. What the focus should be is that we're putting a bigger 
financial strain on California. That will impact everybody. More money will be 
taken away from parks, schools, libraries and other vital services."

A FUN RUN FOR EDNEY AND BRUINS; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: POINT GUARD HAS CAREER-HIGH 
28 POINTS, PAC-10 RECORD 11 STEALS AND NINE ASSISTS IN 137-100 ROUT OF GEORGE 
MASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When everybody else was harried, hurried and galloping out of control, Tyus 
Edney was gliding. 
</P>
<P>
 When everything else had been pushed a step past confusion, Edney, 5 feet 10 
and built for speed, was calm -- and still going faster than anybody on the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so used to it, he doesn't seem like he's going that fast to me," said 
teammate Ed O'Bannon. "He zips and dodges everybody; to me it's old news." 
</P>
<P>
 Old news, same result. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game that lived up to its go-go-go billing Thursday night, Edney foiled 
George Mason's attempts to outpace UCLA, leading the Bruins to a 137-100 
victory before 10,072 at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 The 137 total was the second highest in UCLA history -- trailing only the 149 
points the Bruins scored against Loyola Marymount and the same Paul Westhead 
shoot-'em-up system in the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior point guard juked past full-court traps and dribbled through double 
teams and sprinted his way to a near triple double -- a career-high 28 points, 
nine assists and a Pacific 10 Conference record 11 steals. 
</P>
<P>
 With Patriots trying to get up the floor as quickly as possible, Edney stepped 
in front of inbounds passes at least five times, pretty much mangling George 
Mason's fast break. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seemed like they were always looking for their guards on the outlet," Edney 
said, "and I was able to anticipate pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 After an edgy first half in which George Mason scored 57 points and trailed by 
14, a couple of quick Patriot scores in the opening moments of the second 
narrowed the gap to seven. 
</P>
<P>
 But a couple of Edney steals early in the second half keyed a 22-10 UCLA run 
that widened the Bruins' lead to 95-74 with more than 12 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 With freshman guard Toby Bailey making open shots on his way to a 22-point 
night and Ed O'Bannon cleaning up the boards and finishing with 14 rebounds and 
23 points, the Bruins outscored George Mason by 23 points in the second half, 
holding the Patriots to 43. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward G.C. Marcaccini led the Patriots with 19 points, and guard Donald Ross 
made six of 13 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the second half a lot better than the first half," UCLA Coach Jim 
Harrick said. "A lot better basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA crashed through the 100-point barrier on Marquis Burns' follow with 10:35 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
 By the five-minute mark, the only question left was whether UCLA (5-0) would 
meet Harrick's goal of keeping the Patriots (4-2) under 100 points. Harrick had 
said that unless George Mason scored fewer than 100, the Bruin players would 
spend the next practice sprinting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots came into the game as the nation's leading scoring team with an 
average of 117.4 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
 With less than a minute to play, and George Mason stuck at 98, two big blocks 
by freshman center omm'A Givens made it close. But Curtis McCants' two free 
throws lifted the Patriots into triple-digits with 20 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came into the locker room saying that Coach said they couldn't score over 
100," O'Bannon said with a smile. "I guess we compromised." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick, blaming himself for some of the first-half defensive lapses because 
he kept some players in the track meet for too long, said his players would 
only have to run half as much as he'd intended. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have held them under 100 if I chose to do that," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime, Edney already had seven steals, tying the school record, and led 
all scorers with 19 points. He broke the school steals record five seconds into 
the second half and broke the conference record before eight minutes had 
elapsed in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tyus Edney kind of single-handedly got them going," said Westhead, the George 
Mason coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The unofficial coup de grace was Charles O'Bannon's over-the-shoulder slam 
with 3:48 to play. His free throw made the score 122-88. O'Bannon was the 
fourth Bruin to get into the 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the Bruins, who shot 52.5% and would have shot better if center George 
Zidek hadn't missed back-to-back slams, would like to keep playing at this kind 
of frenetic pace? 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the running game, and I think our players like that style of 
basketball," Edney said. "But a game like this is fun, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you play better teams, you have to run your half-court offense as well 
as the break."

NBA ROUNDUP; WEBBER RETURNS BUT GETS INJURED IN LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Webber, playing his first game against the Warriors in Oakland since his 
Nov. 17 trade to Washington for Tom Gugliotta and three first-round picks, 
suffered a dislocated left shoulder Thursday night in a 107-87 loss to the 
Warriors, who ended a 10-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington has lost eight in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Latrell Sprewell, booed when he exchanged a pregame hug with Webber, scored 26 
points and Gugliotta added 18 points and 13 rebounds for the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington was in the middle of a 14-0 run when Webber went down in a 
third-quarter scramble for a loose ball. Scott Skiles' 17-foot jumper and a 
free throw by Juwan Howard gave Washington a 63-56 lead with 6:10 left in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State regained control by answering with a 14-3 run that began and 
ended with baskets by Sprewell. The Warriors, who got 17 points from Chris 
Gatling and 16 points each from Tim Hardaway and Rony Seikaly, pulled away in 
the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber endured overwhelming boos throughout the night. Some fans held signs 
reading, "No whining, No crying, No Webber." Others showed support, saying "I 
miss Chris" or "I love Chris." 
</P>
<P>
 Every time he touched the ball, he had to play through catcalls of "baby!" and 
"timeout!" a reference to his mistaken timeout call at Michigan in the NCAA 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 114, Phoenix 106 -- Kenny Smith scored 25 points and Vernon Maxwell 
led a third-quarter burst that helped the Rockets end the Suns' seven-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon had 24 points and 14 rebounds for the Rockets. Danny Manning 
led the Suns with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 103, Dallas 101 -- Gary Payton scored 28 points and keyed a late 13-2 
run that helped the SuperSonics beat the Mavericks in Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal Mashburn led Dallas with 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 93, New York 90 -- John Williams made a running bank shot with 20 
seconds left in New York, helping the Cavaliers to their seventh consecutive 
victory and sending the Knicks to their fourth defeat in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Price, who missed the last three games because of bruised ribs, hit five 
three-point shots on his way to scoring 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Oakley, who missed the last four games because of a dislocated right 
toe, led New York with 19 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 103, Atlanta 94 -- John Stockton had a season-high 17 assists and Jeff 
Hornacek had 24 points as the Jazz won their seventh consecutive game and 
extended their franchise-record road winning streak to 10 in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz improved to 10-1 against Eastern Conference teams and completed a 
sweep of a six-game road trip while also leaving Hawk Coach Lenny Wilkens two 
victories shy of tying Red Auerbach's NBA career mark of 938. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 109, Minnesota 89 -- Olden Polynice and Walt Williams each scored 
17 points as the Kings exploited the Timberwolves' season-high 25 turnovers in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 103, Philadelphia 91 -- Alonzo Mourning scored 26 points in 
Charlotte, N.C., as the Hornets continued their domination of the 76ers by 
beating them for the 13th time in 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Weatherspoon led Philadelphia with 25 points. 
</P>

 Sacramento King center Duane Causwell was released from Placer County Jail in 
Auburn, Calif., on $7,500 bail after his arrest Wednesday night on felony 
spousal abuse and false imprisonment charges against his wife, Leslie.

MORNING BRIEFING: THERE'S A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE FOR THIS FORMER BRUIN PLAYER

 Former UCLA basketball player Nigel Miguel has been performing in movies and 
on television for several years. Now, he's an ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel, 31, who played for the Bruins from 1981-85, has been appointed an 
ambassador by his homeland, Belize, a Central American country with a 
population of 230,000. He was honored last week at a formal ceremony giving him 
rights and responsibilities of goodwill ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is sort of like a training ground and steppingstone," Miguel said.

 Trivia time: What was the largest crowd ever to attend a Rose Bowl game? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidence? Saturday's Ram-Redskin game in Anaheim may be the last for the 
Rams in Southern California. Their first opponent after moving to Los Angeles 
from Cleveland in 1946 was also the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams won, 16-14, on Bob DeLauer's field goal in a Times Charity Game at 
the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No worry: During a discussion of attacks on sports figures, such as Monica 
Seles and Nancy Kerrigan, Lee Trevino was asked if he ever worried about his 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got 14 clubs and a 318-pound caddie. Are you kidding?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who'll be first? Mario Lemieux, the Pittsburgh Penguins' legendary center, is 
getting three massages a week in an attempt to restore his ailing back, but 
says he still hasn't made up his mind about returning to hockey for the 1995-96 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither has the NHL. 
</P>
<P>

</P>

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: FOX UNABLE TO FIND MUCH OF A DOWNSIDE TO RAMS' 
DEPARTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 If the Rams end up moving to St. Louis, don't expect Fox to make a big stink 
about not having an NFC team in the nation's No. 2 television market. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the Rams don't generate good ratings here. Sunday's game at 
Chicago got a 9.9 Nielsen in Los Angeles. The San Diego Chargers and New York 
Jets, on NBC at the same time, got a 9.5. And NBC's second game, Cleveland at 
Pittsburgh, which was unopposed by NFL football, got a 15.4. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing, without the Rams in Los Angeles, Fox would be able to show 
doubleheaders here whenever the Raiders were on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Said David Hill, president of Fox Sports: "We've said before, there is nothing 
in our contract with the NFL that requires an NFC franchise in Los Angeles. 
It's an NFL matter. We'll let them handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams were consistent winners who drew big numbers, it might be more of 
a concern to Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hill said, "It would still be a league matter. My belief is, television 
has no right to tell a sport how to conduct its business." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 New Year's doubleheader: It has been a good year for Fred Roggin, and 1995 is 
looking even better. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 1, after the Orange Bowl, Channel 4 will carry consecutive Roggin 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 First, about 8:30 p.m., will be "Sports Bowl '94," Roggin's 12th year-end 
special for Channel 4. Then comes a rerun of Roggin's "Top Secret Television 
II," which is being shown nationally by NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC has also picked up another of Roggin's shows, "Too Good to Be True," first 
shown last August. The second installment, "Too Good to Be True II," will be 
televised sometime early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, his Sunday night sports wrap-up show continues to do well, 
averaging a 6.5 rating, while other stations have dropped half-hour Sunday 
sports shows. Channel 7 now runs a movie at 11:30, and Channel 2 has "Hard 
Copy" at 11:30. 
</P>
<P>
 As for "Sports Bowl '94," some of the sound effects are corny, and some of the 
footage has been seen before, but overall, Roggin and producers Mike 
Cunningham, Greg Dowling and Kevin La Beach have put together another winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sports Bowl '93" got a 20 share last Jan. 1, and did even better when it was 
repeated after the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 New beginning: Roy Firestone, whose last regular half-hour "Up Close" show, 
featuring Wilt Chamberlain, will be on ESPN tonight at 9:30, said this is not 
an end of an era. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to think of it as the beginning of a new era," he told many who either 
work or have worked on "Up Close." 
</P>
<P>
 A party was held on the set in Hollywood on Monday to commemorate Firestone's 
final regular "Up Close" taping, when George Raveling was the guest. The 
Chamberlain show was taped earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone thanked his behind-the-scene workers, people such as Bob Seizer, the 
executive producer for the first 13 of the 14 years Firestone did the show, and 
current executive producer Debra Vogel. Others mentioned were Cindy Katz, Josh 
Kaplan, Jason Schirn, Ron Gralnik, John Carlin and Todd Fritz. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone will do 13 one-hour prime-time specials for ESPN, plus many "Sunday 
Night Conversations" for "SportsCenter." 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone's first prime-time special, to be shown Jan. 21, will feature Pete 
Rose, Jerry Jones and Chris Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already taped Rose and Webber, and both interviews went extremely 
well," Firestone said. "I'm really excited about doing these specials." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Myers will take over Firestone's role on the daily, half-hour "Up Close" 
shows Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thrilled to death for Chris," Firestone said. "He's a good friend and I 
know the show is in good hands." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The crew on Fox's NFL pregame show seemed to be generally pleased that Jimmy 
Johnson will be sticking around. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Howie Long: "Sure, I guess I could look it as though I'd have more air 
time if Jimmy was gone, but in this case, he's such a good guy I'm glad he's 
staying. I've known Jimmy since he coached me in the (1980) Blue-Gray game, and 
he's the same guy now as he was then." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Long: He chided his employer, Fox, pretty well on last Sunday's show. 
</P>
<P>
 First Johnson said, "I turned down a substantial amount of money to stay in 
television. Money is not the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Long said, "You'll fit right in here." 
</P>
<P>
 The comment drew applause from the crew working the show at the Fox studios in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 John Madden may be making $7.5 million a year, but the little people sure 
aren't getting rich. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics are saying Johnson, despite having signed a three-year contract with 
Fox, may still bolt for a coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
 "If in two months I am offered $10 million to coach in Tavernier (where he 
lives in the Florida Keys), I would turn it down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Hill, his Fox boss, say there is no window or loophole that will 
let Johnson out of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 But a source familiar with such contracts said Johnson can be restricted only 
to where he works in television, that the contract can't restrict him from 
going into another profession -- such as coaching. One thing the new contract 
will do is require Johnson to be on the set every Sunday next season. No more 
staying home in Tavernier and communicating via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 That's good news for Fox but bad news for fish lovers who will miss the 
aquarium in Johnson's living room. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ratings game: Johnson's orchestrated "announcement" accomplished the desired 
effect. Fox's pregame show got a national rating of 5.5 overall and a 6.4 the 
second half hour. NBC's half-hour "NFL Live" show Sunday got a 4.1.

 TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL is playing a Saturday schedule this weekend because of the Christmas 
holiday, but the cupboard won't be bare on Sunday. ABC offers a college 
football doubleheader, the Blue-Gray game at 9 a.m. and the Aloha Bowl at 12:30 
p.m., and NBC has an NBA doubleheader, beginning at 1 p.m. It will show Seattle 
at Denver, followed by New York at Chicago. These are NBC's first NBA telecasts 
of the season. The next one will be Jan. 22. . . . There is one Sunday NFL 
game: Detroit at Miami on ESPN at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended viewing: Curt Smith, author of the critically acclaimed "Voice of 
the Game," a definitive history of baseball broadcasting, has written and 
co-produced a 90-minute documentary that goes by the same name. It will be on 
ESPN Sunday at 9 a.m. Be sure to set the VCR. In one segment, Harry Caray talks 
about how he started his trademark tradition of leading the crowd in "Take Me 
Out to the Ballgame." It started in 1976 when he was with the White Sox and 
owner Bill Veeck tricked him into singing into the PA system. Caray explains 
Veeck's thinking: "Everyone would sing along because they knew they couldn't 
sing any worse than I did." 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth Southern California Sports Broadcasters Awards luncheon will be 
held Feb. 1 at Lakeside. Jim Lampley will emcee the event. Nominees for best 
radio sports talk-show host are KABC's Steve Edwards, XTRA's Lee Hamilton and 
KMPC's Joe McDonnell. McDonnell is not working in radio these days. He quit 
KMPC because of lack of sports-talk opportunities. . . . Deacon Jones filled 
McDonnell's old role this week on KMPC's morning show and is being considered 
for the job permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of awards, the Jim Healy tribute put together by Steve Bailey, John 
Felz and Bob Rowe has won a Golden Mike. . . . Fred Dryer was a guest on KABC's 
"Sportstalk" Wednesday night and was tremendous. Years ago, Dryer gave up a 
promising sportscasting career to become an actor. Acting's gain was 
sportscasting's loss. . . . Nice guy Geoff Witcher, who has been down on his 
luck, has been hired to do the "Dodger Confidential" programs for KABC radio. 
He replaces Eric Tracy, now the co-host of "Sportstalk." . . . Chris Schneider, 
formerly of KMPC, is the program director and afternoon drive-time host of a 
new all-sports station in Cincinnati. . . . Baseball preview: Yes, there will 
be baseball in 1995. A preview of the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes' California 
League season will be broadcast on KMNY (1600) Sunday at 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. and 
again Jan. 1 at the same times. Joe Castellano is the host.

NEWSWIRE: TOMBA COMES UP BIG YET AGAIN ON SLOPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alberto Tomba longed for this one, and it was a long time coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba, a three-time Olympic champion from Italy, won his first World Cup giant 
slalom in nearly three years Thursday at Alta Badia, Italy, giving him three 
victories in three days and five this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba, 28, had the fastest times in both runs to beat Urs Kaelin of 
Switzerland by 0.45 seconds down the steep Gran Risa track in the Italian 
Dolomite Mountains. Christian Mayer of Austria was third, 0.61 seconds behind 
Tomba. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 38th victory of Tomba's career, and he is off to his best start 
since the 1987-88 season, when he won nine races and two gold medals at the 
Calgary Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wanted to win this giant slalom, in this place," Tomba said. "The 
latest victory is always the most exciting, but I can't say today's was better 
than yesterday's. I love them all." 
</P>
<P>
 Counting consecutive slalom victories to end last season, Tomba now has won a 
record six slaloms in a row, beating the men's World Cup record of five done 
three times by Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark and matched once by Marc 
Girardelli of Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
 The triumph also widened Tomba's overall lead in the World Cup standings. He 
has 550 points, 248 more than defending World Cup champion Kjetil Andre Aamodt 
of Norway. College Football

 USC offensive coordinator Mike Riley will be interviewed Monday for the 
coaching vacancy at Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, 41, is in his second year at USC.  
</P>
<P>
 Vanderbilt seeks a successor to Gerry DiNardo, who recently left Vanderbilt 
after four years to become coach at Louisiana State. Vanderbilt was 5-6 last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them I'd talk to them, but that I'm really happy at USC and it'd take 
a great offer to get me to leave," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley will be interviewed by Vanderbilt Athletic Director Paul Hoolahan in 
Dallas, where USC will play Texas Tech in the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 A Miami sports official said bargain housing deals given to football players 
who rented from boosters made it tough for him to maintain NCAA compliance and 
was partially responsible for his resignation last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Players from Miami's 1989 and 1991 championship teams got the sweet deals on 
housing, the Miami Herald reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "I questioned whether they had institutional control and that's one of the 
reasons I left," said Doug Johnson, former associate director for compliance. 
"I didn't think I could work to maintain institutional control." 
</P>
<P>
 Five players also drove rental cars at discounted rates, but the NCAA found 
the violations were not serious enough to punish the school, the newspaper 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the housing, Johnson said he approved leases for Heisman Trophy winner 
Gino Torretta and two others to pay only a combined $1,000 a month to live in a 
$200,000 luxury Coconut Grove condominium owned by a booster in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he warned school officials about the dangers of similar living 
arrangements in which players rented rooms from boosters. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people live together things happen -- the borrowing of a car, the 
loaning of money -- the kind of thing that is a definite violation," Johnson 
said. Baseball  
</P>
<P>
 The Texas Rangers acquired right-handed pitcher John Burkett from the San 
Francisco Giants in exchange for infielder Rich Aurilia and outfielder Desi 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little surprised to be going," Burkett said. "But I can tell you that 
I'm really excited about it. I want to be on a winning team. The Rangers seem 
to be making that commitment. That's all you can ask for." 
</P>
<P>
 Burkett won 67 games for the Giants in the last five seasons. He tied for the 
fourth most victories in the National League during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 He was tied for second in the National League last season with 25 starts, 
issuing only two walks every nine innings. In 1993, Burkett tied for first 
place with 22 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Aurilia and Wilson will be assigned to the Giants' Pacific Coast League team 
in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran catcher Kirt Manwaring signed a new two-year, $3.675-million contract 
with the Giants, the team announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Manwaring, who has been with the Giants for five years, batted .250 with 29 
runs batted in during the strike-shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
 All-Star first baseman Frank Thomas said the Chicago White Sox are in serious 
trouble now that they've lost Julio Franco to a Japanese team and traded 
pitcher Jack McDowell to the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco agreed to a two-year, $7-million contract with the Chiba Lotte Marines, 
the richest contract in Japanese baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a breakthrough year for the White Sox this past season, I see this as a 
very serious setback to our goal of becoming the next World Series champion," 
Thomas said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cincinnati Reds, still trying to sort out their starting rotation for next 
season, signed Jack Morris, 39, to a $600,000, one-year contract that gives him 
the chance to earn $1.4 million more in bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, a right-hander who has spent his 18-year career in the American 
League, was released by Cleveland in August. Miscellany  
</P>
<P>
 The Royal and Ancient Golf Club announced that a change in the rules will 
allow Arnold Palmer to make a farewell appearance at the British Open, which 
returns to the Old Course at St. Andrews, Scotland, in 1995. Instead of 
offering all past British Open champions under 65 a place in the event, the 
club has altered the rule to read "65 or under." Palmer, who won the Open in 
1961 and '62, celebrated his 65th birthday Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Newman, who coached the San Diego Sockers to 10 indoor soccer 
championships in 14 seasons, said he is leaving the team.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eddie Anderson returned to the practice field Thursday. But the bigger 
question remains: Can he return to the playing field Saturday? 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, the Raiders' free safety, sat out last week's game because of a 
pulled groin. He is hoping to play Saturday in the regular-season showdown 
finale against the Kansas City Chiefs at the Coliseum with a playoff berth 
possibly on the line for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel ready," Anderson said. "I was a little sore today. It hurts a little 
when I go to the left, but I've got one more day. I seem to heal pretty quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Also practicing were cornerbacks Lionel Washington, who has a calf bruise, and 
James Trapp, who has a groin pull. Anderson, however, is the key figure. A 
nine-year veteran, his presence in the defensive backfield figures to be 
desperately needed against a veteran like Kansas City quarterback Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider Coach Art Shell said he might not decide which, if any, of his ailing 
defensive backs will play until Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Athletes usually tread softly heading into a big game. Nobody wants their 
remarks to serve as bulletin board material to inspire the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody except the Chiefs, apparently. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City guard Dave Szott is quoted by the the Associated Press as saying, 
"Put pressure on a Raider team and they can self-destruct in the end. They have 
a self-discipline problem. Just look at their penalties. It's high. . . . We'll 
make fewer mistakes than they do in the fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Added receiver J.J. Birden: "I think sometimes they kind of lose focus between 
all the late hits and cheap shots here and there." 
</P>
<P>
 Raider linebacker Winston Moss smiled at the remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to take that with a grain of salt," he said. "We shall see on 
Saturday." STEVE SPRINGER

 Backup quarterback Chris Chandler sat out practice again because of a sore 
back and said his chances for playing Saturday against the Washington Redskins 
don't look good. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Maddox, who hasn't played in four games, worked as Chris Miller's backup 
for the second consecutive day and will serve in that capacity Saturday if 
Chandler isn't ready.Chandler started against Chicago before leaving in the 
second half because of the back injury.

 The Rams announced that 32,359 tickets have been distributed for Saturday's 
game against the Redskins, meaning the local TV blackout will not be lifted for 
what could be the team's last home game in Anaheim Stadium. The Rams drew 
32,969 for their season opener against Arizona, the smallest crowd for a home 
game since the team moved to Anaheim Stadium in 1980. They have averaged 44,864 
a game this season, their low mark since moving to Anaheim.

 Linebacker Shane Conlan won the Daniel F. Reeves Memorial Award as the team's

Memorial Award as the rookie of the year, in a vote of media representatives.  
</P>
<P>
 Conlan, a three-time Pro Bowl selection with Buffalo, led the Rams in tackles 
this season with 98. Also receiving MVP votes were tailback Jerome Bettis and 
cornerback Todd Lyght. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce, a second-round draft pick from Memphis State, caught 21 passes for 272 
yards before going on injured reserve Dec. 9 because of a knee injury. He beat 
out right tackle Wayne Gandy, the team's first-round pick, and strong safety 
Toby Wright.

 Pepperdine overcame a 13-point second-half deficit before faltering in the 
last 1 1/2 minutes of a 61-58 loss to San Diego State on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dug ourselves a big hole and scratched back but could not get over the 
top," said Pepperdine Coach Tony Fuller."We had an opportunity to take the lead 
but failed to capitalize on our chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine (2-7) trailed, 46-33, with 9:54 to play after Dion Gray made a free 
throw to cap a 7-0 run by San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gerald Brown, who scored 19 of his 21 points in the second half, scored 
eight during a 10-1 run that pulled the Waves to within 47-43 and made a 
three-point basket that tied the score at 54-54 with 3:03 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State (5-3) took the lead for good, 57-56, with 1:05 to play on a 
free throw by Marc Carter, who led the Aztecs with 18 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State missed three of six free throws in the last 12 seconds but 
twice retained possession with offensive rebounds.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; MOTEN TURNS IT UP, TURNS ARIZONA OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All the talk about Arizona guard Reggie Geary's defense apparently brought out 
the best in Lawrence Moten. 
</P>
<P>
 Moten scored a season-high 25 points as 14th-ranked Syracuse (7-1) built a 
13-point halftime lead on the way to a 94-84 victory over No. 6 Arizona (7-2) 
Thursday night at Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been one to talk a lot," said Moten, who also had seven assists. 
"I let my actions speak. I went out there determined and focused. My teammates 
set good picks and I hit the shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Geary: "I don't think we anticipated how intense they were going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Syracuse used defense and clutch shooting to continue its mastery of 
nonconference opponents in the Carrier Dome. The Orangemen have won 74 of the 
last 76 games against non-Big East foes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats kept clawing back after falling behind, 49-36, at halftime, 
closing to within three points on one occasion and to four points twice, only 
to have the Orangemen pull away. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Stoudamire led Arizona with 22 points and Geary had 19. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 No. 7 Kansas 71, Rice 57 -- Freshman Raef LaFrentz scored 18 points as the 
Jayhawks (7-1) survived poor shooting and 15 turnovers at Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jayhawks forced Rice (3-3) into 20 turnovers but could not put the game 
away until the Owls wore down midway through the second half. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 No. 15 Arizona State 72, Oklahoma State 69 -- Mario Bennett had 22 points and 
14 rebounds at Tempe, Ariz., helping the Sun Devils (7-2) end the Cowboys' 
seven-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Riley was crucial in the victory, making two three-point shots late in the 
game and then making two free throws with 1:21 to play for a 71-65 edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett and seven-foot Bryant Reeves of Oklahoma State (8-3) dueled to a 
virtual standstill, with Reeves finishing with 24 points and 13 rebounds.

 Stanford 64, No. 22 Virginia 60 -- Brevin Knight scored eight of his 20 points 
in the final 3:42 as the Cardinal (7-0) held on to beat the Cavaliers (6-3) at 
Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight, who left the game with 7:42 to play after taking an elbow to the chin, 
returned to made a three-point shot with 3:42 left to put Stanford ahead for 
good, 54-52. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford dominated at the foul line, making 25 of 31 to Virginia's nine of 19. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Missouri 76, No. 23 Illinois 58 -- Paul O'Liney led a balanced attack with 19 
points and the Tigers (7-1) pulled away from the cold-shooting Fighting Illini 
(8-2) in the second half at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-range misfiring doomed the Fighting Illini, who made only three of 25 
three-point shots.

 A crowd of 21,714, the largest to watch a basketball game in Missouri, saw the 
game at the new Kiel Center.

 No. 25 Iowa State 114, North Florida 80 -- Fred Hoiberg scored 27 points and

at Ames, Iowa. OTHER GAMES

 DeJuan Wheat had 18 points and Louisville (5-3) took advantage of 22 Nevada 
Las Vegas turnovers in an 89-72 victory at Louisville, Ky. UNLV (0-4) is off to

VENTURA TURNS BACK GLENDALE, 94-64 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They come with their slingshots loaded, determined to slay the monster in 
orange and black, but leave without dragging the trophy home. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Glendale College's turn to take aim at powerful Ventura on Thursday 
night, but the Vaqueros missed the mark badly and lost, 94-64, in a Western 
State Conference interdivisional game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just too good," Glendale Coach Brian Beauchemin said. "They whipped 
us and beat us. You can only battle so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (15-0), ranked No. 1 in the state, bolted to a 34-9 lead and was not 
seriously threatened. It was the 11th time the Pirates have scored at least 90 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates harassed Glendale with their relentless full-court press from the 
opening tipoff and controlled every facet of the game.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think our press bothers a lot of folks," said Ventura Coach Philip Mathews. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are quick and we have some outstanding athletes that execute the press 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura forced Glendale (8-4) into 25 turnovers, 14 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates exploited their size advantage and quickness, especially when 
Beauchemin benched 6-foot-5 point guard Maurice Sowells early in the first half 
because he wasn't happy with Sowells' effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Sowells, who scored only a three-point basket, Glendale had trouble 
matching up and couldn't contain Ventura on the boards.  
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates outrebounded Glendale, 46-22. Freshman forward Bobby Kiritopulos 
led Glendale with 10 rebounds. Damien Cantrell and Hakeem Ward each had eight 
for Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's game was geared toward athleticism and they are much better at it," 
Beauchemin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates hit a cold spell midway through the first half, when Glendale went 
on a 15-4 run. 
</P>
<P>
 A rare four-point play by Joe Khouzam, who made a three-point basket and 
converted a free throw after he was fouled on the shot, and two free throws by 
Eric Scott pulled the Vaqueros to within 38-26 with 2 minutes 39 seconds before 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura went nearly five minutes without scoring while Glendale made its run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates jumped out quickly in the second half and opened a 69-33 cushion 
with 13:15 to play, the last nine points coming on a three-point basket by 
Gerald Zimmerman and two by Shannon Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmerman, one of 10 freshmen on the squad, scored 16 points to tie Glendale's 
Charles Garcia and Eric Scott for game-high honors.  
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates got 15 each from former Canyon High standout Charles Woodard and 
Ward.

WARRIORS CONTINUE TO IMPROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Woodbridge girls' basketball Coach Eric Bangs said his team needed to improve 
this week, and it did so in a couple of easy, early victories in the Santa 
Barbara Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Thursday night, the Warriors got a chance to play full-bore against a 
team that was, if not its equal, at least competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge, ranked No. 1 in Orange County, scored a 57-40 victory over Chino 
to advance to the tournament championship, but it was a closer game than the 
score indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Chino trailed by only four points one minute into the fourth quarter, but 
baskets from 17 and 18 feet by Tami Weaver -- who had scored only three points 
the first three quarters -- sparked a 14-2 run over the final 5 minutes 30 
seconds, during which Chino didn't make a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't mind a close game to get us tougher," Bangs said before his team 
improved its record to 8-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Chino made two runs at Woodbridge, cutting an 18-7 margin to 18-17 in the 
second quarter before Krissy Duperron went on a 10-point scoring binge. The 
Warriors led at halftime, 33-21. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the credit goes to Carly Moss, who spent most of the night guarding 
Rasheeda Clark, the highly recruited Chino standout averaging 17 points per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark had only six points at halftime, making only two of 10 shots with Moss 
in her face. Clark finished with 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Another run came late in the third quarter and early in the fourth when Chino 
cut the halftime lead from 12 to four, 40-36. Then Melanie Pearson scored on a 
drive, Duperron made a free throw and Weaver connected with her long baskets. 
And the rout -- once again -- was on.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL / SANTA BARBARA TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS; BREA TOPPLES ANOTHER 
HIGHLY RANKED TEAM; WOODBRIDGE NEXT

 Would you believe Brea-Olinda is at it again? 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats, a year removed from the Nicole Erickson era, knocked off its 
second nationally ranked team in two nights, scoring a 55-40 victory over 
Fresno Clovis West in the semifinals of the Santa Barbara Tournament of 
Champions Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea, ranked No. 2 in Orange County, plays No. 1 Woodbridge in tonight's 
championship game at 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (Nicole Erickson, Sarah Beckley and Colleen Hudson) left, everyone told 
us we couldn't do it anymore," said Brea junior Kiyoko Miller, "and we want to 
prove to ourselves and others that we can, that we're a good team. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a great tournament no matter what happens against Woodbridge 
because all these teams we've been playing have been great teams." 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling about Erickson and Co., who led the Ladycats to a 33-0 season and 
national No. 1 ranking, is universal on this Ladycat team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stress that every day," first-year Coach Jeff Sink said. "You can't 
replace three players like that on a yearly basis. We want to carry-on that 
tradition, but it's essential that we establish our own identity." 
</P>
<P>
 That identity is now 11-0 and has extended the school's winning streak to 65 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea, one night after pressing the full length of the court in a 57-56 victory 
over Atherton Sacred Heart -- ranked seventh in the nation -- was unable to 
maintain that pace against Clovis West (7-1) -- ranked sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Ladycats dropped into a zone and got a break when Adrain Williams, a 
6-foot-3 center bound for USC, picked up her third foul with 7 minutes 42 
seconds left in the second quarter. The score was tied at 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea's early success was helped by the play of Dawn Metz, Brea's 6-1 answer to 
Williams; Metz finished with eight points -- six in the first quarter -- and 
seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who finished with 13 points and only two rebounds, didn't come back 
for the remainder of the first half, and Clovis West didn't make a field goal 
the final 4:23 as Brea broke the game open with a 10-2 run over the final 1:51, 
boosted by three-point baskets by Jennifer Saari and Lee Moulin. 
</P>
<P>
 Clovis West pulled within seven and six points in the third quarter, but Saari 
and Moulin answered with three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 Clovis West missed its first 10 shots of the fourth quarter and Brea applied 
the finishing touches. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulin had three three-point baskets and a game-high 15 points; Saari also had 
three three-pointers and finished with 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea made 22 of 53 shots; Clovis West made 14 of 40. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one expected us to come here and win it all," Moulin said. "Everyone says 
since we lost Nicole and the others that we're not good, but we still have a 
lot of good players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't underestimate us."

BOYS' BASKETBALL / LAS VEGAS HOLIDAY CLASSIC; MATER DEI STREAK ENDS AT THE 
BUZZER 
</P>

<P>
 Clay McKnight got the ball, put it up and believed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all my shots are going in," McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
 For one of the few times, it didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight's three-point field goal attempt hit the lip of the rim, then bounced 
off. In that moment Mouth of Wilson (Va.) Oak Hill Academy had survived, 55-53, 
to win the Reebok Holiday Prep Classic on Thursday at Las Vegas Durango High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew if we could keep McKnight from shooting threes, we'd win," Oak Hill 
Coach Steve Smith said. "We didn't think their other players could beat us." 
</P>
<P>
 He was right, but just barely. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs (11-1) appeared to be fading, trailing 52-44, with 4 minutes 50 
seconds left, then rallied. They closed to within one, 54-53, with 1:31 left 
and had opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Schea Cotton had a chance to put Mater Dei ahead as he went one on one with 
Ron Mercer, one of the top seniors in the nation. Cotton worked him for nearly 
30 seconds, then lost the ball with 17 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Hill center Venson Hamilton made one of two free throws with 13 seconds 
left. Cotton grabbed his miss to set up the final play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to break Schea to the top of the key and if he got 
double-teamed, we were going to go for the win," Coach Gary McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
 It played out that way. Kevin Augustine dribbled left, then right, as McKnight 
cleared with two Warrior players running toward him. He had made three 
three-pointers in the game and a tournament-record 27 in six games. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, though, it was short.

<P>
 "I don't know if it's because I'm his father or coach, but I'm proud of Clay," 
Gary McKnight said. "If we had to do it all over again, I'd do it the same." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ended the Monarchs' 75-game regular-season winning streak. They last 
lost in the Above the Rim final on New Year's Eve, 1991. Mater Dei was routed, 
69-50, by Oak Hill that night. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the Monarchs were able to play with the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei had the lead the entire first half, led by Cotton, a 6-5 sophomore, 
and Shaun Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton scored 14 in the first half while being hawked by Mercer. He had two 
shots blocked early, but gained confidence and finished with 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson scored nine in the first half, mostly on drives past Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton finished the half by grabbing a rebound and dribbling the length of the 
court for a layup at the buzzer, giving Mater Dei a 31-26 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercer kept the Warriors (14-1) close. Mater Dei started 6-1 Mike Waugh on 
Mercer and ran several defenders at him all night. Mercer still had 20 points, 
16 in the first half, and sank four three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Melvin Whitaker and Hamilton who did the dirty work. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker finished with 14 points and 17 rebounds, eight offensive. Hamilton 
had seven points and 11 rebounds, nine offensive. They dominated the inside 
during a second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton played a one-man zone the second half, using his 6-10 body to clog 
the middle. That left Waugh free, but he didn't get off a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We left the kid open to take shots you normally take," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton's presence ended Jackson's drives through the lane. He made only one 
of eight shots in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Sammy Smith's layup gave the Warriors their first lead, 33-31, two minutes 
into the second half. Whitaker then scored all eight of his second-half points 
during an eight-minute stretch. His tip-in capped an 11-4 run that gave the 
Warriors a 52-44 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we hit a wall during that stretch," McKnight said. "We looked 
tired." 
</P>
<P>
 This was the Monarchs' 10-games-in-10-days spree, which started with the 
Tournament of Champions last week. Mater Dei won nine of those games, including 
a 87-60 victory over Washington (D.C). Dunbar in Thursday's semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton scored 23 points and McKnight 17, 15 on three-pointers, against Dunbar. 
But it was Jackson who who made the Crimson Tide cry uncle. Dunbar had rallied 
from a 14-point deficit against Las Vegas Durango in the quarterfinals, but 
Jackson ended any of those thoughts. He was knocked to the ground to start the 
second half, then scored the Monarchs' first nine points to stretch a 41-31 
halftime lead to 50-31. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had to work to hard in that game," Gary McKnight said. "It 
affected us."

PREP ROUNDUP; PHILMAN PICKS IT UP, LEADS EDISON OVER UNIVERSITY FOR TOURNAMENT 
TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Edison's Marie Philman escaped early foul trouble and a dismal first quarter 
to score 25 points and lead the Chargers to a 64-53 victory over University in 
the championship of the Villa Park Tournament Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Philman, who had two fouls in the first minute of the game, scored only one 
point in the first quarter, but Danielle Wiggins scored eight and the Chargers 
(6-2) took a 12-11 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison Coach Dave White then decided to change the Chargers' strategy on 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philman wasn't getting open early," White said. "So we worked in two and 
three extra passes and this opened up the offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Philman took advantage, scoring 11 of Edison's 14 points in the quarter. Even 
so University (6-2) hung close and tied the score, 26-26, on a basket by 
Raschielle Lawrence at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Quality defensive play and eight points by Philman in the third quarter 
allowed Edison to open up a 44-34 lead. Forward Julie Rechsteiner drew five 
charging fouls, negating Trojan scoring opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rechsteiner was, by far, our best defensive player tonight," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 University was able to close to within three points with less than two minutes 
to play, but a basket by Rechsteiner, a key rebound by Philman, who finished 
with 14 rebounds, and four points by Kerri O'Bric put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 University guard Heather Snavely finished with 22 points. JASON HILL

DANA PARSONS: THE BLIGHT AFTER CITRON'S MESS: A DERIVATIVE LITTLE JINGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 'Twas the month before Christmas and all through Orange County, 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone was happy, expecting great bounty. 
</P>
<P>
 The people were primed for holiday cheer, 
</P>
<P>
 Recession had ended, the good times were here. 
</P>
<P>
 The supes were nestled, all snug in their chairs, 
</P>
<P>
 With power and perks, they put on great airs. 
</P>
<P>
 The investment fund had been managed with care, 
</P>
<P>
 In the hopes that big payoffs soon would be there. 
</P>
<P>
 When suddenly from Wall Street there arose such a clatter, 
</P>
<P>
 The supes had to wake up to see what was the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The news is not good," mumbled CAO Schneider, 
</P>
<P>
 His face grew contorted; was there rum in his cider? 
</P>
<P>
 "You remember that fund that had billions in it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's plummeting faster than a New York minute." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell me you're joking," said Harriett Wieder. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if you're not, I'll have a double Beefeater." 
</P>
<P>
 "How could this happen?" asked a stunned Tom Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wasn't our strategy thought out and wily?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently not," said morose Ernie Schneider; 
</P>
<P>
 Harriett blanched; Gaddi threw up beside her. 
</P>
<P>
 They cursed Bob Citron; cast a pox on his house; 
</P>
<P>
 Yesterday, they loved him; but, now, what a louse. 
</P>
<P>
 He purchased derivatives; no one asked how; 
</P>
<P>
 His investment pool was a steady cash cow. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron delivered; they said he had prowess; 
</P>
<P>
 But now his career was being measured in hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must fire Citron," the board all agreed, 
</P>
<P>
 "Put distance between us, with all due speed." 
</P>
<P>
 "Could we say we don't know him, could we say we were dubious?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Could we say we feared that some day he would ruin us?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's call him reckless, a maniacal boob." 
</P>
<P>
 But, alas, the toothpaste was out of the tube. 
</P>
<P>
 The supes pleaded ignorance, said they weren't the Grinch, 
</P>
<P>
 They pointed desperately toward Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 They huddled again, as baffled as ever; 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted advice, the quicker the better. 
</P>
<P>
 Their financial adviser suggested bankruptcy, 
</P>
<P>
 Supes threw up their hands; the adviser said, "Trust me." 
</P>
<P>
 A two-part plan to solve Citrongate: 
</P>
<P>
 Declare bankruptcy and then liquidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can we do that?" asked the supes, now quite glum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either that," they were told, "or be hung by your thumbs." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, God," each supe said, "I wish I were dead." 
</P>
<P>
 "Politically, you are," the public all said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with disaster, the supes had no druthers, 
</P>
<P>
 Their hopes for salvation lay with Salomon Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep down, the supes knew it was they who had blown it, 
</P>
<P>
 Their hope was that voters would somehow condone it. 
</P>
<P>
 But not to be fooled, voters demanded the supes 
</P>
<P>
 Step down at once and admit they were dupes. 
</P>
<P>
 While Riley and Wieder were already weaning, 
</P>
<P>
 Some said the board needed a total housecleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out Stanton and Steiner, and take Gaddi too!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Dash away, dash away, we'll surely make do." 
</P>
<P>
 The supes held their ground but grew ever more queasy, 
</P>
<P>
 When into the fray jumped the D.A., Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can we govern under such a condition?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere we look, the Securities and Exchange Commission." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, cities and schools sift through the rubble, 
</P>
<P>
 Wondering how to escape from such dire trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 'Tis a pity at Christmas that all have the blues, 
</P>
<P>
 What a terrible way to make the national news. 
</P>
<P>
 And as for Bob Citron, that once-merry elf? 
</P>
<P>
 What does he have to say for himself? 
</P>
<P>
 After years of asking for the public's votes, 
</P>
<P>
 He repaid their faith with a bunch of bad notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a peep, not a wink as he faded from view, 
</P>
<P>
 Just a "Merry Christmas to all; too bad you got screwed." 
</P>

 THE WALRUS DIP: December is hardly the month that most of us think about 
taking a swim in the ice-like Pacific. But the "Walruses" of the Newport Beach 
Athletic Club are doing it for a cause -- raising funds to help the 
homeless.About 100 of them will run two miles in the sand this morning at 
Corona del Mar State Beach -- for corporate sponsors -- then take a dip to 
"earn their tusks."... Says spokeswoman Judy Cooper: "In the name of love, they 
gamble their sanity."

 RED HOT GIFT: Chad Smith, drummer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, recalls his 
first drums: "Baskin-Robbins ice cream cartons." So he was delighted to meet a 
16-year-old Huntington Beach youth with cystic fibrosis Thursday when the young 
man, named Loren, received a sheer blue $3,000 Pearl drum set. It's the same 
kind owned by Smith, Loren's favorite drummer. . . . Smith's visit in Fountain 
Valley and the drums were made possible through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. 
Says Loren: "It's the best Christmas present you can ever get."

<P>
 LOADED FOR BEAR: For years Brad Wright of San Clemente has set up an 
award-winning Christmas display in his front yard. But sometime early Thursday, 
someone swiped the mechanical polar bear that's been one of its central 
features for seven years. . . . Wright, who says it would have taken three 
people to cart it off, is offering a $250 reward, no questions asked: "I'd 
rather get back into the spirit of the season."

FRAMEWORK FOR LIFE; OAK VIEW: A SINGLE FATHER HAS BEEN AMONG THE VOLUNTEERS 
HELPING HABITAT FOR HUMANITY BUILD A NEW HOME FOR HIS FAMILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

 There's no front door and the roof isn't finished. Most of the walls are still 
just frames. 
</P>
<P>
 But it looks like home to Terry Wieser. 
</P>
<P>
 The 39-year-old computer teacher from Port Hueneme is the latest recipient of 
a house built by volunteers from Habitat for Humanity of Ventura County, a 
nonprofit group that provides homes for needy families. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are very excited," Wieser said Thursday at the formal dedication of 
the four-bedroom home in Oak View. "They've been looking in the house, picking 
out their bedrooms and eyeing the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Habitat officials planned to present the front-door keys to Wieser, a single 
father of four, at the ceremony. But delays in construction have pushed back 
the move-in date until late February. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a wait that does not bother Wieser, who has spent months with dozens of 
volunteers building the home from the ground up. "I'm going to know this house 
inside and out," he said. "Every crack, every crevice." 
</P>
<P>
 Habitat for Humanity is an international organization founded in 1976 that 
builds and repairs homes for low- to moderate-income families willing to 
perform 500 hours of "sweat equity." 
</P>
<P>
 The participants, most of whom could never afford to buy a home without help, 
agree to pay the mortgage and donate time to other Habitat projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Using mostly donated materials and volunteer labor, the group has built 
thousands of homes across the country. Early next year, Wieser will move into 
the second house built by the county chapter of Habitat, although the group has 
rehabilitated dozens of others locally. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the hardest things we do is select the families," said Virgil Nelson, 
the executive director of the Ventura County chapter, who spent months sifting 
through dozens of applications before choosing the Wiesers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieser first heard about the organization through a newspaper ad and applied 
for a house earlier this year. He worked on the Oak View home for weeks before 
finding out that he had been selected to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Better than the best came true," said Wieser, who has accumulated more than 
200 volunteer hours so far. "I plan on giving back and doing the very same 
thing (for someone else)." 
</P>
<P>
 Land for the Mahoney Avenue home was donated by Charles Henderson, who last 
year was living in a trailer on one of his three Oak View lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson agreed to donate two of his parcels to the organization if Habitat 
volunteers built him a three-bedroom house. Group volunteers early next year 
will break ground on a third home that will be built for Jose Flores and his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the house Thursday, Chris Wieser, 14, and little sister, Jennifer, were 
looking forward to moving out of their grandparents' house in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty cool house," said Chris, who has spent the last 10 Saturdays 
helping build the home. "I like it because I can see how it's being built. 
We've been working real hard on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer relishes the thought of having her own bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way my little sisters won't always come into my room and go through my 
stuff," the 12-year-old said. "I'm probably going to put my bed right by the 
window." 
</P>
<P>
 Retired construction worker Al Baber spent Thursday sawing two-by-fours that 
will be used in the home's interior walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing it all my life and these people needed some help," said 
Baber, 75. "I've built maybe 10,000 houses in the area, so I have a little 
experience at it. This one will be really nice when it's finished." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said he is working with the city of Oxnard to build 10 to 20 homes for 
other poor families. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of selfish," he said. "There's great joy in seeing people take 
responsibility for their lives.

VENTURA MAN ORDERED TO STOP DUMPING INTO RIVERBED; ENVIRONMENT: OPERATOR OF 
TREE-TRIMMING SERVICE ALSO FACES SUIT ALLEGING HE HAS DISCARDED TONS OF DEBRIS 
IN WATERWAY. BUT HE SAYS HE DID NOTHING WRONG.

<P>
 A federal judge has ordered a Ventura man to stop dumping debris into the 
Ventura River, following allegations that he has illegally discarded tons of 
material into a section of the waterway over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Appel, who operates The Eager Beaver Tree Service, is accused of 
dumping tree branches, logs and other material into more than 15 acres of river 
channels and wetlands, in a lawsuit filed last month by the U. S. Environmental 
Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 That activity has taken place on a 31-acre parcel Appel owns near Casitas 
Springs, EPA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Appel, 50, said Thursday he has done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never dumped anything in the waterways," he said. "The EPA has been 
threatening me with grievous crimes for a long time, but none of it is true." 
</P>
<P>
 But EPA officials said Thursday that Appel has dumped vegetation and fill 
material into the Ventura River and San Antonio Creek, which slice through his 
property and spill over to create lush wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 They also accuse Appel of clearing and grading river channels and the 
wetlands, thus diverting the river's natural flow.  
</P>
<P>
 Such activity, illegal without a permit, could cause flooding, EPA officials 
say. It already has damaged habitat that may be home to rare and endangered 
species, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
 The injunction, issued Wednesday by U. S. District Judge Lourdes G. Baird, 
will remain in affect until the judge issues a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA spokesman Dave Schmidt said Thursday that Appel has ignored repeated 
orders by federal, state and local agencies to stop his activities. He said it 
is unusual for the EPA to seek an injunction because most people obey such 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dealing with someone here who has defied all previous efforts of 
enforcement," Schmidt said. "This is not something that just happened 
yesterday, it's been going on for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to complaints, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers launched an 
investigation in early 1993 into the matter and concluded that Appel had 
illegally dumped debris into the waterways and wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Clean Water Act prohibits landowners from dumping into rivers and 
wetlands without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Appel had no permit, and the Corps ordered him to stop. EPA officials said 
Appel ignored that order. 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1993, the EPA got involved, issuing another cease-and-desist order. 
That order also was ignored, EPA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In July of this year, Appel filed a lawsuit against the EPA and the Army Corps 
of Engineers, asking the federal agencies to prove that they have jurisdiction 
over him and his property. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress limits their jurisdiction to navigable rivers and interstate 
waterways, and that doesn't have anything to do with the Ventura River," Appel 
said. "I want them to show me where the federal government can tell a state 
citizen what to do in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 That lawsuit is still winding its way through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the EPA filed its own lawsuit last month and on Wednesday won the 
preliminary injunction preventing Appel and The Eager Beaver Tree Service from 
dumping wood debris, vegetation and other material into the waterways. 
Officials believe Appel dumped debris from his tree service, which does 
trimming and stump removal, into the riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an unusual move, but that's because we are really concerned about the 
things he is doing," said Jessica Kao, a lawyer for the EPA in San Francisco. 
"We need to minimize the harm. We are really concerned about what his 
activities might do to properties downstream." 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA also is concerned about what Appel might be doing to his own property. 
</P>
<P>
 Kao said Appel's parcel once was a thriving riparian habitat, home to the 
Southwestern pond turtle and the red-legged frog, which are candidates for the 
endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of sad, the site is extremely bare and a lot of the interior trees 
are gone," Kao said. "We want to be able to preserve that area, and the longer 
we let it go the harder it will be to restore." 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA's lawsuit seeks to compel Appel to restore the river bottom, its 
tributaries and the adjacent wetlands. It also seeks unspecified civil 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Appel was not pleased Thursday when federal officials showed up 
to cordon off the 15-acre section where the violations allegedly occurred. He 
said all he has been doing is trying to provide for the 40 sheep that graze on 
his land. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just been farming my property," he said. "It's been farmed for years, a 
long time before the EPA even existed."

FIRE CAPTAIN ACCUSED OF SELLING DRUGS JAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A veteran Ventura County fire captain has been arrested after allegedly 
selling drugs to a police informant, prompting discovery of a cache of weapons 
and a bomb at his Newbury Park house, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. William Elliot Handy, 48, who is assigned to the Piru station, was taken 
into custody late Wednesday in connection with the sale of half an ounce of 
methamphetamine to the informant at an Albertson's on Reino Road in Newbury 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Handy was under the influence of methamphetamines when arrested, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies, tipped that Handy had sold drugs from his house and made 
deliveries throughout the Conejo Valley, then served a search warrant at 
Handy's home on the 2800 block of Denise Street. 
</P>
<P>
 His neighbors in the upper middle-class housing tract had complained in recent 
weeks of traffic they feared was related to narcotics, said Sgt. Gary Pentis, 
who headed the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 While deputies were searching the house, Loyd Robert Wood, 28, of Newbury Park 
arrived and was detained after detectives suspected that he was under the 
influence of drugs. The unemployed construction worker was taken into custody 
after officers found three cellophane bags suspected to contain 
methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three-bedroom, disheveled house, a team of about 18 deputies recovered 
two electronic weighing scales, packaging material and other drug 
paraphernalia. Deputies also seized six handguns, a .223-caliber assault rifle, 
a loaded shotgun propped beside a bed and an incendiary device later removed by 
the bomb squad. 
</P>
<P>
 The device included a blasting cap and connected fuse, a jar with black powder 
and some chemicals. Twenty-six grams of methamphetamine -- worth about $1,000 
on the street -- were also found. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't recall (a case like this) in my career in this agency," said 
Assistant Chief Dave Festerling of the Ventura County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 At Station 28 in Piru, where Handy has been assigned for about a year, a fire 
captain said neither he nor his crew could comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentis said deputies served a warrant at the Piru station Wednesday night, but 
found no methamphetamine in Handy's locker. 
</P>
<P>
 The narcotic, also known as speed or crank, is a stimulant that can cause 
users to become paranoid, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Handy, released on $20,000 bail Thursday, had been booked on suspicion of 
possession of methamphetamine for sale and being under the influence of the 
drug, Sgt. Mike Johnson said. He is to be arraigned next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood, who remained in custody Thursday, had been booked on similar charges and 
was to be arraigned today. His bail was also $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Handy's arrest marked the second time in a week that the County Fire 
Department has dealt with scandal involving an employee or former employee. On 
Monday, a former supply clerk pleaded guilty to burglarizing four fire stations 
after luring firefighters away with false 911 reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not happy about either one of those cases," Festerling said. "It's been 
one of those when-it-rains-it-pours type things."

FATHER'S OWN SEARCH FINDS HIS 2 CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Camarillo father, desperate to find his missing children, was reunited with 
them Thursday after he conducted his own search and located them living with 
their mother along a lonely Missouri highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County district attorney officials spent much of the day Thursday on 
the telephone with Ozark County, Mo., sheriff's deputies and a judge to clear 
the last legal roadblocks separating James Moats from his son James, 5, and 
daughter Jessica, 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best Christmas I'm ever going to have," a tearful Moats, 35, said 
in a telephone call from Missouri moments before a court order gave him his 
children again. "I'm just going to make sure they have a good Christmas as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 The children disappeared in August after a weekend visit with their mother, 
and failed to turn up despite exhaustive record searches by local and federal 
agencies. So Moats and his mother decided to drive to places as far-flung as 
Texas and Missouri, areas where his former wife might be hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 Moats said he was relieved to learn that his son, who has had open-heart 
surgery four times and was under observation for an artery blockage, was in 
relatively good health despite missing a scheduled October doctor visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the worst thing is they just basically need a good bath," Moats said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken into custody in Missouri on child abduction charges was Sherry Kay 
Moats, 35. She will be extradited to Ventura County to face prosecution here, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Pam Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Moats was granted permanent custody of his children in January after a 
court battle revealed that Sherry Moats is an alcoholic and the children wanted 
to stay with their father, Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Moats was allowed weekend visits with her children, but she did not 
return them as scheduled on Aug. 21, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office, as well as the FBI and missing children's 
centers throughout the United States, had conducted an extensive search for the 
children for four months without success. 
</P>
<P>
 "We literally thought she had gone to the underground -- we had exhausted 
everything," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although authorities knew the children initially had been taken to Missouri, 
the trail grew cold when Sherry Moats' mother told police her daughter had 
returned to California, district attorney's Investigator Dennis Peet said. 
</P>
<P>
 When schools, utility company and motor vehicle records throughout the country 
were searched without success, James Moats devised his own plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, he said he and his mom were going to go everywhere he thought 
(Sherry Moats) could run to," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 First, James Moats went to Texas, visiting towns where his ex-wife had 
relatives and leaving flyers with pictures of the children on them. When that 
did not prove successful, Moats and his mother went to Missouri early this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We traveled along 130 miles of highway, going to small towns and dropping off 
flyers," Moats said. "That's when we got people who said they recognized the 
kids, Sherry or the car." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, an informant called the Ozark County Sheriff's Department and told 
them where Sherry Moats and the children were living. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were off a rural highway in the middle of Missouri," Peet said. "She had 
been living with another man, she had only gone out a couple of times, and the 
children were not in school. . . . Without these flyers, no one would have ever 
found her." 
</P>
<P>
 Moats said he and his mother will drive the children back to Camarillo and 
expect to arrive Christmas Day. Although he expects the children will need 
counseling to deal with what has happened, he said nothing in the future will 
be as bad as the past four months -- for the children or for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like somebody just reached in and tore my heart out," he said.

YOUNGSTERS' 'MIGHTY MORPHIN' PLAY PACKS A PUNCH -- AND A KICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the last two months, admitting clerk Kathy Rodriguez has noticed a 
peculiar trend in the emergency room at the Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At least six young children have come to the county hospital seeking treatment 
for playground combat wounds suffered during sword fighting and kick boxing 
inspired by their favorite TV show: "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers." 
</P>
<P>
 The enormously popular program has spawned the hottest toys on the market this 
holiday season, and its karate-chopping spandex-clad super-heroes have 
enthralled children with their galactic adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 But educators, parents and medical officials have observed that when 
youngsters re-create Power Ranger stunts on elementary school playgrounds, the 
results can sometimes be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot of kids coming in with injuries and I've asked them, 'What 
were you doing?' A majority were claiming to be playing Power Ranger," said 
Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 She recalls one case in particular. A 6-year-old boy came in recently with a 
deep laceration to his left arm, just below the shoulder, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The child explained that he and a friend were playing Power Ranger when the 
boy cut him with a stick he was wielding as a sword. "He was the green ranger," 
the boy told her. "He got me before I could move." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few months, Rodriguez has seen bumps and bruises, cuts and minor 
head injuries caused by children thwacking each other with sticks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that stands out in my mind now," Rodriguez said. "Power 
Rangers have become such a big thing for these kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Big indeed. Since their television debut in the fall of 1993, "Power Rangers" 
has become the top-rated children's television show in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, about $1 billion worth of licensed Power Ranger merchandise has 
been marketed throughout the world, according to Burbank-based Saban 
Entertainment, the show's production company. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the action figures, parents can surround the Christmas tree 
with Power Ranger gifts such as pajamas, backpacks, trading cards, bike helmets 
and underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for the goods has been so high this year, some Ventura County stores 
are struggling to keep Power Ranger merchandise on the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Target store in Ventura, four shelves packed with Power Rangers on 
Wednesday were nearly empty the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have anything (in storage)," said Mariam Gonzales, a saleswoman at 
Target in Ventura. "What's out here is all we have." 
</P>
<P>
 No karate-kicking combatants could be found at the department store Thursday 
afternoon. But 9-year-old Cassie Urspringer of Camarillo explained the Morphin 
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're popular with boys because they do karate," she said. In fact, 
her 5-year-old brother, Matthew, wants to watch the show. "My mom, she doesn't 
let him watch because she says it's violent." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the television show has been criticized as provoking violent behavior 
among children, Saban Entertainment officials maintain that the show encourages 
teamwork and teaches children how to resolve conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Power Rangers have served as a positive motivator for kids," said Barry 
Stagg, vice president of publicity for Saban. "They stand for good." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jean N. Eaton, a first-grade teacher at Junipero Serra Elementary School 
in Ventura, said she has observed violent behavior on the school playground 
when children act out scenes from the television show. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do play quite a bit of this right now," she said. "I know that the Power 
Ranger idea is the good guys versus the bad guys, but if they could emphasize 
more positive ways of dealing with problems, it would help." 
</P>
<P>
 But the show's producers say they have done that. Saban and Fox Television 
have created 18 television spots to remind children that their beloved rangers 
are fantasy, Stagg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We reiterate to kids that what they see on TV is a carefully choreographed, 
staged performance done by experts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicki Hannigan of Ventura doesn't have to be convinced. Leaving Toys R Us, her 
arms were overloaded with 11 Evil Space Alien figures, nemeses of the 
super-hero Power Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Her three boys watch the show and are no worse for it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids don't have injuries, and they don't inflict injuries," she said. 
"They kick the air, not other people."

 Status of Council Aides Is Changed 
</P>
<P>
 Issue: City council aides 
</P>
<P>
 Background: In September, 1984, the City Council approved a program giving 
aides the status of independent contractors in order to give council members 
more flexibility in hiring and assigning their work. Council aides work an 
average 21 hours per week and are paid $15.20 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Development: In order to comply with new Internal Revenue Service guidelines, 
the council recently approved a resolution changing the status of aides from 
contract employees to temporary part-time employees. That change will require 
the city to contribute to Medicare and the Public Agency Retirement System for 
these newly classified employees.

 Issue: Affordable housing for seniors 
</P>
<P>
 Background: In 1991, the Redevelopment Agency purchased a 1.75-acre lot on 
13th and Monroe streets as a potential site for a housing project for low- and 
middle-income seniors. In September, 1993, city officials broke ground for the 
Rose Gardens, a 132-unit complex that is expected to be completed in early 
1995. Total construction cost is estimated at $8.6 million. Once completed, the 
complex will be managed by Elderly Development Westminster and will offer 
one-bedroom apartments, ranging in size from 481 to 512 square feet. Rents 
range from $375 to $575 a month. Each unit will include living and dining 
areas, kitchen, bathroom and bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Development: More than 300 prospective tenants so far have submitted 
applications, and Elderly Development Westminster has begun interviews. A task 
force has been created to consider such issues as maintenance, security, 
emergency assistance, eligibility, deposits and pets. Tenants are expected to 
start arriving in January, officials said.

 Ballet Prodigy Needs Aid for Bolshoi Study 
</P>
<P>
 Issue: Teen-age ballet dancer Ryan Turley's planned trip to study with the 
Bolshoi Ballet 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Turley, 15, is one of the best young ballet dancers in the 
country. He currently is studying at the San Francisco Ballet School. He has 
been invited by the prestigious Bolshoi Ballet to travel to Russia in February 
and train with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Development: Turley's journey may have to be put on hold because his family 
has had trouble finding the money to finance the trip. His family plans to hold 
fund-raisers to collect money to help Ryan, who has dreamed about dancing with 
the Bolshoi since he began lessons at San Clemente's Coast Ballet Academy 
nearly four years ago. He has participated in Bolshoi Ballet training camps in 
Colorado in past summers.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MEDFLY-AREA LEMONS ARE SWEETENED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the gross-out factor doesn't turn them away, perhaps local pride will reel 
them in. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the marketing scheme Moorpark rancher Mike Bailey has dreamed up as he 
prepares to launch an unusual new product: Ground Zero Lemonade. 
</P>
<P>
 As the yellow-and-orange label boldly proclaims, this lemonade came from 
Ventura County's "No Fly Zone" -- the 86-square-mile pocket placed under 
quarantine this fall in an attempt to contain the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
 The thought of drinking juice squeezed from lemons grown in a bug-infested 
area might churn a few stomachs. And even seasoned lemonade drinkers might grow 
squeamish when they glimpse the small plastic fly glued to the neck of every 
16-ounce bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bailey is counting on old-fashioned local boosterism -- plus the lure of 
the gimmick -- to win over customers. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes shoppers will jump to buy "home-grown lemonade that's 
pro-agriculture and pro-grower."  
</P>
<P>
 Made from frozen concentrate, Ground Zero Lemonade should hit local farm 
stands and independent grocery stores early next year, priced at about $1 a 
bottle. Bailey has pledged to donate at least 5% of his profit to the county's 
Fruit Fly Action Cooperative Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, none of Ground Zero's lemons were actually grown inside the 
bug-infested area, which is largely confined to a small grove on the campus of 
St. John's Seminary in Camarillo. Instead, the lemons come from the 
wide-ranging quarantine zone, including Bailey's ranch -- where no Medflies 
have been discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemons within the quarantine zone can be sold domestically but cannot be 
exported to Japan. Bailey anticipates that the ban on overseas sales will "put 
a dent" in his profits this winter and spring, but he cannot estimate how much 
he might lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to make it up somehow -- maybe with the lemonade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A true Ventura County product, Ground Zero is bottled by Chase Bros. Dairy in 
Oxnard, and the flies are glued on by ARC Industries in Camarillo. Bailey, who 
works as an advertising designer as well as a rancher, drew up the labels. 
</P>
<P>
 And he made sure every one of the bottles carries his motto: "When life hands 
you a lemon, make lemonade." STEPHANIE SIMON

<P>
 In Santa Ana, before shopping malls and tract homes, the place to shop was 
Main Street, which in the 1940s, '50s and '60s was lined with grand department 
stores and elegant shops. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the grandest stores was the Buffums on Main and 9th streets.The store 
featured an imposing rock facade framed by large palm trees. It was home to the 
famous Yorba Room restaurant, which was decorated in Early California style. On 
noon each Thursday, models wearing the latest fashions strutted around the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 That Buffums closed in 1987. The building is now occupied by the Orange County 
Department of Probation. Today 
</P>
<P>
 This is the final day of the weeklong Newport Harbor Christmas Boat Parade. 
The 86th annual event, which runs from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m., features about 200 
decorated boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewing is available at many locations in the harbor, including restaurants. 
Grandstand seating is provided by the Newport Harbor Jaycees for a fee of $5 to 
$7. The fee includes shuttle transportation from the Newport Dunes Resort at 
1131 Backbay Drive in Newport Beach.

MIKE PENNER: RAM FANS KEPT THE FAITH WHILE TEAM LOST IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Penner 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a tradition in our household, as much a part of the holiday season as 
those frothy goblets of eggnog, which, looking back, should have been spiked 
but never were. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, it would happen on a Sunday in late December. My father, my younger 
brother and I would gather 'round the hearth, say a silent prayer and flick on 
the television set, where we would spend the next three hours flinching every 
time Roger Staubach or Fran Tarkenton dropped back to pass with the Rams' 
playoff lives -- and ours -- on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 And when our suffering was through, and the Rams had been eliminated on a 
blocked field goal or a bogus offsides penalty or a head-on collision between 
two Ram defensive backs chasing a sure interception, my father would turn off 
the TV and the three of us sit there, blinking at the blank screen, trying to 
wait out the intense stomach pain. 
</P>
<P>
 After a minute or so, my father would suddenly lean forward, spring out of his 
chair and head for the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, he would be back with his legal yellow tablet, on which he had scribbled 
-- in pencil, of course, allowing for personnel moves -- the Rams' roster and 
depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK now," my father would brightly announce as he pored over the pages. "We 
need a linebacker. There are supposed to be some good ones in the draft this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Winter after winter, our football seasons ended this way. Loss, denial, 
acceptance, start planning for training camp -- all before sundown, too, until 
my brother and I hit our late teens and figured out there were better things to 
break your heart over, like women, or presidential candidates, or rock bands 
that were going to save the world and instead wound up selling light beer. 
</P>
<P>
 But my father, gifted with the inner resiliency of a Zen priest, has stayed 
the course, through 25 years of thin and thin, all the way up to the apparent 
bitter end -- Christmas Eve, 1994, with the moving vans' engines idling off in 
the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 I mention this because John Shaw and Georgia Frontiere would have you believe 
that such a condition is humanly impossible; that there is no such thing as a 
loyal Ram fan; that the Southern California sporting scene is all played out 
and the Rams have no choice but to move on to Shangri-La -- which, oddly 
enough, used to be known as St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw and Frontiere have never mingled with the people -- the crux of the 
problem, in a nutshell -- and therefore wouldn't know that once upon a time, 
there were many households like ours. Maybe not quite as obsessive, but devoted 
enough to have their holidays ruined every year without fail and keep coming 
back for more. 
</P>
<P>
 Ours was an allegiance forged on abandonment and betrayal, and if we had been 
smart, we'd have walked away that very first day. But I was 12 in 1969 and my 
father had never been to a professional football game and there we were, 
standing outside a sold-out Coliseum, hoping to see the Rams play the Packers, 
searching for the friendly people always there selling spare tickets for 
reasonable prices, as a neighbor had told us. 
</P>
<P>
 We found no sellers -- back then, Ram fans clung to their tickets -- so my 
father bought me a program and I rode home, crushed, staring at black-and-white 
mug shots of Roman Gabriel and Les Josephson. 
</P>
<P>
 My father promised to make it up to me, and he bought advance tickets for the 
Dallas game. Opening kickoff, long Ram runback, and a rookie named Rich Saul 
hits a Dallas cover man so hard, he nearly somersaults in midair. 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, when I have asked my dad what first hooked him, and, more 
curiously, what has sustained him, he mentions that play. "That impressed me," 
he says, and he has spent the last quarter-century waiting for another hit to 
match it. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that moment, my father has either watched on television, attended or 
listened on radio to every game the Rams have played. That's an awful lot of 
heartache, and what does he have to show for it? 
</P>
<P>
 Sore abdominal muscles from "watching the Rams on TV and pressing on the arm 
rests all game, pushing for an extra yard." 
</P>
<P>
 A collection of daily sports sections from the 1978 season, because that was 
the year my dad was convinced the Rams were going all the way, and the 
collection ends with an account of the Rams' 28-0 loss at home to Dallas in the 
NFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ram helmet, a jersey once worn by Doug France, two footballs autographed by 
the '86 and '87 teams, this year's depth chart and a yellowing stack of 
RamPages, the Ram fanzine that went belly-up this year when rumors of the move 
to St. Louis scared off advertisers in droves. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, he also has a copy of "Hard Knox." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are no golden Super Bowl moments, no championship season video. And, 
quite possibly, after Saturday, no home team. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked my father this week if he planned to go to the last game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about it," he said, "but it's Christmas Eve and I didn't like the 
New Orleans game. I went to it and it made me sick. They used to be so much fun 
to watch. They don't look like they're playing with any emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably watch the Raiders game and listen to the Rams on the radio." 
</P>
<P>
 And after that? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll still follow them, even if they're in St. Louis," he said. "I'll keep my 
subscription to Pro Football Weekly and watch them when I can. I'll never root 
for the Raiders or the 49ers, though, because I hate them too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday will be a sad day, but it isn't like he hasn't been prepared for it. 
"The last five years, it's been very difficult to be a Ram fan," he says. The 
last five years, there have been far too many sad days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Georgia and John Shaw don't care about football, not the way a real 
fan does. Once the Super Bowl's over, I start getting ready for the exhibition 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, those exhibition games will probably be held in Missouri. And all 
Anaheim will be left with is a headstone that reads "Los Angeles Rams, 
1946-1994, Done In By Fan Indifference." 
</P>
<P>
 The worst casualty will be the truth.

GROUP VOWS TO ESCALATE FIGHT FOR RAMS; PRO FOOTBALL: SAVE THE RAMS, SAYING TEAM 
NEVER NEGOTIATED IN GOOD FAITH, WILL TAKE CASE TO NFL AND TO COURT IF DECISION 
TO MOVE IS MADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As they say in a hockey brawl, there go the gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 They came flying off the hands of Save the Rams task force members, who 
Thursday abandoned their six-month course of diplomacy toward the NFL team 
they're trying to keep in Orange County and instead declared war. 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams called a news conference to say it's convinced the Rams will 
strike a deal to move to St. Louis "within 10 days," according to agent Leigh 
Steinberg, co-chairman of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members, who spent months trying to sell the Rams on a proposal that 
includes a new or renovated stadium, season-ticket and luxury suite guarantees 
and an offer to purchase a share of the team, also said they'll launch a 
lobbying assault on NFL owners in an attempt to secure the eight votes required 
to block a move. 
</P>
<P>
 But a good portion of the 1 1/2-hour gathering outside Anaheim Stadium was 
spent criticizing the team for a failure to negotiate in good faith, 
questioning its commitment to Southern California fans and accusing Ram 
President John Shaw of ignoring efforts to keep the team in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Bryant, president of the Rams booster club, fired the first salvo when 
he revealed an excerpt from a two-hour meeting with Ram owner Georgia Frontiere 
and Shaw on Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we talked to Mrs. Frontiere about our proposal and mentioned guarantees, 
she expressed a great deal of surprise, turned to Shaw and said, 'John, you 
mean there are guarantees in this proposal?' " Bryant said. "It was as if she'd 
never heard of them before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then when I told her the proposal included an offer to purchase a minority 
share of the team, she again expressed surprise and asked John the same 
question, because she was not aware someone in Orange County wanted to buy a 
share of the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Has Shaw withheld information about the local offer in an attempt to undermine 
Save the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, but it's certainly not helping us," Bryant said. "I don't know 
if you can categorize it as undermining. I would categorize it as selective 
information giving." 
</P>
<P>
 Several attempts to reach Shaw Thursday were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Next on the firing range was Save the Rams co-chairman Jack Lindquist, a 
jovial sort who spent 40 years in management at Disneyland, a.k.a. the Happiest 
Place on Earth. But Thursday, it was No More Mr. Nice Guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American public demands value for money paid, and one of the problems is 
they have not received that from the Rams," Lindquist said. "With their 
attitude and the way they've operated here, the Rams aren't going to be 
successful in Anaheim, St. Louis or anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this franchise needs is a local infusion of ownership, because going to 
a Ram game has to be an event, a happening, not only with the product on the 
field but with an attitude in the marketplace. The Rams have done nothing to 
generate fan support here . . . and over a period of years, they've appeared to 
go out of their way to destroy whatever fan support that existed." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg, whose Newport Beach firm represents 19 NFL quarterbacks, has been 
careful not to publicly criticize Frontiere or Shaw during the past six months, 
but he could no longer hide the frustration of being stonewalled in his 
attempts to deal with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've told the Rams for months that we have investor groups ready to go, 
willing to meet with them, and their response has been negative," said 
Steinberg, who declined to name the individuals or corporations interested in 
investing in the team or a stadium project. "There has been no negotiation with 
the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 So Save the Rams will take it to the other 29 NFL owners and Commissioner Paul 
Tagliabue during Phase 2 -- Eight Votes or Bust might be a better title -- of 
the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is abundantly clear that it is not in the best interest of the NFL to 
allow the Rams to leave Southern California," Steinberg said. "We're going to 
forcefully bring that message to the commissioner, and we will strenuously 
lobby this issue with the owners." 
</P>
<P>
 They hope to back the message with the political clout of Gov. Pete Wilson and 
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, California's U.S. senators. And Peter 
Ueberroth, former baseball commissioner, might be enlisted to convince owners 
that this area can support the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 If they are to move to St. Louis, the Rams must submit a proposal for transfer 
to the league 30 days before the March 12-17 NFL meetings in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 They essentially must prove that they can't survive in Anaheim and that the 
deal in St. Louis, which includes virtually all revenue from a new 70,000-seat 
domed stadium, is far superior than the Orange County offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who close their 49th season in Southern California on Saturday 
against the Washington Redskins, will need approval from three-fourths of 
owners (23 of 30) at the league meeting to move. Save the Rams will need eight 
votes to block them. 
</P>
<P>
 If owners don't approve, the Rams would have to file an antitrust suit against 
the NFL, as the Raiders did before moving from Oakland to Los Angeles in 1982, 
to play next season in St. Louis, which lost the Cardinals to Phoenix in 1988 
and failed in a 1993 bid to land an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can get eight votes, and what could stop the Rams is Mrs. Frontiere's lack 
of desire to go through litigation," Steinberg said. Save the Rams will likely 
have at least one vote. In a recent confidential Times survey, in which NFL 
owners were asked whether they'd approve a Ram move to St. Louis, one of the 14 
respondents said he would not approve. Three said they would approve the move, 
and 10 were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the league wants to continue to have representation in Los Angeles, 
but I don't have a feel for how the league will vote," Kansas City Chief owner 
Lamar Hunt said. "I personally favor stability in franchise location, but I 
don't know enough about the facts of this case right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams is also considering legal action and has been discussing an 
eminent domain suit, in which it would attempt to declare the Rams a county 
asset, condemn the team and make Frontiere sell it. 
</P>
<P>
 Precedence wouldn't favor Orange County, though. In Oakland's suit involving 
the Raiders, the California Supreme Court ruled that cities can't use eminent 
domain to condemn a sports franchise because it would violate the U.S. 
Constitution's dormant commerce clause, which states that states can't 
interfere with interstate commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "That suit, I think, is a dead loser," said Gary Roberts, vice dean of the 
Tulane Law School who represented the NFL in the Raiders' antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts said Save the Rams might have a little more luck with an antitrust 
suit, but only because antitrust laws pertaining to professional sports leagues 
are so numerous and confusing that a jury or a judge -- especially in Orange 
County -- might find merit in such a suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense is that any suit they might bring to keep the Rams, if the team is 
determined to go, is probably grasping at straws," Roberts said. "But if you 
can get a local court that is highly political, and a judge who will do 
anything to keep the Rams, they have a tremendous amount of control over how 
these things play out." 
</P>
<P>
 But the bottom line is if the Rams are willing to go to any lengths to move, 
the NFL will have trouble stopping them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no rules in the NFL when teams want to do something," said Joseph 
Alioto, the former San Francisco mayor who represented the Raiders in their NFL 
suit. "And I would think the NFL would not oppose a move to St. Louis, because 
there's no team there and they were one of the finalists for an expansion 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 If the NFL blocks the move, Alioto said, "All Georgia would have to do is file 
suit the way the Raiders did, and they'll win it. I think she could get a fast 
preliminary injunction, and it wouldn't be a long, drawn-out ordeal." 
</P>
<P>
 But Steinberg believes the Rams would comply with a losing vote and stay in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way we'll make this work is presenting the league with our offer, 
which is very good," Steinberg said. "An announcement (to move) will come soon, 
but we'll keep fighting in every possible way, and we will keep this team in 
Southern California." 
</P>
<P>

reasons. The commissioner may also convene a special committee to perform 
fact-finding or other functions, 
</P>
<P>
 * Following the commissioner's report, it will be presented to owners for 
action, either at a special meeting or the annual meeting. Three-fourths of the

financial support by means of any publicly financed playing facility, special 
tax treatment and any other form of public financial support. 
</P>
<P>
 * The degree to which the ownership or management of the team has contributed 
to any circumstance which might otherwise demonstrate the need for such 
relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whether the team has incurred net operating losses, exclusive of 
depreciation and amortization, sufficient to threaten the continued financial 
viability of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 * The degree to which the team has engaged in good faith negotiations with 
appropriate persons concerning terms and conditions under which the team would 
continue to play its games in such community. 
</P>
<P>

the team is currently located. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whether the team proposes to relocate to a community in which no other team 
is located. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whether the stadium authority, if public, is not opposed to such relocation.

BASEBALL OWNERS PULL PLUG ON TALKS; LABOR: THEIR EXECUTIVE COUNCIL IMPLEMENTS 
PAYROLL LIMITS AND GETS RID OF ARBITRATION. PLAYERS WILL APPEAL TO NLRB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reprieve, and the posturing, ended Thursday night when baseball's owners 
and players failed to reach a bargaining settlement before the midnight 
deadline established by the owners last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The governing executive council, conferring by phone and exercising the 
authority the owners had approved in that Chicago meeting, responded to the 
breakdown in negotiations by declaring an impasse in the four-month-old dispute 
and unilaterally implementing an economic system that will place a cap on 
payrolls and eliminate salary arbitration.  
</P>
<P>
 A system that the union contends will transfer millions of dollars to owners 
and destroy free agency becomes effective today. 
</P>
<P>
 It is certain to ignite a bitter legal battle and jeopardize the 1995 season, 
when the owners will attempt to use replacement players and the union will 
resume a strike that began Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "The owners will come to regret this -- sooner than they realize," union 
leader Donald Fehr said by phone from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would ask agents and players to hold off the signing of new 
contracts until the implemented system can be fully reviewed and predicted that 
the union will pursue all options. 
</P>
<P>
 First and foremost: The union will seek injunctive relief through the National 
Labor Relations Board, charging the owners with an illegal impasse and having 
failed to bargain in good faith, a charge the NLRB has already accused the 
owners of in relation to the $7.8-million pension payment that was withheld 
from the union in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it takes the courts or Congress to help achieve a settlement the players 
can live with, that's fine," Fehr said. "If the players have to win it by 
outlasting the owners, they'll do that too." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr also said he was "profoundly disappointed" the negotiations failed but 
was not surprised or dismayed. He said implementation was "preordained" and 
that the union was working against a "moving target" with every proposal and 
concept measured against the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up until tonight I thought we were negotiating a tax plan, but tonight they 
told us that the tax plan we proposed didn't measure up to the cap. This has 
always been about the cap," Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 In what had seemed to become strictly a showcase attempt by both sides to 
establish a legal case for good-faith bargaining, the implementation delay by 
the owners produced little of substance until Thursday, when the players, for 
the first time, made a two-tiered, escalating tax proposal designed, they 
contended, to apply the drag on salaries and overall cost control the owners 
had been seeking through the cap or their own high-rate tax proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners' negotiating committee studied it for six hours before rejecting 
it, describing it in a statement as an "empty bag." 
</P>
<P>
 Said acting Commissioner Bud Selig, reached by phone in Milwaukee: "I can't 
tell you how disappointed we all are in their alleged counterproposal. It was 
so unresponsive that it is like we were back in June or July." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig said it was never the goal to implement because implementation is "not a 
panacea or long-term solution to the industry's problems, but we couldn't stay 
with the status quo. We had been doing that for too many years, ignoring our 
problems. We had twice delayed implementation. We couldn't do it again. We had 
to move on and prepare for next season." 
</P>
<P>
 Special mediator William J. Usery concurred to an extent, saying it was clear 
"tonight that there was no use going any further for the time being." 
</P>
<P>
 The new system will have an immediate impact in that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Contracts for 1995 must be tendered today. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There will be a scale of minimum salaries: $115,000 for a rookie, $175,000 
for a player with one year of service, $275,000 for two years, and $500,000 or 
$750,000 for three years depending on statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sixty-three players with four or five years of service will become 
restricted free agents. Included in this group are Ramon Martinez, Jack 
McDowell, Jim Abbott and Steve Avery. A parent club wishing to retain rights to 
a four- or five-year free agent must tender a minimum 10% raise. If the player 
receives an offer from another club, the parent club has 10 days to match it. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid a flooded market (six-year players remain unrestricted free agents), the 
union contends there will be few offers and very little movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clubs aren't going to commit to multiyear guarantees under the cap," union 
lawyer Lauren Rich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the cap, clubs will have four years to take incremental steps 
of 25% per year and ultimately bring their payrolls within 84% to 110% of the 
1994 average of about $34.8 million, a figure exceeded by 16 of the 28 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The revenue sharing link, which also escalates in incremental steps, provides 
for 11 smaller-revenue clubs to receive about $23 million in 1995 and $58 
million in 1998. The Angels, whose small-revenue status under the plan has been 
a subject of frequent and angry debate in owner meetings, will receive $1.3 
million in '95 and $3.3 million in '98. The Dodgers will contribute $1.8 
million to the pool in '95 and $4.2 million in '98. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger owner Peter O'Malley said he doesn't completely support the system 
because of the absence of a provision insuring good management among the clubs 
on the receiving end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't like the idea of sharing money with clubs like San Diego and 
Milwaukee, where there has been no evidence of good management," O'Malley said, 
adding Selig's Brewers to a list he had publicly reserved for the Padres of Tom 
Werner, whose sale of the club became official Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from those high-profile provisions of the owners' new system, there are 
many other turn-back-the-clock items. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Elimination of the maximum 20% pay cut, meaning salaries in non-guaranteed 
contracts can be reduced any amount from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Players called up in September when rosters are expanded will not be 
credited with service time accruing to eligibility for free agency, pensions, 
etc., and players on the disabled list will be credited with only 50% service 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Clubs can terminate and release a player at any time without reason. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, mediator Usery said he will report to Labor Secretary Robert 
Reich today and may have more to say about his plans after that. On Thursday, 
former President Jimmy Carter released a statement through the Carter Center in 
Atlanta saying he would be willing to mediate the baseball dispute if there was 
no settlement before the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no official response from the players or owners, but Usery said, 
"The one thing I didn't think we needed at the moment was another mediator." 
</P>
<P>
 Where this ends isn't clear, but the owners face a high risk. Congress could 
remove their antitrust exemption and the NLRB could ultimately levy a 
multimillion-dollar judgment, maybe more. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Eugene Orza, union associate general counsel: "No other industry in the 
country could implement a salary cap or a similar restriction on trade because 
they are all governed by antitrust laws. Baseball could do it because of the 
exemption. The owners had a vested interest in creating an artificial impasse." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Strike Facts WHAT HAPPENED 
</P>
<P>
 -- Owners declared an impasse in contract negotiations with the players' union 
and voted to impose a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 THE NEW SYSTEM 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sets 1995 salary cap of about $34 million, to be phased in over a four-year 
period, requiring 21 of 28 teams to reduce payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Limits players to receiving 50% of industry revenues in compensation (down 
from 58%, according to owner estimates). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eliminates arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In lieu of arbitration, players become restricted free agents after four 
seasons of major league service time. Teams would have 10 days to match any 
offer. Players become unrestricted free agents after six years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT'S NEXT 
</P>
<P>
 -- Teams are expected to offer contracts under the new system to all unsigned 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The union is expected to file unfair labor practice charges with the 
National Labor Relations Board, touching off long and costly hearings. If the 
NLRB files a complaint against owners, the agency would seek a federal 
injunction. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Congress may elect to re-examine baseball's antitrust exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 THE 1995 SEASON 
</P>
<P>
 -- The owners have said they plan to open spring training camps on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The players will be: any major leaguers who choose to ignore the strike and 
are willing to accept the new management system; and replacement players. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ontario provincial law prohibits the use of replacement players, meaning 
the Toronto Blue Jays would have to play all their games on the road unless all 
their players report.

COLORADO VOTES TO STAY IN BIG 12; COLLEGES: PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE IS REBUFFED 
IN ATTEMPT TO EXPAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pacific 10 Conference's hopes of expanding to the Rocky Mountains ended 
quickly Thursday when the University of Colorado rejected an invitation to join 
the league.  
</P>
<P>
 Colorado's Board of Regents declined the offer with a 6-3 vote during an 
emergency meeting in Boulder, citing a commitment to the newly formed Big 12 
Conference. Big Eight schools including Colorado agreed last February to form 
the superconference with four Texas refugees of the Southwest Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado's retired chancellor, Jim Corbridge, and Athletic Director Bill 
Marolt were instrumental in securing an agreement between the Big Eight and 
Baylor, Texas, Texas A&M and Texas Tech. Competition is scheduled to begin in 
the 1996-97 academic year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be pretty unfair to change our minds at this hour," said Norwood 
Robb, a Colorado regent. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent invitation was extended to Colorado after presidents and 
chancellors of Pac-10 schools decided expansion was necessary to remain 
competitive on the ever-changing college sports landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pac-10's intervention at this late stage, I think, raises some ethical 
questions," Nebraska Chancellor Graham Spanier told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Hansen, Pac-10 commissioner, said Colorado's rejection will not affect the 
conference but does limit future expansion. Not only does the Pac-10 want 
schools with strong overall athletic programs but it requires high academic 
standards, which made the Buffaloes attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Martin, a Colorado regent who supports switching to the Pac-10, blamed 
Thursday's outcome on the conference leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish Mr. Hansen had had the vision to consummate his offer a year 
ago," Martin said. "One cannot sit around idle, particularly in a society like 
ours that is ever-changing. 
</P>
<P>
 "His lack of aggressiveness as well as sense of where he wanted to go in the 
'93-'94 time frame put us in the position where we are right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Other regents agreed that had the Pac-10 moved a year ago, Colorado might have 
switched. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a case of timing," Martin said. "We have much in common not only with 
the California schools, but with Oregon, Washington and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then (the Pac-10) presented us with an offer less than two weeks before the 
Christmas holiday. That further demonstrated a lack of timing and vision." 
</P>
<P>
 The regents did not want to upset fellow Big 12 schools by leaving them after 
playing an important role in negotiating a five-year, $100-million contract 
with ABC and Prime Sports Network to televise the league's football and 
basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Pac-10 offered a slightly better financial package, regents said 
they had a moral and ethical commitment to stay with the Big 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Marolt was relieved to get a quick decision, as the regents voted on the 
matter two days after the invitation was disclosed. He also was glad they 
supported his efforts as one of the architects of the Big 12.

LIFE'S A KICK ; VIKING KICKER FUAD REVEIZ OF COLOMBIA HAS NOTHING BUT PRAISE 
FOR ADOPTED HOMELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fuad Reveiz still hears the guy in the front row. 
</P>
<P>
 "The . . . is getting ready to kick," the guy yells, using a racial slur. 
</P>
<P>
 Reveiz still hears his Minnesota Viking teammates from the back of the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Check the Colombian's luggage," they shout with glee. 
</P>
<P>
 Reveiz, the leading scorer in America's favorite game, will repay America for 
its transgressions this Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 His family of five will load food and gifts into the car and visit a teen-age 
mother and an infant daughter who have just been thrown out of their house. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they will stop at the home of three boys and a mother who cannot pay 
their phone bill. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of days later, Reveiz will buy tickets for three dozen kids and 
escort them around the Metrodome field before the Vikings' season finale 
against the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuad Reveiz will not curse America. He will praise America. Just as he has 
praised it every day since arriving in Miami from Bogota 20 years ago when he 
was 11. 
</P>
<P>
 He will trust that one day, the ignorance will end. A kicker with a current 
streak of 26 consecutive field goals will be known by all as simply a guy with 
a good leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, he will show that being a true American has nothing to do with the 
color of your skin, your country of origin or the lilt of your voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people coming to this country, we get misguided," he said. "We get 
sold the idea that America owes us something." 
</P>
<P>
 He paused. "It is the other way around. This country opened its arms for me. 
It is my responsibility to make it better. There is nothing that is owed. There 
is much I need to repay." 
</P>
<P>
 As Fuad Reveiz's accomplishments are celebrated during the end of this NFL 
regular season and the playoffs, he stands as proof that not everyone plays 
professional football in hopes of smashing someone. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, as strange as it may seem, a guy plays in hopes of thanking 
someone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During Reveiz's current streak of 26 consecutive field goals -- three short of 
the league record -- he is approaching another mark of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Most consecutive field goals without raising an eyebrow. 
</P>
<P>
 His purple uniform not only engulfs his chunky 5-foot-11 frame, it also 
swallows his smile. 
</P>
<P>
 His expression -- which is no expression -- does not change until he is back 
in his wool slacks and sport coat, preparing to meet his family or his son's 
soccer team or the numerous fans who have caught the hint that Reveiz is the 
most approachable pro athlete on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 Only then can you see the brightness in the eyes of an immigrant who 
understands what is important. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not those 26 field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father and mother brought us to this country with only a couple of 
suitcases -- my father drove a forklift and now he owns his own business," he 
said. "Building yourself up from nothing, building a family, that is real life. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I do on the field, it is only a game." 
</P>
<P>
 After struggling through a solid but unspectacular career, Reveiz was reminded 
of that this summer during the World Cup soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning while working in the Orlando venue for the Spanish-language 
network Univision, he was shocked by what he heard on his car radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Andres Escobar of the Colombia soccer team had been murdered by countrymen 
because he had accidentally scored a goal for the United States in Colombia's 
2-1 loss two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Reveiz thought, "That could have been me." 
</P>
<P>
 He had grown up kicking a ragball on the streets of Bogota. His leg was so 
strong he had kicked a 60-yard field goal at a Miami high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer was the only thing I knew," he said. "If I stayed in Colombia, that is 
the only thing I play." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he thought he would never again worry about a silly blocked kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I immediately prayed for that guy's family," he said. "I felt such pity for 
all those people down there who are facing such pressure. And I remembered the 
bottom line. What I do is just a game. That took a lot of the pressure off me." 
</P>
<P>
 It has showed. With one game remaining during a season in which field-goal 
kickers were supposed to become irrelevant: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He has a league-leading 125 points, three field goals more than his 
previous career high. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He hasn't missed a kick in the last two months, and has made 32 of 37 
attempts overall. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He has missed only three field-goal attempts of 40 yards or shorter in the 
last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He has beaten the Green Bay Packers with game-tying and overtime field 
goals. He has won two other games, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Buffalo 
Bills, with five field goals in each. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fuad has been in a zone," said Gary Zauner, Viking special teams coach. "It's 
like every situation has been the right situation for him. Every kick, the 
right kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not one thing bothers him or seems to worry him. He's like a great surgeon. 
No emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 Reveiz saves that for stories about arriving in this country and seeing, for 
the first time, Coca-Cola in cans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like, 'Wow! How could this be?' " Reveiz recalled. "Everything was so 
big, so different." 
</P>
<P>
 And so out of reach. For his first five years, while his father was working 
toward owning a freight business and the family lived in tiny apartments and 
rented homes, Reveiz and his two brothers shared a room. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the registration fee for his first soccer league was put up by a 
coach. Fuad was never certain that his family owned more than those suitcases. 
</P>
<P>
 But he saw enough to make him want to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this country, everybody has a chance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 22, in a ceremony that was filmed for a United Way commercial, he became a 
U.S. citizen. He was a lowly rookie for the Miami Dolphins, but even Coach Don 
Shula publicly congratulated him. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that being an immigrant ever became easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the jokes about foreign-born kickers, Reveiz has had increasingly 
fewer compatriots. Today, he says, the only opposing coach or player he can 
address in Spanish after games is the Rams' Tony Zendejas. 
</P>
<P>
 Several NFL players and coaches have Latin American roots, like punter Rich 
Camarillo, but they no longer speak the language well. 
</P>
<P>
 "There used to be a little club of guys like Raul Allegre, Efren Herrerra, Max 
Zendejas, Fuad . . . " said Samm Pena, producer of "Super Show Deportiva," a 
new Spanish-language NFL news show. "If anybody understood each other, it was 
those guys. But now almost all of them are out of the league except Fuad. 
That's got to be a little hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Reveiz became even more isolated by signing with Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tripled the Hispanic population," he says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Reveiz has found comfort in visiting classrooms like those at the Adams 
Spanish Immersion School in St. Paul, where the children are taught in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have any idea who he was, but after he was here a few minutes, he 
and my third-graders couldn't stop talking," said Concha Fernandez del Rey, a 
teacher from Spain. "You say he's doing good this year? I would imagine. People 
who put their heart into what they do are good at anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The cultures mix when Reveiz spends time at a police substation in nearby 
Brooklyn Center, a storefront that provides local children with a safe haven in 
the middle of a crime-ridden area. He recently bought a big-screen TV for the 
station so his young fans can watch him kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other day he was here speaking Spanish to these two little girls who were 
really excited that they could understand him," said Sgt. Frank Roth of the 
Brooklyn Center force. "We've dealt with the athletes from all the pro teams 
here, and none is more genuine. Most of the guys won't show up unless they hear 
a little ka-ching . Fuad comes for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Leave it to the little guy from Colombia to lecture his fellow pros on 
American ideals. 
</P>
<P>
 "These days, everybody is saying that pro athletes should not be role models," 
Reveiz said. "I'm saying, that is absolutely wrong. Sure, your role models 
should be your mom and dad, but kids today react to so many other things. One 
of those things is us." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a reason Reveiz behaves so calmly on the field. He knows who is 
watching. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, kids think it is cool to taunt your opponent, to insult him, to even 
insult your coaches," Reveiz said. "I am saying, that is not cool. That is not 
how it works. That is not how you build a life for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 What is cool is marble cake. The children at the Brooklyn Center substation 
baked one for him the other day. "Congratulations Fuad, You're Our Pro Bowler," 
read the script on the icing. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day it was announced that he had made the real Pro Bowl. But he 
couldn't stop talking about that cake.

MIKE DOWNEY: LEWIS WAS ALWAYS A RAIDER AT HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As he raises Arabian horses on his spread in Missouri, at times Albert Lewis 
cannot help but be curious where life's path will take him next. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, back when the Raider cornerback was in school, his major was 
political science. So perhaps, like freshman congressman Steve Largent of 
Oklahoma, a man Lewis once chased all over a football field, running for public 
office should be his next step. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am," Lewis says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are?" 
</P>
<P>
 Absolutely, the 34-year-old veteran campaigner says with a straight face, as 
he prepares for Christmas Eve's reunion with his old playmates from Kansas 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite likely the most eloquent athlete on his team, if not his league, Lewis 
would make a splendid politician, and on this bright December day he hoists his 
palm like a Boy Scout taking an oath and hereby promises that he is being 
deadly serious, that he will, someday soon, be a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, but from which state?" a visitor asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ha! That's the catch," Lewis says, laughing. "I've lived in most of them." 
</P>
<P>
 They say Albert Lewis is the best interview on the Raiders, and they do not 
exaggerate. He has a facility for the English language right up there with the 
great sesquipedalian Todd Christensen, and would make a natural television 
sportscaster should those political ambitions be sheer folly. Or maybe he would 
serve mankind better raising horses, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 With a genuine interest in whichever subject is on the table and with none of 
that autospeak to which so many jocks are prone, Lewis slips easily into a 
discussion about what it took to assimilate (his word) everything he needed to 
cram into his skull upon becoming a Raider with everything he had already 
absorbed in 11 full seasons with the Chiefs. He concentrates on every question 
and avoids easy answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must sometimes still feel like a Chief at heart," the visitor presumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never a Chief at heart," is Lewis's unexpected response. 
</P>
<P>
 What with the Chiefs coming to town before Santa to attempt to bring the 
Raiders lumps of coal, it would be convenient for Lewis to simply recollect all 
the good times in Kansas City, the four consecutive Pro Bowl appearances, the 
11 blocked punts, those three interceptions in the 1991 season opener. A guy 
expresses astonishment that Chiefhood wouldn't be in his blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eleven years, Albert . . . ?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to be a Raider at heart, not a Chief," Lewis interrupts. 
"See, something I have come to accept in this business is that the logos 
change, the colors change, the scenery changes, but none of this, in and of 
itself, constitutes my being anything but a football player. All that any 
player can do is the very best job he knows how to do, for whichever football 
team employs him." 
</P>
<P>
 He was a Grambling Tiger who couldn't wait to come roaring out of college and 
into a new life. The great Willie Brown had dropped by his own alma mater to do 
some advance work for the Raiders, for whom he had excelled in the defensive 
backfield for a dozen seasons. He assured Lewis that when NFL draft day rolled 
around, the Raiders would ring his phone, and sure enough, they did. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis was ecstatic. As a young three-sport letterman in Mansfield, La., he had 
had no particular favorite team, in spite of friends trying continually to 
shove the Dallas Cowboys in his face. Then around came Willie Brown and that 
got Lewis to following the exploits of Lester Hayes and Mike Haynes and 
picturing himself alongside them in the Raider secondary, particularly when the 
third round began and they gave him a call. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just received word that the Raiders intended to take me with their very 
next pick," Lewis recalls, "when the phone rang. 
</P>
<P>
 "And somebody whispers, 'It's the Chiefs.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in shock." 
</P>
<P>
 He is still able to vividly flash back to that trip up north, which -- 
regardless of his fib about living in many states -- was one of the few times 
in young Albert's life that he had traveled beyond Louisiana's borders. That 
drive he made to begin his pro career with the Chiefs, it seems like yesterday, 
yet what Lewis remembers most is, "I had a car and one suit and that's it. And 
I stayed 11 years." 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of car?" he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a . . . no, maybe I shouldn't tell you," Lewis says. "Let's just say a 
lemon." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how well he comported himself with the Chiefs, the plain and 
undeniable truth is, Lewis projected himself as a Raider. From the sideline, 
before games, he says, Al Davis would tell him one minute how Cliff Branch 
would burn him and another minute how a guy as good as Lewis belonged with the 
Raiders, not with these guys wearing, ugh, red. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, those great Raider-Chief wars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the fights better than I do the games," Lewis says, 
lightheartedly. "I remember when Greg Townsend snatched Brad Budde's helmet 
right off." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, good fight," a man agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll say," Lewis says. "I thought it was Brad's head." 
</P>
<P>
 A black uniform with Lewis' name on it was waiting. He considers the Kansas 
City secondary he played for to be one of the greatest ever assembled, but the 
time had come to break up the act. Fleeing as a free agent, Lewis defected to 
the Chiefs' deadliest of enemies, where he would eventually be paired at 
cornerback with another Pro Bowl player from a town called Mansfield (in this 
case Ohio), the very able Terry McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
 But it took a while to become a pair. Lewis did not start for five weeks. He 
saw talent being wasted, not merely his own, and spoke up about it, using his 
status as a veteran to lecture teammates on being immature and unprepared. 
Lewis became the speaker of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Came the game at New England and finally Coach Art Shell juggled the lineup. 
The Raiders turned a corner that day and Lewis is not even half serious when he 
says, "Wasn't that the day I joined the lineup? No, really, I will tell you one 
thing that happened on that day. We became a team that day. For the first time 
all season, we felt that every single man had left everything he had out on 
that field. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing I have harped on since coming here is, you cannot beat 
yourself. It was always integral to Kansas City's game plan to make the other 
team beat itself. The Chiefs are a very disciplined organization and very well 
coached. We can defeat them, but only if every individual on this Raider team 
commits himself to the fullest extent." 
</P>
<P>
 And, being diplomatic, Lewis presumably will be sure to say hello to every 
Kansas City player before the game? 
</P>
<P>
 He takes this under consideration and says, "Only if they say hello first."

UMPIRES' UNION ADDS ITS COMPLAINT TO MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baseball's labor problems erupted on a second front Thursday when Richie 
Phillips, general counsel for the umpires' union, accused the American and 
National leagues of failing to bargain in good faith in a complaint filed with 
the National Labor Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said the leagues have notified the umpires, who are paid year-round, 
that they will be locked out and will stop receiving pay on Jan. 1.The umpires' 
four-year bargaining agreement expires Dec. 31, and Phillips said there has 
been no substantive response to a proposal that would increase salaries 60%, 
would double the postseason bonus pool -- each umpire currently receives a 
bonus of $10,000 to $20,000 -- and would increase their severance package from 
$200,000 to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips accused the leagues of anarchy and claimed that baseball 
representatives have said that it's easier to negotiate with people when "their 
pockets are empty." 
</P>
<P>
 National League President Leonard Coleman denied that and said, "We reviewed 
their proposals with disbelief, regarding them as extraordinary in their 
largess, given the realities of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Management lawyer Robert Kheel said a decision hasn't been made, but a lockout 
is an option. He said owners on Tuesday offered a no-lockout, no-strike pledge.

 Save the Rams task force members on Thursday abandoned their six-month course 
of diplomacy toward the NFL team they're trying to keep in Orange County and 
declared war. 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams called a news conference to say it's convinced the Rams will 
strike a deal to move to St. Louis "within 10 days," according to agent Leigh 
Steinberg, co-chairman of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members, said they'll launch a lobbying assault on NFL owners in an 
attempt to secure the eight votes required to block a move. 
</P>
<P>
 They also criticized the team for a failure to negotiate in good faith, 
questioned its commitment to Southern California fans and accused Ram President 
John Shaw of ignoring efforts to keep the team in Orange County. MIKE

NHL, PLAYERS APPEAR STALLED DURING HOLIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No talks were held Thursday in the NHL labor dispute, none are scheduled today 
and no business will be conducted over Christmas, pushing the earliest date for 
an end to the lockout past New Year's. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing that has occurred in the last couple of days that is 
encouraging at all," said Tom Reich, a player agent who has served as a 
go-between during the dispute. "Now, players are in a position where there has 
to be a deal without a (payroll) tax and owners are taking the position they 
have to have more (concessions)." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources on both sides said an agreement is still possible by Jan. 5 for a 
season opener on Jan. 15, but the schedule would be shorter than 50 games, as 
the league's Board of Governors mandated last week. Lawyers for each side were 
in contact Thursday but they were not expected to set up any meetings until 
after Christmas, and those sessions would probably involve small groups rather 
than the chief negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
 Only if players give ground on salary arbitration and free agency will the 
league eliminate its proposed payroll tax, management sources said. Players 
reaffirmed their opposition to the tax this week during a meeting in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 A possible solution that did not include a tax was floated last week during 
talks involving small delegations from each side. It was tied to players 
relinquishing salary arbitration rights almost totally and might require 
raising the age for unrestricted free agency to 31. Players have said they 
won't give up arbitration rights completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Two league sources said that as long as talks continue, even sporadically, 
Commissioner Gary Bettman will not exercise his power to cancel the season. But 
if there's no resolution by Jan. 11, the schedule will be cut to 44 or 40 games 
because of arena scheduling conflicts.

A RAINBOW DISCOVERED AT CANYON; BOYS' BASKETBALL: COWBOYS GET A CHANCE TO 
SCHEDULE A TUNEUP FOR THE PLAYOFFS AFTER THEIR GAME AGAINST A TEAM FROM HAWAII 
IS CANCELED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Canyon High boys' basketball Coach Greg Hayes may have lost an opportunity to 
play a game, but he hasn't lost his sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes attributes "a lack of communication" for a nonleague game against St. 
Louis High being canceled Wednesday when the team from Hawaii failed to show 
for a scheduled 7 p.m. start. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Canyon, we're used to having games canceled two ways," Hayes said. "When 
the roof in our gym leaks and earthquakes. This was easy." 
</P>
<P>
 The cancellation could turn out to be a blessing for the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 With an odd number of teams in the Foothill League, Canyon's regular season 
ends almost a week before the playoffs begin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section permits teams to play a maximum of 20 games -- 
tournaments count for two games -- exclusive of playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Cowboys will have the opportunity to schedule a nonleague game on the 
final week of the regular season in February.  
</P>
<P>
 "At the top of my Christmas list is someone for us to play after our regular 
season ends," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really want to head into the playoffs with a week between games." 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon thought a contract to play St. Louis had been secured last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We mailed them the paperwork and had everything set up," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, St. Louis ventured into Orange County and played El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hayes contacted an assistant coach at the team's hotel, the coach claimed 
a representative of the team had called Canyon and canceled the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, fans, officials and players waited at Canyon High for the Hawaiian 
team to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once it got to be 6:30, we'd watch someone come through the door and think, 
'Hey, they look Hawaiian,' " Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be amazed at how many Hawaiian-looking people live out here."

GIRLS' BASKETBALL / SIMI VALLEY TOURNAMENT; THORPE PUTS SIMI VALLEY TO SLEEP 
SEMIFINALS: NEWBURY PARK FORWARD WAKES UP WITH 10 POINTS IN FOURTH QUARTER AS 
PANTHERS RALLY FOR 59-46 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For the better part of three quarters Thursday night, Newbury Park High's Jann 
Thorpe was tougher to find than Waldo. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior forward was shut out, both in the scorebook and on the backboards, 
as her Panthers struggled to keep pace with Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorpe, however, scored 10 of her 14 points in the fourth quarter to lead 
Newbury Park to a 59-46 victory over the Pioneers in a semifinal of the Simi 
Valley tournament at Rancho Santa Susana Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory sets up a rematch of last season's championship game against 
Alemany, a 53-40 winner over Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 And Newbury Park wouldn't be there if it weren't for Thorpe and reserve Amy 
Berman. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley (10-3) entered the fourth quarter with a 36-34 lead before Berman 
(10 points) hit two three-point attempts and teammate Julie Wastell added 
another for a 43-36 Panther advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a team like Newbury, you have to keep up with them for four quarters," 
said Pioneer forward Tawnee Cooper (11 points). "Tonight, we only stayed with 
them for three."  
</P>
<P>
 Then the Panthers, ranked 10th in the state, took off on a 19-3 run to put 
away their ninth straight victory over their Marmonte League rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone had to wake our team up," said Thorpe, who had all four of her 
rebounds in the final eight minutes. "Amy did just that." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley guard Angela Mosesso had the same effect on her team a quarter 
earlier. She connected for three consecutive three-pointers to give the 
Pioneers a 36-32 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Mosesso had 12 points, while teammate Jamie Griffin added nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Wastell scored 14 points and Kara McKeown contributed 10 points and nine 
rebounds for Newbury Park (11-1). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany 54, Ventura 40 -- Carly Funicello scored 23 points for the Indians 
(7-0) in the other semifinal. Alemany will attempt to win its third consecutive 
Simi Valley tournament championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly McKay added 14 points for Alemany, while Ventura's Ember Brown scored 
13. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood 67, Kennedy 57 -- Anna Celaya had 28 points to become North 
Hollywood's career scoring leader in a fifth-place semifinal game.  
</P>
<P>
 Celaya, a senior guard, has 961 career points, surpassing the mark of 938 set 
by Jacinda Sweet from 1989-91. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbie Celaya added 13 points for the Huskies (4-2). Kennedy (8-5) was paced 
by Tamaya Morris, who scored 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade 48, Channel Islands 47 -- Nicole Rossi scored with 53 seconds left 
for Chaminade (7-4) in the fifth-place semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Rossi finished with 11 points, while teammate Shawnte Mitchell led all scorers 
with 21 points. Eleanor Ecoffey scored 16 points and Judy Tuimoloau added 14 
for Channel Islands (5-4). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bell-Jeff 53, Louisville 48 -- Stacy Cobb scored 16 points and Felicia Flores 
added 14 for the Guards (6-3) in a consolation semifinal. Becky Witt had 14 
points and six steals for Louisville (5-5). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hart 46, Pasadena 30 -- Jaclyn Kuptz scored 13 points and LaCresha Clark added 
12 to lead Hart in a consolation semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon 48, Royal 40 -- Laura Tweedy scored 15 points, while Tanya McLaughlin 
and Danya Driggs each added 11 for Canyon in the 13th-place game. Jessica Cruz 
scored 12 points for Royal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City 43, Burbank 41 -- Culver City outscored the Bulldogs, 15-9, in the 
fourth quarter to win the 15th-place game.

GEORGE SISTERS A MATCHED TRIO; CHATSWORTH MIDFIELDERS HAVE MUCH IN COMMON -- 
ESPECIALLY A ZEAL FOR SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis George had seen the sport but didn't think much of it. Returning to his 
family's Chatsworth home after work, the computer consultant passed a local 
park where each day he saw hordes of children in happy pursuit of a tumbling 
object. 
</P>
<P>
 "There always seemed to be a thousand of them out there kicking this little 
ball around," George recalled. "I'd always thought, 'What a stupid thing to 
do.' But then we got hooked." 
</P>
<P>
 That was seven years ago and there are no signs of George or his family 
shaking free soon. 
</P>
<P>
 George's three daughters, Melinda, 17, Michelle, 16, and Pamela, 15, start for 
the Chatsworth High girls' soccer team, a perennial City Section powerhouse 
that looks as dominant as ever this winter with a related triple threat in its 
midst. 
</P>
<P>
 The George sisters describe themselves as best friends and say that having one 
another close by for guidance and emotional support is key to their 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice having two older sisters on the team," Pamela said. "They never 
knock me and I can always look to them for encouragement. Having your own blood 
on the team, you can ask them, 'What am I doing wrong?' and they'll be honest 
with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Occupying three of their squad's four midfield positions, the siblings have 
propelled the Chancellors to a 7-1-1 record. They have accounted for 13 of the 
team's 40 goals and often employ what verges on mental telepathy to control a 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all work together well, we know each other's style of play," Pamela said. 
"We can all pretty much read each other's minds as to where we're going to put 
the ball, where to run, when to move to open space." 
</P>
<P>
 The Georges began developing their soccer instincts on their first youth teams 
and play the sport with a passion that impresses Chatsworth Coach Jack Sidwell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their intensity level is exceedingly high," Sidwell said. "Some players will 
be a little goofy during off times in practice. But (the Georges) are there to 
win at soccer and it's hard to get anything in between them and that goal." 
</P>
<P>
 On the field it's often difficult to get anything between them, period. 
Playing midfield, the Georges are able to roam from goal to goal, influencing 
every facet of a match. 
</P>
<P>
 Melinda, who has scored eight goals, led last year's team with 30 and has such 
endurance that Sidwell says she could easily play back-to-back matches. 
Michelle has three goals and is impressive with the ball in traffic. Pamela is 
the fastest of the three and has two goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Georges' skill at soccer, the game is far from the focus of their 
lives. The girls are part of a tightly knit family that includes their mother, 
Georgia, and younger brother, Paul.  
</P>
<P>
 All three sisters are good students, play a sport besides soccer and are Girl 
Scouts. Toss in sleep and an occasional meal and there's not much time for 
hanging out, kicking back or fooling around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I write schedules all the time," said Melinda, who after being in Girl Scouts 
for 13 years will soon receive the organization's highest citation, the Gold 
Award. "Often I wake up in the night thinking I have to write down everything 
that needs to be done or else I'll forget. I'm a lot more of a lists person 
than my sisters." 
</P>
<P>
 That's understandable, given the straight-A student's commitments throughout 
the year.  
</P>
<P>
 The senior is in three advanced placement courses and one honors class at 
Chatsworth, runs track and cross-country for the Chancellors, is the leader of 
a 30-member Girl Scout troop and, when high school soccer is out of season, 
plays the sport with Michelle on the San Fernando Roses club team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything (Melinda) does, she puts everything into it," said Michelle, who 
with Pamela chose to be a member of a Girl Scout troop separate from their 
sister's.  
</P>
<P>
 "I totally admire and envy her dedication and commitment. I wish I had that, 
and over the years I think I've gained more just from watching her and wanting 
to be more alike." 
</P>
<P>
 While Melinda's determination and discipline are noteworthy, it sets her 
somewhat apart from her sisters, who share a room and are more impulsive and 
outgoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boys, clothes and dancing, Michelle and Pamela are probably more alike" said 
Georgia, who attended Chatsworth High when it first opened in 1963 and 
graduated from the school two years later.  
</P>
<P>
 "They like the same kind of music and they like to go out and dance, whereas 
Melinda's a little more inhibited. As the oldest child, she's just not as free, 
where the other two are much more off-the-wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season marked the first time the George sisters had played for the same 
soccer team. Age-group barriers on lower levels meant Michelle bounced back and 
forth, playing with Melinda one year, Pamela the next. 
</P>
<P>
 The two older sisters were successful from the beginning, going undefeated in 
1987 with their first youth league team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just going to be Pamela who played at first," Georgia said. "But I 
told Dennis if we're going to get Pamela in, we might as well let all three 
kids go the one year and get it out of our system." 
</P>
<P>
 So much for that idea. Over the years, George girls appeared on numerous youth 
league and club teams, including one that featured Michelle and Pamela as 
players and their father as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is at Chatsworth that the George sisters have attained their greatest 
glory and become closest with their teammates. The Chancellors are two deep at 
all 11 positions and the Georges are among the team's brightest stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love playing with them," said sophomore forward Denise Paul, the team's 
leading goal scorer and a frequent beneficiary of the Georges' passes.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're almost perfect on the field and they say what needs to be said. It's 
not like we look up to them, but we listen to what they say." 
</P>
<P>
 This winter, much of the talk among the Chatsworth players centers on their 
desire to recapture the City championship, a title they held from 1988 to 1992. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The Chancellors were ranked No. 1 in the section in 1993 and faced San Pedro, 
which they had crushed earlier in the season, in the playoff semifinals. 
Overconfident and uninspired, Chatsworth lost in double overtime, ending its 
five-year reign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't believe it," Michelle said. "We were focused on the finals and 
thinking we would play Grant (the eventual champion). It was almost a nightmare 
and it haunts me to this day. You walk in the gym and you see the banners . . . 
but there's no '93." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with offering a chance for redemption, this season is special to the 
George sisters because it is likely their last as teammates.  
</P>
<P>
 Melinda hopes to run track in college and has applied to five of the 
California State universities for next fall. In the meantime, Michelle and 
Pamela are doing their best to create positive memories for themselves and 
their older sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make the most of this year, definitely," said Michelle, who already 
has won a City championship this year with the Chatsworth volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't afford to waste it because it's our last year together, both on the 
team and as a family. I want to win (the City championship) for Melinda because 
I know it means a lot to her. That's always in my head and makes me try 
harder."

DIGEST: RADINSKY SIGNS WITH WHITE SOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Simi Valley High left-hander Scott Radinsky has signed a one-year 
contract with the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky, 26, spent the 1994 season on the disabled list after being diagnosed 
with Hodgkin's disease. He underwent chemotherapy to fight the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect Scott to be fully recovered and ready to go by spring training," 
said Ron Schueler, White Sox general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Radinsky was 8-2 with four saves and a 4.28 earned-run average in 73 
relief appearances with the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A winter baseball camp featuring former Crespi High standout Jeff Suppan, a 
pitcher in the Boston Red Sox organization and Chuck Fick, a scout with the St. 
Louis Cardinals, will be held Dec. 27-28.

 Center Blake Jacobson of Crescenta Valley High suffered a hyper-extended left 
knee Monday and might not play until the Falcons' Pacific League opener in two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson, a 6-foot-8 1/2 senior who will play for Navy, said he injured the 
knee when he stepped on an opposing player's foot in a game against St. Louis 
of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it feels pretty good," Jacobson said. "I'm walking on it but I 
don't have full range of motion."

 Alemany High might play a boys' and girls' basketball doubleheader at the 
Sports Arena before a Jan. 20 Clippers game, although final arrangements have 
yet to be confirmed, girls' Coach Melissa Hearlihy said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' team would play a nonleague game against Bishop Montgomery and the 
boys' team would face Mission League-rival Loyola. However, formal approval has 
yet to be received from Alemany administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 It was reported Thursday in another newspaper that the doubleheader was a done 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was entirely premature," Hearlihy said. "Our players hadn't even been 
informed of the possibility. We hadn't received confirmation from Loyola."

 Both Alemany teams have been forced to play all their games on the road since 
losing the school gym in the Northridge Earthquake last January. Volleyball

 Basketball Coach Pete Cassidy didn't linger on the subject of Cal State 
Northridge's 62-point loss to 13th-ranked Cincinnati on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably never mention this game to (the players) again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy knows how it feels. 
</P>
<P>
 He played on the Northridge team that lost to Chapman by a school-record 65 
points in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was angry and certainly embarrassed," Cassidy said, recalling the moment. 
"And I vowed that I would do whatever it took to make sure that it didn't 
happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, Northridge was routed by Xavier, 101-65.

 Called for traveling: Former Notre Dame High and UCLA basketball player Nigel 
Miguel has been performing in movies and on TV for several years. Now, he's an 
ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel, 31, has been appointed a goodwill ambassador by his homeland, Belize, 
a Central American country with a population of 230,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is sort of a training ground and steppingstone." Miguel said. "I'm 
hoping my acting enhances my visibility as to bringing attention to the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel has had parts in "White Men Can't Jump," "The Air Up There," and "Blue 
Chips" and just finished working on Billy Crystal's "Forget Paris."

 Miguel played guard at UCLA from 1981-85 and averaged 13 points and four 
assists as a senior.

 Business is business: Newbury Park's first-year boys' basketball coach, Steve 
Johnson, might not have been sure which team he was supposed to be coaching 
last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson coached the junior varsity at Simi Valley for the past six years. And 
Simi Valley's varsity this season, with the exception of one player, is 
identical to his Pioneer junior varsity from last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's old team beat his new team, 74-70, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very strange feeling because we had a very close team last year," 
Johnson said. "We went through a lot with the earthquake. I care a lot about 
those guys. They are great players and great kids, but I wanted to beat them."

 No boys' basketball team is more deserving of a holiday break than Moorpark. 
On Tuesday, the Musketeers played in their 14th tournament game in a little 
more than three weeks, including 10 games in the past two weeks. Coach Tim 
Bednar gave his tired troops five days off before reconvening Dec. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can go skiing, snowboarding, whatever," Bednar said. "I just told them 
not to get hurt."

 Perhaps Moorpark should keep playing. The Musketeers put together an 
eight-game winning streak during the stretch.

A GIFT FROM THE GIFTED; HOPE UNIVERSITY'S HOLIDAY SHOW IS NO MERE PAGEANT. AT 
THE ARTS COLLEGE IN ANAHEIM, THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED UNWRAP TALENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At one end of a dim, slightly threadbare gymnasium, in front of only a few 
dozen people, one of the most extraordinary Christmas concerts of this or any 
season was performed last week. 
</P>
<P>
 There were traditional carols, seasonal playlets, holiday-themed dancing, even 
a bell choir. And there was long applause, cheering and several standing 
ovations worthy of an inspired performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubly inspired, because every performer that Tuesday afternoon, all 32 of 
them, ages 18 to 50, were developmentally disabled, afflicted with various 
characteristics of Down's syndrome, autism, cerebral palsy or other conditions 
that prevent them from performing many simple, daily tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 But not from performing in front of an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 These artists were the student body of Hope University, the nation's only 
private fine arts college for the gifted mentally retarded. Through the 
school's curriculum of artistic development, each student is given the 
opportunity to discover and use an innate talent, whether musical or visually 
artistic, and develop it. The arts, said Hope University's director George 
Gilliam, are a catalyst to greater self-knowledge and self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's yearly Christmas Festival, performed in the gym before an 
appreciative audience of parents, friends and relatives, is the culmination of 
many weeks of preparation, rehearsal, planning and hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Acton knows. 
</P>
<P>
 Acton, 33, afflicted with PKU, a protein deficiency that causes mental 
retardation, speaks slowly and a bit haltingly but can -- and did -- sing 
"Silent Night" in its original German. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yes," she said. "I sure do look forward to the Christmas Festival. What 
it means is it gives us all a chance to go out and entertain and give a little 
piece of ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always so for Acton. Before coming to Hope University nine years 
ago, she said she worked at a repetitive workshop job for Goodwill Industries 
in Santa Ana and only sang at home, by herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated working in a workshop," she said. "Now I can do what I love, which is 
the music and the whole fine arts thing. It's something I feel really good 
about, doing what I love. I wouldn't trade places with the average person in a 
workshop for anything now." 
</P>
<P>
 Acton is proud that she has, for the past five years, been singing with Hope 
University's musical ensemble, the nationally famous Hi Hopes. A 12-person 
instrumental and vocal group, the Hi Hopes are made up of several of the 
school's most gifted students, true savants whose musical talent is in almost 
inverse proportion to their disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 There are five true savants in the Hi Hopes group (the word savant is French 
for "genius" and refers to anyone with low intelligence or mental abilities who 
exhibits extraordinary talents). However, said director Gilliam, there are a 
handful of other organized instrumental and vocal ensembles at the school that 
also regularly perform at area convalescent hospitals and at public functions. 
And, he said, that is when many formerly introspective, shy students blossom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today," Gilliam said, "it's not just the Hi Hopes going out and performing. 
We're bringing up other groups to a higher level so they can get out and 
interact and show the community what people with disabilities can do. We always 
say that anybody can learn. I want the school to be a reflection of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing, though, is that everybody gets a chance. The 
performing is what brings out the changes in them. That's when the real 
transformation starts to take place. They may have only one line or one word in 
a song, but that verbal outburst gives them something to look forward to." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the students come to Hope University with some specific talent that 
has previously gone unnoticed, Gilliam said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time they don't have anywhere else to go" to display their 
talent, he said. "They may play or sing at home, but they're sad that they 
don't have anywhere else to do it. They're referred to us, and we go through 
the process of watching them. We're looking for something we can develop. And 
once we find that, maybe we can teach them something else." 
</P>
<P>
 The school has a motto: "To train the talent is to diminish the disability." 
It is no more evident than at Christmastime, with the Festival, and during 
summers, when the student body rehearses and performs a fully staged musical. 
Last year, Gilliam said, they staged "My Fair Lady." 
</P>
<P>
 "They make backdrops and do their own scenic design," Gilliam said. "We keep 
everybody working on specific goals, showing them how to work through a plan 
and put the pieces of the puzzle together. Everybody gets a chance to learn and 
solve problems. And then they sing and play music. They pulled it off without a 
hitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual support among the students is constant. Throughout the Christmas 
performance, at the end of each solo or group number, there were many high 
fives, many hugs, long clapping and cheering. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have good friendship with each other," said Trieana Moon, 20, a singer and 
the newest member of the Hi Hopes. "We get along with each other and laugh, and 
it brings us so much joy. And we help each other musically. It's a big part of 
my life. I really had a good time performing for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 For many formerly withdrawn students, artistic performance has become a window 
on the world, and a source of new confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the perfect outlet for them," Gilliam said. "It gives them a vehicle to 
step out of themselves. People are always amazed at their ability." 
</P>
<P>
 And they know how to take a bow. At the Christmas Festival, performer after 
performer played an instrument or sang with conviction and beauty and verve 
and, beaming, acknowledged the applause with a decidedly professional mien. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're happiest when they're performing," Gilliam said. "You can see it on 
their faces. They're very honest about their feelings, and they're very 
dedicated. I have to stop them or they'd practice 24 hours a day. They get lost 
in it and find freedom there."

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; WHERE THERE'S A WILL IN SCHOOLS, THERE'S A 
PRAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Even without a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow voluntary 
prayer in class, thousands of students across the nation are pressing their 
hands together in prayer at school. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the high school students involved in voluntary religious clubs -- an 
overwhelming majority of which are Christian. The clubs offer a place where 
students can express their faith in their free time. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Fellowship of Christian Athletes, one of the more popular 
national religious groups on campus, says it has an all-time high of 5,278 
school affiliates -- mostly high schools -- up nearly 50% over 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 And a group called Campus Crusade for Christ says it reaches 250,000 junior 
high and high school students nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The clubs got a boost in 1990, when the Supreme Court upheld the 
constitutionality of the 1984 Equal Access Act. The act says religious clubs 
must be treated like any other extracurricular clubs on secondary school 
campuses: Christian clubs must be allowed if chess clubs are. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990 case, the court sent a message to holdout school districts across 
the nation that they must allow the clubs, noting "the crucial difference 
between government speech endorsing religion, which the (Constitution) forbids, 
and private speech endorsing religion, which the (Constitution) protect(s)." 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe that the presence of religion on campus should be an integral 
part of the day -- not just in clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican lawmakers have vowed to pursue a school prayer amendment, hoping to 
get it on the books by the summer. The measure, introduced by Rep. Ernest 
Istook Jr. (R-Okla.), would allow -- but not require -- school districts to 
conduct teacher-led prayer. Under the proposal, students who don't want to pray 
can sit silently or leave the room. President Clinton has opposed the 
Republican plan, although he says he would endorse a moment of silence at 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University in 
Nashville, Tenn., argues in a recently released study that schools should teach 
students about religion, but not indoctrinate them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to teach United States history adequately without teaching 
about our religious roots," says the study's author, religious scholar Charles 
C. Haynes. "The same is true in world history. A student who graduates from 
high school and doesn't know anything about Islam is not prepared to live in 
the modern world. Many of the world's conflicts are rooted in religious 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fighting over whether we can have a 30-second nondenominational prayer 
diverts attention from the real issues. Teaching about religion needs to be 
there."

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; BIBLE GROUPS ARE NOT THE ANSWER FOR EVERYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Not everyone involved in religious youth groups has found the answer to his or 
her prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen-year-old Jane of Santa Ana, who preferred that her real name not be 
used, said she is angered by church tactics used to recruit teen-agers through 
youth groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane jokingly refers to herself as "born again, dead again." 
</P>
<P>
 "After battling with bouts of depression and feelings of estrangement during 
the first three months of my junior year, I did not know where to turn for 
guidance," said Jane, now a senior. "School, my family life, my social life -- 
everything dissatisfied me." 
</P>
<P>
 This dissatisfaction led her to attend a Friday night Bible study at a Santa 
Ana church. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bible study offered me a sense of belonging that I just did not feel anywhere 
else," she said. "There were 20 or 30 complete strangers who invited me into 
their family just because we all believed in the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jane said the effect of the instantaneous acceptance soon wore off, 
especially when she was advised to cut off contact with former friends because 
they were not "good Christians." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to cut off all emotional ties with people I had been friends with all 
of my life," she said. "I even alienated my parents and told my mother that she 
was going to hell because she thought homosexuality was acceptable. My religion 
soon seemed to be like a drug addiction, and I had to kick the habit." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane has stopped attending the Bible study sessions and has reconciled old 
friendships. She concedes, however, that she still believes in what she learned 
while she was "born again."  
</P>
<P>
 "I have found a happy medium between fanaticism and atheism," Jane said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am still friends with people from my church, but I just could not handle 
surrounding myself with religion all of the time," she said. "I also still 
believe in the Bible and the church, but I am not so consumed with it." DANA 
LENETZ

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; READING, WRITING AND RELIGION; AS TEEN 
ATTENDANCE AT CHURCHES AND BIBLE STUDY GROUPS HAS INCREASED, SO HAS THE FOCUS 
ON THEIR ROLE ON CAMPUS. CLUBS ARE FORMED, SPECIAL EVENTS ARE HELD, AND THE 
DEBATE RAGES OVER WHETHER A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ENDORSING PRAYER IN SCHOOL 
SHOULD BE ADOPTED.

 Joyce Koo bows her head, a gold cross flirting with the collar of her white 
shirt. Her Bible, bound in a brown leather case, lies open in front of her, and 
her fingers sweep under each line. In an inspirational voice, Koo, 17, explains 
the meaning of prayer with a serene piety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to read the Bible and pray because it gives me insight into myself as 
both a person and a Christian," Koo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Koo is among the growing number of teen-agers across the nation who have 
turned in recent years to organized religion and Bible study. According to a 
Gallup youth poll, one-half of the nation's youth attended church weekly in 
1993, up from 45% in 1992. A Gallup survey also showed that young adults are 
more likely (53%) to attend church than adults (40%). 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor Pat Follis of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship of Anaheim said she has 
noticed an increase in teen activity within her church in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have noticed more teen-age activity in Bible study, prayer and ministry 
with one another and with the community, and a greater attendance at Sunday 
services," Follis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attribute a growing teen interest in religion to the deterioration of the 
family unit. Bible study and youth groups can offer a place of community and 
acceptance that some teens don't find at home, they say.  
</P>
<P>
 Senior Pastor George Munzing of Trinity United Presbyterian Church of Santa 
Ana says other social factors are at work, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teen-agers look at the world we live in and recognize that many things are 
not satisfying," Munzing said. "Younger kids are seeing their older brothers 
and sisters being sent to Haiti and Kuwait; teen-agers are dying of AIDS and 
suicide, families are stricken with cancer. It seems that the circumstances in 
which we live are sobering. The church offers a moral stability we do not find 
in other places. Of course, it also offers love and good, healthy relationships 
that we all need." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mirroring the growth in teen activity in churches is increased emphasis on 
religion in high schools -- in campus clubs, in special events and in the 
debate over whether a constitutional amendment endorsing prayer in school 
should be adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian clubs have been established on campus at many Orange County schools, 
with meetings held during lunch or before or after school. At Foothill High 
School in Santa Ana, Christian students created the Alternative Club, a Bible 
study/discussion group that meets every Wednesday during lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 The club has about 30 members, said member Tiffany Ang, but attendance varies 
from week to week, "depending on everyone's schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Ang, who has gone to meetings regularly for more than a year, said the club 
"is a good way to support my personal beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am part of the Alternative Club because I am supporting others who share 
the same beliefs I do and to help those who don't know what we are about gain 
some insight." 
</P>
<P>
 For 17-year-old Sam of Santa Ana, who preferred that his real name not be 
used, the Christian club at his school became a lifeline. After years of 
abusing drugs and running with the "wrong crowd," Sam said he found help after 
a classmate invited him to a Christian club meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I discovered the club, I was so lost," Sam said. "My grades had 
fallen; my relationship with my parents was bad, people who I respected no 
longer respected me. I was heading toward self-destruction at such a quick 
pace. It scared me. Then I found the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
 As he plunged into his newfound spiritual world, Sam said, Christianity 
spurred him into overcoming his drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was amazing," Sam said. "I made a new group of friends who knew exactly 
how I felt about the Lord, and I spent my sophomore year re-evaluating my life 
and re-forming my goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot believe what a different person I have become and how much happier I 
am now."

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; 'SEE YOU AT THE POLE' GAINS MOMENTUM AS CAMPUS 
EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

High School.

<TEXT>
<P>
 By 7 in the morning, more than 160 students had gathered in a circle around 
the flagpole outside Los Alamitos High School for the fall's fourth annual See 
You at the Pole, a national prayer event that has been gaining momentum at high 
schools across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos students began with the song "Live to Tell." Then senior Andrew 
Poe, leader of the Christian club on campus, Cross Bearers, led the students, 
with heads bowed, in prayer for their school, community and country. Students 
read verses from the Bible, and a time of silence was given for personal 
prayers. The chorus from "Our God Is an Awesome God" closed the event. Then it 
was time for school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing to see what God can do with just a few people who want to be 
used by Him," Poe said about the prayer event. 
</P>
<P>
 See You at the Pole was played out at other Orange County high schools, 
including Capistrano Valley, Villa Park, Troy, Canyon, Esperanza, El Dorado and 
Valencia, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth prayer event started as small gatherings in Texas. But as word 
spread, so did participation at junior high and high schools and college 
campuses. See You at the Pole is coordinated by the National Network of Youth 
Ministries, a nonprofit, interdenominational networking ministry for youth 
events based in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is always debate about prayer on campus, the Network of Youth 
Ministries says that See You at the Pole is constitutionally protected because 
it is student-led and held during non-instructional time, and attendance is 
voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministry estimates that more than 2 million youths participated in the 
1994 program across the United States and in 25 counties, including Russia, 
Canada, Ecuador, Australia, Japan and Belgium. In 1993, there was an estimated 
turnout of 1 million.

SETTING THE TONE; JONATHAN WOLFF HAS BEEN CREATING MUSIC FOR TV SINCE 1982. HIS 
BIGGEST, LATEST HIT IS THE THEME FOR 'SEINFELD.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A few years ago, composer Jonathan Wolff received a phone call from Jerry 
Seinfeld, who had been referred to him by a mutual friend, comedian George 
Wallace. Seinfeld needed a theme song for his new television series, then 
called "The Seinfeld Chronicles." Other composers' efforts had not met his 
criteria: something catchy that would underscore but not interfere with the 
stand-up routines he planned to do at the beginning of each episode, and that 
also could be used between scenes during the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolff thought, "Where others have tried and failed, how can I avoid the land 
mines?" He watched videotapes of Seinfeld doing stand-up -- and thus was born 
the series of finger snaps, lip pops and tongue clucks that make up the quirky 
theme song heard each Thursday night on the NBC series "Seinfeld." 
</P>
<P>
 "Watching the tapes, I diagnosed (creating a theme) as a sound-design problem, 
not a soundtrack problem," Wolff, 36, recalls, sitting in the lounge area of 
his Burbank Boulevard office/studio, Music Consultants Group Inc. "The melody 
is Jerry's voice. So instead of using drums or other instruments, I used sounds 
that could go with his human voice and used the pacing of his words to go with 
his tempo. I did use a bass, which has a frequency range that does not 
interfere with the voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry seems to talk at a pace of 110 beats a minute," he adds. "I think of 
that like a brisk walk -- a 'gotta get to the curb, gotta catch my cab' kind of 
energy. I wanted it to be kind of New York-sounding." 
</P>
<P>
 Capturing the tone of a show -- usually as envisioned by its producer -- and 
setting up the viewer for what is to come is precisely what a theme song is 
supposed to do, Wolff says. "When you go to an opera, there is an overture, and 
the curtain rises. It's part of the experience, the feeling of being 
entertained. There's a heightening -- you rise to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes a theme song takes you to the place," he adds. "With the moose in 
'Northern Exposure,' by the time it's at the end, you're there, ready to watch 
the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolff may not have written that series' theme song, but he is one of 
television's most prolific composers. He had been scoring episodes of such TV 
series as "Who's the Boss?" since composing for "Square Pegs" in 1982; his 
first theme -- or main title, in industry jargon -- was for "The Charmings" in 
1987, with subsequent credits including Shelley Long's sitcom "Good Advice," 
"Saved by the Bell -- The College Years" and "The Good Life." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the success of "Seinfeld" that really put him on the TV music map. 
He now scores CBS' "Dave's World" -- for which he chose and arranged the Billy 
Joel song used as the main title -- and Fox's "Married . . . With Children," 
and created the theme and does the weekly music for "The Boys are Back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His midseason shows include a CBS comedy about New York bicycle messengers, 
"Double Rush," from "Murphy Brown" creator Diane English; "A Whole New 
Ballgame," starring Corbin Bernsen on ABC, and "Unhappily Ever After," a 
syndicated sitcom about a dysfunctional divorce. He was also recruited to 
revamp the venerable "Mickey Mouse Club" song for The Disney Channel's current 
crop of Mouseketeers, which begins airing early next year.  
</P>
<P>
 That sort of output would be virtually impossible without Wolff's 
state-of-the-art computerized electronic equipment, an array of recording 
devices, sequencers, consoles and speakers housed in the Burbank building he 
bought in 1986. The high-tech machinery allows him, for instance, to receive a 
"Seinfeld" episode videotape on a Wednesday evening and have it scored by 
Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The equipment enables me to manipulate things so much easier," he says. "It's 
like a word processor -- when I do on-screen editing, I can grab and move 
things in seconds. It gives me artistic flexibility too. I can try hundreds of 
variations of an edit." 
</P>
<P>
 He also can incorporate those distinctly non-musical sounds he pioneered on 
"Seinfeld." For the theme for the upcoming "Double Rush," Wolff, who bicycles 
to work from his Burbank home, used the sound of his bike's grinding gears and 
his own breathing. He then added fast-moving street noises such as horns 
honking and people shouting. 
</P>
<P>
 For the theme of CBS' multigenerational sitcom "The Boys Are Back," though, 
Wolff used a traditional acoustic guitar after creator-executive producer 
Matthew Carlson mentioned that he liked the instrument; the only other input 
the composer had was Carlson's stipulation that the music must appeal to all 
ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Carlson: "He took it from there. I didn't know what I had in mind until 
Jonathan showed it to me. This theme is bright and engaging -- when it's right, 
the theme is a perfect blend of music and the show. Jonathan also does segues 
throughout the show, musically wry comments about the action that are always 
appropriate and exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 The television audience probably does not notice all of his composition 
subtleties, Wolff knows. "They don't always get that a costume is handmade or a 
desk is real oak, either," he says. "But these details make for a richer, more 
inviting experience."

SOUNDS LIKE BRAZIL; NEW ENGLANDER FOUND HIS MUSICAL PERSONA IN RIO. IT 
PERMEATES THE NUMBERS HIS GROUP WILL PLAY AT LE CAFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Frank Zottoli may have been born in New Haven, Conn., of Italian ancestry, but 
there's little doubt his musical heart is from Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
 Zottoli first encountered Brazilian music on his initial professional gigs as 
a teen-age pianist growing up in Wallingford, Conn., near New Haven. "But I 
didn't really understand how beautiful songs like Antonio Carlos Jobim's 
'Triste' and 'Desfinado' were until much later," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 As he grew older, Zottoli began to realize the depth and quality of the 
popular music of Brazil, and while studying at what is now the Berklee College 
of Music in Boston, he "fell in love with the music," he said. Still it took a 
trip to Brazil in 1985, and some personal encounters with Brazilians and their 
music on their home turf, to fully cement that adoration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may sound trite, but Brazilian people and their music have a warmth that's 
unmistakable to anybody who meets them, hears, feels the music," says the 
keyboardist, shaping words with his hands. "They, their music -- both are warm 
at the outset. A lot of Brazilian music mates the rhythms of Africa and Brazil 
with sophisticated harmonies and beautiful melodies. Those are the classical 
elements of great music from anywhere, as far as I'm concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 The 2 1/2 months he spent in Rio were wonderful just as enjoyment. "It was a 
dream of mine to visit there, to take an educational vacation and soak up the 
music. I went out almost every night," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 That brief stay was also instrumental in forming Zottoli's musical persona. 
And now the essentials of the popular music of Brazil, exemplified by songs 
written by such noted Brazilians as Jobim, Dori Caymmi and Ivan Lins, permeate 
most of the music that the keyboardist, 45, performs. 
</P>
<P>
 Zottoli appears Wednesday at Le Cafe with his recently formed band, Todos 
Vagabundos, featuring Doug Norwine (saxes, woodwinds), Octavio Bailly (bass), 
Sinclair Lott (drums) and Scott Breadman (percussion). Naturally, says the 
leader, Brazilian-influenced sounds will predominate. 
</P>
<P>
 "You might hear a standard like 'Besame Mucho' or 'The Shadow of Your Smile' 
done as sambas," he says. And there will be originals by the leader and Moacir 
Santos, one of the most highly respected, but least known, of Brazilian 
writers. The music of Santos, with whom Zottoli performed and who has lived in 
Southern California for decades, struck the keyboardist the first time he heard 
it while at Berklee in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bassist Abraham Laboreil's wife Lyn played a record of his for me and 
Abraham, and we both freaked," Zottoli says, his face lighting up. "I heard 
something that I had never heard before -- a music from Northern Brazil which 
Moacir had made completely unique."  
</P>
<P>
 At Le Cafe, there will of course be tunes by Jobim, done now both for their 
luxurious musicality and in tribute to the man who died recently at age 67. "I 
never knew Jobim, but I saw him perform in Los Angeles at the Wiltern Theater," 
says Zottoli. "He was unbelievable. A great musician and spirit has been lost. 
I imagine that those who knew him feel a tremendous loss, and I sympathize with 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge resident Zottoli, who has played with a variety of artists, 
including sax man Stan Getz, the Brazilian band Velas and the pop group Fifth 
Dimension, is one of Southern California's most interesting improvisers. He has 
a keen rhythmic edge, and his lines have plenty of melodic whammy. He long ago 
attracted the attention of Le Cafe owner Dale Jaffe, who was excited about 
booking Todos Vagabundos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank puts new meaning into the word fusion as he merges all these sounds 
from Brazil in a very fresh way," says Jaffe. "I love having this band in 
whatever form it is taking, and I hope it will catch on." 
</P>
<P>
 Zottoli began playing piano at age 6, accompanying his father, an amateur 
singer of popular songs. He began formal studies at age 10, though he always 
played by ear. 
</P>
<P>
 He entered Berklee, from which he earned a diploma in 1973, because, he says, 
"I heard that was the place to study seriously, but not necessarily 
classically." 
</P>
<P>
 Since landing in Southern California in 1976, he has worked steadily, doing 
everything from collaborating on albums with Japanese artists who wanted to 
explore Brazilian music to playing weddings. 
</P>
<P>
 Zottoli says the musical life has been "good at times, not good at times." 
</P>

says directly, and without complaint. "But it's great because of the artistic

THEATER REVIEW; MISPLACED MADNESS TAKES OVER STAGE; PLAY ABOUT VAN GOGH BECOMES 
A SCREAMING MATCH AND FAILS TO CONVEY ARTIST'S DEPTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It doesn't take long for a screaming match to erupt in James Kennedy's 
biographical drama on Van Gogh, "Mad Vincent," at the Odessa Theatre. It takes, 
however, a very long time for the screaming match to end: the final, screaming 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Loud Vincent" is more like it, an astoundingly inept and frenetic telling of 
the last crucial eight years in the sad life of the painter. Although Brant 
Cotton, at certain angles and in certain light, closely resembles Van Gogh, 
there is nothing else in writer-director Kennedy's play and staging that 
closely suggests verisimilitude. Even the charitable assumption that the play 
-- first produced in 1976 -- is meant to recreate a crazed mind through crazed, 
high-pitched dialogues finally collapses. 
</P>
<P>
 That Van Gogh has never been properly dramatized in countless films and plays 
may say something about him: His artistic struggle is notorious, but it was 
mostly a profoundly inner one. Neither imagined spoken exchanges nor imagery 
designed to imitate his canvases have ever come close to the drama of the 
paintings themselves. Van Gogh's gradual mental and physical collapse occurred 
while his painting mastery exploded -- a combination tempting to the dramatist, 
but impossible to pull off. 
</P>
<P>
 The fatal problem with "Mad Vincent" is that there's not even a gradual 
collapse: This Vincent is mad from the outset. Cotton is asked to play 
scattered and angry from nearly his first line, and he can't take the role 
anywhere. This also suggests an unchanging character, when the actual Van Gogh 
went through more character changes than you could fit in a novel. No artist in 
history, for example, accomplished such drastic stylistic shifts in such little 
time (a few years) as Van Gogh, and few allowed those shifts to be so visibly 
personal. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, it's even difficult to glean that he may be a genuine artist; he seems 
to be just a lunatic young man with no social skills surrounded by other 
lunatics. A (fictional) fellow named Max the Actor (Brad Henson) indulges in 
long-winded, self-pitying monologues about how rough the actor's life is.  
</P>
<P>
 As the itchy, nerve-racking Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, James Andrew Oster -- 
understudying Richard Magram -- plays at the same crazed decibel level as 
everyone else, and doesn't even try for the under-5-foot Toulouse-Lautrec's 
hobbled physical appearance. Oddest of all, he is depicted as a kind of rock 
star surrounded by hooker-groupies in a pop-style musical number. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no flow between scenes, and even less of a sense of Van Gogh's 
artistic process. For all of the wordy, breathless speeches, the play's text 
never explores the heart of Van Gogh's unfounded self-doubt in his own talent, 
his political idealism or the depths of his complex relationship with brother 
Theo (a weak Gary Iverson). 
</P>
<P>
 It's even harder to fathom the general sloppiness, including factual errors 
that carry over into dramatic absurdity when Van Gogh fires several bullets 
into his chest (he actually shot himself once) and keeps standing and emoting 
for the long final scene.

VARIETY SPICES EXHIBIT; GALLERY SHOWCASES LOCAL AFRICAN AMERICAN ARTISTS IN 
'PERSPECTIVES.' VARIED WORKS RANGE FROM VINTAGE AMERICANA TO JAZZ MUSICIANS IN 
BOLD HUES.

 Fredric Booker isn't out to make any profound political statement about the 
African American experience with his paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let the politicians deal with social statements," Booker said. "I'm not into 
that. An artist's (role) is painting what he has experienced, what he sees." 
</P>
<P>
 What Booker has experienced as an African American, and what he subsequently 
paints, is often thought-provoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Booker's "T'was" shows an African American woman with three children, two of 
color and one white. The African American children are in the lower portion of 
the painting while the white child is at the woman's breast. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a story I used to hear over and over again from my grandmother 
(about) her mother," Booker said. "That's what she was, a wet nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I say 'T'was,' 'cause that's the way it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Booker's work reflects vintage Americana of the 1940s and '50s. Booker 
sees this as an era that artists -- with the exception of Norman Rockwell -- 
have neglected. "Everything I paint, it's what we were," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten of Booker's watercolors, including "T'was," are part of the latest exhibit 
at the Lancaster Museum/Art Gallery. "Perspectives of African-American Artists 
of the Antelope Valley" features more than 100 pieces by 13 artists. The show 
runs through Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Curator Norma Gurba cited the changing demographics of the Antelope Valley, 
the corresponding increase in local African American artists and her desire to 
showcase different ethnic and social groups as reasons behind the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always looking for different themes," she said. "The community has 
changed quite a bit. We have a whole new field of artists." 
</P>
<P>
 "Perspectives" is the Lancaster museum's first show devoted to artists of 
African descent, Gurba said, noting that the exhibit's offerings are quite 
varied. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a nice mixture," she said. "Some (paintings are) depicting work 
scenes; (others show) nostalgic home life, civil rights, sports figures, 
African heritage pieces. It's eclectic in some ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale artist Thurman Hackett, who has 20 pieces in the show, is pleased the 
museum chose to feature African American artists, saying that such an exhibit 
is overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 In his own work, Hackett most enjoys bringing jazz to life on canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 With bright, bold colors and telling expressions on the faces of his subjects, 
Hackett said he makes music resonate in his art. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jazz -- Center Stage" depicts a typical scene from the 1940s with jazz 
musicians performing on stage; "Musical Art of Jazz" shows a man in a tuxedo 
playing a trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to project something that's different," Hackett said. "I try to be 
different from anything else. I like originality." 
</P>
<P>
 Hackett paints in a cartoon configuration, combining cartoon-like images with 
realism. "I find freedom of expression through the painting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Artist Darwin (Murph) Murphy, a Tehachapi resident exhibiting 13 pieces in the 
show, is a firefighter who relies on his work experiences for many of his 
pieces. He uses his paintings as an opportunity to depict African Americans in 
a positive way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my firefighter paintings have African Americans in them," he said. 
"It's a positive role model type of thing so the kids can see another view. You 
don't always have to be a ballplayer or singer." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy's 5-by-6-foot "Not Only Brothers" is based on an incident that occurred 
in the Indiana Fire Department when two African American brothers responded to 
the same emergency call. One man fell from a three-story building and his 
brother caught him. 
</P>
<P>
 The painting shows the brothers on the ground and a female firefighter 
assisting them. "It's showing the brotherhood of all fire departments," Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Papa's Rookie," Murphy painted his young grandson wearing a fireman's hat 
and holding a hose. "My grandson likes everything I do. He wants to be a 
fireman also," Murphy said. "When I was a kid I always wanted to be a 
firefighter, like a lot of young people." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said his acrylic-on-glass painting, "Animal in the Wild," is a portrait 
of society. From a distance, the painting appears to show two eyes peering 
through brush. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you get close, all this brush turns to thousands of faces," he said. "That 
animal is you and I."

FRESH FROM THE GARDEN; FROM LUSH TO LONELY, CANVASES BLOSSOM WITH A VARIETY OF 
FLORAL IMAGES IN CENTURY GALLERY'S CURRENT EXHIBIT. FEATURED ARE FOUR AREA 
ARTISTS, WITH FOUR VERY DIFFERENT APPROACHES.

<P>
 For hundreds of years, many a painter has turned to the garden as a source of 
inspiration. Remarkably, the subject matter of flowers in artwork has yet to be 
exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 For various contemporary artists and art lovers, there is still something 
poignant and redeeming about lively images of luscious blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Century Gallery's show, "From the Garden," brings together the paintings of 
four Los Angeles-area artists who "cover four different aspects of getting 
their ideas from the garden," gallery director Lee Musgrave said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to give a broad interpretation to the theme. I also enjoyed picking 
four different painting techniques." 
</P>
<P>
 Alli Farkas' stylized, otherworldly images of the lotus leaves of Echo Park 
Lake feature her exploration of chiaroscuro -- the juxtaposition of light and 
dark, reflection and depth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was drawn to the leaves, rather than the blooms, of the lotus plants," 
Farkas writes in her artist's statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leaves offer an infinite variety of shapes, from tightly rolled 'cigars' 
to gradual stages of openness, culminating in large bowls which gather in the 
sunlight, filter it, and cast it in new colors upon the leaves and water 
below." 
</P>
<P>
 "Her perspective is extremely immersed in the subject," Musgrave said. "It 
reminded me of when I was a little kid, down in the dirt. She has gone right 
down into it and separated it from the city. That's what a park is supposed to 
do. You go to a park to escape the city and return to nature." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Farkas writes that it was "not my purpose to portray realistic leaves 
and water. I wanted the viewer to feel the warmth of the sun on the leaves, get 
lost in the reflections, float on the water or be a bug on a leaf." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Kaufer, another artist in the exhibition, paints colorful, 
expressionistic flower still-lifes. 
</P>
<P>
 Her images, made of energetic brush strokes, are "more about the celebration 
of painting," Musgrave said. "They're very happy." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, a sense of woe permeates Mark Jager's more sharply depicted 
flower pots. The one in "The Red Vase" sits on a stool, full of color and 
flowers, but alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of Jager's works on view present paintings within paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 A canvas that depicts a floral arrangement -- a facsimile of one of his 
previous compositions -- is seen propped up against a studio wall. 
</P>
<P>
 By reframing his earlier works, he offers a different perspective on his own 
vision and emphasizes the isolation in which an artist dwells. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Hilary Baker, the garden is a "starting point to go on to a very personal, 
introverted imagery," Musgrave said of Baker's sensual gouaches on paper, 
abstract visions of earthy delights. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of her forms readily resemble a flower, as does one in "Happy 
Talk," others convey more ghostly presences. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's developed a visual vocabulary that's personal and seems to touch 
something very universal," Musgrave said. "Strange as it may seem, I think 
Hilary's (paintings) are very romantic." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Baker intended to make romantic compositions is unclear. Her artist's 
statement, consisting solely of the following declaration, suggests that other 
forces come into play as well while she is working: 
</P>
<P>
 "It is as much a source of mystery and bemusement when a flower crops up in 
one of my paintings, as it would be if I were to come upon a strawberry growing 
in the snow."

CLUB SCENE: MILDLY WILD AT AMAZON BAR & GRILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA L. OLIANDE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While some restaurants incorporate bits of decor to loosely create a motif 
that attracts a crowd, Amazon Bar & Grill in Sherman Oaks goes all out to 
create a whole environment based on its eco-friendly theme. Walking into Amazon 
is like walking through a rain forest on a mild night. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: There is one long bar to the right of the door and a waterfall, 
surrounded by trees and plants, in the middle of the room. The lighting is dark 
and intimate with twinkling "stars" overhead. It is a relaxing atmosphere in 
which to enjoy a dinner of chicken, fish and other health-conscious foods, but 
no red meat. "The raising of beef is one of the main causes of the 
deforestation of the rain forest," said Peter Knight, general manager. 
"Besides, it's not good for you." 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: Since it is primarily a restaurant, the crowd can vary greatly, but 
the majority are in their mid- to late-20s. This isn't a dress-to-impress 
crowd; many prefer the casual date look of skirts, shirts and sometimes jeans. 
Jackie Bitner, 29, said she liked the attitude, or lack thereof, among the 
patrons. "It's mature, sophisticated," the Beverly Hills resident said, "not 
like a young, Hollywood scene." 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: Cleto, billed as a Latin pop band, entertained the dinner and 
drinking crowd on a recent Saturday night with original tunes and covers of 
Stevie Wonder and the Doobie Brothers, among others. The sets were more pop and 
R & B than Latin, with subtle vocals and mellow rhythms. It is a wonder, 
though, how the band, with two back-up singers, fit in the small "cave" high 
above the room that serves as a stage. Fortunately the music didn't seem to 
suffer from the cramped space. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: "It's very different from every other place," said Patrick 
Goodfellow, 22, of Woodland Hills. "It's a nice mood, especially with the 
music." The lush, relaxed atmosphere was an attraction for a lot of the 
patrons. "It's nice that you can walk up and talk to anybody," said Sherman 
Oaks resident Mike Mandell, 26.  
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: The air tended to be hot and humid, and, for patrons of the bar, the 
available space was too small. "I think they should close off the restaurant," 
said Tim Haro, 22, "and make this place all bar. Maybe with dancing." But the 
Encino resident was not very impressed with the band. "The music is kind of 
hokey." 
</P>
<P>
 THE WORD: "I'm from the East Coast, so I feel right at home," said one man to 
his perplexed table mate. "That waterfall really adds to the humidity in here." 
</P>
<P>
 Amazon Bar & Grill, 14649 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. (818) 986-7502. Hours: 
11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. to 2 a.m. Monday to Saturday; limited

COVER STORY; THE CHILD AS A SPECTATOR; A RESTLESS YOUNGSTER CAN SPOIL A PLAY OR 
CONCERT, YET OUTINGS CAN SUCCEED WITH SOME PREPARATION -- AND IF PARENTS ARE 
WILLING TO LEAVE THE SHOW EARLY.

<P>
 The holiday season is a time of family togetherness, a time when parents 
across the country get visions of their little sugarplums, decked out in their 
holiday velvet and lace, sitting quietly and attentively at a live performance 
of "A Christmas Carol" or "The Nutcracker Suite." 
</P>
<P>
 If you are one of those parents anticipating your child's awe at a holiday 
perennial, you might want to think twice before plunking down a lot of money on 
tickets to any show that involves real people on stage with an audience of 
people who also spent big bucks on tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking a child to a live event really depends on the child's attention span, 
what the seating is like and how the group is arranged," says Jim Ruggirello, 
director of educational programs for the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents also need to think as much about the surrounding audience as what is 
best for their child," Ruggirello says. 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn Guerboian of Tarzana agrees. She recently took her daughter, Natalie, 
9, to her first live performance -- a production of "The Nutcracker" by the Los 
Angeles Chamber Ballet at the Luckman Fine Arts Complex at Cal State Los 
Angeles. She chose that production, she says, because "it's a Christmas story, 
and it's a good one for her to get started into seeing live performances. You 
don't want to make a mistake of taking them to one that they don't enjoy and 
then it leaves a bad taste in their mouths."  
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has dealt with children and the performing arts will advise, most 
importantly, that parents first consider their own child. 
</P>
<P>
 Is he or she really going to sit rapt for two hours or more? Or is your child 
the one with the vibrator under the seat who has to go potty every 10 minutes, 
not out of real need but because flushing the toilet is a blast? 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Gutierrez of Cudahy, who recently took her nieces, Jordan, 3, and 
Breanna Fitzgerald, 5, to "The Nutcracker" for the first time, said prior to 
the show that she hoped they would "sit still for two hours. This is an 
experiment." 
</P>
<P>
 Will your child truly enjoy a ballet, a classical concert or a Broadway 
production? Or is yours the one who would prefer a shopping mall appearance of 
the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers or a rock concert? 
</P>
<P>
 "There is definitely an age where it's not appropriate to take a child to the 
theater," says Renee Miller, marketing director for Baltimore-based Baci 
Management Inc., a theater company that books performances at the Pasadena 
Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "A 2- or 3-year-old can't sit through an entire performance," Miller adds. "I 
don't care if it's 'Sesame Street on Ice.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mark and Alyse Zwickel of Los Angeles, however, say they had luck taking their 
daughter Sarah, 2, to live shows, including a "Sesame Street" production and 
"Beauty and the Beast." 
</P>
<P>
 What was their secret? 
</P>
<P>
 "Prepare them in the morning," Mark Zwickel advises. "Tell them what they're 
going to see. Get them excited about it. And be prepared to leave so you don't 
disrupt anybody else if they're not enjoying it."  
</P>
<P>
 Alyse Zwickel adds: "And bring snacks." 
</P>
<P>
 While taking such a young child to a live performance may not be the best 
idea, there is nothing wrong with exposing youngsters to the arts at a very 
early age. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a child can't be too young to start listening to music," says Herbert 
(Sonny) Ausman, a trombonist with the L.A. Philharmonic and daddy to 3-year-old 
Amanda and 18-month-old Emma. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Ausman's wife, Erica, used to work for the Philharmonic, music is a 
family affair, and their Toluca Lake household is naturally filled with music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always playing music around here," Ausman says. "You can start playing 
music for them as early as you can. It sure wouldn't hurt a child to listen to 
music when he or she is in the womb." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Ausmans routinely take both girls to orchestra rehearsals, Sonny 
Ausman feels they are far too young to attend a full-scale concert. "The child 
should be old enough to be quiet, about 8 or 10," he says. "Of course, it 
depends upon the child." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, just about anyone in the performing arts believes it is important to 
encourage youngsters to enjoy live performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take children to performances where other children are performing," advises 
Norine Xavier, artistic director of the West Coast Dance Theater in Reseda. 
"Children gravitate to other children performing. Kids want to see other kids 
perform; they use them as role models." 
</P>
<P>
 Annette Cutrono of Venice did just that, bringing her younger children, Alina, 
7, and Lucca, 4, to "The Nutcracker" for the first time to see their older 
sister, Lily, dancing in the production. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, she says, she would have left Lucca at home "because he can't pay 
attention for that long."  
</P>
<P>
 "I think he'll be OK today because Lily's in it and it's colorful."  
</P>

 Sidney Shimabukuro of Moorpark and his son, Grant, 5, were also attending the 
holiday ballet to see an older child in the production. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter is performing today, so he gets to go a lot," Shimabukuro says. 
"It's the second or third time. He's well behaved." 
</P>
<P>
 "If parents start preparing the child before the performance, letting him know 
what to expect -- what's going to be going on -- that seems to help," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, says Suzanne Haffamier, owner and artistic director of the Performing 
Arts Institute in Canoga Park, that's why "The Nutcracker" is such a family 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The Nutcracker' is a good ballet for children because it is a pretty, 
colorful story with a happy ending and the children really get into it," 
Haffamier says. "But a lot of ballets are very abstract." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruggirello advises parents to start out with programs that are specifically 
geared toward children. "Parents should ask how long the presentation is, where 
the children sit," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a program for 3-, 4- and 5-year-olds," Ruggirello says. "It really 
never had the impact we wanted because the theater seats were too big for small 
children. So we moved the chamber orchestra into the lobby. The kids sit on the 
floor with their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found their attention span was equal to if not better than the older 
children because it was so immediate to what was going on," Ruggirello adds. "I 
want to see someone sitting quietly because he is so interested in the music he 
forgot to misbehave." 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Del Rosario of West Covina says she frequently takes her children, 
Janelle, 4, and Alennie, 11, to live performances, including the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl and the Joffrey Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 "They love it," she says. "They enjoy that very much." 
</P>
<P>
 As children grow older, theater opportunities expand. Broadway shows and 
musicals -- with the combined experience of music, dance and drama -- are 
especially appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of shows are issue-oriented," says theater marketing director Miller. " 
'Angels in America' is dealing with AIDS, for example. It's a very mature 
topic, and it might be inappropriate to take your child under a certain age to 
such a play. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are wonderful shows like 'Oliver' and 'Annie' that are perfect for 
children," Miller adds. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Miller says, many production companies have recognized the 
importance of the younger audience and are now providing study guides that will 
prepare them for the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The more a parent prepares a child for the production, the more the child 
will get out of it," Miller says. "Preparing children also stimulates them to 
get excited about the performance. Make sure the child is familiar with the 
music. It is much more exciting to know what you're watching." 
</P>
<P>
 Caroline Azluz of Los Angeles agrees. "It's good to have them acquainted with 
whatever it is they're going to see, so that they can relate to it," says 
Azluz, who has taken her sons, Albert, 7, and Oliver, 4, to several live 
performances. "If it's an adult subject, sometimes they get lost in the story 
line. So, you need to give them a children's idea of what it's about." 
</P>
<P>
 For many youngsters, especially those just past the pimple stage, attending 
classical events is just not cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that, some groups are making a concerted effort to tailor events 
to the tastes of young people. "We market our college- and high-school-age 
concerts as a kind of classy date night," Ruggirello says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always gawky teen-age boys out there!" he says. "The idea of having 
enough savoir-faire to say, 'Do you want to go down to the Music Center?' is 
terrific." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier advises parents not to be snobs when exposing youngsters to cultural 
events. "Children really like singing and dancing and hip-hop, things that are 
a little more flashy and up-tempo," she says. "They see it on TV; they hear it 
on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Introduce them to contemporary things" as well as more classical 
performances, she says. "Take them to something they'll be more relaxed around, 
maybe something that they don't have to dress up for." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, children exposed to the arts can have a variety of interests. Jason 
Rosen, 13, of Woodland Hills is a talented pianist who plays classical music. 
He has, according to his mother, Lisa Rosen, expressed minimal interest in 
seeing a live performance. Yet he has been to see the rock performer Huey Lewis 
and the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical "Starlight Express." 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to find something he would be interested in and something that is 
appropriate, with limited adult language," Lisa Rosen says. "I wouldn't take 
him to see a heavy-metal group." 
</P>
<P>
 Although just about anyone involved in the arts agrees that any exposure to 
the arts will open doors to a child's imagination, they also agree that live 
performances are critical to the survival of the American theater tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hate to see a society where people stayed home all the time and 
watched TV," Ruggirello says. "If you find the symphony boring, try opera, or 
the theater, or dance. Attendance at live cultural events is a valuable 
experience for everyone." What to Know Before You Go 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some guidelines to consider before taking children to a live 
theatrical performance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Begin exposing youngsters to the performing arts at an early age. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider a child's age, attention span and the content of a program before 
spending money on tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look for special children's programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prepare young ones for a performance by playing the music and telling them 
the story. 
</P>
<P>
 * Warn them to behave in the theater -- to sit quietly, without talking, and 
to be considerate of others. 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage them to applaud at the appropriate moments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take them to the bathroom before the performance begins. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't insist that they sit through the performance if they become fidgety or 
begin acting up. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't insist that they attend a performance that they are not likely to 
enjoy.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: 48 HOURS AND COUNTING; JUST TWO DAYS TILL CHRISTMAS. BEST 
BETS FOR STRAGGLERS TRYING TO FINISH THEIR GIFT-BUYING ARE ANTIQUE JEWELRY, 
LINGERIE, FRAGRANCES.

<P>
 Many of you are just getting started with your Christmas shopping and will do 
it all in one or two days -- like today and tomorrow. I suspect that most of 
those who fall into this category are men, but surely there are some 
last-minute women shoppers as well. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is a guy thing to wait until the last minute, then I suggest jewelry, 
lingerie or perfumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Antique jewelry will appeal to the romantic, and the Collector's Eye has the 
largest selection of vintage jewelry in Southern California. Any one of the 
stunning chokers from days gone by could make her misty-eyed, and they are all 
less than $50. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's difficult to comparison shop these pieces, owner Merilee 
Flannigan is an expert. A two-strand French jet choker with a teardrop pendant 
dates from the 1940s. Flannigan's expertise puts the value at between $75 and 
$85, but she tagged it at $45. A baroque pearl and crystal choker for $36.95 
(estimated value $65 to $75) would charm any woman and label the giver as a 
romantic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Collector's Eye, 21435 Sherman Way, Canoga Park. Hours: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
Monday to Saturday, noon to 5 p.m. Sunday. Closed Christmas Day. Cards: 
MasterCard, Visa. Call (818) 347-9343. * 
</P>
<P>
 Lingerie for Less, the off-price chain with San Fernando Valley locations in 
Northridge, Sherman Oaks and Tarzana, seems to be specializing in velvets and 
laces in lingerie this holiday season, and at great bargain prices. We loved 
the stretch lace camisoles for $9.99 (retail $18 to $24) and, if you want to 
check her out in a velvet bodysuit, you can give her one for $14.99 that would 
sell for $30 to $36 elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Lingerie for Less, 8974 Tampa Ave., Northridge, (818) 885-0435; 14622 Ventura 
Blvd., Sherman Oaks, (818) 783-6126; 19203 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana, (818) 
881-2961, or call (800) 303-4535 for the location nearest you. Cards: American 
Express, Discover, MasterCard, Visa. Store hours vary.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fragrances for both men and women always sell at Perfume City for 10% to 50% 
less than at department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 For women, Alfred Sung's 3.4-ounce eau de parfum retails for $65; it is 
specially priced at Perfume City for $49.50. Bijan's 2.5-ounce fragrance for 
women, an eau de parfum, sells elsewhere for $60 and at Perfume City for 
$46.80. 
</P>
<P>
 The new offering by Issey Miyake is very hot, so the discount is a little 
less: At department stores, a 3.4-ounce eau de toilette is a whopping $75, but 
you'll save $7.50 here, where it's marked $67.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the big sellers in men's fragrances are specially priced: Versace's 
3.2-ounce eau de toilette is $43.50 instead of $53, as is Carolina Herrera's 
3.4-ounce eau de toilette, which also retails for $53. 
</P>
<P>
 Perfume City, 12215 Ventura Blvd., Studio City. Hours: 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
Monday to Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday . Cards: American Express, 
Discover, MasterCard, Visa. Call: (818) 763-1875. * 
</P>
<P>
 For those who are out of time and energy or just can't make a decision, a gift 
certificate for any of the above would certainly be welcome, and an envelope 
promising a series of beauty treatments would surely make her smile. 
</P>
<P>
 At Mary Jo's Beauty Boutique, there's an intriguing deal on facials. A gift 
certificate for $50 buys a one-hour deep-cleansing and rejuvenating facial. But 
if she brings a friend, it's two for the same price since Mary Jo Price, who 
also works at the Warner Bros. studio salon, charges by the hour and will give 
two complete facials in one hour's time. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Jo's Beauty Boutique, 13267 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. No credit cards. 
Hours: by appointment Monday to Saturday, also 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. today and 7 
a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday . (818) 995-3319. Geri Cook's Bargains column runs 
every Friday in Valley Life!

GIVING A LITTLE ENGLISH; AREA ESTABLISHMENTS PROVIDE ANGLOPHILES WITH A PROPER 
BRITISH EXPERIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH SHAER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Ruth Shaer is a Van Nuys writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American Anglophiles -- those souls devoted to all things English -- seeking 
to join the British in celebrating the traditional British Boxing Day on 
Monday, can choose from "wellie whanging," to taking tea or making a 
reservation to see a satirical British play. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxing Day is rooted in the 17th Century, when collection boxes were placed 
outside churches over the Christmas holidays. Collections ended Dec. 26, and 
the contents were given to the poor. By the 18th Century, the Christmas box 
represented gifts of money to servants and tradespeople. This practice has 
diminished over the years (along with servants) but the custom remains to give 
certain tradespeople -- such as dustmen (translation: sanitation workers) or 
mail carriers a Christmas box. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18th Century also spawned a Boxing Day tradition known as 
"wellie-whanging." "Wellies" are Wellington boots, named around 1817 after 
Arthur Wellesley, the first Duke of Wellington, who, on one occasion, is said 
to have thrown his boot at a servant. 
</P>
<P>
 This Boxing Day, Anglophiles can visit the Rose Tree Cottage and English 
Village in Pasadena to participate in wellie-whanging by throwing a wellie from 
50 paces at the English tea shop owner, Edmund Fry. "The whole thing is totally 
ridiculous," says Fry. "Everyone just has a good time and no one goes home 
miserable." MAYFLOWER CLUB "PANTO," NORTH HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
<P>
 Although the run of the traditional English pantomime or "panto" usually 
starts on Boxing Day, in the San Fernando Valley the Mayflower Club will 
present its 29th annual panto -- a satirical play that's a silly twist on a 
nursery rhyme -- beginning in late January. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, which started out as a British-American Club after World War II, is 
presenting "Hickory Dickory Dock," directed by Joel Mondeaux, the veteran 
American actor and director, with a cast of Brits and Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Panto is musical interactive family theater with a little Benny Hill-type 
bawdiness thrown in. It was conceived in the early 18th Century as a children's 
introduction to theater, in which nursery rhymes and fairy tales were produced 
on stage. To maintain the adults' interest, risque parts were added. Each panto 
comprises, among other cast members, a "dame," with a saucy sense of humor. The 
dame is traditionally played by a man in drag, harking back to Shakespearean 
times when all the actors were men, while the young hero is played by an 
attractive girl. ROSE TREE COTTAGE AND ENGLISH VILLAGE, PASADENA 
</P>
<P>
 Proprietors Edmund and Mary Fry -- he's English, she's American -- say the 
Rose Tree Cottage was the first English tearoom in the Los Angeles area. For 15 
years, they have served a mostly Anglophile clientele, with about 90% of the 
customers American and the remainder English.  
</P>
<P>
 At high tea, they serve the works -- finger sandwiches, scones baked in the 
Frys' bakery, homemade jam and real Devonshire cream. 
</P>
<P>
 The Frys visit England three times a year to stock their village shops with 
such wares as antique lace, Liberty of London fabrics, British foods, maps, 
guides and antique costume jewelry copied from the collections of the likes of 
Queen Victoria and Wallis Simpson, the Duchess of Windsor, and Sherlock Holmes 
hats and brollies (translation: umbrellas). The Frys make and sell their own 
jams, lemon curd (it's a British thing) and shortbread. HUNTINGTON LIBRARY, ART 
COLLECTIONS AND BOTANICAL GARDENS, SAN MARINO 
</P>
<P>
 Covering 130 acres of the 207-acre grounds, the 15 specialized gardens of the 
Huntington Library are arranged within an English park-like landscape of 
rolling lawns. Reminiscent of Olde England, there's a Shakespearean garden with 
Elizabethan York and Lancaster damask roses dating to 1551. 
</P>
<P>
 A man drapes himself casually over a bench, listening to the delicate 
trickling of a bird fountain. An arched trellis frames a delightful pathway 
adorned with a curtain of overhanging roses. As you walk along this path, it's 
easy -- and glorious -- to forget that there's a congested, noisy freeway only 
a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Jan. 15, the Huntington is presenting one of the finest collections of 
the pioneer of multimedia art, William Blake, a gifted poet, artist and 
printmaker. In his day (1757-1827), he was considered the quintessential 
eccentric Englishman. Today many may find his free-thinking, spiritual and 
artistic vision quite contemporary. After perusing the exhibit, stroll over to 
the Rose Garden Tea Room for an extremely proper English tea.

RELUCTANT NOVICE: FROM THE FRYING PAN . . .; INTO THE FIRE ISN'T SO BAD. A 
SHOCK AT FIRST, INTRODUCTION TO COOKING HAS ITS REWARDS, INCLUDING A SALAD TO 
GO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The home arts are not my strong point. My Teflon pan has cooked up far more 
burgers and hot dogs than it has omelets and stir-fry vegetables. It is thus 
with great apprehension and a cooking IQ lower than Tom Hanks' in the movie 
"Forrest Gump" that I drive up to the Westlake Culinary Institute for my first 
professional cooking class. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinning down the source of my anxiety is difficult. It seems to spring from as 
many holes as a pasta strainer's. Suddenly, I think of a thousand reasons why I 
shouldn't learn to cook. But the most convincing is simple and direct: I don't 
know the first thing about food or cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 I try to calm myself by thinking that Mozart could compose and play a sonata 
at age 5, but I'm pretty certain he couldn't bake a nifty German chocolate 
cake. With that comforting thought, I enter a retail cook's store called Let's 
Get Cookin'. It is here that the professional cooking series meets once a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, are you checked in?" asks Phyllis Vaccarelli, owner of the store and 
founder of the culinary institute. I snake my way past shelves crammed with 
odd-looking utensils to the classroom at the back. About a dozen students face 
a wall loaded with two floor-to-ceiling commercial refrigerators and a freezer, 
pantry cabinets and a double stainless-steel sink. 
</P>
<P>
 Our teacher arrives without fanfare. Cecilia De Castro is an attractive and 
diminutive Filipino woman with boundless energy and a passion for cooking and 
teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 With a degree in restaurant management and nutrition, she began and developed 
the UCLA cooking school program. Currently, she's a cooking consultant, caterer 
and teacher whose graduates are employed in California's best restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia has the students introduce themselves and describe their cooking 
ambitions. The majority are experienced cooks. There's Joseph, who runs a large 
kitchen of more than 10 chefs. Ron works for a restaurant's catering division. 
"I want to work at a restaurant in Maui," says John, a man in his 40s who's 
hoping to make the transition to cooking from a job with the phone company. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two students are homemakers who simply love to cook and have no 
pretensions of becoming the next Wolfgang Puck. I'm there simply because the 
whole process has always been so mystifying and indecipherable that I finally 
decided to try to break the code. 
</P>
<P>
 The first subject is health and sanitation. "Who knows at what temperature 
bacteria multiply?" asks Cecilia. I'm fascinated to learn the answer: Various 
bacteria can infect food between the temperatures of 40 and 165 degrees 
Fahrenheit. In general, the key to preventing infection is quick preparation 
and immediate cooking or refrigeration of the ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 I was always better at textbook learning than laboratory work, and I don't 
mind if we discuss bacteria for the rest of the time. We also learn about 
kitchen etiquette, such as never ever put a knife in the sink, and always say, 
"Behind you," to alert other kitchen workers to your whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Open your notebooks," Cecilia instructs. I was hoping we'd keep talking, but 
it's time for the first "practical" cooking exercise. Every class is preceded 
with a handout of that night's assignments. Tonight is salad night. 
</P>
<P>
 I am paired with Jan and Curtis. Jan is looking to enter the catering field; 
Curtis is an actor and model who would like to find a way to combine his two 
passions of food and motorcycle riding. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams are assigned one of three salads: Cobb, Caesar, and three-color 
rotelle (a kind of pasta) with roasted bell peppers. We've been assigned the 
Cobb. Jan instantly takes charge, like a head chef. "Don, you start preparing 
the vinaigrette a la moutard. " From what I can tell, if you know French, 
you're way ahead in this class. Unfortunately, I don't know a word. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "One more thing," Cecilia barks, as we scurry about the room gathering 
ingredients like ants at a picnic. "Make sure you make as many mistakes as you 
can. That's how you learn." 
</P>
<P>
 And I waste no time, mistakenly pouring the salad oil into the bowl containing 
the egg before whipping the yolk. The two emulsify. No matter how frenetically 
I whip, I cannot cajole these two ingredients into harmony. Jan wants me to 
start over. Instead, I fess up to Cecilia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Didn't you read the recipe directions?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, I answer that I did. Well, I did.  
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia shows how to easily repair this common problem. We all watch as she 
heats water in a pan, then slowly pours the separated mixture into the hot 
water, all the while whipping it. Like magic, the yolk and oil combine. 
</P>
<P>
 After seasoning my dressing to taste, I begin chopping and dicing ingredients 
like some kind of slice-o-matic invention gone mad. My julienne-sized cuts more 
closely resemble french fries than matchsticks. It's all I can do not to slice 
my fingers off with the Sabatier knives I purchased before class for a little 
more than $200. All I know is I've spent gobs of money on French cutlery with a 
500-year tradition, and I still can't chop a leaf. I'm in shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no," Cecilia says, gently guiding my hand. "Keep the tip of the knife on 
the table and let the weight of the heavy part of the blade do the work." My 
hand starts to get the rhythm. It's like a miracle has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, the salad is tossed with half the vinaigrette (the remainder will be 
served as a side dressing). Now comes The Presentation. It sounds easier than 
it is. As for the diced tomatoes, chicken, bacon, avocado and eggs, the recipe 
instructions read, "Arrange in strips on top of salad greens." Curtis piles on 
the first "strip" and Jan stops him. "Make each strip narrow and fairly 
straight," she says. Halfway through, I see that Jan is right. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia approves, and then draws the entire class's attention to our 
handiwork. But they're all too busy to notice. Being part of the Cobb team, 
though, I'm impressed. I've never seen a Cobb salad attractive enough to ask 
out for a date. After all the salads are presented, we dig in.  
</P>
<P>
 As I help clean up the mess we've made, I put some of my Cobb salad in a paper 
bowl to take with me. I'm elated, and I'm not exactly sure why. Making a Cobb 
salad is no big deal, but I have some satisfaction in knowing I could make 
another just as easily. And I have a sneaky pleasure. I want to make this for 
my friends, just to show off.

FOR KIDS; STIRRING CATHOLIC YOUTH; YOU! MAGAZINE, WITH ITS EMPHASIS ON FAITH IN 
CELEBRITIES' LIVES, SEEMS TO FILL FORMERLY NEGLECTED NEED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Jeff Schnaufer is a regular 
contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a slogan like "The Alternative Youth Magazine," readers might imagine the 
bull pen of YOU! Magazine in Westlake Village to be filled with the lingering 
scent of marijuana and staffed by foul-mouthed youths with more body piercings 
than Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavens, no. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, this unusual clan of writers, artists, etc. have banned smoking in 
the office, speak in tongues and pray the rosary daily to honor the real 
Madonna, the Virgin Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet YOU! staffers have every right to brand their product an alternative to 
the other Generation X magazines on the market. Although it has the same 
splashy graphics and celebrity interviews, YOU! touts itself as the only 
international youth magazine aimed at Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every other teen magazine I look at out there has one thing on its mind -- 
aesthetic beauty," said Chris Taleck, 25, from Tuscon, a graphic artist for 
YOU! "We go one step further. We bring issues into the light. And the readers 
respond to that." 
</P>
<P>
 With 45,000 paid subscribers in Latin America, Europe and the United States, 
YOU! has the numbers to back up this approach. 
</P>
<P>
 According to publisher Paul Lauer, YOU! is published in four languages 
(English, Spanish, German and Polish), has no competition from other Catholic 
youth magazines and rates well against Catholic publications aimed at adults. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the National Catholic Register, a weekly Catholic newspaper 
published in Sherman Oaks, has about 23,000 circulation, according to Catherine 
Calvin, its circulation manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other magazines, each issue of YOU! features film and music reviews, 
the latest pop culture trends, reader response columns and celebrity 
interviews. But what separates the magazine most from other publications is the 
way the interviews and articles bolster the Catholic faith by tackling modern 
issues from teen sex to bulimia. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the front cover, you won't know this is a religious 
publication," said Lauer, 32, pointing to the magazine covers featuring Kurt 
Cameron, Amy Grant, Joe Montana, Los Lobos and Harry Connick Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our forte has been interviewing celebrities of all kinds about their faith," 
Lauer said. "Once we've broken that wall and been able to get into a 
celebrity's faith, it has a tremendous impact on our young readers out there." 
</P>
<P>
 "The gospel message is simple to understand," Lauer said. "What is difficult 
is communicating the message in a language youths can understand. The reason 
YOU! magazine works is because we communicate the message in a language and a 
format that young people understand: pop culture. Movies, music, celebrities, 
sports. That's their language." 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa Cech agreed. She helps produce the 10,000-circulation German-language 
edition of the magazine in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many young people think the Catholic faith is boring," said Cech, 20, who is 
spending three months at the Westlake Village office learning new production 
techniques. "The magazine is a good chance to let them know that the Catholic 
faith is exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 This excitement is generated through a variety of features. While some are as 
unusual as articles on a sports-broadcasting nun or shark attacks, most focus 
on guiding youths over rough spots in their faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent examples include a guide to answering pro-choice arguments, a crash 
course in the world's faiths and a how-to column on avoiding sexual pressure 
from other teens -- all written by a rotating crew of staff writers. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the magazine follows the traditional Catholic line by bashing 
lesbianism and abortion, it also takes on social issues not yet addressed by 
the church. The June/July issue lauded a nationwide boycott of Calvin Klein 
products because of the firm's alleged use of anorexic-looking models. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is," wrote YOU! reporter Gina Davis, "advertising's portrayal of 
bone-thin models doesn't represent reality and could never reveal the true 
beauty that shines through each person's soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials have responded to the magazine with praise. Cardinal Roger M. 
Mahony of the Los Angeles Archdiocese said he is "impressed with the quality of 
YOU! magazine's content. It shows young people that it is possible to integrate 
their faith into their everyday lives, especially through features such as 
interviews with celebrities young people admire who are living their faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the magazine draws such advertisers as Domino's Pizza and Word, a 
Christian record label, many missionaries, monasteries and convents also seem 
to appreciate the magazine, as shown by the many advertisements recruiting 
youths. Mahony also sees the magazine stirring up future men and women to serve 
the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciate the magazine's emphasis on each of us answering Jesus' call to 
service," Mahony said. "I would expect that vocations to ministry in the church 
will have their origins in the pages of YOU!"  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the magazine's founder is a self-described former pagan who 
steam-rolled through Judaism, Buddhism, Christian Science and Christian 
fundamentalism before devoting himself to the Catholic faith in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more ironic, Lauer got his magazine idea off the ground with a boost from 
an Orthodox Jew. Starting with $3,000 left to him in his Jewish grandfather's 
will, Lauer left a career playing guitar in a rock band and used the experience 
that gained him a college degree in English literature to print his first issue 
in his parents' garage in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fell in love with the Catholic Church's structure and the clear meaning and 
guidance," Lauer said. "It's changed me for the better. I felt that this is the 
thing that other young people are searching for. The same void exists in the 
U.S. for young people as exists all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Lauer, Catholic adults have 626 publications to choose from to 
learn about their faith, while Catholic youths have only one: YOU! Magazine. To 
fill that void, Lauer seeks out the same people to run the magazine as those 
who read it. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruited from all over the world through the magazine's published appeals for 
help, youthful interns make up nearly all of his staff, committing themselves 
to one-year internships and housed with room and board in a Westlake Village 
condo rented out by Lauer. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the free rent, the nine interns on the staff of 12 are paid a 
small monthly stipend of $75. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not always easy for Lauer to pay even those small stipends, such as 
when Lauer's company, Veritas Communications Inc., was $50,000 short to publish 
the August/September issue. Thanks to a 17-year-old assistant controller named 
Keith Adams and a $50,000 grant from a Detroit benefactor, however, the YOU! 
bullpen got the magazine out. Despite such frantic episodes, Lauer contends 
that the financial picture is improving for his company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have run under an annual deficit that has been as high as $250,000 per 
year, but in 1995, it is only expected to be $170,000," he said. "We have 
always relied on large contributions from foundations and individuals to offset 
our annual deficit." 
</P>
<P>
 The young writers look at it as a learning experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of pressure, but I think it's easier when we are all working 
together," said Adams, who came to YOU! fresh out of high school in New 
Hampshire. "This is a good opportunity to learn about business and learn about 
my faith." 
</P>
<P>
 And there is no sin in that.

3-HOUR TOUR; IN GRAND STYLE; FENYES MANSION VISITORS STEP BACK IN TIME. THE 
ESTATE ALSO FEATURES FINNISH FOLK ART MUSEUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To visit the Fenyes Mansion is to step back into turn-of-the-century Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Eva S. Fenyes, an arts patron and artist, commis sioned architect Robert 
Farquhar to build the Beaux-Arts-style estate on Orange Grove Boulevard in 
1905. (The architect later became known for his 1927-28 design of Beverly Hills 
High School and his contributions to the Pentagon in Washington.) 
</P>
<P>
 Very little has changed since Fenyes furnished the home, even though three 
succeeding generations lived in the mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenyes, born Eva Scott in New York in 1849, was married to an Army general 
from 1878 until 1891, when she divorced him and resumed the travels throughout 
the East Coast and Europe that she had enjoyed before she married. She met 
Adalbert Fenyes in Cairo. They married in Hungary in 1896 and moved to Pasadena 
in 1897. 
</P>
<P>
 During her travels, Fenyes made sketches and painted. Her watercolors can be 
seen throughout the mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1946, Fenyes' granddaughter married Y. A. Paloheimo of Finland, who was 
appointed Finnish consul for Southern California the following year. The house 
became the area's first Finnish Consulate, serving that function until 1965. 
That year, the family decided to turn over its home to the Pasadena Historical 
Society, which has been promoting Pasadena history since 1924. 
</P>
<P>
 The society moved into the Fenyes Mansion in 1970. Pasadena declared the 
estate a cultural landmark in 1981, and it was placed on the National Register 
of Historic Places in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the society changed the estate's name to the Pasadena Historical 
Museum. It encompasses four buildings on the property, including the Fenyes 
Mansion, the Finnish Folk Art Museum and the new Research Library and Archives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fenyes Mansion and the Finnish Folk Art Museum are open for docent-guided 
tours Thursday through Sunday afternoons. The library is open during the same 
hours to anyone interested in learning about Pasadena history and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 This tour begins in the Fenyes Mansion, but history buffs may want to bring 
along a notepad and pen or laptop computer for an extended stay in the library. 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 2 p.m.: Enter the front door of the 23-room home. All the draperies and 
carpets are original. The woodwork is mahogany. 
</P>
<P>
 Furniture from all over the world lends charm to the foyer, whose floors are 
covered with well-preserved Persian rugs. The date 1613 is carved into the 
front panel of a small chest from Germany. A 16th-Century chest from Spain with 
secret compartments was reputedly used to hide valuables during the Spanish 
Inquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on view in the foyer is the tall, grand "Raymond Hotel Clock" from the 
old hotel that once overlooked the city. Within its wooden cabinet are slides 
of colored glass depicting scenes from early Pasadena, including the Rose 
Parade. This served as a "travel brochure" for hotel guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the dining room to find portraits of Eva Fenyes, her daughter and 
granddaughter, both at the age of 5, and the Paloheimo children. The kitchen 
remains much as it was when the house was built except for a more modern stove 
and refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 Go up the sweeping main staircase (as opposed to the servants' back stairway, 
close by) to a sitting room with good-sized windows on its western wall. Opened 
in the afternoon, they brought in the sea breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs, you can also view a child's bedroom with a replica of an English 
Windsor chair and a wicker crib with an antique crazy quilt. A master bedroom 
sports a ceiling fixture once connected for both gas and electricity, a 
knitting table and a rope hanging on the wall that was to function as a fire 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Downstairs again, you'll cross the foyer to enter the hallway, lined with 
books and art objects, that leads to the northern side of the mansion. On its 
walls are paintings of Fenyes' daughter and granddaughter when they were 20 and 
16, respectively. Throughout the house are paintings by several well-known 
Californian and American painters of Fenyes' day, including Benjamin Brown, 
Granville Redmond and William Merritt Chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, turn into Consul Paloheimo's office, which is filled with rare books in 
Finnish and English. But it's the authentic, early-1900s Tiffany desk lamp that 
stands out from the office memorabilia. It was made when Tiffany was still 
personally directing the production of his studio products. There is also a 
Tiffany studios glass and bronze picture frame on display. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the hall is the sitting room, originally Fenyes' bedroom, which 
contains an American Empire mahogany sleigh bed in a Napoleonic design. This 
room leads to the large living room, with its Steinway grand piano and Louis XV 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the living room is the 1911 addition to the mansion. The solarium was 
used as a greenhouse. Today it exhibits many fine examples of 
turn-of-the-century pottery by Artus VanBriggle. 
</P>
<P>
 From the solarium, you'll enter Fenyes' studio. Its large windows allowed for 
plenty of light while she painted. There's another Tiffany lamp, a Victrola 
still full of 78s and a cage for the family's pet marmoset. The room was also 
designed for entertaining: A stage was built with a trap door and spiral 
staircase. Above the stage is a minstrels gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 2 p.m.: Go downstairs to see a small exhibit on the Mt. Lowe Railway, which 
was opened in 1893 to take people into the mountains by cable car. A small 
museum store carries cards, gift items and books. 
</P>
<P>
 2:40 p.m.: Take a stroll through the gardens behind the mansion. Roses may be 
in bloom, and there are peach and other trees. 
</P>
<P>
 2:50 p.m.: Beyond the garden is the Finnish Folk Art Museum. Founded in 1974 
by the Paloheimos, it is the only exhibit of its kind outside Finland. In it is 
an inviting, traditional Finnish sauna. The front room is a re-created tupa , 
or smoke cabin, found in 19th-Century Finland. Among the objects on view are a 
cradle, spinning wheel and butter churn, all made of wood, and a brick hearth. 
Another room displays farmhouse furnishings and ryijy rugs -- shaggy pile rugs 
that are well-known Finnish textile products. 
</P>
<P>
 3:10 to 4 p.m.: Spend time in the Research Library and Archives. Scan some of 
its 750,000 photographs of Pasadena and the surrounding area. There are also 
postcards, glass slides and stereoscopic pictures. Peruse its reference 
materials on Pasadena and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Early periodicals include California Southland/California Arts and 
Architecture, Out West and Pacific Monthly. City street maps, travel brochures 
and political flyers date to the 19th Century. Among special collections are 
the Pasadena Olympic Stars collection and the Tournament of Roses collection of 
programs and pictorials. The library also maintains a file of local news 
clippings and a manuscript file with diaries and correspondence.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: AIRPORT SERVICE AND LEASES ARE PRAISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The department that oversees Ventura County's two airports has improved 
customer service and made significant progress in leasing vacant property, but 
can do more to improve airport management, according to a county audit released 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport Administrator Rodney Murphy, who took over the job in May, is credited 
with several improvements made at the Oxnard and Camarillo airports, says the 
report by Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, customer service was greatly enhanced by expanding parking at 
the Oxnard Airport, establishing a noise complaint hot line and increasing 
involvement in annual public open houses at both airports. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit also praised the Department of Airports for its recent success in 
securing four long-term leases of vacant airport property. 
</P>
<P>
 But the report found several areas where improvements could be made. For 
example, the audit found that the department, which has an annual budget of 
$7.1 million, has been lax in collecting overdue lease payments and lacks a 
policy to charge airport tenants for hazardous waste cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
 More oversight is also needed in collecting various airport fees, monitoring 
capital improvement projects and submitting claims for state and federal 
grants, the audit found. In addition, the audit recommended that the department 
impose a $3 passenger fee -- already approved by the federal government -- to 
help pay for airport improvements.  
</P>
<P>
 Murphy could not be reached for comment, but Mahon said corrective action is 
already being taken in each of these areas. He said that improving airport 
management is vital to the county's efforts to lure additional businesses and 
industry to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Airport serves 92,000 passengers a year through three commercial 
airlines and is home to 120 privately owned aircraft. Camarillo Airport is a 
major provider of business transportation with 575 privately owned aircraft.

 Five Ventura County agencies have been awarded $87,000 under a new state grant 
program aimed at encouraging local strategies to fight homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Housing and Community Development gave Turning Point 
Foundation $40,000.Project Understanding and the Salvation Army received 
$13,580 each, while Lutheran Social Services received $10,000 and Catholic 
Charities/Ventura Mental Health received $9,840. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's new Emergency Housing and Assistance Program is part of a state 
strategy to move homeless people from shelters to self-support as soon as 
possible. Grant money is used for shelter operation and construction, rental 
assistance and counseling and training. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state is attempting to move beyond simply providing emergency shelter and 
to focus on helping the homeless help themselves through counseling, substance 
abuse treatment where necessary and job training," said state Housing Director 
Timothy L. Coyle. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said they expect to award $6 million in homeless grants 
statewide during the current fiscal year. JAN STEVENS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; REDEVELOPMENT PANEL APPROVES 5-YEAR PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard Redevelopment Agency has approved a five-year, $15.7-million plan 
to spruce up the city's downtown, Southwinds and Ormond Beach areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal comes in response to a recent state law requiring every 
redevelopment agency to provide a detailed five-year implementation strategy 
that outlines where its money is going and how it will alleviate blight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council acts as the city's Redevelopment Agency, which uses 
tax revenues and issues bonds to boost fading communities. The five-year plan 
includes projects ranging from fixing up building facades downtown to restoring 
wetlands at Ormond Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The city report approved this week detailed ways in which Oxnard could build 
more housing for low- and moderate-income residents within its four 
redevelopment areas -- two in downtown Oxnard, one at Ormond Beach and one in 
the Southwinds neighborhood in south Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also discussed possible sites for replacement housing in case the 
city's plans force people out of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Club members have objected to plans to redevelop Ormond Beach, arguing 
that the area is mainly made up of wetlands and open space and does not have 
much blight. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Oxnard Mayor Jane Tolmach questioned the motives for scheduling the 
discussion five days before Christmas, adding that redevelopment is widely 
opposed by the city's residents and is financially risky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last week, you hastily staged a possibly failed coup d'etat to get rid of the 
Planning Commission," Tolmach said. "Today, you charge ahead with adopting a 
five-year redevelopment implementation plan, which will greatly increase the 
indebtedness of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members expressed concern about $9.7 million allocated for 
administrative costs and asked for a more detailed explanation of how that 
money would be spent. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SAN MIGUEL ISLAND; FISHERMAN FOUND SAFE BY COAST 
GUARD 
</P>

<P>
 A missing commercial fisherman was found safe Thursday off San Miguel Island 
after a search by Coast Guard officials, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Carney, 42, of Thousand Oaks, who returned home Thursday, was reported 
missing Wednesday after he was two days overdue from a commercial fishing 
outing, Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carney's wife notified authorities Wednesday night, concerned because the 
fisherman had already postponed his return once due to fierce winds and 
turbulent seas off the coast of San Miguel Island, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
 After nightlong efforts to reach Carney by radio, the Coast Guard command in 
Long Beach dispatched a search plane and rescue helicopter to find the 40-foot 
trawler. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than 90% of the time, overdue people are not in distress, but we cannot 
take chances," Coast Guard Petty Officer Eric Dee Jager said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy was supposed to be back Monday and we couldn't reach him by radio, 
so the most prudent thing was to send up the aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
 After a morning-long search Thursday, pilots spotted Carney's craft anchored 
in a cove off San Miguel Island. He had been waiting for the storm system that 
has generated recent rough swells to pass and had not been monitoring his 
radio, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The search operation cost about $5,000 and will not be billed to the Carneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always smart to call us in when a boat is overdue, especially in this 
kind of weather," Dee Jager said. "We're just happy this one ended the way it 
did." MATTHEW MOSK

<P>
 A suspected Thousand Oaks gang member and an 18-year-old Oxnard man suffered 
minor injuries in a scuffle involving as many as a dozen teen-agers at The Oaks 
mall, sheriff's deputies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The short-lived, possibly gang-related melee, involving rival groups from 
Thousand Oaks and Oxnard, started Wednesday night outside a video arcade and 
poured out the north entrance of the Thousand Oaks mall, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 While on foot patrol, a security guard radioed for assistance and a sheriff's 
deputy who was there on another call responded immediately.  
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers scattered in the parking lot as four sheriff's cruisers 
converged. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old Thousand Oaks youth, who suffered a split lip, did not wish to 
file a complaint, nor did his 18-year-old rival and another 17-year-old Oxnard 
youth, Sgt. Mike De Los Santos said. GREG RIPPEE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; MAN SUSPECTED IN CHILD MOLESTATIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley man suspected of molesting three children in fast-food 
restaurants is scheduled to appear for a preliminary hearing today in Van Nuys, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael John Fellows, 46, was arrested in Los Angeles Dec. 12 following a 
two-month investigation of an incident at a McDonald's in Simi Valley and two 
incidents at a McDonald's and a Carl's Jr. in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellows is being held in Los Angeles County Jail in lieu of $300,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the incident in Simi Valley was reported Oct. 18. An 
8-year-old girl was standing at the sink in the women's restroom when a man 
came in, knelt by the girl and licked her leg, authorities said. The man then 
asked the girl for a kiss, but she refused and left, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellows was later identified as a suspect in that incident, police said. Simi 
police shared information they obtained in the case with the Los Angeles Police 
Department, which led to Fellows' arrest by the LAPD, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellows is also accused of molesting a 9-year-old girl in the women's restroom 
of a Carl's Jr. restaurant in the Valley, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 He is also under investigation for a molestation involving a 4-year-old girl 
in Northridge. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; VACANT DISCOUNT STORE TO BE RAZED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Owners of an earthquake-damaged Pic 'N' Save, which neighbors have complained 
about since the Jan. 17 temblor, have decided to tear down the crumbling Simi 
Valley discount store. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the city dated Dec. 19, Mark J. Ellis, director of construction 
and store planning for Pic 'N' Save, said demolition is scheduled for early 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will begin demolition after the first of the year," Ellis wrote. "I will 
be finalizing bids in the next few weeks so we can start the project early in 
the year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pic 'N' Save and a neighboring building that housed a Sears store on Tapo 
Street have stood vacant since the quake, attracting transients and vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, residents who live near the stores signed a petition asking the 
city to force the owners to repair or replace the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council set a deadline of one year after the quake for work to begin 
on repairing or removing the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of the Sears store property have not yet announced their plans for 
the building. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COURT REJECTS REVIEW OF COHAN 
DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appellate court has refused a request by Thousand Oaks to revisit a 
ruling made last month which said the City Council unfairly denied a developer 
his rights to build a Newbury Park project. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's refusal Tuesday to rehear the case brought by developer Albert 
Cohan and his family was viewed by the Cohans as a victory, but by no means the 
end of the 15-year battle they have waged with Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this means to us is that we are going to get a project," Cohan said. 
"But they could still appeal to the Supreme Court and hold us up for another 
three months." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling by the 2nd 
District Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands, the court's decision could open up the city to a 
multimillion-dollar lawsuit. Already, the Cohans have threatened to seek 
damages for revenue lost to years of delay on their proposed 47-acre 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling also appeared to limit the tools cities can use to block 
development projects, causing a ripple of alarm among city officials throughout 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The court Tuesday included three pages of modifications to its original 
ruling. It specifically addressed a common practice in Thousand Oaks whereby 
the City Council can choose to appeal Planning Commission rulings to itself, as 
it did in the Cohan case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our holding should not be read as invalidating all appeals taken by a city 
council or other governing body to itself from a decision of a subordinate 
agency," the court states. 
</P>
<P>
 It goes on to say that the city should have provided the Cohans with an 
explanation for the appeal. The justices also held that an individual elected 
official could have made the appeal and then removed himself from voting on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think perhaps the court or judge is trying to backpedal a little," 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cohan's attorney, Wendy Lascher, said the added paragraphs about the 
appeal process bolstered the original ruling. MARY F. POLS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; HOLIDAY TREES TO BE RECYCLED AT 6 
SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting Dec. 26, residents who want to recycle their Christmas trees can do 
so at six Thousand Oaks locations. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who would rather keep the tree around for a while, the city will 
accept trees until Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The six locations are Borchard Park Service Center, 250 Reino Road, Newbury 
Park; Triunfo Community Park, 980 Aranmoor Ave., Westlake Village; Cal Lutheran 
University, Mount Clef Boulevard and Olsen Road; Home Depot, 500 N. Ventu Park 
Road; Park & Ride at Janss Road and the Moorpark Freeway, and Park & Ride, 
Rancho Road at the Moorpark Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's public works department asks that trees be stripped of all 
ornaments and tinsel and that nails and stands be removed. The trees will be 
hauled to the Calabasas landfill and turned into mulch to be used throughout 
the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, residents recycled more than 13,000 noble and Douglas firs and pine 
trees, Mayor Jaime Zukowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you recycle your Christmas tree, you are helping the environment by 
keeping a valuable resource out of the landfill," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trees that are flocked, painted or fire-proofed will not be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call the city's Recycling Hotline at 449-SAVE. MARY F. POLS

ARROYO TOAD DECLARED ENDANGERED; WILDLIFE: MOVE AFFECTS RECREATIONAL USE AT 
SOME CAMPGROUNDS AND CREEKS. GOLD MINERS CONSIDER A SUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 The arroyo toad has received status as an endangered species, a move that will 
make permanent restrictions on the use of some campgrounds and creeks in 
Ventura County's backcountry, federal biologists announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The listing, which takes effect Jan. 17, puts portions of Piru Creek 
off-limits to motorcycle riders, gold miners and other recreational users 
during the breeding season, federal biologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also closes portions of Lyon and Beaver campgrounds to motor vehicles, 
requiring campers to haul their gear to those sites by foot. And Snowy Trail, a 
popular motorcycle path near Hungry Valley State Vehicular Recreation Area, 
remains closed as biologists and rangers try to reach agreement on where a 
crossing over sensitive Piru Creek should be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Protection for the toad (Bufo microscaphus californicus) is necessary because 
degradation of its habitat has reduced the once-thriving species to perilously 
low numbers, said Sam Sweet, a UC Santa Barbara biologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Once widely distributed in coastal Southern California rivers, the arroyo toad 
has vanished from about 75% of its former range, said Sweet, an international 
expert on the species. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, there were as few as 350 adult toads in the Los Padres National 
Forest, Sweet said. That number has rebounded to about 2,000 today, but the 
species remains fragile, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arroyo toad is simply one of many animals that are disappearing," Sweet 
said. "Other species that live near it are also in danger of disappearing. If 
we value stream corridors and riparian areas, this is what we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But recreational-use advocates said Thursday that they are disappointed by the 
decision, published Dec. 16 in the Federal Register by U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service biologists. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials did not properly evaluate the economic impact of the listing 
in their environmental analysis, said Barret Wetherby, president of Public 
Lands for the People. 
</P>
<P>
 The listing also does not take into account the historic rights of gold miners 
to prospect on streams in which they have a stake, Wetherby said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many agencies in the state and federal government seem to enjoy closing 
down land to the public," said Wetherby, whose Azusa-based group represents 600 
recreational gold miners, off-road vehicle enthusiasts, hikers and campers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we won't give it up without a fight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His group is considering a lawsuit that would fight the designation based on 
the environmental study and its apparent clash with a 122-year-old federal 
mining law, Wetherby said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1872 Mining Law allows prospectors to make a gold claim on public lands if 
the claim is filed with the Bureau of Land Management. Miners have hundreds of 
such claims along Piru Creek alone, Wetherby said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said federal biologists also underestimated the natural processes that have 
threatened the toad, including droughts, animal predators and small population 
sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the arroyo toad population today is found in the Los Padres Forest in 
the backcountry of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, biologists say. But 
smaller, isolated populations are also found in Los Angeles, Orange, San 
Bernardino, Riverside and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Most campers will not notice anything different after the listing takes effect 
because much of the precautionary measures set up to protect the toad have 
already been instituted, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Snowy Trail has been closed since 1990 because it crosses Piru Creek near an 
arroyo toad breeding area. Forest officials are close to an agreement that 
would allow the trail to reopen if the crossing is moved away from the 
sensitive habitat, said Cat Brown, a biologist in the Ventura office of the 
Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The restrictions at Lyon and Beaver campgrounds have also been effect for 
several years, Brown said. Adult arroyo toads are nocturnal and forage for food 
late at night, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campers in the past have arrived in cars at night and flattened the toads, 
Brown said. The camp sites that are off-limits to vehicles have helped 
alleviate that problem, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest rangers have also posted signs at all campgrounds warning about the 
toad's sensitive breeding grounds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown disputed Wetherby's assertion that human rights are being trampled by 
the endangered species listing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not our goal to close down the forest or the creeks," she said. "It's 
our goal to find a balance."

SIMI FIRES CONTRACTOR FOR CULTURAL ARTS CENTER; CONSTRUCTION: CITY SAYS THE 
FIRM HAS POORLY MANAGED THE PROJECT AND HAS FALLEN MONTHS BEHIND IN PAYMENTS TO 
SOME SUBCONTRACTORS. 
</P>

<P>
 Two months before the planned opening of Simi Valley's long-awaited Cultural 
Arts Center, the city has fired the general contractor on the $2.6-million job, 
saying the project has been poorly managed and subcontractors have not been 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
 TriCon, the Van Nuys-based contractor hired by the city in May, has produced 
poor-quality work and is several months behind in payments to some of its 
subcontractors, said Bob Heitzman, deputy city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 TriCon had agreed to complete the renovation of a 70-year-old church on Los 
Angeles Avenue by the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
 But the project stalled when work had to be redone and subcontractors refused 
to complete their assignments until overdue payments were made, Heitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a high level of concern in the last 60 days about progress and 
over the fact that the subcontractors have not been paid," Heitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Pope, a spokesman for TriCon, acknowledged that some work had to be 
repeated and that some contractors have not received pay. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pope blamed the city for the late payments to the subcontractors, saying 
TriCon has not been paid since September. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were unfairly treated" by the city, Pope said. "We are the contractor and 
we are responsible for getting the job done. It is our job to determine how 
that happens. I think (the city was) overly picky." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has paid TriCon $630,000 and is withholding an additional $200,000 
for October and November until the subcontractors are paid, Heitzman said. 
TriCon owes the subcontractors an estimated $90,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is not responsible for any increase in cost on the project, Heitzman 
said. Instead, an insurance company that bonded the contractor will cover 
additional expenses incurred in completing the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance company could choose to hire a new contractor, rehire the 
existing company and monitor its work closely or ask the city to choose a new 
contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Work should resume on the project within two weeks, Heitzman said, though it 
is unclear when the project will be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton called the delay "unfortunate" but said he is pleased with 
the way the city is handling the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what we had here was a management problem, and I think we're taking 
care of it," Stratton said. "Fortunately it's not going to increase the cost of 
the project to the city." 
</P>
<P>
 When completed, the center, which is funded with city redevelopment money, 
will house a 300-seat hall, a smaller theater, an art gallery and a community 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 The city became aware of problems with the project during routine inspections 
in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the columns in front of the building was crooked, and the concrete had 
to be repoured. Also a concrete slab at the back of the property was made the 
wrong size. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a fire sprinkler system was installed too soon and became a 
nuisance during subsequent work, while steel supports for the balcony were not 
installed early enough, so framing had to be redone to accommodate it later in 
the construction process, Heitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these things slowed down the work on the project," Heitzman said. "But 
we're hoping to have things back on track very soon."

SENTRY CORPS MAINTAINS WATCH OVER HOLIDAY SHOPPERS AT MALL; SECURITY: ON THE 
LOOKOUT FOR CRIME, FOUR MEN TRADE SIX-HOUR SHIFTS IN A TOWER THAT CAN SWAY LIKE 
A SHIP ABOVE A PARKING LOT AT THE OAKS. 
</P>

<P>
 From his sentry platform high above The Oaks mall parking lot, an accountant 
who once served communists blinked away the reflections of a thousand 
windshields as shoppers scurried toward Robinsons-May. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to start in this country," said Vasile Savuleascu, 44, who until 
1993 was an adviser for the national bank in his native Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is a part-time security guard for the mall on weekends -- and an 
accountant for a health clinic during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need money for my family," the Thousand Oaks man said, referring to his 
wife and teen-age daughter. "I also am here to earn money for Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Busied with the press of cars and bodies by day, cold and alone by night, a 
tiny corps of four watchmen trade six-hour shifts atop scaffolding that can 
sway like a ship above the mall's east parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, bundled in neon-orange jackets and armed with walkie-talkies and 
binoculars, stand vigil as they scan the lot for car burglars and thieves. They 
also help start dead engines and lead disoriented shoppers to their cars. They 
help mothers locate lost children and rescue motorists who have locked 
themselves out of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're people from all walks of life, people with good jobs beside this," 
said Joe Baxter, 61, director of security for The Oaks. "Some of them have a 
lot better job than I have." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Savuleascu, those who scale a steel ladder to the watch tower 
include an ex-Marine, a car detailer and a concert hall guard. One of them 
holds down three jobs, three of them hold down two. All work 60 hours a week or 
more. All must be painstakingly patient. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about being up here for hours," said Newbury Park resident 
Corey Rhodes, 26, a Marine Corps reservist based in Port Hueneme. "But you're 
always alert, and it takes special training to do that. It takes a special kind 
of discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 As a corporal whose tour on Okinawa began on Christmas Day, 1990, Rhodes has 
put in his time on guard duty. 
</P>
<P>
 So has Savuleascu, who briefly served in the Romanian army. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have known the solitude and the monotony that bind sentinels the world 
over -- and that can be punctuated by sudden bursts of action. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent incident involved a donnybrook among four teen-age girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Vasquez, at 5 feet, 4 inches tall and 150 pounds, is built like a truck 
piston. But like any prudent security guard, the 22-year-old Thousand Oaks man 
knows his limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four girls for me was too much," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing two girls jump two others, Vasquez took off across the parking 
lot but made sure he immediately radioed for help. Both the mall security 
patrol and sheriff's deputies responded, but not before Vasquez pulled one 
victim away from the melee and scared off an assailant who had been kicking and 
pulling the hair of another sobbing girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Victorio, 29, of Oxnard said he too has had his confrontations -- but from 
afar. One involved a carload of youths who appeared to be patrolling the lot 
for a car to burglarize or steal. Irked when they saw him, they sped away amid 
a whirl of curses and contemptuous salutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime probably slows down at Christmas because we have so many people working 
(security)," Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard tower typically is erected in October or November and is dismantled 
after New Year's Day. The 5-by-8-foot loft, guarded by plywood parapets and 
crowned by a wood roof, rises from a steel network two stories above the 
blacktop. And whoever walks it is cut to the bone by the night wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say it's cold down there," said Victorio as he watched a woman hurrying 
to her car, her shoulders hunched against the night. "They ought to see how 
cold it is up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhodes, after taking over the watch with the arrival of nightfall, said his 
time is governed by the needs of his bosses. From 5:45 a.m. to just before 
noon, Rhodes supervises the stocking of merchandise at a nearby department 
store. From noon to 6 p.m., he works in the guard shack. Two nights a week, he 
attends Moorpark College. One night, he works the tower. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I've wanted to do, to get background experience in security, 
to back up my military background," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez, who wants to be a full-time security patrolman, said he details cars 
at a Thousand Oaks dealership and works about 65 hours a week between his two 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Victorio, eager to surprise his siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces with his 
Christmas bounty, has taken on security jobs at a concert theater in Ventura, a 
credit union in Camarillo and at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty much an all-work, no-play type of guy," he said. "At least my bank 
account is 'sufficient funds.' "

MEXICAN FINANCIAL UPHEAVAL; THE PESO -- PROFIT AND PAIN; CONSUMER IMPACT: U.S. 
IS THE WINNER, MEXICO THE LOSER -- AT LEAST FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Winners and losers in Mexico's fiscal crisis strolled through the light rain 
in this border city Thursday, trying to balance their personal ledgers and 
reassess their Christmas plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Tijuana car salesman Fabrizio Maldonado, for example, said the devaluation of 
the Mexican peso means he might have to forgo that $900 Christmas necklace he 
was planning to buy in San Diego for his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 And his used-car business is hurting: Fewer Tijuanans will be able to afford 
the cars he buys for dollars in the United States and transports back for sale 
in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Bonnie Rodriguez of Marina del Rey planned to make a 
special stop in Tijuana to load up on leather goods and blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 And Laura Cruz, an immigrant living in Santa Monica who sent $300 to her 
mother in Mexico to buy Christmas presents, was, in effect, sending her 
significantly more than that. "At least this money can help a little more," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Dick Harris of San Diego, who makes twice-weekly forays to wager 
at Tijuana's off-track betting parlors. He said the devaluation didn't rattle 
him: "I'll keep coming. I place my bets in dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 One way or the other, the peso devaluation ordered by the new government of 
President Ernesto Zedillo is already having a striking and direct impact on the 
millions of Americans and Mexicans whose lives and jobs are tied to the border, 
though the effects are as varied as the many facets of the border economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Those profiting are U.S. consumers buying goods in Mexico with dollars that 
have gained about a third in purchasing power over the last three days. 
Conversely, Mexican shoppers who are in the habit of buying goods and services 
in the United States have lost that much and more. Some money exchange houses 
in San Ysidro were demanding 5.1 pesos per dollar Thursday -- up about 45% from 
a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 More unsettling for many Mexicans now living in the United States was the 
message of turmoil and instability in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 At One Stop Immigration in Los Angeles, a community-based organization that 
provides legal and education services for immigrants, the office has been 
flooded with worried immigrants over the last few days who are concerned about 
losing real estate, bank accounts and other possessions in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "What (people) are concerned about is that they know this political 
instability is bad," Executive Director Jose Gutierrez said. " . . . They're 
worried that all the promises of the Mexican government will go up in smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 The devaluation was partly aimed at persuading Mexican consumers to buy more 
goods in Mexico instead of the United States, to ease the growing trade surplus 
the United States has enjoyed with Mexico since passage of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 By making U.S. goods and supplies more expensive for Mexican consumers and 
factories, the devaluation should eventually stimulate the Mexican economy, 
said John Williamson, fellow at the Institute for International Economics in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes Mexican goods more competitive, and that's one of the purposes," 
Williamson said.  
</P>
<P>
 But paying the price are U.S. retailers and service providers accustomed to 
selling to Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our local economy is based on Mexico, and suddenly it will take more pesos to 
come and buy our goods and services," said Eliud Garcia, executive vice 
president of International Bank of Commerce in Laredo, Tex. "So there is going 
to be a decline in sales here if the devaluation holds up at this level." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Stolley, general manager of the 116-store La Plaza shopping mall in 
McAllen, Tex., where 35% of customers are Mexican, said he expects any negative 
impact to be short-lived. The loss in spending power that Mexicans suffered in 
past devaluations was soon regained in wage increases, Stolley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, devaluations may have hurt us for a couple of weeks, but then 
they get more pesos and they come back and buy. The fact is, we still have 
products that might sell for 30%, 40% or 50% less than over there," Stolley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But until those kinds of market adjustments are made, Mexican shoppers can 
look forward to confusion and leaner times -- despite a government-ordered 
freeze on wages and prices for 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Estrada, spokeswoman for the Tijuana Tourism and Convention Bureau, 
said stores in the city's bustling Avenida Revolucion shopping district were 
already raising prices Thursday to reflect the more powerful dollar -- a double 
blow to Tijuanans shopping for Christmas presents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is out of control. This is very sad for Tijuanans who have been 
saving money all year to buy presents. Only people who have a lot of money are 
not affected by this," Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
 But many Tijuanans crossing into San Diego on Thursday said the devaluation 
wouldn't stop them from shopping in the United States, where they say the 
prices and quality of many items are still superior to those in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The devaluation is expected to make many Mexican food staples whose prices are 
controlled by the government dramatically cheaper for dollar shoppers. In fact, 
past devaluations have led to hoarding of some Mexican supermarket items by 
U.S. shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lloyd Butler, a disabled veteran who is one of thousands of expatriate 
Americans living in the Tijuana area, doesn't expect those costs to stay down 
for long. 'They'll jack the prices up in a week or two, just like they did the 
last time they had one of these."

MEXICAN FINANCIAL UPHEAVAL; THE PESO -- PROFIT AND PAIN; BUSINESS IMPACT: 
FOREIGN INVESTMENTS, CONFIDENCE IN COUNTRY'S ECONOMY SHAKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mexican fiscal crisis has eroded the value of dozens of U.S. mutual funds 
and prompted American firms to re-evaluate their investment plans, undermining 
international confidence in Mexico's economy less than a year after the signing 
of a free-trade pact that brought high hopes for a new era of prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 A wide range of foreign investors -- ranging from corporate giants such as 
Ford Motor Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to individual mutual fund investors -- 
have been shaken by the surprising devaluation of the Mexican peso, which has 
dropped more than 30% in value against the U.S. dollar in only two days. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no longer the trust" in the Mexican market, said Carlos J. 
Valderrama, who advises U.S. and Mexican firms on partnerships and business 
deals. "Some clients who were planning to invest in Mexico indicated to me that 
they will hold off for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the peso continued to plummet after the Mexican government said 
it will no longer control the value of the currency, instead allowing it to 
float freely against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of fears that the devaluation might damage the Mexican economy, the 
turmoil in currency trading quickly spread to the Mexican stock market, where 
foreigners own an estimated $50.4 billion worth of shares -- or 26% of the 
total market. Though the Mexican stock market rose Thursday, the falling peso 
translated into continued losses for American investors. 
</P>
<P>
 In U.S. financial markets, the shares of Mexican firms suffered, as did the 
stocks of American companies heavily involved in Mexico and Latin America. 
Telefonos de Mexico's American depositary receipts fell $4.25 to $40.75, 
Citicorp was down $2 to $41.25, Coca-Cola dropped $1.25 to $51.125 and 
Colgate-Palmolive fell $1.375 to $61.75. 
</P>
<P>
 Several U.S. mutual funds with substantial Mexican and Latin American holdings 
have lost nearly 10% of their value since the crisis began.  
</P>
<P>
 "The surprise (devaluation) has resulted in a very large loss of confidence in 
the government," said William Truscott, portfolio manager of the Scudder Latin 
America Fund, which has lost about 8% of its value in two days. As a result, 
investors will probably focus more on Brazil or Argentina next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our outlook has certainly changed on Mexico, and it's changed to the 
negative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The peso's fall from grace is being closely tracked by U.S. and Mexican firms 
that have expanded into each other's markets to take advantage of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, which lifted many trade barriers. The weaker 
peso will make exporting to Mexico more expensive and reduce the value of 
investments in that nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, might delay the opening of some Sam's 
Clubs and Super Centers in Mexico should the devaluation lead to inflation or 
possibly a recession, said J.J. Fitzsimmons, vice president of finance for the 
company.  
</P>
<P>
 "If the consumer economy is weak, it will clearly affect our business down 
there," said Fitzsimmons, whose firm already operates 33 stores in Mexico in 
partnership with Cifra, a giant Mexican retailer, and plans to open another 25 
in 1995. "But we will not cancel any project that we have started." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the much-heralded benefits of NAFTA to many U.S. firms have been 
undercut. Increased exports of U.S. products to Mexico under the trade pact 
have been credited with creating thousands of American jobs, but now those 
products -- cars, for example -- will be far less competitive in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The devaluation will erase some of the gains Ford had expected in exporting an 
estimated 25,000 U.S.- and Canadian-made vehicles a year to Mexico. Previously, 
those cars had been made in an inefficient Ford factory near Mexico City, where 
all Ford cars sold in Mexico were manufactured under laws abolished when the 
free-trade pact was enacted.  
</P>
<P>
 Now the peso has fallen and "those cars will be more expensive," Ford 
spokesman Al Chambers said. "This is disruptive." 
</P>
<P>
 John Labatt Ltd., a Canadian brewery, said its 22% stake in Mexican brewer 
Femsa Cerveza had dropped nearly $148 million in value since the financial 
crisis began. The Toronto-based company had just bought the stake for $510 
million in September. 
</P>
<P>
 But the effect on U.S. firms will not necessarily be bad. 
</P>
<P>
 In Palm Desert, Richard J. Heckmann, president of U.S. Filter Corp., which 
manufactures water treatment plants, spent Thursday morning reassuring some 
employees worried about the fate of a small but fast-growing number of Mexican 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just telling them it's business as usual," Heckmann said. His firm does 
not take out any profits from Mexico and its contracts can be adjusted to take 
currency fluctuations into account. In fact, Heckmann said, his firm stands to 
benefit because it buys supplies in Mexico with U.S. dollars, which have gained 
purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would be the time to buy equipment, and this is the time to sign 
contracts if they are dollar-denominated," Heckmann said.

U.S., CANADA MOVE TOWARD AVIATION PACT; TRAVEL: THE COUNTRIES AGREE IN 
PRINCIPLE ON A NEW ACCORD EXPECTED TO LEAD TO LOWER FARES AND MORE FREQUENT 
FLIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States and Canada have agreed in principle on a new aviation accord 
expected to offer lower fares and more frequent flights to millions of 
travelers between the two countries, U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico 
Pena announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord, still a few months from completion as details are worked out, will 
supplant a 28-year-old pact that has protected Canadian airlines to the 
detriment of U.S. carriers and passengers. Los Angeles travelers can look 
forward to more choices and more nonstop service to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena said a "framework for agreement" that he and his Canadian counterpart, 
Transport Minister Douglas Young, have adopted will serve as a basis for formal 
negotiations that will start next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of longstanding restrictions, nearly two-thirds of the 100 largest 
U.S. cities, including San Diego and Phoenix, are without nonstop service to 
Canada, Pena said at a news briefing. As a result, he said, many travelers must 
take long side trips to reach their destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, present rules require that most routes be served by only one 
airline from each country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will now move full speed ahead to negotiate an agreement which will scrap 
our antiquated aviation accord . . . and adopt a modern agreement reflecting 
our mutual resolve for fully open trans-border air service," Pena said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena, citing the potential for economic growth, said 13 million air passengers 
traveled between the United States and Canada last year, making it the largest 
bilateral aviation market in the world. Nonetheless, present restrictions have 
kept the growth of U.S.-Canadian air travel to less than 4% a year since 1978.  
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, U.S. air service with France and Japan has grown four times as 
fast -- nearly five times as fast with Germany -- over the past 15 years, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70% of the air traffic between the United States and Canada has been 
handled by U.S. carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Canada has only two major carriers -- Air Canada and Canadian Airlines -- and 
they have been very concerned about excessive competition from the United 
States," said Stephen H. Kaplan, the Transportation Department's general 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-page framework adopted by Pena and Young recommends lifting restrictions 
on passenger service immediately once a formal agreement is reached, except for 
new U.S. carrier access to three major cities: Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. 
There the restrictions would be struck down in steps over three years, allowing 
Canadian carriers time to adjust to a fully competitive environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The framework provides that in each of the first two years, the United States 
may add six carriers operating two round-trip flights a day to Montreal and 
Vancouver, and may add two carriers operating two daily flights each to 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 There are to be no limits on U.S. airline operations to any Canadian city 
after three years. Most restrictions on cargo shipped by air would be removed 
immediately. Upon signing the accord, Canadian carriers would gain unlimited 
route rights from any point in Canada to any point in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena said his department will begin to accept applications immediately from 
U.S. airlines to serve new routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said in a statement from Ottawa: "I'm very pleased our representatives 
have reported that they believe it's possible to resolve the key issues that in 
the past have prevented Canada and the U.S. from establishing an open regime 
for trans-border air services. I hope Canada will be able to re-establish 
formal negotiations with the United States, on the basis of the consensus 
developed, as soon as possible in the new year." 
</P>
<P>
 High-level talks to update the aviation pact started in 1991, but they dragged 
on without success and broke off in 1992. They resumed three months ago after 
both governments named special representatives to resolve the issues.

THE BIZ / JAMES BATES: COMPANY TOWN; THE CIVILIZING FORCE BEHIND DISNEY'S NEW 
'JUNGLE' MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Walt Disney's new version of "The Jungle Book," opening Christmas Day, 
actor John Cleese as Dr. Plumford leads Jason Scott Lee as Mowgli into a 
ballroom. There he shows him the finest wine and food of England, describing it 
as "all the bare necessities of life." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a subtle Disney inside joke, referring to the best-known song from the 
studio's 1967 "Jungle Book" animated hit. This time the studio is putting on 
the screen a live-action film costing nearly $30 million, a bet that Rudyard 
Kipling's tale will still enchant and excite audiences 100 years after it was 
first published. 
</P>
<P>
 To get them the bare necessities needed to make the movie -- and get it in the 
theaters by Christmas -- Disney went to grandfatherly producer Ed Feldman, best 
known for such films as "Witness" and "Green Card." Feldman, 65, is part of a 
small circle of Hollywood "hired guns" -- producers best known for their skill 
at taking potentially difficult films already developed and delivering a 
quality show both on time and on budget with a minimum of friction with the 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing, since what Feldman faced was logistic nightmares ranging from 
getting his hands on 1,400 liters of bottled water a day for the crew to the 
discovery of a dead rat in a fuse box, interpreted as a bad-luck sign by some 
locals in India. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first problems was discovering that the jungle in India didn't have 
the exact rain-forest look that filmmakers envisioned. So the "jungle" in this 
film in reality is a lush state park in Tennessee -- with a few exotic plants 
placed within camera view -- and the same South Carolina island that doubled as 
Vietnam in last summer's hit "Forrest Gump." Feldman jokes that "Jungle Book" 
has historical ties to the United States anyway, because Kipling wrote the book 
in the exotic wilds of Vermont when he was living there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the film required seven weeks of shooting in India and had to 
deal with that country's creaky government bureaucracy. It took up to four days 
for the crew to get its camera equipment through customs and five days to get 
its walkie-talkies. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about sanitary conditions, Feldman spent $70,000 on bottled water. 
Four people were hired just to make sure the water bottles were delivered 
sealed.  
</P>
<P>
 Before filming at a 550-year-old palace made to look like a British Army 
headquarters, Feldman spent $250,000 uprooting telephone poles and wires within 
camera sight so the area would have a late-1800s look to it. Wires were buried 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rat in the fuse box was seen by some as a bad sign, so at the end of 
shooting Feldman had the poles and wires put back. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was a caterer's son whom Feldman insulted when he criticized him 
for handling food with his bare hands, saying, "You know, we're not animals." 
The caterer quit that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman lured him back, but only after apologizing in front of a crowd of 
people. "I'd rather be humiliated than to have to face 150 people who haven't 
had lunch," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman, a Bronx native, began his Hollywood career as a studio publicist 
after graduating from Michigan State University. 
</P>
<P>
 He sent press releases to each movie studio, referring to himself in the third 
person and "announcing" that he had graduated from college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said the same thing about each company -- that I wanted to work for them 
because they were the most progressive and forward-thinking one," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century Fox called and eventually hired him at a position so junior that 
he was frequently summoned into the executive steam room, where, dressed in a 
wool suit, he had to jot down instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 After stints at Paramount, Seven Arts and Warner Bros., Feldman worked for 
Filmways in the early 1970s, where he oversaw production of such movies as 
"Save the Tiger," which earned Jack Lemmon an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman might never have become an independent producer had he not made 
Filmways a lot of money by developing for $22,000 the movie "The Other Side of 
the Mountain," which reaped about $30 million at the box office. Feldman 
thought he deserved a bonus but was spurned. So he quit. 
</P>
<P>
 As a producer, he made a batch of films that included the Oscar-nominated 
"Witness" with Harrison Ford, a raunchy movie called "Hot Dog -- The Movie" 
that was a critical bomb but a financial success, and the box office and 
critical flop "Wired" about the late comedian John Belushi.  
</P>
<P>
 All the while he developed a reputation for getting movies done in a 
workmanlike way, something former producing partner Charles Meeker attributes 
in part to Feldman's lack of a big ego. 
</P>
<P>
 "The studio knows with Ed that they aren't going to get one of those wacky 
demands at the last minute -- like, 'This film is 183 minutes long and the 
director doesn't want to cut it, so learn to love it,' " Meeker says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they spend a lot of money on a project, he's the guy they can put in who 
is going to be a stabilizing influence on the whole production and who is going 
to get the picture done in a way that is reasonable, businesslike and hopefully 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the public is ready for Hollywood's third version of "The Jungle Book" 
(there was also a 1942 film) remains to be seen.  
</P>
<P>
 Before Disney got involved, the movie was seen as a smaller, $18-million 
project that movie financiers Sharad Patel and his son Raju wanted shot 
entirely in India. Financing would come through the sale of foreign rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Disney became interested, agreed to finance the bulk of the film and 
brought in Feldman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognized that somebody else might be able to go out and make a 
live-action 'Jungle Book,' " said David Vogel, production president with Walt 
Disney Pictures. "But if anyone was going to do it, we really wanted to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Being a hired gun is good work if you can get it, with directors around town 
typically making fees of $500,000 to $750,000 with a cut of the profits. Though 
Feldman longs to develop more material, he doesn't mind being hired out.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to develop more on my own," he says. "But if a good project comes up 
again, I'm once again for hire." 
</P>
<P>

 "On the next 'Dee Dee' . . . ": Thursday was White House Press Secretary Dee 
Dee Myers' last day on the job. So far she's said little about what she'll do 
in the future, other than go on vacation to decompress and give a few speeches 
before mapping out her future. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood sources, however, say agents and production companies are already 
lining up to pitch her on the idea of doing a political TV talk show or being 
part of an existing show, figuring that the 33-year-old Southern California 
native would be a strong draw for younger viewers. She's also being pursued to 
write a book. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Myers, who wants to stay in Washington, doesn't have an agent yet, 
though she's being pursued. She is said to be working with Bob Barnett, a 
Washington media power lawyer who represents such news stars as Bernard Shaw 
and Sam Donaldson. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's one of the hottest properties out there now," one entertainment source 
said.

ZENECA GROUP TO PURCHASE 50% STAKE IN SALICK HEALTH; HEALTH CARE: THE DEAL 
CREATES A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN A CANCER DRUG MAKER AND AN OPERATOR OF CANCER AND 
KIDNEY CENTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a groundbreaking move by a pharmaceutical company to get more directly 
involved in patient care, British drug maker Zeneca Group said Thursday that it 
will buy a 50% stake in Salick Health Care, an operator of outpatient cancer 
clinics, for nearly $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal creates an unusual partnership between Zeneca, a leading maker of 
cancer drugs, and Los Angeles-based Salick Health, which operates cancer and 
kidney dialysis treatment centers throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, pharmaceutical companies have tried to cope with rapid 
changes in their global markets by investing in generic drug makers or in firms 
that manage prescription drug programs for employers or insurers. But Zeneca's 
deal takes a different tack, in effect putting the drug maker directly at the 
patient's bedside. 
</P>
<P>
 David Barnes, Zeneca's chief executive, said the deal gives his company access 
to valuable medical-outcome data from Salick clinics that should help Zeneca's 
scientists "better target their drug research and development efforts." The 
deal also helps the British firm move into the U.S. managed care market and 
better understand how to cost-effectively treat cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't just another way to push more Zeneca products through Salick," 
Barnes said. "Where appropriate, (Salick) will use Zeneca products, and where 
appropriate they will use products by Bristol-Myers Squibb or other companies." 
 
</P>
<P>
 The deal gives Salick Health the financial resources it needs to expand its 
operations in the United States and move into Britain and other overseas 
markets, officials said. And it caps a personal success story for Salick's 
chairman, Dr. Bernard Salick, who founded the company in 1973 to provide kidney 
dialysis treatment and later built a highly regarded chain of 10 cancer clinics 
affiliated with hospitals such as Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are great benefits from being involved with a company the size of 
Zeneca," which had 1993 sales of $6.5 billion, Salick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salick's shares soared $5.475 to $34.625 in Nasdaq trading on Thursday, an 18% 
gain. The stock, which also gained $1.50 on Wednesday, had traded as low as $14 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Salick, who owns about 25% of Salick Health stock, will continue as 
chairman and chief executive of the firm after the deal closes. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeneca's move comes as pharmaceutical companies are increasingly searching for 
strategies to respond to rapid changes in their markets, such as the expanding 
influence of managed-care companies in the United States and government price 
controls overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 One area that has attracted interest from some drug makers such as Pfizer Inc. 
and Merck & Co. is so-called disease management. Disease management involves 
developing cost-effective treatment standards for specific diseases and selling 
those services to health insurers and employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Salick recently formed a managed-care subsidiary, SalickNet, that markets 
cancer management services to health maintenance organizations and other health 
care purchasers. Earlier this year, Zeneca formed its own disease-management 
subsidiary focusing on cardiovascular disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the deal, London-based Zeneca will have the option to buy the 
remainder of Salick Health's shares, which would bring the total price of the 
acquisition to more than $440 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Salick stockholders will get $37.75 in cash for each two shares they now hold, 
plus one share of special common stock worth $1.25 a share. They will have the 
right to sell it to Zeneca after 2 1/2 years at $42 per share. Zeneca will also 
have the right for four years to buy the stock at market prices, at a minimum 
price of $42 and maximum price of $50 a share for 2 1/2 years after the deal 
closes.

 Dow Chemical Corp. Buying German Plants: The company is buying three chemical 
plants in the former East Germany in a transaction worth an eventual $2.5 
billion, said the German Treuhand agency, which is charged with selling off 
former Communist enterprises. The purchase by Dow is one of the largest of 
former Communist-run enterprises made since German reunification and is 
probably the last before the selloffs of Eastern German assets end later this 
month. Under the deal, Dow will acquire former state-run chemical plants in 
Leuna, Buna and Boehlen, all in the former East Germany, and will invest in 
modernization, mostly over the next five years, it said.

 AT&T Buys On-Line Service: The company broadened its role in the computer 
on-line services business by purchasing Interchange Network Co. from Ziff-Davis 
Publishing Co.The companies did not disclose the value of the deal, but 
analysts estimated AT&T Corp. paid between $50 million and $100 million. AT&T 
said the cost was not material, which means it was less than 5% of annual 
earnings, or $200 million. The Interchange on-line service is to begin 
operation in the spring with electronic versions of the Washington Post and 
Minneapolis Star-Tribune among its initial products. The transaction is the 
last major asset sale by Ziff-Davis, a family-run company that once included 
influential computer industry publications, marketing and trade show firms.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS MIXED; BOND YIELDS RISE AS DOLLAR LOSES STEAM; WALL 
STREET: BLUE CHIPS ARE BUOYED BY YEAR-END BUYING AND THE CONTINUING CHAOS IN 
MEXICO. 
</P>

<P>
 The stock market ended on a mixed note Thursday, with the Dow Jones industrial 
average posting a moderate gain but most of the market weakening. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar, which had been helped by the turmoil following Tuesday's 
devaluation of the Mexican peso, lost steam, and Treasury bond yields were 
marginally higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue-chip stocks finished higher, buoyed by year-end buying and a flow of 
funds fleeing the chaos in Latin American markets. The Dow advanced 13.12 
points to close at 3,814.92. It had been up about 26 points earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders bought into a long-awaited year-end rally early in the session, 
reluctant to miss out on any potential gains, said Richard Meyer, head equity 
trader at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then they saw stocks reach levels they hadn't seen in a long time, and 
they took profits," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the rally were investors who were pulling their money out of Mexico 
and returning it to U.S. securities, including stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer and economically sensitive stocks led the blue chips higher. Among 
the 30 Dow components, General Motors rose 1 1/4 to 39 1/8, Disney added 1 1/8 
to 46, AlliedSignal gained 7/8 to 35 1/8 and AT&T climbed 1 to 51 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 100 issues on the New 
York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume was brisk at 339.67 million shares but 
down from Wednesday's 378.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad market indexes were mixed, despite a firming in technology stocks for 
the second consecutive session. 
</P>
<P>
 The NYSE's composite index fell 0.23 point to 250.71. The Standard & Poor's 
500-stock index rose 0.06 point to 459.67. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.22 points to 739.34. The American Stock 
Exchange's market value index fell 0.41 point to 427.52. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, meanwhile, short-term yields rose for the first time in a 
week as weak demand at an auction of five-year notes offset speculation that 
Mexico's financial crisis could eventually boost U.S. bills and notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 5.59% from 5.55%. The key 30-year 
bond edged up to 7.85% from 7.84% on Wednesday, while its price, which moves in 
the opposite direction, closed down 1/32 point, or 31 cents per $1,000 in face 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the dollar closed at 1.575 German marks in New York trading, down 
from 1.579 on Wednesday. It also closed at 100.23 Japanese yen, down from 
100.48. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Broderbund Software posted surprisingly strong first-quarter earnings, 
pushing its stock up 4 1/2 to 44 1/2 in Nasdaq trading and taking other 
software issues higher. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dell Computer gained 1 1/2 to 40 1/2, spurred by a Bear Stearns upgrade to 
"attractive" from "neutral." 
</P>
<P>
 * Salick Health Care soared 5 3/8 to 34 5/8 on news that Zeneca Group plans to 
buy a 50% stake. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. bank stocks slid on worries that banks would lose money on their Latin 
American investments. Citicorp fell 2 to 41 1/4. Bank of Boston, which analysts 
said was also heavily extended in loans to Latin America, fell 3/4 to 26 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign trading, Mexico's Bolsa index shot up 102.59 points to 2,306.26 in 
a roller-coaster session after the government abandoned its system of exchange 
rate bands and let the peso plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. depositary shares of Mexican companies continued to plunge. 
Bellwether issue Telefonos de Mexico fell 4 3/8 to 40 5/8, Grupo Tribasa slid 2 
3/4 to 19 5/8 and Grupo Televisa lost 3 5/8 to 32 3/8. Empresas ICA, Mexico's 
largest construction company, skidded 3 to 20 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 The weakness in Mexican stocks spread to other American Depositary Receipts 
from Latin America. YPF Sociedad, an oil and gas exploration company in 
Argentina, fell 3/8 to 21 1/4 on heavy NYSE volume. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stock markets were stronger. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average closed 
up 292.86 points at 19,633.53. London's Financial Times 100-share average 
finished 21.3 points higher at 3,091.7, and Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average 
gained 13.99 points to close 2,100.65. DAILY DIARY

 The securities arm of Bankers Trust New York Corp. agreed Thursday to pay a 
$10-million civil penalty to settle charges that it lied to a customer about 
losses from securities known as derivatives. However, the firm neither admitted 
nor denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, brought jointly by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, represents a clear statement that fraud 
will not be tolerated in the $12.1-trillion derivatives market, regulators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case stands on the fact that you cannot lie to the customer," said Mary 
Schapiro, CFTC chairwoman. SEC officials issued similar statements. 
</P>
<P>
 BT Securities Corp., the securities affiliate of Bankers Trust, is one of the 
biggest merchants of derivatives, the catchall term for exotic securities that 
are based on, or "derived from," some other type of investment, such as a group 
of stocks, bonds or commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some species of derivatives have plunged in value this year as interest rates 
have risen, creating horrendous losses for many of the investors that bought 
them and raising concern that the buyers did not understand what they were 
purchasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers Trust Chairman Charles Sanford Jr. said in a statement that the firm 
does not admit or deny wrongdoing in the settlement. The bank said the 
enforcement case focused "primarily on the actions and statements of one 
employee, who is no longer with BT Securities." The employee was not named. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanford said BT Securities has new procedures in place to prevent similar 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The agencies accused BT Securities of violating anti-fraud provisions of 
securities and commodities laws. BT Securities agreed to pay $5 million to the 
SEC and $5 million to the CFTC. 
</P>
<P>
 The case focused narrowly on BT Securities' relationship with Cincinnati-based 
Gibson Greetings Inc., which makes greeting cards. The company reported a 
$23-million loss earlier this spring because of derivatives it bought from BT 
Securities. Gibson had earlier settled a lawsuit with Bankers Trust. Among 
other things, BT Securities was accused of telling Gibson that its derivatives 
losses were millions less than they actually were. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss, which Gibson claimed threatened its survival, became a symbol of the 
risks in the derivatives market and was cited repeatedly during numerous 
congressional hearings on derivatives.

STUDY SHOWS DISCRIMINATION BY INSURERS; HOMEOWNERS: REPORT IS CALLED FIRST HARD 
EVIDENCE THAT MINORITIES, POOR HAVE LESS CHANCE OF COVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most comprehensive study to date on discrimination among insurers shows 
that poor people and minorities across the country have a harder time obtaining 
homeowner insurance and that they pay higher premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, issued last week by the National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners, 
concludes that insurers do not offer homeowner policies in urban areas 
populated by minorities and people with low incomes. The study also shows that 
insurers charge higher premiums in these markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings are not new, insurance regulators said, but they mark the first 
time hard evidence has been formulated to prove the existence of 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "The study implies that there's a national problem of significant proportion," 
said J. Robert Hunter, former Texas insurance commissioner and a member of the 
association's task force on insurance availability. 
</P>
<P>
 The association studied insurance company data about homeowner coverage since 
1992 in 59 cities in 20 states. It is the first study to track insurance trends 
by ZIP codes. 
</P>
<P>
 The NAIC looked at the concentrations of minority populations within ZIP codes 
and concluded that there is a direct correlation between the price and 
availability of homeowner insurance and the presence of minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If enough insurance companies are competing for the business, you should have 
the lowest premiums and the higher-quality coverage," said Robert M. Willis, 
insurance commissioner in Washington and chairman of the availability task 
force. "That is not being achieved where you have a high predominance of 
minorities." 
</P>
<P>
 The study does not name specific insurers that discriminate. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem stems from underwriting policies that restrict coverage based on 
property values, credit histories of homeowners and subjective judgments about 
an applicant's "lifestyle, stability and morals," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Such subjective criteria may lead to uneven and possibly unfairly 
discriminatory application by different agents and underwriters," it says. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry executives said that fewer urban residents have insurance because 
fewer of them own homes. They also contend that many minority homeowners are 
covered by Fair Access to Insurance Requirements plans, government-mandated 
programs for providing insurance in high-risk areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not surprised by the study," said Sean Mooney, senior vice president 
and economist of the Insurance Company Institute, a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 The study recommends solutions ranging from limited regulations promoting fair 
competition and prohibiting unfair trade practices to more severe laws 
mandating coverage and using undercover investigations to pinpoint 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute said the NAIC will conduct similar studies on discrimination 
among auto and commercial insurers in 1995.

 USAA to Pay $31 Million More in Rebates: United Services Automobile Assn., a 
San Antonio, Tex.-based auto insurer that sells to military officers and their 
families, will refund the money to 218,000 California policyholders under 
Proposition 103, the 1988 rate-cutting initiative, state Insurance Commissioner 
John Garamendi announced. USAA, which is owned by its policyholders, has 
already paid about $44 million in rebates as a result of the measure. It agreed 
to the additional rebates -- which average $142 apiece -- in negotiations with 
Garamendi, who had originally ordered the company to pay $112 million.

SANTA: A BIG, FAT INSURANCE RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He's overweight, he smokes, he flies at night and his on-the-job hazards 
include cramped landing zones and headlong plunges down chimneys. 
</P>
<P>
 As a life insurance risk, Santa Claus is a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spirit of the season, Milwaukee-based Northwestern Mutual Life 
Insurance Co. released a tongue-in-cheek report on how its underwriters might 
regard St. Nick. 
</P>
<P>
 The company found that Santa fits the risk profile of a private pilot or even 
a sky diver better than that of the typical toy manufacturer and distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most experienced pilots are acceptable risks," Northwestern said. "However, 
we would examine carefully the application of any pilot who lands on rooftops. 
Sadly, even Santa might pay a hefty extra premium for these rooftop drops, if 
he could be insured for them at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Occupational hazards aside, the insurer said, there's the question of physical 
fitness: "Recent public appearances confirm that Santa remains 'chubby and 
plump, a right jolly old elf.' This may endear Santa to young children, but it 
would not help the assessment of Santa as an insurance risk." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that Northwestern considers only cigarette smoking in its 
underwriting, so Santa's clay pipe won't cost him any additional premium.

 PG&E Fights Refunds: The San Francisco-based utility sued state regulators in 
an effort to block the $115-million payout.Pacific Gas & Electric Co. asked the 
U.S. District Court to issue an injunction against the California Public 
Utilities Commission, which ordered the refunds. The suit came at about the 
same time the PUC was granting the company a 3% increase in gas rates. The hike 
will add $1.23 to a typical monthly gas bill of $42.06, effective Jan. 1, and 
will generate $100 million in annual revenue for PG&E. The PUC's refund order 
last March stemmed from PG&E's purchase of natural gas in Canada between 1988 
and 1990.

 Ciba Acquiring Maalox, 2 Other Products: The Swiss pharmaceutical giant said 
it is buying the antacid and other U.S. and Canadian over-the-counter drugs 
from France's Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. for $407 million.The deal also gives 
Ciba-Geigy two other key products, Perdiem, a laxative, and Ascriptin, a coated 
aspirin. It will also acquire a production plant in Ft. Washington, Pa. 
Ciba-Geigy said the expansion puts it among the top 10 companies in the U.S. 
over-the-counter market and will add $160 million to its over-the-counter sales 
in 1995.

 Drug Patent Review Requirements Changed: Pharmaceutical companies may now 
receive patents on products without having to conduct human clinical trials, 
according to regulations announced by federal officials. U.S. Patent and 
Trademark Commissioner Bruce A. Lehman said patent examiners in his office will 
accept "any kind of evidence" to prove the usefulness of a drug product and 
will not require that this proof come from expensive human clinical trials. He 
said the regulations were drawn up after biotech companies complained that 
extensive human clinical trials were required to prove that a drug worked.

MEXICAN FINANCIAL UPHEAVAL; Q & A; WHAT THE FREE FLOATING OF THE PESO COULD 
MEAN FOR INVESTORS, OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 What are the immediate and long-term repercussions on workers, investors and 
business people on both sides of the border from Mexico's decision Thursday to 
let the peso trade freely against the dollar? Here are some answers: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Mexican government, which has been holding the value of its currency 
fairly steady for seven years, moved to let it float against the dollar -- 
making its value subject to market forces just like the values of the German 
mark, British pound, Japanese yen and other major world currencies. But because 
the Mexican government has been keeping its currency's value artificially high, 
Thursday's surprising move resulted in the peso plunging -- more than 20% on 
Thursday and more than 30% since last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is this important? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The peso's stability has been at the center of Mexican economic reforms, 
which have stabilized wages and consumer prices and attracted huge sums in 
foreign investment. By pulling the rug out from under the peso, many investors 
believe, the government is signaling a change of heart. If Mexico returns to 
its past of high inflation and currency devaluation, that could have a 
disastrous impact on business, employment and investment in the country.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Then why did Mexico do this? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There are several factors, but a primary one is that the government was 
depleting its foreign reserves by trying to prop up the peso at levels still 
seen as overvalued by the world currency markets. The government spent an 
estimated $4 billion in foreign exchange reserves over the past two days alone 
to keep the currency from falling further. That had depleted those reserves to 
$6.5 billion -- down from $17 billion as recently as Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does this affect the average U.S. citizen? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The repercussions are potentially dramatic, though somewhat indirect. 
Mexico is one of California's largest trading partners, buying everything from 
electronic components to chemicals to lumber, while selling such products as 
textiles, produce and leather. 
</P>
<P>
 If the peso remains weak, Mexicans will be forced to pay more for U.S. goods. 
That could hurt sales by exporters and manufacturers and ultimately lead to 
layoffs of U.S. workers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Americans traveling to Mexico or buying Mexican products are likely 
to see their dollars go further than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How will this affect illegal immigration? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Many illegal immigrants come here because of economic woes in their own 
country, which could be exaggerated by the currency swings, says Max Schetter, 
director of the economic research bureau at the Greater San Diego Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, U.S. dollars now buy more in Mexico. That creates a huge incentive to 
come here, earn dollars and send them to relatives south of the border. The 
currency devaluation "is like an electromagnet attracting Mexicans to the U.S. 
economy," Schetter says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why would this create an economic burden on Mexican citizens? After all, if 
you're earning pesos and buying products with pesos, why would you care about 
the value of the peso when compared to a foreign currency? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In a nutshell, a decline in the value of the peso creates inflationary 
pressures inside Mexico. That's simply because Mexican companies are buying 
goods from international suppliers. The cost of those goods is now higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Mexico's domestic producers can raise their prices because 
they're now competing with higher-priced foreign goods. Workers, grappling with 
a higher cost of living, may demand higher wages. If they get higher wages, 
inflation is boosted even more. If they don't, they must live more sparsely -- 
and their average standard of living is already far lower than that in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does this mean to investors in the Mexican stock market? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's still too early to say for sure. In theory, the devaluation should 
boost exports of Mexican goods and services. That would be good for the economy 
and business as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the value of the peso dropped so dramatically, some experts 
believe any boost to exports could be more than offset by inflationary 
pressures within Mexico. Moreover, they worry that the confidence of foreign 
investors was shattered by this move, largely because the government of 
President Ernesto Zedillo had assured investors Wednesday that it would not 
allow its currency to fall further. 
</P>
<P>
 With Thursday's action, investors rightly questioned whether the Mexican 
government is serious about keeping its promises to investors, says Alan 
Shapiro, chairman of the finance and business economics department at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about Mexican bonds? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Again, there are some uncertainties, but the prognosis appears bleak. 
Short-term interest rates have already been boosted, which hurts bond values. 
U.S. investors, who bought peso-denominated bonds, get doubly hit with the huge 
drop in the value of Mexican currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Even dollar-denominated bonds issued by Mexican companies are at risk, says 
Carl Ericson, vice president and manager of the Colonial Investments Strategic 
Income Fund. That's because these companies are still earning the bulk of their 
income in pesos, but they're paying on their debt in costly foreign currency. 
That puts strain on their balance sheets and makes them comparatively less 
credit-worthy, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Should I sell my funds that hold Mexican securities? 
</P>
<P>
 A: At least nine U.S. mutual funds investing in Mexico lost more than 8% of 
their value in the past two days. While it's rarely smart to sell in a panic, 
it certainly makes sense to evaluate why you're investing in Mexico and whether 
the reasons you first invested still hold true. You should also monitor the 
economic climate there to make sure your investments won't suffer in an 
inflationary environment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I'm about to go on vacation in Mexico. Does this mean my hotel and 
everything else is going to cost less? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Possibly but not necessarily, says Paul Albrecht, director of industry 
relations at Globus-Cosmos Tourama, a travel wholesaler that arranges land 
tours all over the world. Many tourist hotels set their rates in U.S. dollars. 
If that's the case, they're unlikely to give you a break. 
</P>
<P>
 However, your meals and souvenirs are likely to be significantly cheaper. 
Additionally, people who stray from traditional tourist areas and buy products 
and services in pesos will see a surge in spending power, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is terrible for people who invest in Mexico but great for people who 
travel there," Albrecht says.

FBI ARRESTS FATHER, SON IN CD-ROM PIRACY PROBE; SOFTWARE: THOUSANDS OF 
COUNTERFEIT COMPUTER GAMES ARE SEIZED IN THE FIRST MAJOR CASE OF ITS KIND.

 In the first major case of CD-ROM piracy in the United States, the FBI said 
Thursday that it has seized thousands of counterfeit copies of the popular 
CD-ROM computer games "Rebel Assault" and "Myst" and prevented the production 
of tens of thousands of additional copies. 
</P>
<P>
 A father and son who authorities say were the alleged masterminds behind the 
operation were arrested in Buffalo, N.Y., and charged with two felony counts of 
copyright infringement. Peter Misko, 63, of Mississauga, Canada, is free on 
$15,000 bail; his son Bruce Misko, 36, of Chicago is free on $25,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas theft of diskette-based computer software has long been relatively 
commonplace in the United States, authorities say that counterfeit CD-ROMs -- 
which are much harder to produce than diskettes -- are just now beginning to 
appear in the U.S. software market in large quantities. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI is continuing a sting operation aimed at CD-ROM counterfeiters, and 
officials said additional warrants were served Thursday in Indiana and New 
Hampshire as part of a crackdown on retail stores selling the bogus software. 
More arrests are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Software companies have been up in arms about piracy for years, and they are 
dismayed -- if not surprised -- to see the problem spread to the increasingly 
popular CD-ROM format. The specialized equipment needed to duplicate CD-ROMs 
has grown dramatically cheaper in the past year.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are now beginning to see counterfeit copies of our mainstream CD-ROM 
applications being sold here, including Microsoft Office, Encarta and 
Bookshelf, for a fraction of their retail value," said Alison Gilligan, senior 
anti-piracy specialist for Microsoft Corp. "As more and more PCs become 
multimedia-capable, the counterfeiters will focus on multimedia CD-ROM 
applications where there is money to be made." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Roden, general counsel for LucasArts Entertainment Co., which makes 
"Rebel Assault," said the company, working with the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police, tracked the alleged CD-ROM pirates through a complex series of dummy 
corporations in several Canadian cities before it brought in the FBI when the 
trail led to Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 George Lucas, producer of the "Star Wars" film trilogy and owner of LucasArts, 
recently vowed to vigorously protect the firm's copyrights and trademarks. "We 
don't take any form of piracy lightly, including software piracy," he said in a 
statement.

 Comics: Marvel Entertainment stock continued to slip -- albeit slightly 
compared to its plunge Wednesday -- after its disclosure earlier this week that 
its year-end profit will not meet Wall Street expectations, due in part to a 
drop in sports card sales caused by the baseball strike and hockey lockout. The 
stock of the comic book and trading card company, which dropped 10% on 
Wednesday, closed down another 12.5 cents at $14.125 on Thursday.Marvel said it 
expects 1994 earnings of 60 cents a share, less than the 70 cents analysts had 
expected. The company reported net income of $56 million, or 55 cents a share, 
last year on revenue of $415.2 million. Two analysts downgraded the stock, one 
citing a poor earnings outlook for the company's sports trading card business 
and flat sales of comic books. The company said it increased its year-end 
reserves for card returns to $35 million, up from $12 million last year.

THE GOODS; A GIFT TO LAST ALL THEIR DAYS; WITH THEMES THAT RANGE FROM CATS TO 
COMIC STRIPS TO RELIGION, CALENDARS ARE ONE SIZE FITS ALL.

 There are two shopping days left before Christmas which means it's time to 
fill in the gaps on your list. 
</P>
<P>
 One solution: calendars. Unless you really love the mall on Christmas Eve, you 
can take care of everybody with one visit to a well-stocked bookstore or card 
shop. The calendar as gift has many virtues: 
</P>
<P>
 * Without being downright cheap, most calendars are affordable, falling into 
the $10 to $15 range. 
</P>
<P>
 * You don't have to worry about sweater size, and calendars are square and 
easy to wrap in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 * A calendar will last for a year and can be used effortlessly at any minute 
of the day. Few gifts can match that for staying power. 
</P>
<P>
 * A calendar brings order and beauty to a chaotic world. "I always get the 
Sierra Club calendar and I couldn't live without it," says a stressed-out Los 
Angeles writer. "You open it, and there is a beautiful picture. That can be the 
high point of your week." 
</P>
<P>
 * Best of all, you can dip into the vast variety of calendar subject matter 
and choose a gift so personal the recipient will think you spent a lot of time 
picking it out. "They will like you for 12 months," says Ron Gutis of the new 
Border's Books and Music in Westwood. "Or hate you if you give them one they 
don't like." 
</P>
<P>
 But that seems unlikely. Today's calendar array beckons with the ultimate 
something-for-everyone appeal, having come a long way from that model we used 
to get every December from our insurance agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Calendars are a big business and we have a great selection," Gutis says. "Art 
and kids and animal lovers and films and movie stars and Madonna and the 
Beatles." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year we keep adding new subjects," says Lilet Martinez at Workman 
Publishing in New York, a major calendar publisher. One of its award winners, 
"The Medieval Woman," is a richly illustrated tapestry, with bibliography and 
enough history to be used for a textbook. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of different formats including wall calendars, desk diaries and 
page-a-day, which is our best-selling calendar style," says Martinez. At the 
Calendar Marketing Assn. in Liberty, Ill., executive director Maria Tuthill 
confirms the calendar boom. "For the past six or seven years, it's just grown 
and grown," she says. "This year there are 5,000 titles available. It's a 
$9-billion industry and the average American has four to five calendars. The 
most prominent one is in the kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
 She says calendars have developed a lot more humor in the past few years. Gary 
Larson's "Far Side" calendars sell in the millions, and movie and comic strip 
themes are popular, along with the perennial cats, dogs, gardens and 
landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Angels are very big this year," says Tuthill, "and those Magic Eye 3-D are 
also very hot." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, angels are popular at West Hollywood's Bodhi Tree in West 
Hollywood, a spiritual bookstore. "Calendars have been very important for us in 
the last few years," says co-manager Mike Brosnan, who carries calendars 
illustrating the religions of such groups as Tibetans and Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "And astrological calendars with exact phases of the moon and positions of the 
planet, are very big for us, too -- a lot of people consult them," Brosnan 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Rizzoli's Bookstore in Santa Monica is not only selling a lot of angels, but 
also does a brisk business with "anything that looks vaguely classical or 
biblical," says Mauricio Figuls, operations manager. "If a person just can't 
think of what to get someone for a gift, a calendar is great. We have more than 
200 selections -- we've done real well with a Robert Mapplethorpe artwork 
calendar, and these very small CD-ROM-size styles with a jewel case have sold 
like crazy for stocking stuffers." 
</P>
<P>
 Rizzoli's expects to sell about half its stock before Christmas and, like 
other stores, will mark them down after Jan. 1. "They make a good cheap gift 
after the holidays, if you don't celebrate Christmas," Figuls says. 
</P>
<P>
 "People start buying in early August," says Richard Labonte, general manager 
of A Different Light bookstores in San Francisco and West Hollywood. "We used 
to be hard-pressed to find six or eight calendars with gay and lesbian themes. 
This year we have 280 themes in stock, so you can't go wrong picking a gift. 
You can make a romantic, or a political or a friendship statement." 
</P>
<P>
 While calendar buying has gotten so complex some bookstores have sworn off 
completely, others thrive on the seasonal challenge. Vroman's in Pasadena 
stocks 750 to 800 titles. "We have to turn the store upside down to do it," 
says Stan Hynds, book department manager.  
</P>
<P>
 "Vroman's has the reputation for having an extraordinary breadth of titles," 
he says. "If you are looking for a wildflower calendar, you won't find just 
one, you'll have several to choose from. I think you could satisfy any 
potential gift-getter interest with the genres the calendars address these 
days."  
</P>
<P>
 The best sellers are Sierra Club wall and engagement calendars, he says.  
</P>
<P>
 Vroman's sells "a zillion kitty cat and dog" calendars. but this year's hot 
mammal is the wolf, he adds. "We have 12 different wolf calendars, and we will 
sell out."

THE GOODS; A QUICKER RESOLUTION OR SETTLING FOR LESS?; HEALTH: AS MORE DOCTORS 
REQUIRE ARBITRATION HEARINGS RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS, SOME OBSERVERS WONDER IF 
PATIENTS' BEST INTERESTS ARE BEING SERVED. 
</P>

 Fran and Keith Gochmanosky wanted justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 9-year-old son had undergone surgery to have 70% of his tongue removed 
because his pediatrician had overlooked a tumor in the boy's mouth. Distraught 
over the realization that their son would be haunted throughout his life -- 
every time he speaks, interviews for a job or kisses a girl -- the Gochmanoskys 
decided to take the doctor to court. 
</P>
<P>
 Only then did they learn that when they signed up with their HMO several years 
earlier, they had unknowingly given up their right to a trial by jury as part 
of their contract. Instead, they had to settle their differences through 
private arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea we had to use arbitration," says Fran Gochmanosky, who lives in 
San Diego with her husband and son, now 12. "I had no idea what arbitration 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 A panel of arbitrators eventually sided with the Gochmanoskys, who would not 
reveal the exact settlement amount. And while they are pleased with the 
outcome, they say a jury might have awarded their son a lot more money -- 
perhaps the full $3 million they asked for. "And he deserves every penny," says 
Fran Gochmanosky, whose son sees a speech therapist. "We went through living 
hell, and my son is going to suffer for the rest of his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, patients -- knowingly and unknowingly -- are signing away their 
rights to take a doctor to court for malpractice. Today, most California health 
maintenance organizations -- as well as many private doctors -- require 
patients to sign binding arbitration agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 While all sides agree that the process reduces legal fees and speeds 
resolution of a case, opinion is divided as to whether arbitration serves the 
patient's best interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the perspective of the insurance company or the large health plan, 
arbitration is a great idea," says Will Clark, a Torrance attorney who 
represents plaintiffs and defendants in malpractice cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "But from the patient's standpoint, I have strong reservations. A jury trial 
has been recognized since our nation's founding as a very important right. We 
all ought to be very suspicious when someone trades us anything for it," says 
Clark, who has also served as an arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at what juries have awarded on some lifetime disability or birth injury 
cases. It can come into the tens of millions of dollars. It is unlikely that 
arbitration would get to those levels," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But such massive judgments are part of the problem -- and one of the reasons 
arbitration exists, according to Dr. Mitchell Karlan, a Beverly Hills cancer 
surgeon and board member of the Southern California Physicians Insurance 
Exchange. "So many physicians get hit with lawsuits that don't deal with merit, 
facts or hard evidence, and lawyers, who have their fingers in the honey pot, 
have a field day. They play the jury like a violin string. So many frivolous 
claims raise the cost of medical care." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Karlan says he no longer advocates arbitration in malpractice cases. 
After about 15 years of requiring arbitration agreements in his office, Karlan 
abandoned the contracts several years ago when he realized his patients' 
"distaste" for the forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even before my patients saw me, they were hit with a legal commitment. I 
didn't like the feeling it gave them. They have enough to worry about, with a 
lump in their breast, a hernia or a thyroid problem," he says. "Those papers 
tainted our relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Daryl Alexander, a Tarzana obstetrician-gynecologist, believes 
arbitration benefits all parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I didn't have to introduce legal topics into my relationships with 
patients," she says. "I would like to confine my discussion to medicine, which 
is my expertise and interest. I wish we did not live in a litigious society. 
But since we do, I feel more comfortable knowing that we are not going to spend 
a whole lot of dollars on lawsuits. Arbitration is a way to simplify the 
medical-legal process and keep costs down." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Alexander, the vast majority of her patients sign the arbitration 
form without a murmur of complaint. "Interestingly," she says, "it is never my 
patients who are lawyers or judges who resist. It is usually people who don't 
understand what arbitration is." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that most patients don't know what they are signing away, says 
Virginia Nelson, a San Diego attorney who represented the Gochmanoskys. "Before 
people make a decision, they should be informed -- but they are not. They get 
handed this form as they walk in." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Nelson added that she signs arbitration forms herself. "I have no 
fear of the process," she says. "The jury trial is not necessarily the only 
just way to resolve a case. Courts are crowded; cases take a long time to get 
to trial; they are very expensive. Arbitration is an alternative method of 
disposing of disputes. If a patient wants treatment by this doctor, I say, 
'Sign it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Once signed, the contracts cover all care a patient receives by that provider 
-- forever. The form also states that if a pregnant woman signs the contract, 
her unborn child is bound by it. If a patient signs the agreement and 
subsequently dies as a result of negligence or malpractice, the surviving 
family members are also bound to the terms of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 A person who signs an arbitration agreement, then has a change of heart, may 
cancel the contract by notifying the provider in writing within 30 days -- 
something many doctors say virtually no patients do. After 30 days have 
elapsed, getting out of the contract is virtually impossible, unless the other 
party decides not to enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The binding nature of these agreements have been upheld in all court 
decisions in the last decade," says Elizabeth Rolph, a senior political 
scientist at RAND, a Santa Monica think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 In a typical medical malpractice arbitration, both the patient and physician 
are represented by an attorney of their choice. Each side picks an arbitrator 
-- called a "party arbitrator" -- and the two party arbitrators together select 
a third, neutral arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Since party arbitrators are likely to favor their respective sides, the 
neutral arbitrator often casts the tie-breaking vote that decides the outcome 
of the case. Once a decision is made in arbitration, it may not be appealed.  
</P>
<P>
 The arbitration process is generally less formal than a courtroom trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arbitrators are not as concerned with procedures as they are with getting to 
the meat of the issue," says William Goldsmith, a Tarzana malpractice attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arbitrators may take over questioning of witnesses, and a jury can't do that. 
A witness, for example, may be talking about how wonderful this doctor is, and 
all the arbitrators are interested in knowing is what angle a ligament was 
sliced," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Most legal experts agree that arbitrators, who are usually attorneys or 
retired judges, are less likely to be swayed by emotion -- which is why some 
people believe a patient, especially one who was catastrophically injured, has 
a better chance of winning big in a jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Juries tend to be more sympathetic than arbitrators, and I think that is 
good," says Woodland Hills attorney John O'Meara. "Who is to say that people 
who base cases on sympathy are not correct? There are juries that occasionally 
run amok, but it is amazing how often they are right. From what I have seen, 
plaintiffs do a lot better in jury trials." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, the attorney who represented the Gochmanosky family, isn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "By and large my clients walk away (from arbitrations) thinking it was a fair 
process," she says. "But it's a crap shoot with a jury: You have no way of 
knowing who these 12 people are. Some have a very strong bias in favor of the 
medical profession. And if you do get a verdict, you may not collect it because 
of the appellate process."  
</P>
<P>
 So what's better for the patient: Arbitration or a jury trial? 
</P>
<P>
 There is really no good way to compare a person's chances of winning one way 
or the other, according to Rolph. For one thing, most cases destined for court 
settle before ever reaching trial, as the defense does not want to risk getting 
hit with huge damages. A much greater proportion of cases go to arbitration, 
where runaway awards are rare. 
</P>
<P>
 And because arbitration proceedings are private, getting information on them 
is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no public records of arbitration proceedings," Rolph says, "so you 
have big problems in terms of getting data and drawing conclusions."

GOLDEN GLOBE NODS A LOT LIKE A BOX OF CHOCOLATES . . .; AWARDS: 'GUMP' AND 
'PULP' LEAD FILM NOMINATIONS, WHILE 'FENCES' TOPS TV LIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Forrest Gump" and "Pulp Fiction," films that viewed America respectively 
through contrasting prisms of a simple man's remarkable life and hit men 
cruising the drug underworld, led the 52nd annual Golden Globe Awards 
nominations Thursday in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Robert Zemeckis' "Forrest Gump," which rode a wave of baby boomer 
nostalgia to become the fourth-highest-grossing picture of all time with nearly 
$300 million in domestic box-office receipts, grabbed seven Golden Globe 
nominations -- including best motion picture drama -- the most for any film. 
</P>
<P>
 Six nominations, including one for best film drama, went to director Quentin 
Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction," which has been the darling of critics since it won 
the Palme d'Or at last spring's Cannes Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The two films now likely will be considered front-runners in the race for the 
Academy Awards, which will be handed out on March 27. (Nominations will be 
announced Feb. 14.) Once scoffed at, the Golden Globes, which are bestowed on 
feature films and television programs, in recent years are taken more seriously 
by the Hollywood studios since they are often seen as a precursor to Oscar 
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Golden Globe nominations in the best drama category went to "Quiz Show," 
director Robert Redford's film about the '50s TV quiz show scandals, which 
recently won the New York Film Critics Circle Award; "Nell," director Michael 
Apted's film about a young woman found in a remote North Carolina cabin who 
speaks her own language, and director Ed Zwick's "Legends of the Fall," a movie 
about a Montana rancher whose family is torn apart over the love of a woman. 
Both "Nell" and "Legends" are dark horse candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was one big surprise omission in this year's balloting for best drama 
it was the critically acclaimed remake "Little Women," which was totally 
ignored by the 90 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn., which vote on 
the Golden Globes. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes also honor musicals and 
comedies. This year's best picture nominees in those categories were "The 
Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert," "Ed Wood," "Four Weddings and a 
Funeral," "The Lion King" and "Ready to Wear (Pret-a-Porter)." 
</P>
<P>
 The mainstream Disney and its avant-garde subsidiary Miramax Films dominated 
the Globes, garnering a dozen nominations each. 
</P>
<P>
 There were two surprises in the best director category: Oliver Stone for his 
violent black comedy "Natural Born Killers," the controversial film's only 
nomination, and Ed Zwick, for the sweeping family saga "Legends of the Fall." 
Zemeckis, Redford and Tarantino round out the nominees. Apted was shut out of 
the race, though his film was nominated. 
</P>
<P>
 Best actor drama nominations went to last year's Oscar winner Tom Hanks for 
his title role in "Forrest Gump," John Travolta in "Pulp Fiction," Morgan 
Freeman in "The Shawshank Redemption" and Paul Newman in "Nobody's Fool." But 
few expected to see a nomination for Brad Pitt, who plays a distraught son in 
"Legends of the Fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Three-time Golden Globe winner Meryl Streep was nominated for her role in "The 
River Wild." Joining her in the best actress drama category were likely Oscar 
favorites Jodie Foster in "Nell" and Jessica Lange in "Blue Sky," as well as 
Jennifer Jason Leigh in "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle," and Miranda 
Richardson in "Tom & Viv." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Carrey, who exploded on the big screen with the unexpected hit "Ace 
Ventura: Pet Detective" and went on to star in two other hit comedies, was 
nominated for best actor in a comedy for "The Mask." Other nominees are Johnny 
Depp ("Ed Wood"), Hugh Grant ("Four Weddings and a Funeral") and Terence Stamp 
("The Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert"). A big surprise vote went 
to Arnold Schwarzenegger ("Junior"). 
</P>
<P>
 In the best actress in a comedy arena, nominees are Jamie Lee Curtis ("True 
Lies"), Geena Davis ("Speechless"), Andie MacDowell ("Four Weddings and a 
Funeral"), Shirley MacLaine ("Guarding Tess") and Emma Thompson ("Junior"). 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel L. Jackson, who was overlooked as a best actor (drama) nominee as a 
Bible-quoting hit man in "Pulp Fiction," though his role was largely equal to 
Travolta's, received a best supporting nod for the movie. He also received a 
best actor nomination for the HBO prison movie "Against the Wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Miranda Richardson was the only other nominee to receive nominations in both 
film and TV, with a best actress drama bid for "Tom & Viv" and best supporting 
actress nod for HBO's Nazi thriller "Fatherland." 
</P>
<P>
 The best supporting nominees for movies also include Martin Landau for his 
role as Bela Lugosi in "Ed Wood" and Dianne Wiest for "Bullets Over Broadway." 
Both have won several critics' awards for those performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the TV programs honored with Golden Globe nominations, CBS' quirky 
series "Picket Fences" led with five nominations, including best television 
series (drama). NBC's popular sitcoms "Frasier" and "Seinfeld," and "The 
Burning Season," HBO's drama about the Brazilian activist Chico Mendes, 
followed with four nominations each. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, CBS led the pack with 15 nominations, followed by NBC with 14, ABC 
with 12 and HBO with 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides "Picket Fences," which has received the Emmy for best dramatic series 
the past two years, the best television series (drama) nominees are "NYPD 
Blue," the cult fave "The X-Files" and the medical dramas "Chicago Hope" and 
"ER." The latter is the highest-rated new show of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to "Frasier," which also won the Emmy this year, and "Seinfeld,"

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: ANOTHER HOLIDAY CLASSIC: AN ODE TO ITO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A remarkable discovery was made recently regarding Clement Clarke Moore, who 
wrote that Christmas classic "A Visit From St. Nicholas." It seems that workers 
refurbishing a residence once occupied by Moore, who died in 1863, came across 
a trunk in the attic containing several of his works that had never been 
published. 
</P>
<P>
 Included was a largely different, astonishingly contemporary version of 
Moore's famous Yule poem, a tract that proves that, more than merely a skilled 
technician and sentimentalist, he was one of the most prophetic literary 
figures of his age. Talk about your futurists. 
</P>
<P>
 Now . . . not to boast or anything, but don't forget that this is the column 
that once gave you the political thriller "Sandinista Clause" and introduced 
those now-popular reconstructionist carols "Deck the Halls With Amy Fisher," 
"God Rest Ye Merry Cameramen," "Rudolph the Red," "Frosty the Anchorman" and 
the delightfully bawdy "Chests Roasting on an Open Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, it was only a couple of years ago that you read in this space a 
previously unpublished version of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" in which 
the Cratchits were a Nielsen family and sweet Tiny Tim debauched himself by 
watching "Geraldo." 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with that noble tradition, this recently discovered version of 
Moore's poem, one the modernist titled "Here Come de Judge," is offered here 
for your holiday perusal: 
</P>
<P>
 'Twas the night before trial, when all through the court, Not a brief was 
stirring, not even a tort; The cameras were posted outside with care, In hopes 
the defendant would soon be there; Reporters were nestled all snug in their 
beds, While visions of O.J. danced in their heads; And my wife in her kerchief 
and I in my cap, Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap -- When 
outside the courthouse there arose such a clatter, I sprang from my bed to see 
what was the matter. Away to the TV I flew like a glutton, Tore open the doors 
and pushed the "On" button. The 27-inch picture and its luminous sheen, Gave 
the luster of midday to the TV screen; When, what to my wondering eyes should 
then appear, But a miniature sleigh drawn by folks to jeer, With a little old 
driver, so famous and neat-oh, I knew in a moment it must be Judge Ito. He was 
dressed in his robe, from his head to his foot, While assigned to a case all 
tarnished with soot; A bundle of documents he had flung on his back, And he 
looked like a law clerk just opening his pack. He had a broad face and a little 
round belly, That shook when he laughed, as it did on the telly. But unlike his 
twinkly interview with Tritia, His eyes were weary, his manner farmisht-a. More 
rapid than eagles his coursers they came, And he whistled and shouted and 
called them by name: "Now lawyers, now voyeurs and all Diane Sawyers, "Now 
Dershowitzes and like-minded glitzes, "Now TV hoods scavenging Brentwood, "Now 
parasites and troglodytes, "Now Geraldos, now Rickis and other talk sickies, 
"Now Sally Jessy and lives so messy, "Now eye-to-eye bunglers and all Connie 
Chunglers, "Now CNN, again and again, "Now Larry King and Brothers Ringling, 
"Now you damn choppers and TV whoppers, "Now Times, Newsweeks and your rotten 
leaks, "On radio voids and trapezoids, "On quickie books and Enquirer schnooks, 
"On 'Hard Copy' and 'Court TV,' "On yellow glare of 'A Current Affair,' "On 
tabloid clowns chasing Goldmans and Browns, "On media snoops jumping through 
hoops, "On you lice chasing Heidi Fleiss, "On you vermin harassing Mark 
Fuhrman, "On shows that dine, from 'Dateline' to 'Nightline,' "On print corkers 
and creeps from New Yorker. "Although you plead innocent, "You're guilty 
absolutely 100%. "So when you have stopped enjoying the annoying, "With nary a 
thought of whom you're destroying. "When you comics have ceased your 
one-lining, "Without regard for whom your maligning. "When you newsies have 
stopped that jive, "With all the rumor that's live at five. "When you have 
ended your lowest of courses, "With your unreliable sources, "When you have 
finished going astray, "With Rosey, Faye Resnick and DNA. "When you have 
finished having your ball, "To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall! 
"Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!" "And pretty please, curse you, fall 
-- please fall!" Only then he exclaimed, ere he drove off a mile, "Happy 
Christmas to all, and to all a fair trial."

SOAPS STAR THALIA COMES ON STRONG; TELEVISION: SAYING SHE WAS 'BORN SEXY,' THE 
MEXICAN ACTRESS-SINGER IS LOOKING TO BUILD HER FAN BASE IN THE UNITED STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH HANANIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She plays a 16-year-old peasant girl in search of happiness on the smash 
Mexican soap opera "Marimar," now airing weeknights on KMEX-TV Channel 34. But 
a poor peasant girl is not all that 22-year-old Thalia plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the set, she also plays a sex goddess -- and does so well enough to have 
become the throbbing hub of an entertainment empire spanning movies, television 
and music. 
</P>
<P>
 Thalia's technique in an interview is to tease the inquisitor, telling the 
most outrageous tales about herself and seeing how much of it flies. During a 
recent two-hour conversation, she shared her wholehearted belief that she was 
"born sexy" and that she cannot walk the streets of either Los Angeles or her 
native Mexico City without crazed admirers swooning over her -- and maintained 
that none of this is an act; it's simply her lot in life. 
</P>
<P>
 She said all this not in the intimate confines of a private one-on-one meeting 
but in front of two publicists and her mother, who listened in from a nearby 
couch -- and didn't volunteer a word until she was spoken to. 
</P>
<P>
 Thalia -- she needs no last name in Mexico -- has just arrived in the United 
States. And although many in this country have never heard of her, her act -- 
both on and off the screen and concert halls -- has made her something of a 
Madonna in the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marimar" has scored smashing ratings here since premiering in October, KMEX 
officials report, and is the most popular show broadcast across the country by 
the station's parent network, Spanish-language Univision. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear Thalia tell it, it was always like this. 
</P>
<P>
 Her fame began at age 10 when she picked up on the singing career at which her 
mother had tried and failed. With Thalia as lead singer and bass guitarist, 
Timbiriche soon became one of the top groups not only in Mexico, but in all of 
Latin America, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Two and a half years later, Thalia appeared in her first soap opera, then 
appeared in a touring production of "Grease." She went on to star in "Maria 
Mercedes" and then "Marimar," soap operas named after her character. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently moving her mother into a secluded, hilltop house that she bought in 
Bel-Air, Thalia has begun shuttling between Mexico City and Los Angeles. She is 
also taking private English lessons -- the better to nab a starring role in a 
Hollywood movie. 
</P>
<P>
 When she does start knocking on Hollywood doors next year, she may be 
difficult to turn down -- coming in with a built-in Latino fan club. Her sales 
pitch here is not expected to differ much from the one that worked so well in 
Mexico: sexual fantasy. A recent photo in the widely circulated TV y Novelas , 
a sort of cross between TV Guide and People, features her wearing a black 
leather cap and see-through blouse while holding three dog leashes. At the end 
of the leashes are men on all fours, clad only in their underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the fantasy of every woman -- to hold at our feet servile and tame 
slaves, like in Roman times. And the worse we treat them, the more passionate 
they become," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that her views are universally popular in Mexico. Many radio stations, she 
says, would not play two tunes from her best-selling CD, "Thalia." The first 
song, "Saliva," is about a man and a woman getting drunk on champagne and 
kissing. The other, "A Pact Between the Two," is about a woman being beaten by 
a man -- until she discovers that she was only dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, she volunteers, decried "Saliva" as overly suggestive, and "Pact" as 
sadomasochistic. 
</P>
<P>
 So were they? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know. Maybe," she says with a smile and a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, the controversies have only pushed her popularity forward. And 
she's importing the formula that worked so well in Mexico to this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, she volunteers that, unlike her, American women often tend to be 
"beautiful but tranquil," lacking the Latina sexiness "that starts in the 
stomach like a fire, and then explodes out." She likewise offers that she has 
little use for narcissistic actors who lack true sensuality. Rather, she 
prefers her boyfriends to be uglier and authentic non-actors with "strong 
souls." 
</P>
<P>
 But she doesn't believe in going out with just one guy at a time, Thalia says. 
Rather, she prefers being surrounded by up to 10 men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to know that in all parts of the world, people want me. I need the 
attention."

POP MUSIC REVIEW; 'COLORS OF CHRISTMAS': A RAINBOW OF YULE, POP HITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Holiday cheer, pop hits, and smooth showmanship produced an evening of 
feel-good entertainment Wednesday night at the Cerritos Center for the 
Performing Arts, as the "Colors of Christmas" concert came to the stylish 
venue's in-the-round stage for a second season. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's program brought together singers Peabo Bryson, Roberta Flack, 
James Ingram and Sheena Easton, each getting a chance to perform separately and 
in a variety of duets. On Wednesday, the first of three sold-out performances, 
the vocalists were indeed colorful, but Christmas classics were given short 
shrift, with more time being spent on the individual performers' hits. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the hits still made satisfying holiday treats. Flack's 
gracefully smoky voice remains a remarkable instrument, and her revamping of 
"Killing Me Softly" was powerful and moving. So was her duet with Ingram on 
"Where Is the Love," which started as a slow-burn blues and then kicked into 
uptempo soulfulness.  
</P>
<P>
 Bryson is a charismatic performer with a skilled set of pipes, and his take on 
Mel Torme's "The Christmas Song" was a Yuletide highlight of the evening. His 
vocal flash sometimes approached overkill, but his playfulness and easygoing 
manner kept his performances enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ingram occasionally worked himself into distracting histrionics, he 
was particularly strong in duets -- with Easton on "We've Got Tonight" and 
Bryson on "Yah Mo B There." 
</P>
<P>
 Easton reached out to the holiday-weary by explaining that the true meaning of 
Christmas was not in Santa, reindeer or snowmen, but in post-shopping 
depression. Then she belted out an over-the-top version of "I Believe," which 
she said summed up her thoughts about Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The spunky singer knows how to hold a stage and work a crowd, but she wouldn't 
let a simple melody do its job, often piling on melisma and flourishes to the 
point of grating melodrama. Her forceful style finally was put to good use on a 
Spector/Springsteen-style rave-up of "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town."  
</P>
<P>
 Though Christmas was in the air, the concert had some strange musical moments. 
Flack paid tribute to Baby Jesus with a tender, hushed "What Child Is This?," 
but James Bond also got his due with Easton's hyper-intense "For Your Eyes 
Only." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram made an odd choice by performing his hit "I Don't Have the Heart," a 
song pretty short on glad tidings. And the evening's showstopper wasn't any 
Santa tune, but "A Whole New World" from Disney's "Aladdin," sung by Bryson and 
Easton. 
</P>
<P>
 The well-dressed family crowd didn't seem to mind the departure from holiday 
favorites and often clapped along or hooted out encouragement to whomever held 
the stage. Bryson and Ingram both took advantage of the intimate performance 
area and worked their way into the crowd as they sang. 
</P>
<P>
 The performers were backed with serviceable, workmanlike arrangements from a 
small orchestra. The players created some affecting passages on softer ballads 
but too often sounded stiff, especially on an awkwardly funky stab at "Joy to 
the World." 
</P>
<P>
 The singers occasionally were drowned out by heavy-handed drumming. They were 
better served by the stirring support of the Crenshaw High School Choir on 
several tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 The singers engaged in some treacly patter between songs and worked in a few 
shameless plugs for current albums, but mostly they exuded seasonal good will. 
The concert closed with all four on stage, tearing into a rousing gospel number 
that brought the house to its feet.

THEATER REVIEW; 'CHRISTMAS PAGEANT': NAUGHTY, NICE AND SILLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Revolving Door's "1994 A Dolt's Only Christmas Pageant," at the Tribune 
Theatre, may be a little irreverent, but not more so than many others that have 
preceded them. Though the program calls the evening "A Dolt's Only," the flyers 
use the phrase "Adults Only." The program is right, and besides, it says 
plainly, "If you are easily offended, you should be ashamed of yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing in the show to offend any but the most narrow-minded, and the 
only lack of taste is in the quality of some of the material. This is an acting 
company, not a writing company, and it's well known that Santa rarely leaves 
both gifts in the same stocking, even at Christmastime. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Beers' play, "An Anti-Chri 
</P>
<P>
 ma$ Carol," which makes up the second act, begins with a clever idea. A woman 
upsets her cynical husband by obstinately maintaining a cheerful attitude about 
the Yule season. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, just like Scrooge, she's visited by ghosts, but these try to 
whittle away her bubbling enthusiasm. It's an inventive twist to the tale, but 
the whole is carelessly and unevenly developed. The humor flags through erratic 
placement of emphasis and, eventually, just too much silliness. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half is an olio of song, guitar and fiddle, a couple of cute 
blackouts and poetry readings aimed at the season. Gary Tomlinson's "A Bankrupt 
Christmas," read with enthusiasm by the author, is bankrupt verse, emotionally 
scattered and weakened by literary pathways that are pointless and 
scansionless. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much stronger is Michael Mollo's reading of Tom Rush's "Potterville," which 
sharply and intricately slices up the sentimentality of "It's a Wonderful Life" 
and winds up sort of proving that "George Bailey was a chump / And Frank Capra 
was lying." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a highlight that must remain a surprise, a very funny rendition of 
"Little Drummer Boy." 
</P>
<P>
 * "1994 A Dolt's Only Christmas Pageant," Tribune Theatre, 116 1/2 W. Wilshire 
Ave., Fullerton. Tonight only, 8 p.m. $5. (714) 525-3403. Running time: 1 
hours, 50 minutes.

WELCOME TO DISNEY'S CREEP SHOW; LEGION OF EVILDOERS AWAIT FANS' DARK FANCY AT 
THE THEME PARK'S VILLAIN SHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the shadow of Sleeping Beauty's Castle lies a den of villainy and treachery 
unrivaled in the Magic Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an island of evil in an ocean of sunlight and goodness. Here, hook-handed 
pirates, crooked-nosed witches and fire-breathing dragons are cherished and 
celebrated. Of course, things being what they are in Disneyland, they are 
marketed and sold too. 
</P>
<P>
 Open for three years, Fantasyland's Disney Villain Shop sells the usual line 
of park merchandise: T-shirts, dolls, mugs, posters and key chains. But in a 
dark twist for the Happiest Place on Earth, the store's items are adorned by 
notorious Disney characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Disneyland visitors always drop by the little, dimly lit shop that 
champions evildoers, especially around the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, we come here every Christmas," said Jamie Madden, 30, who eventually 
settled on a T-shirt of the wicked Queen from "Snow White" after conferring 
with her mother, Bonnie. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really is the most disgusting, creepiest one we could find," said the 
San Diego loan processor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really awful, isn't it?" agreed Bonnie Madden, 50, a San Diego court 
stenographer, who will receive the gift Christmas morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Brae Williams, an 11-year-old from Portland, Ore., knew she was in the right 
place for certain family members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for something for my dad and brother," said Brae, a fan of 
Cinderella's cruel stepmother and Captain Hook. "My dad likes dragons and 
stuff, and my brother is more undercover, more secretive. So, I don't know what 
I'm going to get him." 
</P>
<P>
 The inspiration for the shop came from visitors. There were plenty of 
Cinderellas, Prince Charmings and smiling Mickeys, park officials repeatedly 
were told, but where were the Cruella de Vils ("101 Dalmatians") and Ursulas 
("Little Mermaid")? 
</P>
<P>
 "People would keep coming into shops asking for the Big Bad Wolf," said 
Patrice Davis, a Disneyland merchandiser, "and we didn't have any then." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first Villain Shop successfully debuted in Disney World, say park 
officials, so a second one was opened in Disneyland in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland's small shop creates an atmosphere befitting its ne'er-do-well 
citizenry. Cobwebs and dying ivy cling to its wall. And motion-detector skulls 
scream when unsuspecting visitors pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love the Villain Shop," said Pat Kennedy, 50, a human resources manager 
from Irvine, there with her two sisters. "First of all, it's a hidden shop, and 
a lot of people don't know about it. . . . The villains are really part of the 
fun. It brings back memories of being a child, when it was fun to be afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, as many shop patrons noted, where would a story be without a good 
bad guy? 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't have a good story without a good villain," said Tom Monson, 43, a 
computer engineer from Chandler, Ariz. "You judge the accomplishments of the 
hero by how much resistance he gets from the villain." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, said Jo Ette Munoz, 27, of Norco, real life isn't all roses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always a bad guy in life. Period."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone is enchanted by a shop devoted to evil. One little girl 
excitedly ran into the cave-like room, took one look at an Ursula doll and 
darted out the door. Another poked her head into the store and announced: "Oh, 
these are all villains. Let's go." 
</P>
<P>
 And evil things really can happen here. Last year, someone stole a $1,960 
print of Maleficent from a back wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still don't know how they did it," Davis said.

HAWKS' WINTER HAVEN; BIRDS OF PREY FLOCKING TO WILDLIFE REFUGE AT SEAL BEACH 
NAVAL STATION, SURVEY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bait was set. A small wire cage containing a mouse and a sparrow sat in a 
field, easily seen by any of the sharp-eyed red-tailed hawks in a nearby grove 
of eucalyptus trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 20 minutes, one of the large birds swooped in for a late breakfast and 
was snared. 
</P>
<P>
 An elated biologist, Pete Bloom, had one more startled young bird to measure, 
weigh and hold firmly, carefully avoiding its sharp talons, while he wrapped an 
aluminum identification band around its leg. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 116th red-tailed hawk that Bloom had banded and the 221st he had 
counted so far this winter at the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloom, who is under contract with the Navy to identify and count all birds of 
prey that utilize the 5,000 acres of marsh and uplands, works even after 
sunset, searching the night sky and fields with spotlights for owls. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey is part of a joint effort by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and 
the Navy to protect and enhance wildlife in the undeveloped part of the 
military facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides warehousing weapons, the site is an important winter destination and 
rest stop for southbound birds of prey along their historic migratory flight 
path between the Arctic Circle and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, biologists have achieved a resurgence of endangered shorebird 
species at the station by controlling predators and providing a man-made island 
and floating nests. 
</P>
<P>
 They also want to increase the numbers of hawks, owls and other birds of prey 
that mostly hunt in the station's expansive uplands that shoulder the marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Off limits to the public and protected from development, Bloom said, the large 
expanse of open space at the station is "an incredibly significant resource 
that supports several species of raptors (birds of prey) that are almost absent 
in the rest of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 And it is increasingly essential to migratory birds, he added, as other 
wetlands and open spaces fall to development along the western coast of North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Birds that are migrating south along the Pacific Flyway have no safe place to 
land and catch a meal in the 30 miles between the Santa Monica Mountains and 
Seal Beach," Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important aspect of the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station is that it 
is protected and will remain a sanctuary." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of his most surprising findings, Bloom said, is that the uplands provide a 
winter home to the highest density of red-tailed hawks in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 The booming population of red-tailed hawks, Bloom said, reflects an 
exceptional breeding year for the birds throughout California, Oregon and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The hawks, 90% of which were fledged last spring, are attracted to the base, 
he said, by an abundance of ground squirrels and gophers that inhabit the 
burrow-pocked fields and offer good eating. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloom said he has found 20 species of birds of prey on the base, including 
eight pairs of burrowing owls, a once common inhabitant of Orange County that 
has been nearly decimated outside the naval weapons station by development. 
"This is where they are making their last stand," Bloom said of the owls. 
</P>
<P>
 In the winter, the base is visited by a growing number of peregrine falcons, a 
bird of prey on the federal and state endangered species lists. Bloom said he 
expects at least 100 migrating peregrines to stop at the base this winter to 
feast on smaller shorebirds. 
</P>
<P>
 The peregrine population is starting to rebound nationwide because of a 
reduction in the use of agricultural pesticides and because of efforts to breed 
captive birds, whose offspring recently have been released to the wild in large 
numbers, Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While birds of prey inhabit the uplands, the marsh is filled with shorebirds 
and water fowl, including large flocks of Canada geese that drop in this time 
of year to feed on dry lima beans left after the harvest on nearby fields that 
the Navy leases to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 155 bird species use the station, said Rodd Kelsey, a biologist who 
works for the Navy and oversees protection of wildlife on the base. Among his 
challenges, he said, is dealing with barn owls that raise their young inside 
some of the partly vacant storage buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Kelsey's responsibilities, he said, is making certain that those 
who farm on the base do not endanger the birds by using pesticides or 
exterminating rodents that the birds depend on for their diet. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit for a significant local comeback of two bird species, the California 
least tern and the light-footed clapper rail, both of which are listed as 
endangered, is given to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which since 1972 
has operated about 1,000 acres of marshland on the base as a national wildlife 
refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 While the least tern population at the station dwindled to only five in 1983, 
Kelsey said, biologists last spring counted 198 pairs nesting on a man-made 
island surrounded by electric fencing to protect the terns' eggs from opossums, 
skunks, hawks and other predators. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Mitchell, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist at the weapons 
station refuge, said that there has been an even more dramatic rebound of 
light-footed clapper rails, which over the last eight years have multiplied at 
the refuge from 10 birds to 150. 
</P>
<P>
 Artificial floating nests have been provided to encourage the birds to breed 
on the water, out of the reach of skunks and opossums. 
</P>
<P>
 But most importantly, Mitchell said, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
between 1986 and 1993 trapped and removed about 300 red foxes, a non-native 
species of fox with a wide-ranging appetite that had been thriving on the 
endangered birds at the weapons station. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bloom said the light-footed clapper rail is not the only bird to have 
benefited from the removal of most of the red foxes; so have hawks and other 
birds of prey that no longer have to compete with the foxes for rodents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an ecosystem coming back into order," Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
 If development plans for the Bolsa Chica wetlands south of the weapons station 
are implemented, Bloom said, all of the Bolsa Chica uplands that support birds 
of prey will be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 One result, he said, may be a further increase in the number of hawks in Seal 
Beach. "However, some of the red-tailed hawks would not survive the loss of 
their homes," he warned. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of his findings, Bloom said, he may recommend that the Navy plant 
at the station native trees such as sycamores that have natural cavities 
favored by owls and limbs that other predatory birds can use for roosting, 
hunting and nesting.

2 OFFICERS INJURED IN FREEWAY ROADSIDE CRASH; TRAFFIC: CHP PATROLMEN WERE 
ARRESTING AN ALLEGED DRUNK DRIVER WHEN SQUAD CAR IS HIT BY A SECOND AUTO, ALSO 
DRIVEN BY A DUI SUSPECT.

<P>
 Two California Highway Patrol officers who were arresting an alleged drunk 
driver early Thursday on the Riverside Freeway were struck and injured, but not 
seriously, by another suspected drunk driver, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second driver, whose vehicle was disabled upon impact, was arrested almost 
immediately by other officers who heard a radio report of the accident. It was 
the second time in a day that a CHP vehicle in Orange County had been struck by 
an alleged drunk driver. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first crash, Officers Jeff Keul and Willis Whited were struck while 
standing to the right of their patrol car during an arrest near State College 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers cited the first driver, whose name was not available, on suspicion of 
misdemeanor drunk driving. She was sitting in the back of the patrol car 
talking to Keul through the open rear door, CHP Officer Joan Rivas said, when 
an eastbound auto struck the rear of the cruiser. Whited was standing near the 
right side of the front bumper at the time, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The force of the impact pushed the police car into the officers, throwing the 
officers about 20 feet down a dirt embankment, Rivas said. The auto then 
careened back onto the freeway and struck a UPS truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "The odd thing is our officers were trying to get people driving under the 
influence off the road," Rivas said. "And they do get one, and what happens? 
They're hit by another one." 
</P>
<P>
 Keul was in stable condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange on Thursday after 
suffering facial cuts and internal injuries, Rivas said. Whited was treated at 
Anaheim Memorial Hospital. The driver of the UPS truck and both alleged drunk 
drivers did not need medical attention, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the sedan, Tony Joongdon Choi, 20, of Lakewood was jailed on 
suspicion of felony drunk driving in lieu of $10,000 bail, a jail spokeswoman 
said. Choi had received a speeding ticket in January and has no outstanding 
warrants, according to records from the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Keul is a five-year veteran, and Whited has been with the CHP for six years. 
Officials said the two officers probably were not more seriously injured 
because they followed CHP procedures during the stop. "For safety reasons, all 
officers try to stand on the side that is away from traffic, or the right 
side," CHP Officer Denise Medina said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's accident occurred just hours after another CHP vehicle was struck 
by an alleged drunk driver on the San Diego Freeway in Seal Beach. The officer, 
Krista Crocker, was not injured. The driver, James Timothy Marzano, 38, of 
Yorba Linda was cited on suspicion of misdemeanor drunk driving and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Crocker had been driving north on the San Diego Freeway at the San Gabriel 
River Freeway when Marzano's car swerved into the patrol car, Rivas said. Both 
vehicles went off the roadway and came to a stop.

GIFTS GALORE; APPEAL BRINGS RUSH OF TOYS FOR TOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After weeks of dismally low donations, the Marine Corps on Thursday reported a 
sharp increase in gifts to its famous Toys for Tots program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A day after making an appeal, Staff Sgt. Michael Diaz said thousands of items 
were suddenly arriving at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, where donations 
this year had been off by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been inundated with so many calls," Diaz said. "People are driving 
right up to the barracks." 
</P>
<P>
 He expected 8,000 toys to arrive by day's end, but even so, Diaz feared that 
donations would still fall 24,000 short of the program's 57,000-toy goal. The 
Marines turn the gifts over to 91 social service agencies and churches, which 
in turn distribute the items to needy children. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive continues through today, and several hundred specially marked red, 
green and yellow barrels for toys have been placed around Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the Marines' request for more donations, an Irvine computer 
software company donated $5,000 worth of gifts, an Irvine sporting goods store 
gave 3,000 playground balls and a Laguna Niguel trading firm wrote out a $3,000 
check. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at it and we were kind of shocked actually," Diaz said of the 
check. "If we're good shoppers, we can buy 600 to 700 toys with the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz was excited by the arrival of so many gifts, saying, "the warehouse is in 
a state of chaos, but it's a good type. It seems like the morale (of Toys for 
Tots volunteers) is so much higher." 
</P>
<P>
 Some gift-givers who contacted the Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center, 
where donations were down 40%, were referred to El Toro.  
</P>
<P>
 A last-minute push is also on at South Coast Plaza, Laguna Hills Mall and the 
Tustin Marketplace. For more information, call (714) 726-6746 or the Los 
Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center, (310) 795-2389. 
</P>
<P>
 While things were looking up for the 48-year-old Toys for Tots program, 
officials at Operation Santa Claus said Thursday that they are facing a toy 
shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been horrendous. I've never seen anything like it," said Joanne Noyes, 
who coordinates the countywide program run by the Social Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Santa Claus distributes gifts to children up to age 17, many of whom 
live at Orangewood Children's Home or other group and foster homes. The program 
gave out presents to 16,000 children last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was four gifts a child last year. Now we're down to one gift a child," 
Noyes said, adding that some children might not get anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations may be dropped off at any local fire station or at the Orangewood 
Children's Home at 401 S. The City Drive, in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Rescue Mission officials said that they will hand out a surplus 
of about 7,000 donated toys on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Director Jim Palmer said that anyone "homeless or poverty-stricken" 
is invited to share in the rescue mission's unexpected bounty. 
</P>
<P>
 The rescue mission is at 1901 W. Walnut St., in Santa Ana.

NEW PARTNERS; SCHOOL PROGRAM PAIRS OFFICERS WITH AT-RISK CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHING-CHING NI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 10-year-old Daniel Lee, Santa Claus is dressed in dark blue, wears a badge 
and carries a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, his Santa, otherwise known as Los Angeles Police Officer Jim 
Rossum, noticed that Daniel's right toe was sticking out of his tennis shoes. 
So Rossum bought Daniel a new pair of black high tops as an early Christmas 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 But this Santa wants something in return for his generosity -- good behavior 
and better grades. To make sure that happens, Rossum tries to visit Daniel at 
school as often as he can. 
</P>
<P>
 All Daniel needs, said Rossum, who works out of the Wilshire Division, is "a 
friend, someone who cares." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether as a police officer or St. Nick, Rossum is a friend who cares.  
</P>
<P>
 So are about 20 other police officers at the Wilshire Division who have 
"adopted" children who need extra attention at Marvin Elementary School in the 
Wilshire district.  
</P>
<P>
 "Daniel comes from the roughest part of the Wilshire area," Rossum said. "A 
lot of these inner-city kids come from broken homes and are at risk of getting 
into gangs and drugs. We adopt them so we can take a stand in their lives and 
recruit them before the gangs and the drug dealers recruit them." 
</P>
<P>
 The program began in spring as a joint effort between the police and the 
school to help students with special problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The planning started last November when we were adopted by the Wilshire 
Division," said Anna McLinn, principal at the 1,080-student school, which 
serves kindergartners through fifth-graders. "But we wanted to do more than 
just, 'Hello, we are police officers.' We were heavily affected by the riots. 
We wanted our youngsters to know that police are not the bad people just 
because of Rodney King. We also wanted the officers who don't live in the area 
to know the plight of inner-city youths."  
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer officers devote at least a couple hours a week to helping the 
youngsters at school and sometimes at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go through his homework, get him extra assignments, help him with math 
divisions and sentence structures," said Officer Darcey McCall, who works with 
Jamal Adams, 10. "Next week we'll play basketball together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also talk about what's going on at home," she said. "He lives in a 
gang-infested area. We talk about what's right and wrong. He's become real 
receptive and responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 As a reward for improvement, the officers plan to take the students horseback 
riding next semester.  
</P>
<P>
 The students say they love the extra attention they are getting from their 
uniformed pals and that their friends envy them for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends say they want to be adopted by an officer, too," Jamal said. "They 
ask us how do you get one?" 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say they pair the officers with students who have high 
suspension rates or behavior problems. Officers can look through a portfolio on 
the students and select who they want to help. Parents must give written 
permission for their children to participate in the program.  
</P>
<P>
 The principal says the youngsters just need extra attention to help them 
concentrate in class and interact peacefully with their peers. "We wanted to do 
something . . . so these youngsters would not have a track record (of bad 
behavior) following them to junior high school," McLinn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Having a uniformed police officer suddenly appear in their lives was not an 
easy thing for the children to accept in the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I saw the officer I thought she was gonna take me to jail," 
Jamal said. "I was scared. I saw the police beat up on a man once. But after 
she talked to me I thought she was nice."  
</P>
<P>
 The only complaint Jamal has now is that his officer cannot visit him often 
enough. The organizers admit that there are more children in need of attention 
than there are officers to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program doesn't really cost anything . . . just the officer's desire to 
commit time," said Sgt. Ron Batesole, who works with an 8-year-old boy. 
However, Batesole said it is not easy to get volunteers for the program because 
"a lot of officers don't live close to the community and everybody has their 
own things to do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That is why children envy Daniel. Rossum tries to visit him every day during 
lunch. The officer said he picked the youngster because he knew he would need 
to spend extra time with him. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few months of one-on-one meetings at the school, the two interact like 
buddies. Rossum sometimes greets the shy youngster as "Big Daniel," and gently 
pound fists with the boy in a gesture of friendship.  
</P>
<P>
 Daniel's teacher, June Boyd, said "he's turned around 100%."

<P>
 "I found out he's very artistic," Boyd said. "Before (being paired up with 
Rossum) I couldn't tell what he was good at besides causing problems."  
</P>
<P>
 Rossum, the father of three young children, says he particularly wants to see 
Daniel improve in school because he sees a lot of himself in the youngster.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been there myself," Rossum said. "I grew up in the inner city. I know 
how to relate to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to accomplish is not going to take place overnight," he 
said. "You just can't enter a person's life one day and not show up the next. 
Kids are very smart. They know when you're real and when you're not."  
</P>
<P>
 Parent Janiet Leday says she appreciates what the officers are doing and the 
children. But she does not like the label "problem kids." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowadays we grow up early. It used to be 15 was the age of growing up. These 
kids survive anyway they can. But when you address them as problem kids they 
become problem kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Some officers say they have volunteered their time and love to help ease these 
growing pains. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Sharen Stallworth took the 11-year-old girl she works with home for 
Thanksgiving even though the girl graduated from Marvin in June. Stallworth 
continues to keep an eye on the girl and plans to invite her home for a week 
over Christmas.  
</P>
<P>
 "I try to tell a lot of these officers if you promise them something you got 
to do it," Stallworth said. She kept her promise to take the girl to Raging 
Waters even though the officer broke her ankle after she made the promise.  
</P>
<P>
 "In their whole life they've been promised many things," Stallworth said. "For 
example, when you're a kid you're supposed to have a mother and a father. But 
many of them don't have that. When I'm around her she's always hugging and 
holding my hand. All they need is a little attention and you see a big change."

OFFICER KILLED BY ROBBER HAILED FOR HIS COURAGE; VIOLENCE: RELATIVES SAY THOMAS 
WORLEY WAS ACTING IN CHARACTER WHEN HE CONFRONTED A GUNMAN AT A CANOGA PARK 
SHOE STORE.

<P>
 Pam Worley was in line to pay at the register of the Payless ShoeSource in 
Canoga Park when ex-convict Jesus Valenzuela burst into the discount store with 
a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 As the clerks emptied out the register, she crawled out on her hands and knees 
to her husband, off-duty Los Angeles County Safety Police Officer Thomas 
Worley, who was in the crowded parking lot of the strip mall. 
</P>
<P>
 She told her husband the store was being robbed. He grabbed his badge. After 
confronting Valenzuela, the two men exchanged gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety minutes later, both were dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew Thomas Worley said Thursday that he believed police work was 
more of a calling than a profession and that he had been acting in character. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way he wanted to go, if he was going to go," said one family 
member, Jeff Smolek. "He did just what any officer would do." 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, 33, was the 11th peace officer to be gunned down in the last year and 
a half in Southern California. And as police, family and friends grappled with 
the shock of Wednesday's events, there was widespread praise for Worley's 
courage and valor. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, according to family and friends, was living a dream. He had always 
wanted to be a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Agoura High School, he spent seven years as a police 
officer in the Air Force, rising to the rank of staff sergeant. When he got 
out, he worked as a private security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993, he was accepted into the Safety Police, the sworn officers who 
provide armed security for county facilities, including 59 hospitals and 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 On his application form, according to one law enforcement official, Worley 
wrote: "I like helping people and I don't like when innocent or defenseless 
people are victimized. I feel drawn to law enforcement because of this. I also 
believe in 'callings.' A calling to religious service or medicine. I feel a 
'call' to law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Worley graduated from the Rio Hondo Police Academy in Whittier. 
He was assigned to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, where he worked the 
evening shift. 
</P>
<P>
 As evening fell Wednesday, Worley picked his wife up from work. To prepare for 
a full night of Christmas shopping, Pam Worley asked him to stop at Payless so 
she could buy a pair of comfortable shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it," Pam Worley, 29, and the mother of two children, ages 6 
and 2, said Thursday at her mother's Canoga Park apartment. "Just to get a pair 
of shoes, just to wear for a couple of hours." 
</P>
<P>
 As Pam Worley waited in line about 6:15 p.m. at the cash register, a clerk 
bent down to pick something up from beneath the counter. It was then that the 
suspect, Valenzuela, 44, of Canoga Park, walked up and pointed a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Worley said she ducked down on all fours and crawled outside to her 
husband, who was in the parking lot. "I whispered to him that there was a man 
with a gun," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Worley was carrying his gun, a 9-millimeter Beretta, but dashed to 
their car to grab his badge, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She heard her husband identify himself as an officer. Then the shooting began. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela fired three shots from his .38-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver, 
police said. "One of the rounds struck the badge in Tom's hand," said Clifton 
Williams, president of the 400-member Los Angeles County Safety Police Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Another hit Worley in the chest. A third hit his groin. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, Tom had the presence of mind to return fire," Williams said, hitting 
Valenzuela in the chest and in the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley was not wearing a bulletproof vest. A firefighter performed CPR at the 
scene and Worley was taken to a medical center less than a block away, where he 
was pronounced dead, said Daryl Meeks, assistant chief of the Safety Police. 
Valenzuela did not initially appear to be badly hurt, but a bullet had pierced 
his liver and he died of internal bleeding half an hour before Worley.  
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, who would have turned 45 on Christmas Day, had three robbery 
convictions and was a veteran of state prison, according to officials at the 
state Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral arrangements for Worley were pending Thursday. Police announced the 
creation of a fund for the two children. Tax-deductible donations may be sent 
to: LAC+USC Foundation, Thomas Worley Fund, 1200 N. State St., Room 1112, Los 
Angeles, 90033.

A MATERIALISTIC FATE FOR A PHILOSOPHICAL LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bitter fight over books filled with the secrets of harmony and inner peace 
has ended -- four years after the mysterious death of a Los Angeles scholar who 
spent a lifetime roaming the world to collect them. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Manly P. Hall's library of 18,000 books and artifacts will stay where 
he put them, at the nonprofit Philosophical Research Society he created and ran 
for 56 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute over ownership of the unusual cache of writings on such subjects 
as Chinese metaphysics, Zen Buddhism and Hermetic wisdom had raged between 
Hall's 89-year-old widow and the man who took over the library and control of 
the society after Hall's death in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The court fight turned out to be a costly one for the legacy of Manly Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides soiling the final memory of the gentlemanly, pipe-smoking scholar, 
Hall's supporters say the legal wrangling cost $2 million and has come close to 
putting an end to the Philosophical Research Society library in the Los Feliz 
district, where Hall spent six decades gathering the secrets of mankind's most 
revered thinkers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ironic that all of this could come down on someone who had so much 
integrity when he was alive," said Ron Garner, a Huntington Beach mortgage 
banker and a society member since 1963. Garner said that participation in 
society activities has dwindled and that followers were concerned that if the 
books landed in the wrong hands they might be sold for profit, further 
diminishing the impact of Hall's lifetime of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole episode has been such a contradiction to Manly's life," said Irene 
Bird, a real estate broker from Los Alamitos with a 30-year society 
affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, Manly Hall would have been mortified by the scramble caused 
by his death on Aug. 29, 1990 -- six days after he signed his estate over to an 
assistant who was helping with the day-to-day operations of the Philosophical 
Research Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Widow Marie Bauer Hall went to court to overturn the will, alleging that 
Daniel Fritz and several associates had conned her husband of 40 years into 
signing over personal and society property worth $10 million after he had 
become senile. 
</P>
<P>
 She contended that Fritz, a banker who had worked in computer marketing and 
said he was an ordained minister, befriended her husband in 1987 and 
represented himself as an "Oriental priest" who could help the aging Hall 
"improve his health." 
</P>
<P>
 Fritz denied any wrongdoing. He asserted that Manly Hall was mentally alert to 
the end and signed the new will of his own accord. Fritz also said Hall had 
designated him to run the research society after his death and handle its 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretrial wrangling took 30 months, with lawyers cranking out more than 325 
motions, declarations and depositions. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial started in mid-1993. A handful of followers of the charismatic Hall 
listened glumly as details of his final days and his death -- a coroner's 
report blamed heart disease -- were discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a far cry from the days when hundreds would attend Hall's lectures on 
ethics and morality, comparative religion and medieval philosophy and listen 
intently as he spoke for 90 minutes at a time without pausing to look at notes 
or to take a sip of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Fritz was removed from his society position after Superior Court Judge Harvey 
A. Schneider invalidated Hall's will in August, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did Mr. Fritz effectively steal from Mr. Hall? I think the answer is clearly 
yes," Schneider said in court. "The evidence is overwhelming that Mr. Fritz 
exerted undue influence over Mr. Hall . . . the whole thing just doesn't pass 
any reasonable person's sniff test." 
</P>
<P>
 But the dispute over ownership of the library's 16,500 books and other 
treasures -- such as Babylonian tablets, an ancient Japanese sutra written in 
blood and the bones of a 3,000-year-old Chinese oracle -- continued into this 
year, with periodic hearings in Schneider's courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, lawyers for Marie Hall and for the society finally hoisted white 
flags. 
</P>
<P>
 It was agreed that she would drop any claim to the collection in exchange for 
free title to the Hillhurst Avenue home she and her husband had shared, plus 
the return of works of art the pair had collected. 
</P>
<P>
 The society also agreed to pay her $50,000, return her husband's stamp 
collection valued at $270,000 and give her 214 volumes of Rosicrucian and 
alchemy books from the society library so she can sell them to a European 
collector. Those volumes are valued at $804,000. Fritz also agreed to pay her 
$120,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement is worth $1.9 million, according to her attorney, Martin J. 
Kirwan of Carpinteria. "I'm glad to see it over for Marie's sake," said Kirwan, 
who will be paid $600,000 out of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kirwan, society officials have acknowledged spending about $1.1 
million on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Odom, a Los Angeles lawyer who represented the society, declined to 
comment. Fritz could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walter Hansell, a San Francisco lawyer who serves as general counsel and 
trustee of the society, said the group and its 23,000 supporters nationwide 
want to put the nastiness behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 The society "was very disrupted by Mr. Hall's death and the controversy with 
his widow," Hansell acknowledged. "It's certainly fair to say that the nature 
of the litigation process is at complete odds with Mr. Hall's essential 
philosophies." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Marie Hall said there are still some loose ends that need tying 
up. Manly Hall's death, for one: Los Angeles police homicide detectives say the 
case is still open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I firmly believe it was murder," she said in an interview.

ENLISTING MILITARY AID; LAW ENFORCEMENT: POLICE IN PASADENA AND OTHER CITIES 
ARE ADAPTING DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY FOR USE IN THE WAR ON CRIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena police were hot on the trail of a suspected car thief when he 
abruptly bailed out of the automobile and fled into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, continuing the pursuit would have meant sealing off a 
neighborhood and searching yards with officers, dogs and a helicopter beaming 
an overhead spotlight -- a laborious, time-consuming process yielding uncertain 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 But on this night, using infrared automatic tracking technology, similar to 
guidance systems that allowed "smart bombs" to find their targets in the 
Persian Gulf War, officers in a helicopter "locked on" to the fugitive with 
surveillance equipment. They watched him hide in bushes and alerted patrol 
officers to his camouflaged location. They arrested him within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an example of how military technology, less in demand in an era of 
mounting defense cutbacks, has begun to trickle down to law enforcement. In 
Pasadena's case, a Chatsworth defense company is giving the Police Department 
the use of the $120,000 tracking system in an effort to perfect it for police 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we turn down the heat on the Cold War, the defense industry market is 
disappearing and so (contractors) are trying to convert," said Bill Russell, 
commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department's Support Service 
Bureau. "The most obvious conversion is law enforcement, which is the greatest 
parallel to the military." 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, transit police use night vision goggles, originally designed for 
military pilots, to find graffiti taggers and the homeless in subway tunnels. 
In San Diego, the California Highway Patrol is trying out a satellite system, 
originally created for military navigation, that could enable officers to 
quickly locate patrol cars to more speedily assist an injured officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Shinnamon, chief of the operations bureau of the Baltimore County, Md., 
police and chairman of the International Assn. of Chiefs of Police aviation 
committee, says various manufacturers have begun to tinker with miliary 
equipment to make it better suit the needs of police. Westinghouse, for 
instance, is marketing a police surveillance aircraft aimed at combatting drug 
smugglers, using radar similar to that of an F-16 fighter jet. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the flow of defense technology to civilian industries -- not just 
police departments -- will increase in the years ahead. Already, technicians 
have realized that they can produce better air bags for cars using a device 
similar to a missile detonator. Wide-band radar can be used to verify that the 
steel bars embedded in concrete on construction projects have been properly 
placed. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that this equipment is expensive. The question is, as Jack 
Kyser, chief economist with the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp., puts 
it: "Is it really feasible? Is it durable for everyday usage?" 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Pasadena police are trying to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many police helicopter units have infrared cameras, Pasadena police 
are believed to be the first in the nation to use the cutting-edge equipment 
with an automatic tracking device. An infrared camera works by detecting heat, 
rather than light. With the automatic tracking device, police can monitor a 
specific target -- say, a person crouched in a doorway -- and follow the 
activities of that target. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology is so sophisticated that on a cool night the camera can show 
footsteps across a yard. Or it can show tire treads, indicating the direction 
in which a parked car has sped off -- a valuable clue when police arrive at an 
abandoned site. 
</P>
<P>
 "Infrared was the biggest step for law enforcement, and this tracking is the 
next step beyond," said Pasadena investigator and chief pilot Robert Mulhall. 
"It's like using a typewriter, then switching to a computer and you don't have 
to use whiteout and erasing tapes. You wonder, 'How were we ever able to live 
without this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Pasadena's police helicopter unit began using the infrared technology 
almost two years ago, its arrest rate increased 20%. The unit is instrumental 
in about 60 arrests each month, Mulhall said. With the automatic tracking 
system, Mulhall predicted that the arrest rate will rise at least another 10%.  
</P>
<P>
 A camera mounted beneath the helicopter relays an image to the television-like 
monitor in the two-person cockpit. The "observer," sitting beside the pilot, 
can turn the camera in various directions or zoom in for close-ups, providing 
color images in daylight and infrared ones at night. The pictures can be 
instantly relayed to police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Pasadena police began using the automatic tracking device in June, 
the observer had to visually track suspects -- a tricky task considering the 
number of cars and obstacles such as underpasses on the road, said Officer Joe 
Longoria, who has used the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of a pursuit, it was difficult for observers to juggle 
surveillance with other tasks, such as manning the spotlight or checking the 
location of police cars. Each time an observer took his eye off the suspect's 
vehicle, he ran the risk of losing it. But with the automatic tracking device, 
the observer is better able to help orchestrate chases, Longoria said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent night, Longoria and a pilot flew to a pharmacy where an alarm had 
gone off. 
</P>
<P>
 Flying high and using the infrared camera, Longoria could see two people on 
the side of the building. Because the helicopter was so far away, the suspects 
"knew we were there, but they didn't think we could watch them," Longoria said. 
As Longoria watched with the infrared camera, the two burglars broke in; he 
summoned officers in squad cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the automatic tracking infrared technology, the police would have 
flown low and put their spotlight on the suspects. "We probably wouldn't have 
made that arrest," Longoria said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Longoria and the other officers who use the system swear by it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could fly over the Arroyo Seco at 100 m.p.h. and tell in three minutes if 
anyone was there," Mulhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tracking system -- developed by Carl F. Konoski, president of 
Chatsworth-based Dynametric Systems Co. -- is still being perfected. Konoski is 
fine-tuning software so the system will not get confused when, for instance, a 
vehicle enters a tunnel. Konoski said he chose the Pasadena police because of 
"their spirit of adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 Konoski meets regularly with the pilots and observers, quizzing them about the 
system's strengths and weaknesses. In several months, he hopes to have a 
perfected model. In exchange for their input, the Pasadena police will receive 
a free system.

2 FOLLOW-HOME ROBBERS RANSACK HOUSE; VAN NUYS: INCIDENT IN WHICH FAMILY WAS 
TIED UP PROMPTS POLICE TO AGAIN WARN LATE SHOPPERS TO USE EXTRA CARE AS THEY 
HEAD HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The follow-home robbers who have plagued the Valley in the last week struck 
again Thursday, leading police to renew warnings to late-night Christmas 
shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest incident, four members of a Van Nuys family, including a 
78-year-old grandmother, were tied up for two hours while two men who had 
followed the father home ransacked their house. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier incident Wednesday night, a Northridge woman carrying groceries 
from her car was shoved to the ground by an armed pair who robbed her of 
jewelry and a purse. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're follow-homes, that's for sure," Lt. Dan Hoffman of the Los Angeles 
Police Department's Valley Bureau said Thursday. "Only the difference this time 
is they ransacked a house." 
</P>
<P>
 The new twist could mean more than one group is responsible, or "it could mean 
they're getting bolder," said Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Department officials say there have been eight to 10 such incidents in 
the northwest Valley in one week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wednesday-night attack on a 58-year-old Northridge woman on Los Alimos 
Street fits the pattern of at least eight others that have occurred in the 
Devonshire Division of the LAPD, said division Lt. Bob Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 Two assailants knocked the woman to the ground as she toted a bag of groceries 
from her car to her house at about 8:45 p.m., said Normandy. They took jewelry 
and money before fleeing, possibly in a light brown, mid-sized station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Van Nuys incident, a pair of assailants kept the terrified family of 
drummer Len Coulter -- including his wife, her mother visiting from Texas and a 
7-year-old son -- taped up in a rear room of their Van Nuys home for almost two 
hours. They even borrowed scissors to help cut the duct tape they used to bind 
the family, said Amy Coulter, 17, who was forced at gunpoint to take one of the 
assailants on a tour of the family's valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair accosted Len Coulter as he lugged his drums into his garage after 
returning from work at 1:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The two seemed interested only in electronics and cash, leaving behind the 
family's Christmas presents, Amy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked us if we had any appliances under the tree," she said. "They saw the 
jewelry. They didn't take the jewelry. They just wanted the appliances, as they 
called them." 
</P>
<P>
 While Amy led the robbers around, the rest of the family sat, bound by the 
tape, on a bed in the parents' bedroom, guarded by the other robber. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were here for a good hour or two," said Amy. "That's what made it worse. 
It seemed like they would never leave." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident didn't leave a good impression of Los Angeles with grandmother 
Frankie Watson, who took solace in Bible readings and some sewing after the 
incident Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want to live here," she said. "I'd like to take them closer to 
Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 In the more than 10 years the Coulter family has lived in their Forbes Avenue 
home, they could recall just one minor burglary about five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is some way to start a Christmas vacation," said Amy. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have cautioned holiday shoppers to be more aware of their surroundings, 
keep lights on around their homes, and to drive to a police station if they 
think they are being followed. The incidents seem to occur between 9 p.m. and 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailants are not afraid to use firearms, as one man who chased them 
found out. The 52-year-old victim was shot in the chest last Friday as he tried 
to take back some of the goods the thieves stole from him in the 17100 block of 
Prairie Street in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 A shot also was fired at a man as he fled the assailants Tuesday night in the 
9300 block of Valjean Avenue in North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Although concerned enough about the rash of robberies to call in extra help, 
Valley police officials also said the crimes are consistent with the Christmas 
season, which brings out opportunists preying on cash-laden consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at this historically, you always have more robberies around 
Christmas because people have more cash," said Normandy. "What concerns me is 
this is one group of people committing a lot of robberies" in the Devonshire 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Thursday, the assailants had never forced their way into a home, leading 
Normandy to believe more than one group could be responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've had opportunities to take cars -- some pretty expensive ones, too -- 
and haven't, and they've had opportunities to go into houses and haven't," 
Normandy said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the space of just two hours on Tuesday night alone, four victims were 
attacked within a radius of a few miles in the northwest Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailants have been described as 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet tall, were 
armed with handguns, and have taken measures to conceal their faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Coulter reported the pair who robbed her house covered the lower parts of 
their faces with bandannas, wore ski caps on their heads, and were dressed in 
black.  
</P>
<P>
 In one other incident, the assailants wore ski masks, but in most others, they 
concealed their faces with large sweat shirt hoods, according to Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no pattern in the type of vehicles the robbers follow, nor where the 
victims were before arriving home -- although many were shopping for gifts or 
food. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, police have received a wide array of descriptions of getaway 
cars, said Normandy. They have enlisted the help of Neighborhood Watch groups 
and urge anyone with information on suspects to call their local police 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Safety Tips Police have offered the 
following advice to avoid falling victim to "follow-home" robberies: 
</P>
<P>
 * Be aware of your surroundings and look for people who may be watching you. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you believe you are being followed, don't drive home. Drive to a police 
station. If you are afraid to get out of your car, stay inside and honk the 
horn. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep areas around your house and driveway well lighted. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you have a cellular phone, use it. Dial 911.

POLICE IDENTIFY BODIES IN LOCKER; SUSPECT SOUGHT; INQUIRY: THE THREE, FOUND IN 
NORTHRIDGE, HAD ALL BEEN BEATEN AND ONE HAD BEEN SHOT, AUTHORITIES SAY. ARREST 
WARRANT IS ISSUED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More than four months after their decaying corpses were discovered in a 
Northridge storage locker, two men and a woman were identified Thursday by Los 
Angeles police, who said all of the victims had been beaten and one had also 
been shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Police issued an arrest warrant for 30-year-old Harnoko Dewantono from 
Indonesia, who is suspected of committing the murders. The victims were 
identified as Eri Tri Harto Darmawan, 26; Gina Sutan Aswar, 30; and Surish 
Michandani, who police said was about 45. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Dewantono -- whose nickname is "Oki" -- has been in the 
United States on and off for several years on a student visa, although it is 
unclear if he was ever enrolled in a college or university, Detective Ted Ball 
told a downtown news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We linked him to the crime through physical evidence found in the storage 
locker," Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police declined to describe the evidence and refused to speculate on a motive 
for the killings. Investigators did say that Dewantono knew the victims either 
socially or through business dealings, but they are unsure whether the victims 
knew each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the suspect had sold Michandani a now-defunct Woodland Hills 
dry-cleaning business. Dewantono knew the others socially, police said, and may 
have been Aswar's roommate before she disappeared in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of gaps in what we know, but we hope some member of the 
public who knew the victims or knows the suspect will come forward and help us 
out," said Lt. Al Moen, head of the LAPD's Major Crimes Investigation Section. 
</P>
<P>
 The identification process took about a month and relied heavily on modern 
forensics. Police waited several weeks to release the names because they did 
not want to tip their hand in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 After an anthropologist determined the sex, height, race and other physical 
characteristics of the victims, medical examiners identified Darmawan by 
rehydrating his fingers to get fingerprints. Dental records were used to 
identify Aswar, coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All three had been badly beaten on their heads, and Michandani had also been 
shot, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know if they were struck by a bat or a club or what," said Carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Michandani has not been identified officially by coroner's investigators, but 
police say they are certain he is the third victim. 
</P>
<P>
 All three victims lived in Los Angeles, and all were reported missing in 1991 
or 1992, police said. An official at the Indonesian Consulate said Darmawan and 
Aswar were Indonesians traveling on student visas. Police said Michandani was 
from India, but had spent most of his life in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the victims had family in the United States, though police have 
notified their relatives abroad, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, who uses several aliases, was last seen in February, 1993, in the 
Lake Forest area of Orange County where he had an apartment, Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the case stumped detectives, who were unable to identify the 
victims because the bodies were too badly decomposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies were discovered on a hot day in August by an unsuspecting 
storage-room prospector, who purchased the contents of the U-Haul room sight 
unseen at a public auction after the owner failed to keep up with his rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid such items as dishes, stereo equipment and at least three guns, the buyer 
noticed a foul smell and found one body wrapped in plastic and duct tape. 
Later, authorities found two others. Each body was surrounded by room 
deodorizers and mothballs, in an apparent attempt to hide the smell of decay.

2 SERVICES THAT LIST RENTALS ARE SCOLDED; HOUSING: STATE AGENCY ISSUES REFRAIN 
ORDERS TO VALLEY FIRMS THAT CLIENTS HAVE COMPLAINED DO NOT GIVE PROMISED 
REFUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Department of Real Estate has reprimanded two San Fernando 
Valley rental listing services that have been targets of dozens of lawsuits and 
consumer complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency issued citations, called desist and refrain orders, to Valley 
Management of Van Nuys and Quality Rentals of Burbank. Officials of the firms 
could not be reached for comment. The Times reported earlier this month that 
the Real Estate Department and police in Van Nuys, Burbank and Glendale had 
been flooded with complaints from angry renters who accused the home-finding 
businesses of lying about their services and refund policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies typically charge a $150 fee to provide and update lists of 
available houses and apartments. Under state law, they are required to refund 
all but a $25 service charge to clients who don't find a suitable rental, but 
many customers said they were refused their promised refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 By last summer, complaints to the Real Estate Department, which regulates the 
rental services, were "pouring in," an official said. But the orders issued 
Wednesday did not directly address those complaints.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, neither order mentioned problems with refunds, the main subject 
of complaints. Nor did the orders cite the companies' use of contracts that 
were not pre-approved by the Real Estate Department, as state law requires. 
</P>
<P>
 The orders directed each firm to cease operating without a required state 
license. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Management lacks a license, but is also out of business -- having 
abruptly closed in October after promising refunds to numerous customers, 
according to customers and the firm's former landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 When the firm shut down, another unlicensed rental service, Sunwest 
Properties, opened an office in Studio City that was rented by Richard S. 
Toohey and Michael Jackson, the same men who had operated Valley Management. A 
Sunwest official said the firms were not connected. 
</P>
<P>
 No order has been issued to Sunwest, and the Valley Management order did not 
mention the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why the department moved against a defunct firm that lacked a license, 
instead of an active, unlicensed firm, an official cited delays caused by a 
heavy caseload. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are aware of the problem and I can assure you that we are in the process 
of addressing (it)," said Randy Brendia, regional enforcement chief for the 
real estate department in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I can't assure you is they (Sunwest) won't be gone by the time we" take 
action, Brendia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective John Metcalf, of the LAPD's bunco forgery division, said he is 
investigating Sunwest because he's "aware that Sunwest Properties appears to be 
operating without a license." 
</P>
<P>
 The Quality Rentals order also directed that firm and its owner, Vickie L. 
Cardoza, to cease operating without a license -- even though the order 
acknowledged that the firm has had a license since August. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoza had operated a Glendale rental listing service called Properties 
Unlimited, which closed last summer after being named in about 20 lawsuits in 
small claims court. She opened Quality Rentals in Burbank in July a few weeks 
before getting a state license. 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials said Cardoza's action could have been grounds for denial 
of a license to Quality Rentals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why the department raised the issue now instead of then, Brendia 
admitted, "It doesn't make much sense. . . . I can't put a happy face on it. I 
can only tell you the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Brendia said, the license problem now is part of the firm's operating 
record. If "someone (a prospective customer) calls up, they can find out." 
</P>
<P>
 The department has the power to suspend or revoke licenses. Brendia declined 
to comment when asked if the department is considering further action against 
Quality Rentals. 
</P>
<P>
 But referring to complaints about the firm, Brendia said, "I'd be a darn fool 
. . . if I had that information and did nothing with it, and I'm not a damn 
fool."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; RECYCLE YULE TREES AT DROP-OFF POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank officials are asking residents to recycle their Christmas trees at one 
of several citywide locations in the weeks following the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will not, as in past years, have special alley/curbside collections 
to pick up trees this year but rather has scheduled five sites where residents 
can drop them off for composting, said spokeswoman Cinda Cates. 
</P>
<P>
 Trees can be dropped off between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. Dec. 27 through Dec. 31 and 
Jan. 3 through Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Sites available for tree drop-off are Brace Canyon Park, 2800 Haven Way; 
Verdugo Park, 3201 W. Verdugo Ave.; McCambridge Park, 1515 N. Glenoaks Blvd.; 
Ralph Foy Park, 3200 W. Victory Blvd.; and Izay/Olive Park, 1111 W. Olive Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who have been supplied with green recycle containers by the city 
have another option. They can cut up their trees -- after making sure that 
ornaments, lights and stands have been removed -- and place them in the 
containers for pickup on their regular collection days. 
</P>
<P>
 Recycled trees will be turned into mulch and composting material. Flocked 
trees cannot be composted and should be put in residents' black refuse 
containers, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank recycling program, in its fifth year, recycled 78 tons of 
Christmas trees last year. For more information, call the sanitation division 
at (818) 953-6622. JENNIFER OLDHAM

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: PIG TAKES OFFICER 'FOR A RIDE' ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CHP Officer Joe Morrison figured the traffic jam ahead of him Thursday 
signaled a crash -- until he saw the white pig waddling toward him. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and witnesses said the pig, weighing more than 300 pounds, had fallen 
off a truck and into traffic on the westbound Riverside Freeway near the 
Riverside County line. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time in two weeks that a pig had gotten loose on an Orange 
County freeway. Last week, a 400-pound sow escaped from a farm at Westminster 
High School and made it onto the San Diego Freeway nearby before she was 
rounded up. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison, who had been on his way to work at 1:20 p.m. when he encountered the 
pig, happened to have a pole and harness used to snare stray dogs. But "it 
wasn't doing me much good, because the pig was dragging me down the freeway," 
he said. "The pig was taking me for a ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Four or five people helped by shoving the squealing animal away from traffic, 
which witnesses said backed up at least a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a city boy," said Ken Skolyan, a computer teacher at Westminster High 
School who tried to calm the animal before animal-control officials roped and 
tugged it into a truck. "A squealing pig is not a good sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison, a canine officer, said he learned a thing or two about pigs 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never smelled anything so horrendous in my life," said Morrison, looking 
forward to a change of clothes. "I stink." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Orange County animal control officers will wait a week for the owner 
to claim the pig, then auction it. Skolyan said one of the drivers who stopped, 
a well-dressed woman on her way to a meeting, said she'd like to adopt it. KEN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; CITY OKS 51-UNIT HOUSING PROJECT FOR SENIOR 
CITIZENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week unanimously approved a proposed 51-unit seniors 
housing project on the northeast corner of Nelson Street and Acacia Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing project will be built on a vacant 1.6-acre lot that developer 
SWACO Partnership has acquired from the city in exchange for a slightly more 
than half of an acre of property south of Acacia Parkway and east of Nelson 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The half-acre parcel currently has a 12-unit apartment, but city officials 
plan to tear down the building and develop the property for commercial 
purposes. Tenants in the 12-unit apartment are expected to move to the housing 
project once it is completed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a nice Christmas present," said Art Schatzeder, 76, a retired Cypress 
city engineer, who is developing the project with his partner, Telesforo 
Alvarez, 61, also a retired engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will be financed by a $3.8-million loan from the California 
Housing Finance Agency, Schatzeder said. He expects construction to begin by 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the proposed 51 rental units, 45 will be one-bedroom apartments, and six 
will have two bedrooms.  
</P>
<P>
 Hilda M. Veturis, the city's housing coordinator, said the project would cost 
the city $245,000, which include expenses to relocate tenants of the 12-unit 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city's Agency for Community Development has extended a 
$750,000, 30-year deferred loan to Schatzeder and his partner through the 
federal HOME program, Veturis said. The money will be used to pay for developer 
fees, traffic mitigation fees and other charges associated with construction, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Veturis said that the loan will be forgiven if the developer agrees to set 
aside 11 units for single seniors with income not exceeding $20,600 a year and 
the remaining 40 units to seniors with annual incomes of no more than $27,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will generate at least 50 construction jobs and allows the city to 
comply with state requirements to provide affordable housing to seniors, 
Veturis said.BERT ELJERA

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; STUDENTS MAKE HOLIDAY HOUSES OF GINGERBREAD 
</P>

<P>
 Little Ronald Reagan (no relation) of Burbank has a title, too. 
</P>
<P>
 In his art class at Theodore Roosevelt Junior High, Ronald, 12, is known as 
the "candy man."He's in charge of all the chocolate chips, sour punch straws, 
Skittles, Tootsie rolls and other candies to be used for a gingerbread house 
making event. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Red Lion hotel in Glendale, gingerbread houses of all sorts 
-- from traditional renditions a la Hansel and Gretel to a snow-covered 
McDonald's -- were made by students from local junior high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The houses are currently on display at the lobby of the Red Lion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald's classmates constructed their four creations from gingerbread dough, 
which they cut into a variety of shapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald himself was delegated the responsibility of keeping track of the 
goodies and making sure people weren't eating them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I caught 'em and I told the teacher," said Ronald. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy said he enjoyed being involved in the project. "I like art better than 
all the other classes," Ronald said. "It's cool." MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; SANTA KEEPS HIS DATE WITH NEEDY CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa couldn't be late for a very important date. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why St. Nick chose a police escort over his usual reindeer to 
attend the Guadalupe Community Center's annual Christmas party for needy 
children Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 As Santa emerged from the black-and-white, a ripple of excitement surged 
through the crowd of children lined up to meet him. Parents held chunky 
toddlers above their heads so they could see the portly, red-suited visitor. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the eighth annual party sponsored by Catholic Charities, which runs the 
community center, and the Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley Division. 
Invited were children of the families participating in Guadalupe's 
Adopt-a-Family program, which provides poor families with food, clothing and 
gifts during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly 600 children who attended this year were given 700 toys donated by 
local schools, a business, a synagogue and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer George Aguilar, who has coordinated the event for the LAPD for the 
past five years, said the presents donated this year were smaller and fewer 
than have been collected in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's because more groups are doing this, so the resources are getting tapped 
out," Aguilar explained. The flow of toys seemed fast and furious, however, at 
Santa's armchair. 
</P>
<P>
 "How you doing? What's your name?" asked Santa (a.k.a. Officer Henry 
Gutierrez) as the kids shyly sidled up to him and told him which present they 
wanted.  
</P>
<P>
 The party also included lunch: McDonald's hamburgers, potato chips, fruit, 
cookies and orange drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great," said Dalila Cordova, 11. "They're going to give us presents and 
you get to eat McDonald's food." 
</P>
<P>
 Edith Salgado, 8, said she had learned about Santa in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he laughs, he goes, 'Ho Ho Ho,' " she explained, holding her sides. KAY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; LIQUOR STORE GETS PANEL'S OK TO MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission on Wednesday night granted the owner of a Main Street 
liquor store permission to move his business across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 After turning down the same request two weeks ago, commissioners unanimously 
approved the move of the Nip n' Stuff liquor store from 323 Main St. after 
assurances that alcohol will not be sold at the location after the business 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the city's Old Town neighborhood -- where a collection of Main 
Street shops and restaurants lead from Pacific Coast Highway to the beach -- 
are trying to keep a lid on the number of businesses that sell or serve 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 When liquor store owner John Baker sought city approval to move his store 
across the street, planning commissioners worried that the conditional-use 
permit on the original location could be used by another business to sell 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners approved the move of Baker's store after receiving a letter from 
property owner Ron Bennett, promising alcohol will not be served at the 
location after Baker moves. The conditional-use permit will then expire in 
three months due to inactivity, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker is still seeking health and building permits for his new location. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the red tape is still out there," he said. "You have to cut a little 
bit at a time." RUSS LOAR

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; DIESEL POWER STUDIED FOR PLANNED RAIL LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move its directors say could save millions, the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority is studying use of diesel-powered trains instead of 
electrified rail lines for the proposed Burbank-Glendale-Los Angeles line. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of trains powered by diesel fuel is more cost-efficient and would take 
less time to put in place than the current light-rail system now planned for 
the corridor, said Larry Zarian, MTA vice chair. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials predict a light-rail line running from Los Angeles through 
Glendale and to the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport would cost as much as 
$559 million to build. Diesel-powered trains and accompanying track, on the 
other hand, would cost $259 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Light-rail lines, such as the one connecting Los Angeles and Long Beach, are 
powered by tracks that draw electricity from underground power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 If officials choose light rail for the Burbank-Glendale-Los Angeles corridor, 
the agency may not be able to afford to build the system for as long as 20 
years because of the high cost of electricity, Zarian said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a diesel-powered system, construction could begin in three to seven 
years, following an environmental review and purchase of the diesel trains also 
known as railbuses, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The diesel trains, which are not in use in the United States, could also run 
on other proposed corridors throughout the Southland.  
</P>
<P>
 The MTA's Finance, Budget and Efficiency Committee will review the results of 
the MTA staff's study of diesel-powered trains at its Jan. 20 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In other business, the MTA Board of Directors voted this week to provide a 
25-cent "holiday celebration" fare on all MTA bus and train lines on Christmas 
and New Year's. The decreased fares will begin at 9 p.m. Christmas Eve and New 
Year's Eve and end at 5 a.m. the following mornings. JENNIFER OLDHAM

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; COUNCIL SEEKS PLAN TO LIMIT GARAGE SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week moved closer toward restricting garage sales by 
asking for an ordinance that would allow the sales on only three weekends per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Feldhaus, who has complained that the sales are causing 
blight in parts of the city, has brought up the issue for discussion several 
times in the past two months.But it was Councilman Lou Lopez, sworn in earlier 
this month, who proposed the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to do something that is simple to enforce but still gives the right 
for citizens of Anaheim to have a garage sale," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim resident Dan Mehlhorn was critical of the council for considering such 
measures when it is faced with major issues, such as the county bankruptcy and 
filling a vacant council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rummage sales are not a high priority that this city is facing," Mehlhorn 
said. "I think it's rather ludicrous. I really think this council should be 
more concerned with citizens, especially the poorer citizens who are just 
trying to survive and not make any problems and who aren't at the council 
meeting to voice their opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 The sales are already prohibited under Anaheim's zoning code, but the code is 
rarely enforced, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Code enforcement officer John Poole said there are more than 200 of the sales 
on an average weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will discuss the matter again at its next meeting Jan. 10.GREG

<P>
 A Los Angeles police sergeant on her way to the scene of a robbery suffered 
minor injuries Thursday when her police car collided with a truck in Woodland 
Hills, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Corina Gabrielle Smith, of the West Valley Division, was headed west on 
Ventura Boulevard about 11 a.m. when she hit a truck pulling out of a Union 76 
gas station near DeSoto Avenue.Smith stepped out of the police car after the 
crash, then fainted and fell to the ground, said Sgt. Roger Ferguson, of the 
Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who was wearing a seat belt, suffered a sprained left clavicle, 
shoulder and arm in the traffic accident. She was treated and released at 
Northridge Hospital Medical Center, Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the truck, Mikal Copple, 28, of Bakersfield, suffered minor 
injuries but told officers he would get medical attention on his own. Copple 
was also wearing a seat belt, said Victor Martin, a traffic investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said Smith, an six-year LAPD veteran, was driving between 45 and 60 
m.p.h. to get to the intersection of Fallbrook Avenue and Ventura when she 
totaled her black-and-white, Ferguson said. JEANNETTE REGALADO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; POLICE DISTRIBUTE GIFTS IN HIGH-CRIME AREAS

 The youngest of five brothers, 15-year-old Joseph Faaaliga says that his 
contacts with the police have often been unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, Faaaliga was clutching a basketball, a gift from police 
officers who distributed toys to about 300 children in his neighborhood -- the 
rows of apartments on Flower Street, Shelley Drive and Kensington Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is nice," Faaaliga said. "A lot of children here do not have presents 
this Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching out to children before they become police problems was the idea 
behind the gift-giving effort, said Police Capt. Scott Jordan, who helped 
coordinate the gift distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan said that during the Christmas season, more than 2,500 gifts donated by 
people and business owners will be given away in three high-crime areas in the 
city -- Stuart Drive, the Buena-Clinton neighborhood and the 
Flower-Shelley-Kensington neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps the community open up to us," said Officer Tom Gstrein, who 
distributed the gifts Wednesday with his partner, Carlos Bautista, and some 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the city's community policing program, Gstrein and Bautista were 
assigned six months ago to the Flower-Shelley-Kensington neighborhood, where 
they operate a substation in one of the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents welcomed their presence in the neighborhood, where auto thefts, gang 
fights and drug deals used to be common. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have done a great job," said Maria Asa, who has lived in the 
neighborhood for more than two years. "Everybody here appreciates it."BERT

 A 17-year-old Canoga Park youth was arrested and charged with vehicular 
manslaughter after the car he was driving hit a parked truck Wednesday, killing 
his 18-year-old passenger, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was driving south on Fallbrook Avenue when his car hit a parked 
stake-bed truck near Marlin Place at about 1:30 p.m., according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Tara Coplon, 18, of Canoga Park, was pronounced dead at West Hills Medical 
Center shortly after the accident, police said. Witnesses told police the car 
entered the parking lane for no apparent reason, said Los Angeles Police 
Detective Rick Talkington, who said Coplon was identified as the youth's 
longtime girlfriend. GEOFFREY MOHAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; COUNTY CONTRACT FOR ANIMAL CONTROL ENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing possible cutbacks in county animal control services because of the 
county's bankruptcy, the City Council has decided to end its contract for 
animal control services with Orange County and instead use the Mission Viejo 
Animal Shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-1 vote Tuesday drew applause from a small cadre of animal lovers who for 
weeks had urged the city to bring animal control services under local control. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working very hard for our tax dollars, and we're not getting the good 
service" from the county, said Diane Argyle, who led a weeks-long petition 
effort backing a contract with the new Mission Viejo Animal Shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 She and fellow supporters said that the Orange County Animal Shelter cannot 
meet the needs of South County residents because it is too far away. 
</P>
<P>
 They also favor the Mission Viejo shelter's policy of not euthanizing animals 
unless they are extremely sick or dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is where is the county going to go?" said Mayor Mark Goodman, 
voting to link up with neighboring Mission Viejo for animal control services. 
"With the bond crisis, I see the county animal shelter only having two options: 
They're going to have to raise costs or decrease services. We have a window of 
opportunity to go with Mission Viejo." 
</P>
<P>
 Using the Mission Viejo shelter is expected to cost the city $20,000 to 
$30,000 more per year than contracting with the county. The city also will have 
to pay between $75,000 and $100,000 to expand the Mission Viejo shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Thomas W. Wilson was the lone dissenter, saying that he has never 
received complaints from residents about poor service from the county shelter 
and that he was impressed with the county shelter's computerized animal 
database. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many ifs, too many buts and too many financial questions" in 
ending the county contract, Wilson said. LYNN FRANEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; CITIZENS' PANEL SOUGHT ON CITY'S ROLE IN 
FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former councilman Paul Christiansen has asked the council to form an 
independent citizens' committee to analyze the city's investment strategy in 
light of the county bankruptcy. The city has $18 million tied up in the 
county's devalued investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ask that this citizens' panel be appointed to not look at what the county 
has done but look at what has happened on the city level," Christiansen told 
the council Tuesday after terming the crisis an "absolute international 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Christiansen's call for a panel of residents with financial planning 
backgrounds didn't find much favor with the council, however. Only Councilman 
Eddie Rose and Councilwoman Patricia C. Bates expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to look at what involvement the city may have had with the county 
bond debacle," said Rose, the newest council member. "Let the chips fall where 
they may. There may not be any involvement by city officials, but I feel the 
public needs to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bates said a citizens' review panel could help monitor city 
investments, she also said she doubts residents would have been able to find 
the county pool's pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the finest, the brightest, the 'bestest' in the financial world did not 
understand the problems that were about to unfold," she said. "I don't think we 
need to be looking for the rat in the woodpile. We need to make sure the 
woodpile is rebuilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Christiansen's proposal came after City Manager Tim Casey told the council 
that the city will receive new property tax revenue this month in only one lump 
sum, rather than the usual two payments. The one check from the county will 
probably represent about 10% less than what the city usually receives in 
December property taxes, Casey said.LYNN FRANEY

FOLLOW-HOME ROBBERIES PROMPT POLICE WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two more follow-home robberies Wednesday night and early Thursday in the San 
Fernando Valley led Los Angeles police to renew warnings to late-night 
Christmas shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest incident, four members of a Van Nuys family, including a 
78-year-old grandmother, were tied up for two hours while two men who had 
followed the father home ransacked their house. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier incident, a Northridge woman carrying groceries from her car was 
shoved to the ground by an armed pair who robbed her of jewelry and a purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say there have been eight to 10 such incidents in the Valley in the 
past week. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack on the 58-year-old Northridge woman fits the pattern of at least 
eight others that have occurred in the Devonshire Division of the LAPD, said 
Lt. Bob Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 Two assailants knocked the woman to the ground as she carried a bag of 
groceries from her car to her house about 8:45 p.m., Normandy said. They took 
jewelry and money before fleeing, possibly in a light-brown, mid-size station 
wagon. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Van Nuys incident, a pair of assailants kept the terrified family of 
drummer Len Coulter -- including his wife, her 78-year-old mother visiting from 
Texas and a 7-year-old son -- bound with tape in a rear room of their Van Nuys 
home for almost two hours. Amy Coulter, 17, was forced at gunpoint to show one 
of the assailants where the family's valuables were kept. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair accosted Len Coulter as he lugged his drums into his garage after 
returning from work at 1:15 a.m. Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 Police have cautioned holiday shoppers to be more aware of their surroundings, 
to keep lights on around their homes, and to drive to a police station if they 
think they are being followed.

BODIES FOUND IN LOCKER 4 MONTHS AGO IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than four months after their decaying corpses were discovered in a 
Northridge storage locker, two men and a woman were identified Thursday by Los 
Angeles police, who said all of the victims had been beaten and one had also 
been shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Police issued an arrest warrant for 30-year-old Harnoko Dewantono of 
Indonesia, who is suspected of committing the murders. The victims were 
identified as Eri Tri Harto Darmawan, 26, Gina Sultan Aswar, 30, and Surish 
Michandani, who police said was about 45. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Dewantono -- whose nickname is "Oki" -- has been in the 
United States on and off for several years on a student visa, although it is 
unclear if he was ever enrolled at a college or university, Detective Ted Ball 
told a Downtown news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We linked him to the crime through physical evidence found in the storage 
locker," Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police declined to describe the evidence and refused to speculate on a motive 
for the killings. Investigators did say that Dewantono knew the victims either 
socially or through business dealings, but they are unsure whether the victims 
knew each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the suspect had sold Michandani a now-defunct Woodland Hills 
dry-cleaning business. Dewantono knew the others socially, police said, and may 
have been Aswar's roommate before she disappeared in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of gaps in what we know, but we hope some member of the 
public who knew the victims or knows the suspect will come forward and help us 
out," said Lt. Al Moen, head of the LAPD's major crimes investigation section. 
</P>
<P>
 The identification process took about a month and relied heavily on modern 
forensics. After an anthropologist determined the sex, height, race and other 
physical characteristics of the victims, medical examiners identified Darmawan 
by rehydrating his fingers to get fingerprints. Dental records were used to 
identify Aswar, coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 All three had been badly beaten on their heads, and Michandani had also been 
shot, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michandani has not been identified officially by coroner's investigators, but 
police say they are certain he is the third victim. All three victims lived in 
Los Angeles, and all were reported missing in 1991 or 1992, police said. An 
Indonesian Consulate official said Darmawan and Aswar were Indonesians 
traveling on student visas. Police said Michandani was from India, but had 
lived mostly in Kuwait.

GANG MEMBER SENTENCED TO LIFE IN SLAYING OF MURDER WITNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old Pomona gang member was sentenced Wednesday to 20 years to life 
in state prison for killing a 14-year-old boy two years ago to keep the 
youngster from testifying in a gang-related murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ignacio Contreras, who pleaded guilty June 27 to second-degree murder 
in the death of Eduardo Samaniego, will be eligible for parole in 15 years, 
defense attorney Steve Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras was 17 at the time of the killing but faced court proceedings as an 
adult. The sentencing hearing Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court was "a 
very quiet ending to a tumultuous case," Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Samaniego's death Aug. 17, 1992, resulted in extensive negative publicity for 
the Pomona Police Department and the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of both departments reportedly had assured Samaniego, one of 
four witnesses to a November, 1991, gang murder, that he would not be in danger 
if he testified. But a gunman came to the home of the church-going Little 
League baseball player, took him to a nearby alley and shot him a week before 
the trial was to start. 
</P>
<P>
 The three other young witnesses summoned the courage to testify and helped 
convict Arthur Melendrez, 22, of Chino in March, 1993. Witnesses and informants 
later provided evidence linking Contreras to Samaniego's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Samaniego family members, who moved away from Pomona in fear, are 
awaiting a trial date in a $15-million lawsuit they filed against Los Angeles 
County and the city of Pomona, said their attorney, Tim Hanigan.

TEAMSTERS OFFICIAL CONVICTED, ANOTHER CLEARED IN FBI MOVIE STING; CORRUPTION: 
FORMER TRANSPORTATION CHIEF IS FOUND GUILTY OF CONSPIRACY IN ELABORATE 
UNDERCOVER OPERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The former transportation captain of New England's largest Teamsters local was 
convicted Thursday on federal conspiracy charges, but a former union vice 
president was acquitted in the trial that culminated the FBI's Dramex sting, 
which had an agent pose as a film producer to smoke out organized crime 
influence over labor unions in the movie industry. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-month trial in Boston, a federal jury found William Winn, 63, 
guilty on three counts, while exonerating James Moar, 63, the former vice 
president of 7,000-member Local 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Three New England mob figures were also indicted after the sting conducted by 
the Los Angeles office of the FBI, which came within days of actually filming a 
movie. One pleaded guilty before the trial in return for an 18-month prison 
term, another was accepted in the witness protection program and the third 
became gravely ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the elaborate undercover operation drew some criticism for its 
limited results, Assistant U.S. Atty. Fred M. Wyshak Jr. praised it Thursday as 
"a very successful investigation (that) identified some corruption in the 
Teamsters . . . resulted in a conviction of some members of the Patriarca 
(Mafia) family . . . and produced a very important witness." 
</P>
<P>
 That was a reference to New England mob insider Thomas Hillary, who was caught 
in the sting and then turned into a government witness. Federal prosecutors are 
expected to use Hillary to make further cases against the leadership of the 
Patriarca clan -- perhaps including its reputed boss, "Cadillac Frank" Salemme, 
whose son was supposed to be a defendant in the just-completed trial, but whose 
case was dropped because of an undisclosed illness. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dramex sting -- for "Drama Expose" -- was based on the undercover work of 
Los Angeles Agent Garland Schweickhardt, who studied film production at UCLA, 
was tutored by industry insiders and set up phony David Rudder Productions 
offices in Santa Monica, with a Rolls-Royce at the ready to make him look 
authentic. 
</P>
<P>
 Posing as David Rudder -- a fledgling producer looking to make low-budget 
films -- he traveled across the country armed with scripts that demanded 
"location" shooting in target cities such as New Orleans and Las Vegas. At each 
stop, he waved envelopes of cash before reputed mob figures and union leaders, 
bribes designed to buy "sweetheart" labor agreements allowing him to film with 
cheaper non-union workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Schweickhardt's New England excursions generated criminal charges after he 
paid $65,000 to the three reputed mobsters from 1989 to 1990 to win their help 
getting concessions from the Teamsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Schweickhardt testified that he set up a production office in Providence, 
R.I., and came within a hair of filming a romantic comedy there. 
</P>
<P>
 "To give us credibility, we had several scripts," he said. "We had all the 
hopes and intentions to do a movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities have not said why they ended the sting without going that 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the two Teamsters argued that their clients thought Rudder was a 
real producer and only agreed to allow use of non-union drivers on his sets 
because his films had small budgets -- and they hoped that he would return with 
larger projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Jim Moar ever did is try to do the job he was elected to do, negotiate on 
behalf of his union," said Miriam Conrad, who represented the now-retired 
Teamster vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The Teamsters did not testify, but defense attorneys produced evidence that 
other productions -- including one for HBO -- similarly had been allowed to 
film with non-union crews because they had low budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert C. Bielitz Jr., who represented Winn, said the FBI was misled by the 
boasts of their mob targets -- often in taped conversations -- that they had 
influence over unions around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could write a book about it -- 'How the Mafia scammed the government,' " 
Bielitz said. But his client, Winn, was damaged by his own statements on the 
FBI tapes, and by evidence that he accompanied the reputed mobsters on trips to 
Nevada and New York on behalf of the phony producer.  
</P>
<P>
 The case against Moar was more circumstantial. He was caught on only one tape 
-- and then insisting in 1988 that Rudder hire Teamsters. Defense attorney 
Conrad said the union vice president changed his position the next year only 
because the film's budget dropped from $5 million to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if the FBI got so invested in this that they lost sight of the 
bottom line . . . that my client was innocent," Conrad said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Robert Keeton set Winn's sentencing for April 5. Although 
each count carries a potential five-year prison term, sentencing guidelines 
call for him to receive no more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyshak said the conviction should have a deterrent effect on other union 
officials thinking "whether to take a bribe or ask for a bribe." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to have the impact of making (them) land on the honest side," he 
said.

JUDGE VISITS JAIL HOUSING SIMPSON FOR 2ND TIME 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The judge in the O.J. Simpson case Thursday paid a visit to the jail housing 
the accused double-murderer, the judge's second tour since a deputy allegedly 
overheard an outburst by Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Larry Lincoln, a sheriff's spokesman, said Superior Court Judge Lance A. 
Ito arrived at the Men's Central Jail with a bailiff about 2 p.m. to "inspect 
changes to the visiting area."He left about 45 minutes later, Lincoln said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 29, the judge joined defense attorneys and a prosecutor in a tour of 
the visiting area used by Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito refused to let prosecutors know the nature of remarks Simpson was said to 
have blurted out last month in the visiting area. 
</P>
<P>
 A deputy testified he overheard the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The visiting area was set up under Ito's guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's trial is recessed for the holidays. Ito and the attorneys in the 
case are to return Jan. 4 for an all-day in-chambers session.

 The items Ruth Oldham of Studio City has on display for Christmas this year 
are small, and that's the way she likes it. 
</P>
<P>
 Oldham is a collector of Christmas miniatures, but she does not think small. 
On display are the more than 1,000 pieces she has collected over 30 years. They 
fill shelves that take up an entire wall in her apartment, depicting Santa's 
workshop, Santa's living room, Mrs. Claus' kitchen, a sleigh room and a candy 
factory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the miniature sewing room, for example, elves use minuscule scissors, 
spools of thread and a tape measure to knit a scarf, cap and mittens. Neatly 
stowed in a tiny dressmaker's cabinet are tufts of orange, green and blue yarn 
and stamp-sized dress patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 In the shipping room, an elf clerk keeps track of the piles of colorfully 
wrapped packages. Another elf works at a desk complete with a shiny red phone 
and an account book. A few steps away is a dainty pencil sharpener decorated 
with a sprig of holly. 
</P>
<P>
 Oldham, 55, keeps her Venetian blinds open in the evenings so that her 
neighbors can view her creation from a courtyard that her living room window 
faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "People walking by go, 'Oh my God!' " said Anne Stromberg, one of Oldham's 
neighbors. "They press their noses against the glass." 
</P>
<P>
 Oldham, a bookkeeper, said one of her friends, after seeing her collection, 
told her, "I've been grumbling about Christmas and I was getting out of the 
spirit, but now I'm back in the spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 A Santa, an elf and a glass reindeer made up the first Christmas scene that 
Oldham arranged on an end table in 1964. Four years later, the figures -- many 
of which are Christmas tree ornaments -- filled an entire shelf, and then in 
1971, two shelves. The collection continued to expand, more or less reaching 
its present size by 1987, Oldham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire display, which spills over into two additional bookshelves, 
includes five levels and 20 scenes, including one devoted to Disney characters 
and another containing characters from movies, nursery rhymes and cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 When her now grown-up sons, Rory and Ron, were 9 and 10, they built tables for 
Mrs. Claus' kitchen, which Oldham says she thinks of as her own mother's 
kitchen. The sewing room was created to remind her of herself and her sisters, 
who all loved working with fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, when she buys something for her collection, she gets two of each 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought that someday, Ron and Rory would each take half," Oldham 
said. KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SEARCH CONTINUES FOR HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Five-year-old Tamara Nelson has trouble comprehending the events of that day 
last May, when she watched as a hit-and-run driver struck and killed her 
brother, then laughed and sped away. 
</P>
<P>
 According to her grandmother, Lenzetta Lison, Tamara sometimes seems to blame 
herself for the death of Skyy Nelson, 7, who was struck as he and his sister 
ran across Tobias Street to an ice cream vendor. 
</P>
<P>
 "She shows me letters she writes to him," Lison said. "She says: 'I love you, 
I miss you, I wish you were here, so we could fight again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Police are still searching for the driver, described as a male Latino, with 
shoulder- or collar-length hair and a mustache. He was driving a 1981 black 
Volkswagen Rabbit, possibly with a lowered body and small wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Los Angeles police announced the extension of a $10,000 reward 
being offered by the city for the arrest and conviction of the driver. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred at 10:40 a.m. on May 22 in the 9000 block of Tobias in 
Panorama City. Since that day, Lison has visited the LAPD's Van Nuys station 
regularly, hoping the driver has been caught.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't hate him," Lison said. "I just feel like he's somebody that just 
doesn't care." 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing media coverage produced leads, but none panned out, said Officer 
Rick Talkington, of the LAPD's Traffic Division. Anyone with information is 
asked to call him or Officer John Miller at (818) 756-8391. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the driver may have been in the area to buy drugs. "There was a 
passenger with him, and we're hoping that $10,000 might be a good incentive for 
(the passenger) to snitch him out," Talkington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lison, who was at the station Thursday, was surprised when police presented 
Tamara, who turned 5 Wednesday, with two wrapped birthday presents -- a doll 
and a stuffed animal. 
</P>
<P>
 The family, police said, has fallen on hard financial times, and Tamara -- who 
has won the hearts of officers at the Van Nuys station -- had mentioned to them 
that she had not received a birthday present. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you do these kinds of things, everybody wants to get involved," said 
City Councilman Richard Alarcon, who had heard of the family's plight and also 
brought gifts donated for the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just shows you that people care and love," Lison said. "It gives you a 
lift and helps you to keep on." FRANK MANNING

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; COUNCIL TO TELL CALTRANS IT OPPOSES FUNDING 
FOR FREEWAY ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has decided to write a letter to California Department of 
Transportation officials, telling them that it believes the money Caltrans is 
setting aside for freeway art should be used for something else. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is planning to erect fiberglass murals on the walls of a few freeways 
in Costa Mesa and other surrounding cities in Orange County next year. But 
council members, while they welcomed the idea of the art, thought the money 
should be spent on more essential services. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Tony Petros told the council that he thought the art, which would go 
up on the Costa Mesa and Corona Del Mar freeways in the city, was a waste of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's just work on getting from point A to point B," Petros told the council. 
"It's just like the wisdom of our state to put this as a priority. The money 
could be better spent." 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of federal money that Caltrans plans to spend is not yet known 
because the project is in its beginning stages. The unanimous vote to reject 
Caltrans' idea of erecting art, even though the city has no control over the 
project, came after Diane Theran Blaisure, the chairwoman of a city-appointed 
ad hoc committee, submitted art suggestions to the council for its approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans had asked the city to come up with ideas for the art project, which 
would extend along the Corona del Mar Freeway from Bear Street to the San Diego 
Freeway and from Fairview Road to 19th Street along the Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the art would be mounted on three-foot-square panels, included a great 
blue heron, an oak tree, a prickly pear cactus, an ocean wave and a gray whale 
-- symbols of Costa Mesa and the outlying region. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle suggested that the council send the ideas to the 
Orange County Transportation Authority anyway -- just in case the art project 
goes through. That way, she said, Costa Mesa will have some sort of input. TOM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; GANG SUSPECT HELD IN YOUTH'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Gunshots in a Van Nuys neighborhood early Thursday morning led detectives to a 
suspect in last week's shooting death of a 16-year-old North Hollywood youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers were staking out several locations near Fulton Avenue and Sherman 
Way, looking for Ray Martinez, 20, when gunfire erupted nearby, said Los 
Angeles Police Detective Charles Uribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers saw two men run into an apartment on the 6900 block of Fulton Street, 
Uribe said. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers asked occupants to step outside, they found Martinez among them, 
Uribe said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no arrests related to the report of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was taken into custody at about 1:30 a.m. and charged with murder and 
robbery in the shooting death of Marlon Gutierrez of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez and a friend had been walking on the 12500 block of Vanowen Street 
at about 11 p.m. last Friday when a group of men robbed them at gunpoint. 
Gutierrez was shot when he tried to walk away, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives believe Martinez is a member of a branch of the Mara Salvatrucha 
gang, Uribe said. They believe the gunfire that led officers to Martinez may 
have come from a rival gang. GEOFFREY MOHAN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SIMI MAN FACES MOLESTATION HEARING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley man suspected of molesting three children in fast-food 
restaurants, including two in the San Fernando Valley, is scheduled to appear 
for a preliminary hearing today in Van Nuys, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael John Fellows, 46, was arrested in Los Angeles Dec. 12 following a 
two-month investigation of incidents at a McDonald's and Carl's Jr. in the San 
Fernando Valley and another at a McDonald's in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellows is being held in Los Angeles County Jail in lieu of $300,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Fellows is accused of molesting a 9-year-old girl in the 
women's restroom of the Carl's Jr. restaurant. The incident at a McDonald's in 
Northridge involved a 4-year-old girl, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident in Simi Valley, which led to the arrest of Fellows, was reported 
Oct. 18. An 8-year-old girl was standing at the sink in the women's restroom 
when a man came in, knelt by her and licked her leg, authorities said. The man 
then asked the girl for a kiss, but she refused and left, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellows was later identified as a suspect in that incident, police said. Simi 
police shared information they obtained in the case with the Los Angeles Police 
Department, which made the arrest. TRACY WILSON

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: $325,000 DONATED TO REPAIR CHURCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Checks totaling more than $325,000 for repairing earthquake-damaged church 
buildings were mailed recently to 20 San Fernando Valley-area congregations of 
the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). 
</P>
<P>
 "The pastors of the churches are calling us and saying the checks were a real 
shot in the arm," said the Rev. Robert Fernandez, a church administrator based 
in Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
 Denominational officials in Louisville, Ky., had set up two disaster relief 
funds after the Northridge temblor and distributed the money in recent weeks to 
Southern California presbyteries, or regional units. 
</P>
<P>
 The pre-Christmas mailing of $327,574 was preceded a couple weeks ago by 
$49,000 sent by donors who designated particular churches, Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest check in the recent mailing, $105,074, went to North Hollywood 
First Presbyterian Church, whose sanctuary had to be demolished in the fall. 
The congregation continues to hold services in other buildings on its property. 
</P>
<P>
 "North Hollywood Presbyterian still needs to remodel or repair their remaining 
buildings," Fernandez said. "It's going to take a lot of money for them to get 
back on their feet." 
</P>
<P>
 The second-largest amount, more than $80,000, went to St. James Presbyterian 
Church in Tarzana. That congregation recently voted overwhelmingly to continue 
toward a fund-raising goal of between $600,000 and $700,000 to repair the 
sanctuary building that is now structurally unsafe to enter, said the Rev. Ken 
Baker, senior pastor.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was a very encouraging Christmas present for us," Baker said. "We are 
still going to have to launch a capital fund-raising campaign."  
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando First Presbyterian Church received $15,000 in addition to $20,000 
that was sent earlier from the national collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The San Fernando church worships in its basement fellowship hall, but the 
congregation hopes to be back in the sanctuary on Jan. 22, depending on the 
completion of repairs," Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recipients included Presbyterian churches in Canoga Park ($25,000), 
Woodland Hills ($14,000) and Encino, Reseda and Sherman Oaks ($10,000 each).

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; DROP IN DUI ARRESTS LINKED TO CHECKPOINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol are down in the city 
compared with this time last year, and police believe it is due to the six 
sobriety checkpoints that were conducted this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get 3,000 to 5,000 cars driving through a checkpoint, it focuses 
attention on drinking and driving," Costa Mesa Police Lt. Jim Watson said."When 
that many people have to go through a checkpoint and be scrutinized, it peaks 
their awareness." 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent checkpoint, on Newport Avenue in front of Triangle Square on 
Dec. 10, netted eight DUI arrests, compared with 18 arrests last year, Watson 
said. Thirty-nine drivers have been arrested in the city since Dec. 1, compared 
with 44 last year. In the month of November, 78 people were arrested last year 
on DUI charges compared to 55 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa police have applied for a grant through the California State Office 
of Traffic Safety, and the prospects of holding their own checkpoint look good 
for next year, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, a full-time DUI team, consisting of two officers, has worked 
year-round for several years, four days a week, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just patrol the streets looking for DUIs," said Watson. "Usually, 
they're out Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the team accounts for 40 to 60 DUIs arrests a month. TOM RAGAN

UCI TO OFFER ANONYMOUS HIV TESTING; HEALTH: STUDENTS AND OTHERS CAN MAKE AN 
APPOINTMENT FOR THE SERVICE, WHICH INCLUDES A COUNSELING SESSION, BEGINNING IN 
JANUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Beginning next month, UC Irvine will offer anonymous HIV testing to students 
and other members of the campus as part of stepped-up efforts to promote sexual 
health, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The service, which will be available weekly on Tuesday afternoons, will be 
funded by the Laguna Beach Community Clinic, said Christine Leon, who 
coordinates sexual health promotion at the UCI Health Education Office. The 
clinic has been providing anonymous HIV testing in South County since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and others can make an appointment for the service, which includes a 
counseling session before blood is drawn. That takes about 25 minutes. Another 
counseling session, which lasts about 20 minutes and includes test results and 
health promotion tips, will be scheduled the week following the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will be able to call and use a real or assumed first name," Leon said. 
Phone numbers will not be recorded or requested so that clients can feel 
comfortable about the service, and all of the testing will be done by people 
who are not affiliated with UCI, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach Community Clinic and the Orange County Health Care Agency in 
Santa Ana are among other off-campus sites in the county that offer anonymous 
testing, Leon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials at UCI are initiating the testing service at the same time 
they are renewing efforts to reach out to Asian Americans, Latinos, gays and 
lesbians as well as other students. Health workers are trying to recruit 
students with different backgrounds to promote safer sexual health practices on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Of about 3,400 entering students at UCI this year, 40% reported that English 
is rarely or never spoken in their homes, Leon said.  
</P>
<P>
 "These students and their families or peers may not have easy access to health 
promotion programs or literature that are culturally relevant," Leon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members are reaching out to such students to recruit peer educators. 
Students will learn ways to resist sexual assault and to set boundaries for 
intimate relationships. They will also receive information about contraception 
and other sexual health subjects -- and then learn ways to advise friends, 
families and classmates about such subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 A UC San Francisco study released in October indicated that HIV prevention 
efforts work best for teen-agers who have not become sexually active yet. But 
UCI health promoters hope their educational programs can change students' 
practices before they contract sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon said a 1993 study shows that a significant number of students at UCI and 
other universities have habits that increase their chances for becoming 
infected with AIDS or HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide study of nearly 4,000 students on 29 campuses, which included 
UCI, showed that three out of four students reported that they had sexual 
intercourse at least once, and half had more than three partners of the 
opposite sex in their lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45% of sexually active, unmarried students reported that they used 
condoms -- and those with high numbers of lifetime sexual partners were least 
likely to say they used condoms. About 12% of the students said they had been 
diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease.

NASA FINDS CAUSE OF CRAFT'S WRECK; AVIATION: FAULTY GYROSCOPE IS BLAMED FOR 
NOV. 22 BREAKUP OF UNPILOTED RESEARCH PLANE HIGH ABOVE THE DESERT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A faulty gyroscope sent an unpiloted NASA research airplane into a steep dive 
last month that caused the $1.5-million craft to break up high above this 
desert base, the space agency said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The aircraft, dubbed Perseus, is designed to carry instruments into the 
stratosphere to measure erosion of Earth's vital ozone layer. Perseus is 
expected to fly thousands of feet higher than piloted aircraft, such as 
converted U-2 spy planes, that now are the workhorses of stratospheric 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA said the Nov. 22 breakup of one of two Perseus A aircraft it is testing 
will not cause cancellation of the high-altitude drone program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a setback but it's not a showstopper," said Don Haley, a spokesman 
for NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards. "It's the type of program 
where you can expect incidents like this to happen with much greater frequency 
than with traditional aircraft, because of the tender nature of these 
machines." 
</P>
<P>
 The aircraft that broke up was struggling in hurricane-force winds nearly 
seven miles above Edwards when controllers on the ground decided to bring it 
home. As the craft descended, it began pitching and rolling uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>
 A NASA investigation team headed by former astronaut Vance Brand determined 
that the failed gyro plunged Perseus into a dive during which its 59-foot wing 
snapped off its fuselage. Although Perseus is designed to maneuver at speeds 
not exceeding 70 m.p.h., it was diving at 92 m.p.h. when its wing separated. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground handlers then deployed a parachute on the craft, bringing its pieces 
back to Earth safely. NASA officials said the badly damaged plane will not be 
rebuilt but can be used for spare parts for the second Perseus vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Perseus program has been plagued by mechanical and weather difficulties 
since NASA began test flights a year ago at Edwards. The plane is intended to 
soar to 82,000 feet but so far has not exceeded 50,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 While some atmospheric scientists support Perseus as a low-cost, low-risk way 
to push higher into the stratosphere, others say NASA should build bigger 
aircraft that can loft larger packages of scientific instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Haley said Brand's team pinpointed the gyroscope as the cause of Perseus' 
breakup after studying recorded flight data. The team later confirmed its 
finding by re-creating the Nov. 22 flight in an electronic flight simulator. 
</P>
<P>
 The wrecked craft was on its 16th test flight. The second Perseus craft has 
flown only five times.

TUSTIN PULLED BACK FUNDS IN TIME, BUT CAN STILL LOSE; CRISIS: CITY MANAGER 
REPORTS THAT A COMMUTER RAIL STATION'S FUNDS AND PROPERTY TAX REVENUE MAY GET 
CAUGHT IN COUNTY SQUEEZE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has outlined possible impacts from the county's bankruptcy on 
city projects, including a planned commuter rail station. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin, which pulled its $4 million in principal out of the county-run 
investment pool in April, is in better financial shape than many Orange County 
cities. But officials have cause for concern because the fate of some major 
city projects remains unclear in the turmoil of bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority, for instance, appears to have $1.9 
million in the investment pool that is earmarked for construction of a commuter 
rail station in Tustin, City Manager William A. Huston told the council on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Because these funds are state bond proceeds and were not intended as 
investments, Tustin should assume an aggressive stance and demand that the city 
receive the entire $1.9 million, Huston said. But there are no clear answers at 
this point, he cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Huston also is concerned that the county might attempt to give Tustin less 
than its full share of property tax that was collected before the county 
declared bankruptcy. The city manager estimates that between $200,000 and 
$300,000 owed to Tustin is now tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Any loss of property tax funds would be unacceptable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be just outrageous," he said. "That is not the county's money to 
play with." 
</P>
<P>
 If property tax allocations are cut back or delayed, Huston said, it may be 
more difficult and costly for Tustin to finance its $6 million share for the 
Edinger Avenue/Jamboree Road overpass project. 
</P>
<P>
 Huston also recommended an aggressive approach regarding Tustin's $700,000 
deposit for its share of an $82-million emergency police communications system 
the county planned to purchase. County supervisors recently delayed the project 
for 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin's deposit was being held in trust by the county, Huston said, and was 
clearly not intended for the investment pool. The city should receive full 
credit for the $700,000, Huston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other city worries in connection with the bankruptcy include a possible loss 
of interest income and higher water rates. In addition, there is uncertainty 
surrounding joint projects with the Orange County Water District, the 
Transportation Corridor Agency, the cities of Irvine and Santa Ana, and other 
governmental entities.

1 MOTORIST KILLED, 2 OTHERS HURT IN 3-CAR COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 38-year-old man died Wednesday after the driver of a pickup broadsided his 
vintage sports car, causing a three-vehicle collision that also left the 
truck's driver and another motorist injured, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, John Stanley Magera of Santa Ana, was turning left onto Warner 
Avenue from Wintersburg Avenue when a pickup heading west on Warner Avenue 
struck the driver's side of his car, said Fountain Valley police Sgt. Kevin 
McKeown.A third car heading west on Warner rear-ended the pickup, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Magera was unconscious and trapped in the car when paramedics arrived, said 
Fire Department Battalion Chief Bob McVey. It took firefighters 20 minutes to 
extract him, McVey said. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeown said Magera was airlifted to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he 
died 3 1/2 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other drivers involved in the collision were treated for minor 
injuries at different area hospitals and released, McKeown said. None of the 
drivers were cited. Police are investigating the accident.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PALMDALE'S ONLY HOSPITAL TO SHUT BIRTHING 
WARD; HEALTH CARE: DESERT PALMS ADMINISTRATORS CITE LOW DEMAND, LACK OF 
PROFITABILITY AS REASONS TO CLOSE MATERNITY FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Palmdale's only hospital, Desert Palms Community, will close its maternity 
ward in February, leaving just one hospital in the Antelope Valley where women 
can give birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators of Desert Palms said this week that obstetric care is not 
profitable because the 97-bed hospital facility averages only 15 deliveries a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital, formerly known as Palmdale Hospital Medical Center, will suspend 
the use of its 10 obstetric beds on Feb. 1 for one year, then decide whether to 
reopen the maternity unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to the low volume of deliveries and the poor financial performance of 
this service, we feel we have no choice but to terminate this service at this 
time," Steve Schmidt, the hospital's chief executive officer, said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the hospital needs 60 to 70 deliveries a month to break even on the 
obstetric services. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 employees, primarily registered nurses, will be laid off when the 
maternity ward is shut down, hospital officials said. Schmidt said other 
hospital services, including its basic emergency room and its behavioral mental 
health unit, will not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale Mayor Jim Ledford said Thursday that Desert Palms' decision was a 
setback for the city. "I look at a population of over 100,000, and in my mind 
that warrants a full-service hospital," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ledford said Palmdale officials have tried to persuade the owners of Desert 
Palms to relocate and expand the hospital in the city's old downtown area, 
which is the focus of an urban renewal program. But Ledford said Desert Palms, 
which is owned by Paracelsus Healthcare Corp., rejected that idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said the city's Downtown Revitalization Committee is preparing to 
encourage other health care providers to open a new full-service hospital in 
the old business district. 
</P>
<P>
 Desert Palms spokeswoman Carol Fryer said she could not comment on the failed 
relocation and expansion talks mentioned by Ledford. But she questioned whether 
the area could support another full-service hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (hospital) beds that are available now are more than adequate to serve 
the community," Fryer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Desert Palms administrators said few babies are being born at their hospital, 
partly because most local obstetricians prefer Lancaster's Antelope Valley 
Hospital, where nearly 5,000 children were born last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fryer said most obstetricians have offices in Lancaster and do not want to 
spend the extra time driving to and from a hospital in Palmdale. Many of Desert 
Palms' maternity patients have been women who received no prenatal care but 
merely showed up at the hospital when they were ready to give birth, Fryer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that Desert Palms is set up to handle only only low-risk births. 
High-risk births are generally done at the 341-bed Antelope Valley Hospital, 
which has a neonatal intensive care unit to treat newborns with serious medical 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster has two other hospitals, Lancaster Community, which has the same 
corporate owner as Desert Palms, and High Desert, which is run by the county. 
Neither has an obstetrics unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Cothran, a spokesman for Antelope Valley Hospital, said his facility will 
have no trouble handling another 10 to 15 births per month after the Desert 
Palms unit closes. The Lancaster hospital set an in-house record in October, 
when doctors there delivered 493 babies. 
</P>
<P>
 Cothran said his hospital tallied 4,880 deliveries in 1993 and could be 
staffed to handle as many as 6,500. He pointed out that county officials 
recently dropped plans for an obstetrics unit in the new hospital they plan to 
build in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "They felt that Antelope Valley Hospital could handle the present need and the 
growth in that area," Cothran said.

INGLEWOOD SERGEANT ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Inglewood police sergeant faces possible criminal charges for allegedly 
shoplifting about $100 worth of computer equipment from a Manhattan Beach 
electronics store, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hoffman, head of the Inglewood department's forensics division, was 
arrested Saturday when a security officer at Fry's Electronics spotted Hoffman 
putting $16 worth of printer labels in his coat pocket and adjusting "something 
under his coat, near the small of his back," according to a Manhattan Beach 
police report.The object was a $90 computer part, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hoffman left the store without paying for the items, the store security 
officer placed him under arrest, according to the report. Because the crime is 
a petty theft, Hoffman was booked and released, said Manhattan Beach Police 
Sgt. Randy Leaf. 
</P>
<P>
 The case will be sent to the district attorney's office, Leaf said. Initially, 
Hoffman gave a fake name to store security officers and Manhattan Beach police 
officials, but Inglewood Police Chief Oliver M. Thompson said a former 
Inglewood officer now in Manhattan Beach identified Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman, a 16-year veteran of the Inglewood department, has been placed on 
administrative leave while an internal investigation is conducted, Thompson 
said. Hoffman could not be reached for comment.

CONSUMER BRIEFS: TIPS FOR SPOTTING SUSPICIOUS PARCELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of a mail bombing that killed an advertising executive in New 
Jersey earlier this month, the security firm Kroll Associates has released tips 
on spotting suspicious packages. The indications of a mail bomb fall into five 
categories: 
</P>
<P>
 * Weight and appearance. Excessive weight for size; uneven or lopsided shape; 
bulkier than normal; soft spots or bulges; oil stains or greasy marks on the 
wrapper; small hole in the wrapper; protruding wires, metal or string. Size may 
vary widely, from cigarette-carton dimensions on up. 
</P>
<P>
 * Packaging. Wrapper suggests previous use, such as traces of glue or old 
mailing labels; unprofessional wrapping, use of excessive or several 
combinations of tape; endorsements such as "Fragile -- Handle With Care," 
"Personal and Confidential" or "Rush -- Do Not Delay." 
</P>
<P>
 * Postage-Addressing. Excessive or inadequate postage; origin and sender 
unfamiliar to recipient; no return address; postmark is different city than 
return address; unusual return address format, such as homemade label, 
cut-and-paste lettering, rub-on block lettering; name and title of addressee 
inaccurate; distorted handwriting; misspelling of common words. May be sent by 
U.S. Postal Service, express delivery services, messenger or may be placed 
physically at the delivery site. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unusual characteristics. Package makes buzzing, ticking, rattling or 
sloshing sound; emits peculiar odor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Contents. Pressure or resistance in removing the contents; visual 
distractions inside, such as currency or pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 "If through these or other clues you suspect a letter or package may be 
harmful, do not open the item, but isolate it, secure the immediate area and 
immediately notify your company's security director and-or local law 
enforcement authorities," said John T. Horn, director of Kroll's corporate 
security department.  
</P>
<P>
 The package should not be immersed in water, he said, but rather placed where 
it is easily accessible to bomb squad personnel. Windows should be opened in 
the immediate area to help vent fumes from an explosion or the emission of a 
harmful gas.

 Espresso Machine Maker Responds to Injuries: A leading espresso machine maker 
will offer corrected operating instructions after reports of injuries caused by 
shattered carafes, the Consumer Product Safety Commission announced this week. 
The agency said Krups North America will voluntarily offer stickers and 
corrected operating instructions for its 1.47 million espresso-cappuccino 
machines, model No. 963, after receiving 57 reports of shatterings, including 
15 injuries.The problem is linked to the position of the filter holder for the 
machine. If it is set in the wrong position, steam pressure may build up with 
enough force to cause the holder to fly out of the machine, possibly shattering 
the glass carafe. Consumers should rotate the filter holder to the "max" 
position. Call (800) 526-5377 to receive revised operating instructions and a 
sticker to put over the "min-max" position.

 Hearing Aid Maker Settles FTC Complaint: The Federal Trade Commission said 
Beltone Electronics Corp., one of the nation's largest makers of hearing aids, 
has agreed to pay $825,000 in penalties to settle charges of false-advertising 
claims.The agency said the case involved Chicago-based Beltone's marketing of 
its ClearVoice and Voice Enhancer hearing aids. The settlement includes 
provisions to prohibit Beltone from misrepresenting the ability of its hearing 
aids to focus on speech in noise situations, the FTC said. It said the 
settlement also requires Beltone to give refunds to dealers whose customers 
have returned their aids after a trial period and to make certain advertising 
disclosures to help customers understand the limits of the hearing aids.

 Toys Recalled: Kidpower Inc. has recalled a racetrack car set because of a 
manufacturing defect that could pose a choking hazard to children. The company

potential choking hazard to young children, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
Commission said this week. The commission said it knows of no injuries 
involving the toys, which were sold nationwide this year through Fingerhut 
catalogue sales, Toys R Us stores and other retailers. The commission said the 
toys should be taken away from children immediately and consumers could contact 
Kidpower at (800) 545-7529 for replacement instructions.

BRIEFCASE: WORKPLACE; HUGHES AGREES TO PAY FOR HOLIDAY SHUTDOWN OF ITS 
FULLERTON PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Don Lee, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After screaming "Scrooge" last week, union workers at Hughes Aircraft in 
Fullerton this week got what they wanted for Christmas--at least from the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Hughes isn't going to change its mind about the plant's fate.As previously 
announced, it will close by the end of next year, resulting in the loss of 
6,000 jobs. But the good news for the 1,000 or so union workers at the plant is 
that they will get paid during the companywide holiday shutdown next week. 
</P>
<P>
 According to workers, Hughes management had initially told the Carpenters 
Union that its members wouldn't get paid because they recently voted down a 
contract proposal. But labor and management came to an agreement, enabling 
union workers to get the same holiday pay benefit that they and other salaried 
employees have long enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most likely, this will be the last Christmas at Hughes in Fullerton. "People 
are trying to get into the holiday spirit," said Scott Sechman, a technician. 
</P>
<P>
 Sechman, 40, is one of dozens of people who recently received layoff notices. 
His last day is scheduled to be Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably going to be the last good one," Sechman said of Christmas. 
"We're going to go all out this year for the kids."

NEC'S ATTEMPT TO SELL ITS 29 TRAINING CENTERS FAILS; EDUCATION: THE 
IRVINE-BASED FIRM SAYS THE DEAL FELL THROUGH BECAUSE RULES WOULD HAVE MADE SALE 
OF THE SCHOOLS AS A UNIT DIFFICULT. 
</P>

<P>
 National Education Corp. said Thursday it has ended negotiations to sell its 
29 training centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks broke down between the Irvine-based company and the prospective buyer, 
said Jerome W. Cwiertnia, NEC's president and chief executive officer, because 
of regulations that would have made a sale of all 29 schools together 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Licenses to operate the schools could not have been transferred as part of the 
sale, Cwiertnia said, so the prospective buyer, which the company would not 
identify, would have had to solicit a license for each school individually from 
both state and federal departments of education. 
</P>
<P>
 "That increased the risk," said Cwiertnia, because there was no guarantee that 
licenses would have been granted for all of the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 NEC, based in Irvine, said it will continue to search for buyers for the 
schools, which offer career training courses to high school graduates. But NEC 
will now offer them for sale individually or in small groups, the company said, 
rather than in a block. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling the education centers is key in the company's overall plan to return 
to profitability. For its latest fiscal year, NEC lost $9.6 million on revenue 
of $355.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Cwiertnia placed the blame on the training centers, which are scattered across 
the United States and offer courses in such areas as medical, electronics and 
automotive technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "They lost money this and last year," he said. "We would be profitable without 
the schools operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the company's other divisions, one of which offers correspondence 
courses and another that publishes supplemental educational materials, are 
profitable. A fourth division, which offers computer training for businesses, 
is still losing money. 
</P>
<P>
 NEC has made numerous attempts at restructuring flailing education centers 
operations, analysts say, but those efforts failed, forcing the company to 
decide in June to shut down the entire division that runs them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The restructuring has been going on for some time," said Byam Stevens, an 
analyst with the brokerage H.G. Wellington in New York. "They expanded too 
fast, made a huge managerial mess, and they are still trying to pull those 
chestnuts out of the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 NEC's stock hit a 52-week low in New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday, 
closing at $3.88 a share, down 25 cents.

ORANGE BROKERAGE SEEKS BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION

<TEXT>
<P>
 Montano Securities Corp., an independent brokerage in the middle of an 
ownership dispute, has filed for bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing and feud prompted Union Bank to freeze the firm's 10,000 customer 
accounts.Montano Securities, based in Orange, has nine offices and 900 brokers 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Founder Daniel Montano, ousted as president of the firm Dec. 14, filed two 
days later to reorganize the company under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy 
code. 
</P>
<P>
 Montano's dismissal came after an audit requested by the firm's minority 
shareholder, California Quartz Corp., revealed that Montano had understated 
losses and exaggerated revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 California Quartz, which owns the Focus Institute, a Costa Mesa computer 
school, was seeking to obtain a controlling interest in Montano Securities for 
$1.5 million. Montano fought the move by filing for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, California Quartz obtained a restraining order that bars Montano 
from company business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like a good investment," said David Lopes, California Quartz 
president who replaces Montano. "It would have been even better if the numbers 
weren't so far overstated." 
</P>
<P>
 An audit found that Montano Securities' revenue had been overstated by about 
$2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopes said customers' accounts should be released in "a day or two" when the 
firm presents proof to Union Bank that Montano is no longer involved in 
management.

 Managing a Career: Mark Alch, managing director of the outplacement firm Drake 
Beam Morin in Irvine, has a holiday gift for today's beleaguered worker. He 
calls it: "The Seven Steps to Making Sure You're Not the Other Shoe That 
Drops." 
</P>
<P>
 Step 1: Learn your value in the wider job market. In other words, he says, 
find out how many jobs there are out there for someone with your job title, 
education and experience. Are your current salary and benefits above or below 
the norm? 
</P>
<P>
 Step 2: Examine which of your skills could be transferred to other functions 
and other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Step 3: Aggressively pursue continuing education. 
</P>
<P>
 Step 4: Network both inside and outside the company relentlessly, establishing 
wide contacts throughout a company's management structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Step 5: Actively look for other opportunities within the company that give you 
broader understanding of the whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Step 6: Manage your boss as assiduously as your subordinates, meaning that you 
make sure your boss knows what your priorities and goals are. 
</P>
<P>
 Step 7: Don't be afraid of changing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies no longer offer people careers," Alch said. "People create their 
own careers."

 More Entrepreneurship Training: Another holiday present for workers: The 
so-called BOSS program, which helps laid off workers become entrepreneurs, will 
begin double sessions next month to handle the heavy demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Applications have increased substantially in the last two months due to the 
pending layoffs at the Hughes facility and greater awareness of the program," 
said Susan Fox, director of BOSS, which stands for Business Ownership Service 
System. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which is provided by Rancho Santiago College mostly with federal 
Labor Department funds, runs for 10 weeks. During that time, participants 
attend classes five days a week, four hours a day, learning finance, 
bookkeeping, marketing, insurance, legal matters, manufacturing and production. 
By the end of the session, every student drafts a complete business plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The BOSS program is free, and beginning in January there will be morning and 
afternoon classes, with a third evening session to be added later. 
</P>

DREAM CAR COULD SOON BECOME A REALITY; AUTOMOTIVE: THE LINCOLN 2000 IS A 
CONCEPT VEHICLE THAT COULD WIND UP IN SHOWROOMS AS A LUXURY CONVERTIBLE AIMED 
AT AGING BABY BOOMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many of the "concept" cars that manufacturers roll out at auto shows are dream 
machines -- they don't really run and they couldn't be built or sold at a 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But some -- the Dodge Viper, for instance -- become practical prototypes for 
vehicles that eventually turn up on the road. Ford Motor Co.'s Lincoln-Mercury 
division is showing a concept next month that could be one of those. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the baby boomers age, they're going to want vehicles that are great 
handling, fun to drive," Lincoln-Mercury general manager Keith Magee said last 
week as he walked around the L2K, as the Lincoln 2000 is nicknamed. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-seat, convertible sports car had just been shipped to Ford's design 
center here from the California automotive studio that put it together for 
January's North American International Auto Show in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Magee insists that there are no plans to mass-produce the L2K, but 
acknowledges that a production Lincoln 2000 could be accomplished in "three 
years, plus or minus." He said its future will depend to some extent on public 
reaction to the car at auto shows. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are several suggestions that Ford might be serious about this 
roadster: 
</P>
<P>
 * It was created using components that are today's technology, and it's 
drivable. Ford was even willing to take reporters on a test drive until snow 
cleanup forced cancellation of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * It was designed for a group of buyers whom rival Mercedes-Benz has already 
targeted with the SLK, a two-seat, luxury convertible that started on the show 
circuit more than a year ago and will be on sale in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 * The L2K would fit Ford's strategy to broaden Lincoln's appeal to buyers who 
aren't men in their 50s, 60s or 70s. It was created to appeal to people a 
decade or more younger and as a car women could "feel comfortable and secure 
in," said Richard Hutting, executive designer at Concept Center California, the 
consulting firm that built the car for Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 * The L2K could be built and sold for $40,000 or less. "That was in our minds 
when we did the vehicle," Hutting said. 
</P>
<P>
 The L2K weighs about 2,900 pounds and is powered by a 3.4-liter, 32-valve V-8 
engine that produces about 250 horsepower. Its styling picks up cues from 
present-day Lincolns, but also evokes images of some classic European 
roadsters.

NEW TAX RULES APPLY FOR CHARITABLE GIFTS; LAWS: CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE LARGER 
THAN $250 WILL REQUIRE MORE THAN A CANCELED CHECK FOR DOCUMENTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
 As Americans make their year-end charitable contributions, they will be 
operating under a new set of rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the year is a peak time for contributions, motivated by a mixture 
of holiday season altruism and tax-planning practicality. For most people, the 
end of December marks the deadline to increase their deductions, and thereby 
reduce their tax bill, for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the primary motive of giving is to support a charitable purpose, tax 
planning plays an important role," says the accounting firm of Coopers & 
Lybrand in its booklet Charitable Giving in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, a new set of standards for documenting charitable contributions is 
in effect, having been enacted as part of the 1993 tax and budget bill. The 
paperwork requirements have been increased, for instance, for any cash 
contribution of $250 or more. At that level, "a canceled check is no longer 
sufficient," notes the Institute of Certified Financial Planners. "Now you must 
ask the charity for a written acknowledgment of the value of the gift, and that 
you received no goods or services in return. 
</P>
<P>
 "Religious organizations must state that contributors received only 
'intangible religious benefits.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Many charities and other organizations that receive significant numbers of 
contributions have responded to the new strictures by automatically providing 
receipts of this sort. So the burden of extra work on contributors is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 The limit also can be avoided by splitting contributions into separate pieces 
of less than $250 each. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you make payroll deductions of $50 a month to United Way, for example, you 
don't need written documentation from them, even though the total gift for the 
year is $600," the financial planners' institute notes. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you give property for which you deduct $500 or more, a separate 
Internal Revenue Service Form 8283 must be submitted to substantiate its value. 
With property donations above $5,000, you must get a professional appraisal and 
attach it to your tax return. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, if you make a contribution of $75 or more that provides you with 
something of value in return, such as a meal or tickets to a concert, you need 
to get a written statement from the charity. This document should estimate the 
value of the goods or services you receive, which is then subtracted from the 
amount of your total payment to determine how much you have contributed for tax 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, charitable giving continues to be governed by rules that applied 
in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only individuals who itemize deductions may deduct charitable contributions," 
says the accounting firm of Ernst & Young in its "Tax-Savings Strategies Guide 
1995." 
</P>
<P>
 If you contribute 20% or more of your gross income, the firm points out, any 
of several limits on how much you can deduct may apply. 
</P>
<P>
 At year end, timing is of the essence in determining whether you can take a 
deduction for a contribution within a given tax year. If a check is mailed or 
delivered by Dec. 31, as supported by evidence such as a postmark, it is 
eligible for deduction in the current year.

 Contributions by credit card can be deducted currently, even if you don't pay 
off your card balance for months. "If you make a contribution with borrowed 
funds," points out Ernst & Young, "a deduction is allowed in the year you make 
the contribution, regardless of when you repay the loan." 
</P>
<P>
 But the gift must be actually charged to the credit card, not just pledged. No 
matter what amounts you may promise to pay, a pledged contribution does not 
become a deductible contribution until you make good on it.

<P>
 Hundreds of Orange County workers are expected to lose their jobs in early 
January under a sweeping plan, passed by the Board of Supervisors on Thursday, 
to slash $40.2 million from the county's budget over the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the cuts will come from salaries, and nearly every county government 
service -- from the courts to health care to social services programs -- will 
be targeted. More reductions may follow if the county's financial situation 
deteriorates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hardest hit will be the county's General Services Agency, which 
maintains county buildings, the county's administrative office and the Human 
Resources Department, which handles personnel matters. Also targeted were 
welfare services and contracts for providing outside legal assistance for the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no easy way . . . to say someone died or you're fired. And that's 
what happened today," said Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who is retiring this 
month after 16 years on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows exactly how many jobs could be cut. But the head of the Orange 
County Employees Assn. estimated that 800 to 1,000 positions could be lost. One 
supervisor said there are several hundred county jobs currently unfilled, which 
might help out. 
</P>
<P>
 John H. Sawyer, the union's general manager, charged that supervisors acted 
"prematurely and unjustifiably" in approving the cutbacks, in which they 
suspend a number of collective bargaining agreements with local unions, ask 
that some employees volunteer to retire and put a halt to all raises and 
promotions.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the announcement of expected layoffs came three days before 
Christmas, officials offered one bit of consolation: Workers are not expected 
to lose their jobs during the holidays. Department managers, however, must have 
their budget-cutting plans ready for board approval Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The board gave broad discretion Thursday for county managers to fire 
employees, regardless of seniority, and to cut salaries. The move was timed by 
county leaders in part to head off raises that were due to county firefighters 
today and other employees in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are shocked and disappointed that the county would treat its employees so 
cavalierly, particularly in the face of this march of folly," said Sawyer, 
whose union represents 11,000 of the county's 18,000-member work force. "This 
is a disastrous approach. This has all the aspects of a steamroller." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * A federal bankruptcy judge approved an interim plan that lets Orange County 
and more than 180 cities and districts withdraw up to $1 billion to pay 
emergency bills and make payrolls through Jan. 31. The plan limits the county 
and each investor to 30% of their investments in the county's troubled bond 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * Supervisors demoted Matthew Raabe as acting treasurer and named former 
Oklahoma state Auditor Thomas E. Daxon as treasurer for the next four months. 
Daxon was named two weeks ago as the county's special consultant to the 
treasurer's office. Raabe will return to his previous job as assistant 
treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 * The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, one of several agencies 
investigating the county's financial debacle, has sent 10-page questionnaires 
to investors, inquiring about their dealings with the county pool and whether 
the risks were adequately explained. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salomon Bros., the brokerage handling the liquidation of Orange County's 
portfolio, said it had auctioned off $405 million more in corporate securities 
Thursday but it was not immediately known how much was raised in the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 * Former California Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, the county's top financial 
adviser, said that although the sale so far of $3.3 billion in holdings by 
Salomon Bros. had succeeded in bolstering the troubled portfolio, "it is still 
very risky" and still vulnerable to losses from increases in prevailing 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other factors, exotic derivatives now make up nearly 80% of the residual 
portfolio, compared to 60% as recently as Dec. 13. That is because the 
investment advisers have focused on selling off the most easily marketable 
securities first to raise cash quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes said those moves have succeeded in raising the county's cash balance by 
more than $1.8 billion while paying off $1.53 billion in loans. At the same 
time, the potential loss to the portfolio from a 1-point rise in interest rates 
is now $220 million, down from $300 million Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes made his remarks in interviews with reporters from several newspapers 
before the Board of Supervisors held its emergency meeting Thursday to announce 
widespread budget cuts. 'Giant First Step' 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing crammed with anxious county workers, department managers and 
residents, Sheriff Brad Gates was the first to announce what had been rumored 
for days. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates was part of the county's three-member management council that has spent 
the past nine days considering where to cut spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff called the $40 million in cuts "a giant first step" that is "the 
necessary starting point to resolve our financial crisis."  
</P>
<P>
 "These are unique circumstances," he said. "We are on uncharted waters. What 
we need to do is different from what we've done before. It is important that 
all of us . . . must renew our commitment to steer the county through these 
troubled times." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the county is already six months into its budget year, Gates said, the 
council's ability to reduce spending was limited. The $40-million reduction 
represents nearly 20% of the county's general fund budget through June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply cannot cut any more this year without seriously jeopardizing 
mandatory levels of health and public safety for our residents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he emphasized that the first round of cuts "must be done immediately," and 
cautioned that the overall recovery would take several years. "The longer we 
delay action, the deeper and more Draconian the cost-saving measures will 
become," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gates, Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi and Health Care Agency Director Tom Uram 
met with individual department heads several times, as well as with the 
county's legal and financial advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without exception we found our entire county family ready, willing and able 
to assist in solving the current financial situation," Gates told the board. 
"If there was ever a problem for us it was that so many in our county family 
offered more help than we were able to or had the time to accept." 
</P>
<P>
 The management council refused to discuss specific numbers of people that may 
be laid off, and suggested that with the proper amount of budget juggling in 
each department, the impact could be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a scare tactic to just make up a number," Capizzi said. "I think 
my department is going to try to minimize laying people off." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said: "These are not easy decisions and we know it. There is 
anguish. There is frustration. it will be years before the county completely 
recovers from this situation." Officials' Authority Questioned 
</P>
<P>
 Several Orange County judges on Thursday privately raised questions about 
whether Gates and Capizzi -- elected officials who run large departments of 
their own -- had any authority to be part of an impartial body overseeing 
countywide budget cuts.  
</P>
<P>
 "They have no business being there, first because they don't have the 
authority and secondly because it clearly appears to be a conflict of 
interest," said one judge who declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department was reduced 0.7% while the district attorney's office 
was reduced 1.1%. Other departments were targeted for as much as 12% to 18% in 
salary cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the hardest-hit program in the county is "alternate defense," which 
provides attorneys for indigent people and pays for other court costs in those 
cases. The program, whose 1994-1995 budget was under $13 million, must slash 
$3.7 million -- or 29% of the total budget -- from its program, according to 
the management council plan. The county's public defender's office will pick up 
the slack, with no extra budget.  
</P>
<P>
 The General Services Agency will also suffer big losses, with a reduction of 
$4.5 million, more than 12% of the annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big number," said Bert Scott, said head of the GSA, which maintains 
county facilities. "It's a significant number. Obviously we have to do whatever 
it takes to get this done." 
</P>
<P>
 Other areas ordered to cut the greatest chunks from their budgets include the 
Human Resources Department, which will lose about 18%, of its 1994-1995 budget, 
and the offices of Supervisor William G. Steiner and incoming Supervisor Marian 
Bergeson, whose staffs will be trimmed 14% and 20% respectively. But because 
those offices have relatively small budgets, the cuts will yield only about $1 
million in savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Several departments with large budgets will take smaller hits that will 
nevertheless go far to make up the overall county shortfall. The county 
Probation Department was ordered to reduced its budget by $3 million, the 
Social Services Agency by $10 million and the Health Care Agency by $3 million. 
For all three, though, the cuts are under 5% of their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the departments losing the least, each less than 2% of this year's 
budgets, are assessor and county counsel.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the layoffs, the county's administrative office expected at least 20. 
The county counsel expects to cut jobs as well because there are not many other 
areas to cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have that many legal pads," said Terry A. Andrus, the county's top 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize the layoffs, county officials are hoping some employees will take 
advantage of early retirement incentives offered Thursday. Employees who retire 
immediately will be guaranteed all their accrued vacation and compensatory time 
in cash. Those benefits remain in jeopardy for workers who stay with the county 
because the money is frozen in the county's investment pool and could suffer 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders said the Board of Supervisors had rendered their labor contracts 
useless and feared they would be powerless to have a say in how the cutbacks 
will be implemented. They were particularly incensed that the board's action 
allows anyone to be laid off, regardless of seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 "County employees are the only asset that remains intact," Sawyer told board 
members as many in the audience cheered loudly. 
</P>
<P>
 John Sawyer Jr., counsel for the Orange County Employees Assn. and the general 
manager's son, said that the association's members "were stunned by an 
overwhelming sense of betrayal." 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders were most dismayed by the the abrogation of layoff provisions in 
their bargaining agreements that protect employees according to seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eliminating seniority seems to be designed to replace the merit system with 
favoritism," the younger Sawyer said. "We're going to be evaluating our legal 
options." 
</P>
<P>
 One angry resident pointed the finger at county supervisors, who have come 
under attack since the bankruptcy and criticized for failing to prevent it. She 
said county workers should not take the hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had these people working in our county and they are not the cause of 
the problem," said Madelene Arakelian of Laguna Hills. "What are you going to 
give up? You should all resign." 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Pickett, field representative for a union that represents 500 county 
workers, suggested an across-the-board pay cut of 10% rather than layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no fairness or equity in the layoff," she said. "Why make 800 to 
1,000 employees go out the door when there is an alternative where everybody 
contributes to solving the problem without anybody losing their jobs?  
</P>
<P>
 "The wrong people are paying the price for the mistakes they had no control 
over," she said. A Tough Vote 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said Thursday's vote was a 
tough one. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the decision we make here today will have very real and I'm afraid 
negative consequences for some of our county family, all of the decisions have 
been weighed and all have been difficult, as most would understand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Silva, who joins the Board of Supervisors in January, sat in the audience 
at the Hall of Administration, listening to the grim news. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very, very sad to see this many lives affected," Silva said later. "When 
they have to go home to their families and tell them that now they're 
unemployed, that's really horrible. And it could have been prevented, that's 
what makes me so mad. This was not an act of God. This was done by people."  
</P>
<P>
 Silva said he thought the board had little choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was the right thing to do," he said. "I don't think that they 
really see the bottom yet. Unless we can act fast, I think there could be 
additional problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's announcement of massive cuts was the culmination of three weeks of 
nearly nonstop meetings and widespread worry over the financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis surfaced Dec. 1, when former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. 
Citron and Raabe, his top assistant, announced a $1.5-billion "paper loss" to 
the county's investment pool. Citron resigned Dec. 5, one day before the county 
became the first in history to file for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's loss has reached more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 County leaders said the financial crisis left them no choice but the slash the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected that it would come to this point," Steiner said late Thursday, 
exhausted by the day's events. "It's regrettable. This is the low point of the 
investment pool calamity. From this point on, I hope we're going to see 
recovery."

<P>
 Hundreds of Orange County workers are expected to lose their jobs in early 
January under a sweeping plan, passed by the Board of Supervisors on Thursday, 
to slash $40.2 million from the county's budget over the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the cuts will come from salaries, and nearly every county government 
service -- from the courts to health care to social services programs -- will 
be targeted. More reductions may follow if the county's financial situation 
deteriorates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hardest hit will be the county's General Services Agency, which 
maintains county buildings, the county's administrative office and the Human 
Resources Department, which handles personnel matters. Also targeted were 
welfare services and contracts for providing outside legal assistance for the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no easy way . . . to say someone died or you're fired. And that's 
what happened today," said Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who is retiring this 
month after 16 years on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows exactly how many jobs could be cut. But the head of the Orange 
County Employees Assn. estimated that 800 to 1,000 positions could be lost. One 
supervisor said there are several hundred county jobs currently unfilled, which 
might help out. 
</P>
<P>
 John H. Sawyer, the union's general manager, charged that supervisors acted 
"prematurely and unjustifiably" in approving the cutbacks, in which they 
suspend a number of collective bargaining agreements with local unions, ask 
that some employees volunteer to retire and put a halt to all raises and 
promotions.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the announcement of expected layoffs came three days before 
Christmas, officials offered one bit of consolation: Workers are not expected 
to lose their jobs during the holidays. Department managers, however, must have 
their budget-cutting plans ready for board approval Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The board gave broad discretion Thursday for county managers to fire 
employees, regardless of seniority, and to cut salaries. The move was timed by 
county leaders in part to head off raises that were due to county firefighters 
today and other employees in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are shocked and disappointed that the county would treat its employees so 
cavalierly, particularly in the face of this march of folly," said Sawyer, 
whose union represents 11,000 of the county's 18,000-member work force. "This 
is a disastrous approach. This has all the aspects of a steamroller." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * A federal bankruptcy judge approved an interim plan that lets Orange County 
and more than 180 cities and districts withdraw up to $1 billion to pay 
emergency bills and make payrolls through Jan. 31. The plan limits the county 
and each investor to 30% of their investments in the county's troubled bond 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * Supervisors demoted Matthew R. Raabe as acting treasurer and named former 
Oklahoma state Auditor Thomas Daxon as treasurer for the next four months. 
Daxon was named two weeks ago as the county's special consultant to the 
treasurer's office. Raabe will return to his previous job as assistant 
treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 * The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, one of several agencies 
investigating the county's financial debacle, has sent 10-page questionnaires 
to investors, inquiring about their dealings with the county pool and whether 
the risks were adequately explained. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salomon Bros., the brokerage handling the liquidation of Orange County's 
portfolio, said it had auctioned off $405 million more in corporate securities 
Thursday but it was not immediately known how much was raised in the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 * Former California Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, the county's top financial 
adviser, said that although the sale so far of $3.3 billion in holdings by 
Salomon Bros. had succeeded in bolstering the troubled portfolio, "it is still 
very risky" and still vulnerable to losses from increases in prevailing 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other factors, exotic derivatives now make up nearly 80% of the residual 
portfolio, compared to 60% as recently as Dec. 13. That is because the 
investment advisers have focused on selling off the most easily marketable 
securities first to raise cash quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes said those moves have succeeded in raising the county's cash balance by 
more than $1.8 billion while paying off $1.53 billion in loans. At the same 
time, the potential loss to the portfolio from a 1-point rise in interest rates 
is now $220 million, down from $300 million Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes made his remarks in interviews with reporters from several newspapers 
before the Board of Supervisors held its emergency meeting Thursday to announce 
widespread budget cuts. 'Giant First Step' 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing crammed with anxious county workers, department managers and 
residents, Sheriff Brad Gates was the first to announce what had been rumored 
for days. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates was part of the county's three-member management council that has spent 
the past nine days considering where to cut spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff called the $40 million in cuts "a giant first step" that is "the 
necessary starting point to resolve our financial crisis."  
</P>
<P>
 "These are unique circumstances," he said. "We are on uncharted waters. What 
we need to do is different from what we've done before. It is important that 
all of us . . . must renew our commitment to steer the county through these 
troubled times." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the county is already six months into its budget year, Gates said, the 
council's ability to reduce spending was limited. The $40-million reduction 
represents nearly 20% of the county's general fund budget through June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply cannot cut any more this year without seriously jeopardizing 
mandatory levels of health and public safety for our residents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he emphasized that the first round of cuts "must be done immediately," and 
cautioned that the overall recovery would take several years. "The longer we 
delay action, the deeper and more Draconian the cost-saving measures will 
become," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gates, Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi and Health Care Agency Director Tom Uram 
met with individual department heads several times, as well as with the 
county's legal and financial advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without exception we found our entire county family ready, willing and able 
to assist in solving the current financial situation," Gates told the board. 
"If there was ever a problem for us it was that so many in our county family 
offered more help than we were able to or had the time to accept." 
</P>
<P>
 The management council refused to discuss specific numbers of people that may 
be laid off, and suggested that with the proper amount of budget juggling in 
each department, the impact could be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a scare tactic to just make up a number," Capizzi said. "I think 
my department is going to try to minimize laying people off." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said: "These are not easy decisions and we know it. There is 
anguish. There is frustration. it will be years before the county completely 
recovers from this situation." Officials' Authority Questioned 
</P>
<P>
 Several Orange County judges on Thursday privately raised questions about 
whether Gates and Capizzi -- elected officials who run large departments of 
their own -- had any authority to be part of an impartial body overseeing 
countywide budget cuts.  
</P>
<P>
 "They have no business being there, first because they don't have the 
authority and secondly because it clearly appears to be a conflict of 
interest," said one judge who declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department was reduced 0.7% while the district attorney's office 
was reduced 1.1%. Other departments were targeted for as much as 12% to 18% in 
salary cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the departments losing the least, each less than 2% of this year's 
budgets, are assessor and county counsel.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the layoffs, the county's administrative office expected at least 20. 
The county counsel expects to cut jobs as well because there are not many other 
areas to cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have that many legal pads," said Terry Andrus, the county's top 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize the layoffs, county officials are hoping some employees will take 
advantage of early retirement incentives offered Thursday. Employees who retire 
immediately will be guaranteed all their accrued vacation and compensatory time 
in cash. Those benefits remain in jeopardy for workers who stay with the county 
because the money is frozen in the county's investment pool and could suffer 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders said the Board of Supervisors had rendered their labor contracts 
useless and feared they would be powerless to have a say in how the cutbacks 
will be implemented. They were particularly incensed that the board's action 
allows anyone to be laid off, regardless of seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 "County employees are the only asset that remains intact," Sawyer told board 
members as many in the audience cheered loudly. 
</P>
<P>
 John Sawyer Jr., counsel for the Orange County Employees Assn. and the general 
manager's son, said that the association's members "were stunned by an 
overwhelming sense of betrayal." 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders were most dismayed by the the abrogation of layoff provisions in 
their bargaining agreements that protect employees according to seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eliminating seniority seems to be designed to replace the merit system with 
favoritism," the younger Sawyer said. "We're going to be evaluating our legal 
options." 
</P>
<P>
 One angry resident pointed the finger at county supervisors, who have come 
under attack since the bankruptcy and criticized for failing to prevent it. She 
said county workers should not take the hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had these people working in our county and they are not the cause of 
the problem," said Madelene Arakelian of Laguna Hills. "What are you going to 
give up? You should all resign." A Tough Vote 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said Thursday's vote was a 
tough one. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the decision we make here today will have very real and I'm afraid 
negative consequences for some of our county family, all of the decisions have 
been weighed and all have been difficult, as most would understand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Silva, who joins the Board of Supervisors in January, sat in the audience 
at the Hall of Administration, listening to the grim news. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very, very sad to see this many lives affected," Silva said later. "When 
they have to go home to their families and tell them that now they're 
unemployed, that's really horrible. And it could have been prevented, that's 
what makes me so mad. This was not an act of God. This was done by people."  
</P>
<P>
 Silva said he thought the board had little choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was the right thing to do," he said. "I don't think that they 
really see the bottom yet. Unless we can act fast, I think there could be 
additional problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's announcement of massive cuts was the culmination of three weeks of 
nearly nonstop meetings and widespread worry over the financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis surfaced Dec. 1, when former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. 
Citron and Raabe, his top assistant, announced a $1.5-billion "paper loss" to 
the county's investment pool. Citron resigned Dec. 5, one day before the county 
became the first in history to file for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's loss has reached more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 County leaders said the financial crisis left them no choice but the slash the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected that it would come to this point," Steiner said late Thursday, 
exhausted by the day's events. "It's regrettable. This is the low point of the 
investment pool calamity. From this point on, I hope we're going to see 
recovery."

</P>
<P>
 Voiding contracts with labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Adjusting the county general fund by approving salary cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparing reduction plans for agencies and departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Making partial payments for sick leave and vacation days. 
</P>
<P>

COLUMN ONE; THE SOULFUL LEGACY OF SAM COOKE; THE CHARISMATIC MINISTER'S SON 
BECAME A TOP 40 SENSATION WHO INSPIRED GENERATIONS OF SINGERS. HIS EXPLOSIVE 
RISE WAS CUT SHORT WHEN HE WAS SLAIN AT A MOTEL 30 YEARS AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His body was found slumped in the doorway of a sleazy tryst stop, his back 
resting against a desk -- no pants, one shoe -- a bullet through his heart. He 
had gone to the motel in his new red Ferrari with a woman he had picked up in a 
Hollywood restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 She later told police he had abducted her and tried to rape her before she 
managed to flee with his trousers. When he broke down the door to the manager's 
office searching for her, there was a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager, a 55-year-old woman, fired three shots. And Sam Cooke -- the 
soulful singer poised at 33 to ascend to a level of stardom few black American 
entertainers had been allowed to reach -- lay dead on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who followed his career are convinced that a conspiracy was behind the 
killing. Others reject such theories but say they will never believe that he 
would abduct and try to rape a woman. Allan Klein, Cooke's manager at the time, 
maintains that the full story has yet to be told. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the truth, those who knew him say, the singer's musical legacy is far 
more significant than the way he died 30 years ago this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting stilled a voice whose phrases could fall prettily like a cascade 
of polished pebbles or well up roughly from an emotional core, seizing the 
spirit and shaping it to its will. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sam was the best singer who ever lived, no contest," record producer Jerry 
Wexler once said. Rod Stewart described Cooke's influence on him as being so 
profound he spent two years listening only to his music. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke's musical roots lay in gospel where he rose to the first rank, making a 
magnificently joyful noise as lead singer of the legendary Soul Stirrers. He 
was one of the earliest artists to bring gospel influences to pop, producing a 
seductive sound that appealed across racial lines. 
</P>
<P>
 This year alone, James Taylor sang "Everybody Likes to Cha Cha Cha." Jimmy 
Buffett cut "Another Saturday Night." Michael Bolton included "You Send Me" and 
"Bring It on Home to Me" on his album of classic songs. And Stewart's version 
of Cooke's "Having A Party" became a Top 10 pop hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sam Cooke's SAR Records Story," a double disc of his work with other 
performers when he was head of his own label, was released to critical acclaim 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming is a long-delayed film on Cooke, Klein said. In February, William 
Morrow & Co. plans to publish a new biography, "You Send Me," named for his 
biggest pop hit. A Cooke blues album will be re-released in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his lyrics already are staples of popular culture. People who may not 
know who he was have found themselves idly singing these lines from "Wonderful 
World": 
</P>
<P>
 Don't know much about history  
</P>
<P>
 Don't know much biology . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In just over six years in pop music, Cooke recorded or wrote 29 Top 40 singles 
-- more than Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard combined. He 
established SAR, an independent record label in 1959 with J.W. Alexander and 
S.R. Crain, and launched the careers of artists such as Bobby Womack, Billy 
Preston and Mel Carter. In 1986, he was one of the first 10 inductees into the 
Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 To teen-age girls he was a fantasy made flesh -- a charismatic sex symbol 
whose flashy smile and matinee idol looks were exceptionally easy on the eyes. 
Just months before he died, he had made a triumphant return to New York's 
Copacabana Club, and he had screen-tested for a movie role. 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigating Cooke's shooting "underestimated his stature," recalled 
Alexander, his former business partner -- some say his right hand. "The head of 
the 77th Street Division said he didn't realize Sam was that big until he 
started getting calls from Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke's career in gospel and pop also spanned an era when African Americans 
found their political voice. Beneath all of that sex appeal lay an evolving 
political consciousness that began surfacing in his moving civil rights anthem, 
"A Change Is Gonna Come." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His younger brother L.C. cannot recall a time when Cooke even considered 
anything other than singing. When they were growing up in Chicago, Sam once 
lined up rows of Popsicle sticks, explaining to L.C. that they were his 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm singing to them, preparing myself for the future," L.C. recalled Cooke 
saying. "I'm never going to work a 9 to 5 job. You can never achieve anything 
and get ahead working 9 to 5. All you can do is survive from payday to payday." 
</P>
<P>
 L.C. was totally confused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 7 years old," he said. "Sam was 9. I didn't know what he was talking 
about. My father worked. I was wondering how the hell you make it if you don't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 He chuckled, remembering his brother's childhood determination: "He never did 
work 9 to 5." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke shaped his style in the church -- the crucible of black music -- singing 
gospel with two of his four brothers and two of his three sisters in a family 
group before joining the Soul Stirrers. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 18, he was the leading gospel performer in the world," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Cooke was worried that gospel fans would think he "was forsaking them 
and the Lord" if he went pop, L.C. said. But their father, a minister, sealed 
the issue. "Sam, the Lord gave you a voice to make people happy," L.C. recalls 
his father saying. "Go ahead and sing." 
</P>
<P>
 "You Send Me," Cooke's first pop release for Keen Records, soared to No. 1 on 
the charts in 1957, selling more than a million records. "Man, this is gold," 
he told his arranger Rene Hall. "I can write a lot of these things." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander marveled at Cooke's facility to spin out hits nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wrote 'Everybody Loves to Cha Cha Cha' at a Christmas party at Lou Rawls' 
stepfather's house," Alexander said. "He just watched what everybody was doing 
and wrote the song in a matter of minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 For a man with practically no formal music training, he had a remarkable ear 
for every element in a recording. Cliff White, who played guitar on practically 
all of Cooke's recording and concert dates, recalled that Cooke "heard the 
whole thing, the music, the background, and how they worked together. He had no 
regard for the rules and regulations of music. He thought as a performer -- not 
as a musician. He wanted a particular sound. Nothing else would do." 
</P>
<P>
 He had impressive record sales among white audiences. But "if you've never 
seen him live in a black club, then you're missing something," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must make your audience feel what you feel," Cooke once told an 
interviewer. "If you have ever attended Baptist services, you'll know what I 
mean. You have to stir up the emotions of the congregation and literally lift 
them from their chairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Through all of the success, he never lost the common touch, said singer 
Womack, who played guitar in Cooke's band. Cooke would tell Womack to stop the 
car when he spotted crapshooters arguing on the street in a tough neighborhood. 
Cooke would walk over and announce: "I'm in this game. Here, I'm giving you 
$50, you $50 and you $100 because you got the biggest mouth," Womack said. 
"Then he would shoot out, win his money back and get back in the car laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 Womack also recalls watching Cooke's consciousness change. "I saw him start 
reading about black history," Womack said. "He was so into it that he would 
read in the wings. I wondered what's in that book because I never wanted to 
read. He said, 'Malcolm, man. You gotta read Malcolm.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At segregated auditoriums in the South, Womack recalled, police would patrol 
the black side with dogs to keep the youngsters in their seats. But whites were 
allowed to stand and cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooked vowed to stop playing in segregated houses. He told Womack, "If we stop 
doing this, the other young guys will be afraid not to stop. I'm responsible if 
I let that (expletive) happen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke's widow, Barbara, who met him when she was 13, recalls how as teen-agers 
they dreamed of fancy cars and big houses. "We used to imagine those things 
because that was all we had," said Cooke, 59. "We had nothing. I told Sam that 
you have to see the future before you can get there." 
</P>
<P>
 The future was a fairy tale that came true, she said, only to tragically 
unravel. Memories of Dec. 11, 1964, are still painful for Cooke, who had not 
publicly discussed her feelings until now. 
</P>
<P>
 Her marriage had its share of tension, she said, adding that Cooke was 
addicted to celebrity and had an "insatiable" need for attention from women. As 
painful as the circumstances of his death were, she said, she was not surprised 
because he had devised a strategy to avoid paternity suits by sleeping with 
prostitutes rather than fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't accept what he did, but I supported him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives pieced together what allegedly happened at the Hacienda Motel -- 
now renamed the Star -- on South Figueroa Avenue primarily from the accounts of 
two women: Lisa Boyer (no relation to this writer), then a 22-year-old 
described in media reports as a "Eurasian singer," and Bertha Lee Franklin, the 
motel manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer told investigators and a coroner's inquest that Cooke had offered her a 
ride from Martino's, a celebrity hangout, to the Hollywood motel where she 
lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than take her home, Cooke took her on a high-speed ride through the 
early morning streets. They wound up at the motel on Figueroa where he 
registered under his own name and dragged her into the room, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke pinned her to the bed and ripped off her dress, Boyer said. She escaped 
when he went into the bathroom, scooping up her clothes and inadvertently 
grabbing his pants. She said she knocked at the manager's office, got no 
response, then ran off. 
</P>
<P>
 A few doors away, she stopped to dress, then called police from a phone booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Cooke had gone to the manager's office, demanding to be let in to 
look for Boyer, Franklin told investigators. When she refused to open the door, 
he broke it down and began searching the office apartment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 He grabbed her wrists and they struggled to the floor, Franklin said, adding 
that she managed to grab a .22-caliber pistol from the top of her TV and start 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lady, you shot me," she said Cooke told her before charging her again. She 
picked up a stick and began hitting him, she said. He fell back against the 
desk where homicide investigators found him. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's inquest determined that the shooting was justifiable homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had he called me and told me he was in a hotel without any clothes -- to 
bring him something to wear . . . " said Barbara Cooke, her voice trailing off. 
After reflecting for a long moment, she said: "I'm his wife. No matter how it 
might sound, I would have done that." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands gathered outside the Los Angeles church where Ray Charles, Lou Rawls 
and Bobby (Blue) Bland sang at Cooke's funeral. Even larger crowds converged on 
the Chicago church where a second service was held. 
</P>
<P>
 Just over a month after the shooting, Boyer was arrested in a prostitution 
raid in Hollywood. Three months later, Barbara Cooke married Womack. They 
divorced six years later. She has moved to northern Louisiana where she lives 
in affluence on her share of royalties from Cooke's songs. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1967, Franklin was awarded $30,000 in damages from Cooke's estate for 
battery. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke's fans were sure that there was more to their idol's death than met the 
eye. The killing was a mob hit, went one theory. He had been killed at a 
prominent entertainment executive's mansion and taken to South-Central to avoid 
a scandal, others theorized. There were also whispers about drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The headline in one Los Angeles weekly newspaper read: "Blackmail Seen As 
Motive for Sam Cooke Murder." 
</P>
<P>
 A group of black disc jockeys demanded an investigation, and the Los Angeles 
Herald Dispatch published a front-page satire of the coroner's inquest -- 
suggesting that the proceeding was racially biased. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, Cooke's manager, hired private detectives who concluded that the 
shooting was justifiable. But Klein has never accepted Boyer's account. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was prepared to fight and asked Barbara if she would like me to keep going 
on it," Klein said. "She asked: 'Will it bring him back? Will it get him out of 
the room with that woman?' I told her no. She said: 'I have two children, and I 
don't want to put them through this.' So the investigation was stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, who later managed the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, said he will 
reveal his theory of how Cooke was killed in the movie that he plans to 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Barbara Cooke and Womack married so soon after Cooke's death, one 
rumor speculated that they were involved in his killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly didn't kill him . . . unless it was killing him with love," 
Barbara Cooke said. "I married that man to stay with him for the rest of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Woods, who was once married to Alexander, said persistent talk that 
Cooke was killed because he had Mafia associations come "from disturbed people. 
There was no Mafia hit. No threat. No nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 It was difficult for black entertainers to work in clubs without mob 
connections in the 1960s, she said, "but if Sam worked in a place affiliated 
with the Mafia, he was received with respect. They did not want to see Sam 
dirtied." 
</P>
<P>
 There were also those who saw his death as divine retribution for his having 
left gospel singing, Womack recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Other singers watched Cooke for years, "waiting for something to happen to 
him," said Womack, who began his career singing in a family gospel group. 
</P>
<P>
 Tragedy had stalked Cooke long before his death. His first wife died in an 
auto accident. His driver was killed and he was injured in a 1958 accident that 
left Lou Rawls, who was in the car, in a coma for several days. In 1963, 
Cooke's infant son Vincent -- one of his three children -- drowned in the 
family pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Sam was killed, there were those who said: 'He thought he got away, but 
God waited on him,' " Womack said. "I said, 'Man, God don't do people like that 
-- not this kind of God I know. They do it to themselves.' "

NEWS ANALYSIS; PROGRAMS FOR POOR SUFFER DEEPEST CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Government services used by the poor will bear the brunt of the $40.2 million 
in budget reductions adopted Thursday as Orange County government tries to bail 
itself out of the worst municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 High on the chopping block are three county programs heavily relied on by the 
county's poorest citizens -- health care, social services and defense attorneys 
for impoverished criminal defendants. Together, cutbacks in the three programs 
represent about $16.6 million, or 40%, of the total budget cuts approved by the 
County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely spared from the fiscal bloodletting was the Environmental Management 
Agency, a giant bureaucracy that oversees residential, commercial and 
industrial development in unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Also barely grazed by the budget ax were the Orange County Sheriff-Coroner's 
Department and the district attorney's office. Both agencies enjoyed budget 
increases exceeding 24% this year, and the sheriff and district attorney sat on 
the management committee that decided which budget cuts to present to the Board 
of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to dig ourselves out of this mess, which is due to the board's own 
lack of oversight, we must put it on the backs of the people who need welfare 
support," said Mark A. Petracca, an associate professor of political science at 
UC Irvine. "They are the ones who can't do much about it. They are the ones who 
don't make campaign contributions." 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors approved $40,197,177 in cuts for 27 county departments and 
programs from the assessor's office to the treasurer-tax collector's office. 
All reductions must be fully achieved by June, the end of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors relied on proposals from a three-member Operations Management 
Council of Sheriff Brad Gates, Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi and Health Care 
Agency Director Tom Uram. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this was a mammoth undertaking," Uram said. "It took place in nine 
intense days. We did the best job three people could do in dividing the hurt . 
. . (but) it's not what I wanted to do when I grew up. I wouldn't like to do it 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Not counting services directly benefiting the poor, the budget cuts are spread 
across the remaining 24 agencies and programs. Of those, the General Services 
Agency budget of $37 million was cut 12.4%. The budget for Human Resources, the 
county's personnel office, was slashed almost 18% from $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The county administrative office's budget of $6.3 million was reduced 11.6%. 
Cuts for each office of the Board of Supervisors ranged from 8.3% for the 3rd 
District to 19.8% for the 5th District, some of the largest reductions 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors have come under extreme public scrutiny because of the 
bankruptcy, and polls indicate that a majority of Orange County residents blame 
them as much as now departed Treasurer Robert L. Citron for the financial 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Faring far better were the district attorney's office with a 1.1% reduction, 
the Sheriff-Coroner's Department with a 0.7% reduction, and the Environmental 
Management Agency with a cut of less than 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts for the Sheriff's Department and district attorney should hardly be 
felt because both agencies had funding increases this year of 24% and 31% 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the programs often relied on by the poor, $3 million will be cut from the 
$235-million budget of the Health Care Agency, which oversees public health 
services, medical services and mental health programs. Uram pointed out that 
the cut was actually deeper than it might appear because only $13 million of 
his seemingly huge budget involves discretionary spending. 
</P>
<P>
 About $40 million of the agency's overall budget comes from the county's 
general fund. The rest is from fees and state and federal sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Uram said he did not anticipate that vital programs such as those intended to 
check the spread of communicable disease would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board's direction was to protect public health and safety. I do not think 
the board will come through with cuts in those areas," Uram said. 
</P>
<P>
 No salary cuts are planned, but layoffs are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Social Services Agency, responsible for administering welfare 
programs, foster care and other benefits for the poor, suffered an 
$8.8-million, or 4.1%, reduction in its $213-million budget. On top of that is 
another $1-million cut from county welfare funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The reduction could affect programs funded largely by the state and federal 
governments, which rely on contributions from the county. But state officials 
said Thursday that there was no way to assess the effects because it was 
unclear where the cuts would be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidonie Squier), a spokesperson for the state Department of Social Services, 
said the county had not contacted the state about the cuts and state officials 
were very surprised by the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 County Social Services Director Larry Leaman could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit was the county alternative defense budget of $12.7 million, which 
was reduced by $3.7 million, or 29%. The program provides private defense 
attorneys for impoverished adults and juveniles whenever the county public 
defender's office cannot take their cases because of conflicts of interest, 
which occur when there are multiple defendants in a case. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternative defense also pays for court-appointed attorneys, and defense 
investigators and lawyers who have won competitive bids to handle major felony 
matters, including death penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic reduction in the alternative defense budget will cause a shift of 
about 3,000 cases to the county public defender's office, which must assume the 
caseload without any additional staff. Although the public defender's office is 
now being asked to shoulder work that was done by court-appointed attorneys, it 
received an overall budget increase this year of almost 15% over the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we can do now is to get it done and preserve the integrity of our 
operation," said Public Defender Ronald Y. Butler. "We'll work harder than we 
have been. It's a crisis, and my office is willing to do all it can to 
participate in the resolution of this crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 But James L. Smith, the presiding Orange County Superior Court judge, said the 
public defender's office is taking one of the hardest blows in the wake of the 
county's bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be one of the most problematic areas of the proposed cuts," Smith 
said. "How can the public defender handle the additional cases? By working 
harder? I'm not sure they can. By providing less services? Is that what we 
want?"

PESO PLUNGES AS MEXICO LETS THE CURRENCY FLOAT; ECONOMICS: U.S. ACTIVATES A 
$6-BILLION LINE OF CREDIT. NEWS IS BAD FOR MEXICANS FACING LOSS OF BUYING 
POWER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mexican currency plummeted Thursday -- losing a fifth of its value -- and 
the Mexican stock market fluctuated wildly in frantic trading after President 
Ernesto Zedillo's government stunned international financial markets and this 
nation by permitting the peso to float freely against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and Canada, its partners in the North America Free Trade 
Agreement, immediately rushed to aid Mexico, which suddenly has been enmeshed 
in political and economic turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Treasury Department officials confirmed Thursday that they are activating 
a $6-billion line of credit for the Mexican Central Bank, which can also call 
upon $1 billion in Canadian loan credits to shore up this nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 While diplomats and financiers in New York, Washington and Mexico City 
scrambled to limit the damage, U.S. shoppers poured into Tijuana in a light 
rain. Among them was Tim Mulholland of Reseda, who paid $50 for a pair of boots 
that he expected to cost $90 -- the good news about a fiscal crisis that has 
enhanced the buying power of the dollar in Mexico by about one-third in just 
three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came down for some Christmas shopping, and I was pleased. People were real 
nice," Mulholland said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the news is not so good for Mexican citizens, who suddenly face a shrunken 
peso and rising interest rates, all in the name of slashing their country's 
unmanageable trade deficit and strengthening the economy in the longer term. A 
60-day wage and price freeze was also imposed to contain the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico requested the emergency credit line, part of the NAFTA agreement that 
took effect Jan. 1, after Treasury Secretary Jaime Serra Puche announced the 
floating of the peso. The funds will help bolster Mexico's foreign exchange 
reserves, which Serra disclosed had plummeted to $6.5 billion -- the result of 
months of government buying to defend the peso at overvalued levels. The 
reserves stood at $17 billion as recently as Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of announcing what the government called an extreme measure to 
stabilize the peso at rational levels and blunt the impact of political 
instability in the embattled southern state of Chiapas, thousands of Mexicans 
lined up at exchange houses to sell off the Mexican currency. Mexican stocks 
traded in New York fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Mexican economists said the government move spread anger, resentment and 
a crisis of confidence in Zedillo's government just three weeks into his term 
-- and three days before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech to Mexican economists late Wednesday, Zedillo had stressed that he 
believed radical measures were necessary to deal with the uncertainty resulting 
from an Indian-led uprising in Mexico's southernmost state. He insisted that 
the actions ultimately would usher in "a new era of economic growth." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican action was endorsed by the Clinton Administration and the 
International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Fischer, IMF deputy director, called Mexico's moves "an appropriate 
response to recent market developments. . . . These measures reinforce the 
sound economic policies that have been pursued in recent years and that 
resulted in a marked improvement in the performance of the Mexican economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the international praise and projections that Mexico's long-term 
prospects remained solid, the net result was a day of trauma for the Mexican 
economy. The shock waves also rippled through Latin American markets, such as 
in Brazil, where the stock exchange finished down 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Just hours after trading opened in Mexico City and in New York on Thursday 
morning, the peso took its largest drop against the dollar in more than a 
decade -- free-falling from 3.978 at Wednesday's close to 4.6, where Mexican 
economists said they expect it to remain for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Bolsa, Mexico's stock market, the peso float had the opposite effect. 
The market initially rallied, as the new exchange rate made Mexican stocks 
cheaper for foreign investors. Then, at midday, it plummeted. But then it rose 
again in the third heaviest trading day of the year, finishing up 4.66%, or 
102.59 points. 
</P>
<P>
 But most Mexican stocks traded in the United States fell sharply. Shares in 
blue-chip Telefonos de Mexico, a key barometer for American investors who had 
viewed Mexico as a boom market for years, were down $4.25 at $40.75 after 14.77 
million shares changed hands in extremely heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tremendous blow to the Mexican economy," said Mexican economist 
Rogelio Ramirez de la O. "I think it has inflicted tremendous wounds on Mexico. 
I think it will take six years to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst of the wounds is a crisis of confidence for President Zedillo," he 
said. "It has exhibited a president who has lost control over the two most 
important policy initiatives in which we had so many hopes -- the economic 
initiatives and the political initiatives in Chiapas." 
</P>
<P>
 Serra's announcement around midnight Wednesday that the peso would float came 
just 12 hours after he and Zedillo's other key economic advisers had vowed that 
they would take no further action affecting the exchange rate, which fell 15% 
on Tuesday after the government lifted the Mexican currency's official trading 
ceiling in response to a rebel mobilization in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Serra then flew on Thursday to New York, where he sought to explain the 
government's actions to a high-powered group of federal officials and Wall 
Street representatives in a midday meeting at the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers criticized the sudden reversal in policies and asked Serra why they 
should have confidence now in any other measures Mexico plans, according to one 
person at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Serra told the 70 people assembled that the Mexican central bank will 
implement a tight monetary policy aimed at price stability, which will "entail 
an initial period of higher interest rates that will help stabilize the foreign 
exchange market." 
</P>
<P>
 Serra also reiterated the government's intent to contain inflation, balance 
its budget in 1995 and increase revenue through more sales of state-owned 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Most independent financial analysts agreed with Zedillo's prediction that the 
devaluation will ultimately strengthen the economy by boosting exports. 
Economists stressed that some form of devaluation was necessary to adjust for 
Mexico's trade deficit and to make its markets more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, whose sweeping free market reforms 
freed Mexico from its financial crises of the 1980s, stubbornly resisted a peso 
devaluation; such an action has become almost traditional in the Mexican 
presidential succession, usually occurring in the final months of a term. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the words of several economists, Salinas this time "left Zedillo 
holding the bag." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also predicted that Zedillo's radical steps may send Mexican 
inflation soaring far beyond the 4% that the government projected last week in 
its budget statement for 1995. They said the rates could go into the 
double-digit levels that plagued Mexico in the years before Salinas brought 
inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to stave off such problems, the government announced an agreement 
Thursday with major employers and unions to freeze wages and prices for 60 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most economists questioned Zedillo's timing and methods to resolve the 
problem of the peso's overvaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Salinas left basically a good situation behind," Ramirez said. "I 
don't think the economy was falling apart, and I don't think it's fair to blame 
Salinas. Even if we had to devalue -- and for some time the Mexican government 
decided to ignore the signals -- it didn't have to be done this way. There were 
many other mechanisms in place. What we have seen is mismanagement. It's very 
bad timing, extremely poor judgment and also some bad luck." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ramirez said he does not expect a jump in inflation. The reason: Few 
Mexicans have enough money to fuel it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night, I got in a taxi from the airport, and after some time I asked the 
driver, 'Why is the city so sad? It's only a few days before Christmas,' " the 
economist recalled. "He said to me, 'You know, people have no money.' So I 
don't think inflation will be a problem."

FIRST LADY CALLED FORCEFUL VOICE FOR TAX CUT STRATEGY; POLICY: SOURCES SAY HER 
ROLE IN DEBATE WAS DECISIVE. IT SHOWS SHE HASN'T LOST CLOUT IN THE CLINTON 
WHITE HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN and JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, brushing aside objections from top 
Administration economic advisers, was a decisive voice in putting middle-class 
tax relief at the top of the White House agenda for the coming year, senior 
Administration sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton's role in the tax cut debate shows that she remains deeply 
involved in substantive policy-making, despite earlier suggestions that she 
would maintain a lower profile after the collapse of the health care plan and 
the Republican sweep of the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton attended critical planning sessions in the weeks leading up to 
the President's Dec. 15 address, in which he unveiled his new "middle-class 
bill of rights." The plan calls for a $60-billion tax cut targeted at 
middle-income voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior officials, none of whom would permit their names to be used, said that 
Mrs. Clinton has been pushing hard for middle-class tax relief at least since 
it became clear late last summer that the Administration's health care proposal 
was going to fail. The First Lady argued that Clinton must redeem his campaign 
promise to cut taxes for the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 Another source noted that Mrs. Clinton not only was an important player in 
devising the package of tax cuts but she helped draft the President's 11-minute 
speech presenting it to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton's influence in the tax cut debate is consistent with what sources 
said is her role as a central participant once again in White House strategy 
sessions on health care, even though responsibility for devising a new, less 
ambitious health care proposal has been shifted from her task force to the 
National Economic Council and the Domestic Policy Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Her broadened policy and political role also reflects in part the President's 
frustration and anger with his outside political advisers. These aides, he is 
said to believe, let him down this fall and helped fuel the GOP electoral 
landslide.  
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that the President's outside political consultants -- including 
James Carville, Paul Begala and Mandy Grunwald -- were excluded from debates 
over the tax plan. Paradoxically, the President's decision to live up to his 
campaign promise to provide middle-class tax relief represents a vindication of 
sorts for those same consultants. They had strongly opposed Clinton's 1993 
decision to abandon his tax-cut pledge and focus on deficit reduction.  
</P>
<P>
 But with the standing of his outside political aides diminished, more weight 
is being accorded to those in the inner sanctum -- Mrs. Clinton, Vice President 
Al Gore, White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta and senior adviser George 
Stephanopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton's behind-the-scenes involvement in policy is at odds with the 
public image that she has been trying to project in recent weeks. Since the 
Nov. 8 Republican landslide, the First Lady's public appearances have been 
limited to more or less ceremonial duties of the sort traditionally assigned to 
the President's wife -- sightseeing in Indonesia during the Asian economic 
summit, lunching with Latin American first ladies at the Miami Summit of the 
Americas, feeding the homeless in Washington at Thanksgiving, and holiday 
entertaining at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 But an aide to Mrs. Clinton cautioned against drawing conclusions from her 
activities of the last several weeks. The aide said that the First Lady's role 
in the second half of the Clinton term has yet to be established and will not 
be determined until the President lays out his priorities in detail in his 
State of the Union address next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In simple terms, the tax cut debate within the White House came down to an 
argument between the President's economic advisers, who believed that the 
President should keep his focus on deficit reduction, and his political aides, 
who argued that Clinton must re-establish his credentials as spokesman for the 
"forgotten middle class." 
</P>
<P>
 Most members of Clinton's economic team were supportive of a smaller proposal, 
crafted by Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, to provide a tax deduction for the 
costs of post-secondary education and training. They believed that plan was 
consistent with Clinton's earlier initiatives to increase federal support for 
"public investments" such as job training, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet with Mrs. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore decisively in the tax-cutting 
camp, along with Stephanopoulos and the President's other key political 
advisers, the final result was inevitable.  
</P>
<P>
 "She definitely favored the political arguments, much more than the economic 
arguments," one senior official said. "Everybody who was in the campaign, 
including the First Lady and the Vice President, felt a longtime commitment to 
doing a tax cut," added one economic adviser.  
</P>
<P>
 And the momentum behind the political argument in favor of a tax cut quickly 
steam-rolled over the economic team. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mrs. Clinton, the battle over the tax plan may prove to be just a prelude 
to her effort to reassert herself more publicly on policy issues.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to get out more," she noted in a recent speech.

ITALIAN PREMIER QUITS; HE HELD POST FOR 7 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET STOBART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Italy's besieged and embittered Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on Thursday 
bowed out of a riches-to-political-rags government that was born with bold 
promises but died in internal dissension after seven frustrating months. 
</P>
<P>
 On a gray afternoon, Berlusconi rode through Christmas traffic up Rome's 
Quirinale hill in his bullet-proof Mercedes-Benz to tender his resignation to 
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel lighter. I have gotten rid of a great weight," Berlusconi told 
reporters when he emerged from the 45-minute meeting in the Renaissance 
Quirinale Palace that has been home to popes and presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, a 58-year-old media tycoon, entered politics in January, promising 
a new deal for Italy after decades of political cronyism underwritten by 
endemic corruption. But the prime minister himself became a target of 
prosecutors, who alleged that, before he entered politics, bribes were paid to 
tax inspectors at his Fininvest media and retail company. Berlusconi denies 
that he knew about them. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last week, Berlusconi's coalition partner, Umberto Bossi, leader of the 
populist Northern League, broke with him and joined the opposition in three 
no-confidence motions. Berlusconi quit to preempt an embarrassing defeat in a 
parliamentary vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of the nation's 53rd postwar government foreshadows a period of 
political uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the lira and the stock market have fallen in recent weeks as Berlusconi's 
right-wing coalition teetered and finally toppled like a dried-out Christmas 
tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalfaro, a former member of the long-ruling but now discredited Christian 
Democrat party, asked Berlusconi to stay on as caretaker until a decision is 
made to form a new government or call elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Today Scalfaro begins a round of consultations with political leaders that 
will end -- probably after Christmas -- in one of three ways: He will ask 
Berlusconi to form a new government, give the task to someone else or call new 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalfaro is believed to think a new government could be formed within the 
existing Parliament, which was elected nine months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi and his neo-fascist allies, the National Alliance, favor new 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked President Scalfaro to call elections as soon as possible, and I also 
suggested a date," Berlusconi told reporters Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Wednesday afternoon, Italians had followed live television 
transmission of the proceedings as government deputies in Parliament heatedly 
traded charges with their erstwhile allies and the opposition. The debate broke 
off abruptly Thursday morning after an impromptu Cabinet meeting, when 
Berlusconi announced that he intended to throw in the towel. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi's coalition -- three right-wing parties, headed by his Forza Italia 
(Go Italy) -- had been under constant pressure since it was installed in May to 
resolve a huge public debt problem, to complete continuing political corruption 
probes and to meet demands that Berlusconi divest his business holdings. Bossi 
was an outspoken critic of Berlusconi on these issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Early this month, a 2 1/2-year-old corruption inquiry by magistrates in Milan 
closed in on Fininvest. Pressing their investigation of payoffs to politicians 
by business people and industrialists in return for government contracts, they 
interrogated Berlusconi. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister loudly protested his innocence, and his lawyers have 
demanded that the case be shelved. But as Berlusconi resigned Thursday, news 
came that his brother Paolo, who heads the Fininvest publishing enterprises, 
was given a seven-month suspended sentence for paying $90,000 in bribes to the 
corruption-tainted Christian Democrat party.  
</P>
<P>
 Italy's latest government was hailed last spring as one that would give 
national politics a fresh start with new faces and new parties, but it crumbled 
in much the same way as its predecessors had. Berlusconi entered politics in a 
successful effort to short-circuit a victory by the left, led by the former 
Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the March elections with promises of a freer market, lower taxes, open 
government and a corruption-free political system. But his government was 
forced to its knees partly by the same political squabbling, unpopular budgets 
and suspicions of corruption that were the hallmark of previous governments.

 During the parliamentary debate, which Berlusconi himself called, the 
beleaguered premier attacked Bossi, accusing him of treachery against the 
government and voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "After being elected with the votes of the Forza Italia voters he has . . . 
betrayed them," he cried angrily in a 25-minute speech. He termed Bossi's 
no-confidence motion "a slap in the face" and "a resounding offense to good 
sense and to the citizens' trust." 
</P>
<P>
 Bossi, for his part, accused the government of fulfilling none of its 
promises, which ranged from the creation of a million new jobs, to the 
privatization of industry, to antitrust and conflict-of-interest laws that 
would have stripped Berlusconi of direct control over his television and 
publishing interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon Berlusconi's resignation, the Northern League split after about two dozen 
of their 100 or so members of Parliament, led by Interior Minister Roberto 
Maroni, decided to support Berlusconi.

GINGRICH INKS A BOOK DEAL FOR $4 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 House Speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), a struggling author whose earlier 
books never got much notice, cashed in on his political success this week by 
landing an estimated $4-million book contract -- and Democrats said they were 
outraged by his sudden good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich and HarperCollins publishers announced Thursday that they have 
concluded a deal for two books, a political manifesto and an anthology of 
writings about democracy. Publishing industry sources said that the value of 
the deal could exceed $4 million when foreign sales are included. 
</P>
<P>
 But White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers and House Majority Whip David E. 
Bonior (D-Mich.) seized on the announcement as a chance to dent Gingrich's 
image as a populist and quickly complained that the deal is unseemly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It raises some questions," Myers said at the White House, asking reporters to 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bonior, in an unusually bare-knuckled attack, charged that Gingrich's 
contract is part of a political deal with Fox television mogul Rupert Murdoch, 
who also controls HarperCollins. The Australian-born Murdoch is under 
investigation by the Federal Communications Commission because of allegations 
that he improperly used foreign capital to buy six U.S. television stations. 
</P>
<P>
 In his most specific charge, Bonior called the contract "a sweetheart deal" 
and charged that Gingrich's House Republicans are planning legislation "that 
will overturn the very law Mr. Murdoch is being accused of violating." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonior offered no evidence of a direct link between Gingrich and Murdoch. But, 
he declared, "if this is not a gift, if there is no quid pro quo, Mr. Gingrich 
ought to tell us" whether any other publisher was willing to offer him $4 
million for the books. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdoch, through a spokesman, said that he had "absolutely no knowledge of 
this deal" until it was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich denied any political fix and shrugged off the attacks. "Conservative 
books sell," he told the Associated Press during a visit to Ohio. "I can't help 
it if liberal books don't sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one lesson of the episode is to dispel any remaining illusions that 
the Age of Gingrich will see much bipartisanship or old-fashioned congressional 
comity among either Democrats or Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just the normal cut and thrust of politics," Gingrich spokesman Tony 
Blankley said. "The Democrats will take shots when they want to." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Gingrich plans to submit the book deal to the House Ethics 
Committee before formally signing a contract with HarperCollins. House rules 
allow members of Congress to receive money for books they write as long as the 
payments come from "established publishers under usual and customary contract 
terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore, for example, has earned more than $700,000 for a book 
on the environment, "Earth in the Balance," that he wrote as a senator. 
However, Gore's contract guaranteed him only $100,000; the rest has come in the 
form of royalties on the book's unexpectedly strong sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonior acknowledged that members of Congress traditionally have been allowed 
to earn income from their books. "But, you know, the question is, is this 
unusual? Is this excessive?" he asked. "My God, it's an incredible amount of 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a normal book deal," Gingrich spokesman Blankley replied. "It was a 
complete arm's-length transaction. . . . There were several publishers bidding 
actively." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a publishing industry source said, Gingrich's agents submitted his 
proposal exclusively to HarperCollins several weeks ago and other publishers 
hastily offered bids only after they caught wind of the impending deal. 
</P>
<P>
 HarperCollins, which has enjoyed considerable success with books by 
conservative figures, including former Vice President Dan Quayle, said that it 
plans to print at least 750,000 copies of Gingrich's manifesto -- a gigantic 
number in the publishing world. 
</P>
<P>
 Publishing sources said that the reported $4-million advance for two books is 
large, but not unthinkable or unprecedented for a figure as famous -- and as 
"hot," as book promoters say -- as the new Speaker. Former President Ronald 
Reagan won a contract for $7 million in 1989, although he was out of office at 
the time. The book sold poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 HarperCollins Vice President Jack McKeown said that the Gingrich book, 
tentatively titled, "To Renew America," would allow Americans "to finally hear 
directly from the source what Newt Gingrich has to say." Gingrich has made 
numerous appearances on television since the Republican victory in the Nov. 8 
elections.  
</P>
<P>
 The FCC has been investigating whether Murdoch violated federal law by using 
his Australian holding company, News Corp. Ltd., to acquire six American 
television stations which formed the core of the Fox TV network. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. law prohibits foreign individuals or companies from owning more than 25% 
of a broadcasting station. Murdoch became an American citizen shortly before 
the acquisitions, but News Corp. remained an Australian firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republican members of Congress have proposed abolishing the foreign 
ownership law, arguing that it is an obstacle to a free market in broadcasting. 
If the law were eliminated, Murdoch and News Corp. might still face FCC fines 
for their earlier deals but their right to own the stations presumably no 
longer would be in question. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a spokeswoman for the author of the main Republican proposal, Rep. 
Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio), said that the congressman did not have Murdoch in 
mind when he began working on the idea. And Gingrich's spokesman said that the 
GOP leader has taken no position on the proposed change in the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, President Clinton and other Democrats seemed delighted at a 
chance to take a poke at their conservative nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
 At a farewell ceremony for Myers, who is leaving her job at the White House, 
Clinton feigned wonderment at the $4-million figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I made $36,000 a year for 12 years and was glad of it," he said, 
putting himself on the side of the non-book-writing class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I'd known I didn't have to leave to cash in," Myers said with a laugh. 
</P>

SLAIN OFFICER FOLLOWED HIS LIFE'S CALLING; HEROISM: THOMAS WORLEY, ANGERED 
'WHEN DEFENSELESS PEOPLE ARE VICTIMIZED,' DIED IN SHOOTOUT WITH ROBBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Pam Worley was in line to pay at the register of the Payless ShoeSource when 
ex-convict Jesus Valenzuela burst into the discount store brandishing a 
handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 As the clerks handed over the bills, she crawled outside to her husband, 
off-duty Los Angeles County Safety Police Officer Thomas Worley, who was in the 
crowded parking lot of the strip mall at Topanga Canyon and Roscoe boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 She told her husband the store was being robbed. He grabbed his badge. Worley 
confronted Valenzuela, the two exchanged gunfire and 90 minutes later, both 
were dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew him said Thursday that Worley -- who believed police work was a 
calling, more than just a profession -- was acting in character. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way he wanted to go, if he was going to go," said Jeff Smolek, a 
relative. "He did just what any officer would do." 
</P>
<P>
 Worley was the 11th peace officer to be gunned down in the last year and a 
half in Southern California. And as police, family and friends grappled with 
the shock of events, there was widespread praise for Worley's valor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The funeral has not been set, but we hope to have a full-blown police funeral 
for Officer Worley because we look at him as a hero," said Clifton Williams, 
president of the 400-member Los Angeles County Safety Police Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave his life," Williams said. "Sometimes we don't know why the world is 
like it is. But we had an officer who cared." 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, according to family and friends, was living a dream. He had always 
wanted to be a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Agoura High School, he spent seven years as a policeman 
in the Air Force, rising to the rank of staff sergeant. When he got out, he 
worked as a private security officer. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993, he was accepted into the Safety Police, the sworn officers who 
provide armed security for county facilities, including 59 hospitals and 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 On his application form, according to Williams, Worley wrote: "I like helping 
people, and I don't like when innocent or defenseless people are victimized. I 
feel drawn to law enforcement because of this. I also believe in 'callings.' A 
calling to religious service or medicine. I feel a 'call' to law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Worley graduated from the Rio Hondo police academy in Whittier. 
He was assigned to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, where he worked the 
evening shift. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before the shooting, Worley, 33, filled out an application for a 
deputy's position with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, friends 
said. He also picked up a new swing set for his two children -- Christina, 6, 
and Matthew, 2 -- and helped a friend fix a water heater.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's just the kind of guy he was," said the friend, Wayne Carlin, 34. "I 
didn't need any help with that water heater. But he said, 'No, come on, let me 
help. . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
 Worley was also a hands-on dad, said family and friends.  
</P>
<P>
 "You never saw Tom standing when the kids were here," said Anita Jacquin, Pam 
Worley's mother. "He'd always be on the ground, playing with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew spent Wednesday with his maternal grandparents; Christina was at 
Disneyland with her father's parents. 
</P>
<P>
 As evening fell, Worley picked up his wife from work. To prepare for a full 
night of Christmas shopping, she asked him to stop at Payless so she could buy 
a pair of comfortable shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it," she said Thursday at her mother's Canoga Park apartment. 
"Just to get a pair of shoes, just to wear for a couple of hours." 
</P>
<P>
 As Pam Worley, 29, waited in line about 6:15 p.m. at the cash register, a 
clerk bent down to pick something up from beneath the counter.  
</P>
<P>
 It was then that Jesus Mario Valenzuela, 44, of Canoga Park walked up and 
pointed a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Worley said she ducked down onto all fours and crawled outside to her 
husband, who was in the parking lot. "I whispered to him that there was a man 
with a gun," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Worley was carrying his gun, a 9-millimeter Beretta, but dashed to 
their car to grab his badge, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She heard her husband identify himself as an officer. Then Valenzuela fired 
three shots from his .38-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver, police said. "One of 
the rounds struck the badge in Tom's hand," Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
 Another hit Worley in the chest. A third hit his groin. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, Tom had the presence of mind to return fire," Williams said. The 
bullets struck Valenzuela in the chest and the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley "was an excellent marksman," his father, Robert Worley, said Thursday. 
"He prided himself on it. He proved it (Wednesday) night." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Worley was not wearing a bulletproof vest. A firefighter performed CPR 
on the scene, and Worley was taken to Nu-Med Regional Center, less than a block 
away, where he was pronounced dead at 7:40 p.m., according to Daryl Meeks, 
assistant chief of the Safety Police. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect any of this at all," Pam Worley said. Her husband, she said, 
"ran into a lot of bad stuff" at County-USC Hospital, but wore a safety vest 
there.  
</P>
<P>
 As a sworn police officer, Worley was authorized to carry a gun off duty, law 
enforcement officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 And though the parking lot was filled with shoppers, police said the decision 
to return fire appeared reasonable. No one else in the parking lot was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Witnesses say the robber fired first," said Lt. Al Moen, the LAPD homicide 
detective overseeing the investigation. He said that Worley's returning the 
shots appeared to be justified.  
</P>
<P>
 An internal Safety Police investigation into the shootings is also underway, 
Meeks said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela did not appear initially to be badly hurt, witnesses said. But he 
died at 7:17 p.m. at Northridge Hospital Medical Center from internal bleeding. 
A bullet had pierced his liver. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, who would have turned 45 on Christmas Day, had three prior robbery 
convictions and was a veteran of state prison, according to officials at the 
state Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers recovered $350 from Valenzuela, but it was not clear Thursday how 
much of that was taken from the shoe store, Moen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you only wanted to know one person in your life," said Carlin, Worley's 
friend, "Tom was the sort of person you'd want to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Police announced the creation of a fund for the two children Thursday. 
Tax-deductible donations may be sent to LAC-USC Foundation, Thomas Worley Fund, 
1200 N. State St., Room 1112, Los Angeles 90033.

RUSSIAN ARMY WAVERS; BOMBS POUND GROZNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The deputy commander of Russia's ground forces resigned Thursday rather than 
take over the 12-day-old assault on Chechnya -- a war that reached a bloody 
apogee with the first daylight bombing of the rebel republic's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses in Grozny, the center of Chechen resistance, said they counted at 
least two dozen bodies after a day of indiscriminate artillery fire and bombs 
that at one point fell every 30 seconds. An American photographer is among the 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid reports of a broad shake-up of the Russian Defense Ministry, the 
government confirmed that Gen. Eduard A. Vorobyov had refused to take command 
of the army's stalled, dissent-riven campaign to disarm Chechnya's few thousand 
irregular fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an act of a general who doesn't want to soil his tunic with an 
immoral deed," said Sergei Yushenkov, chairman of the Russian Parliament's 
Defense Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear when or if Vorobyov's resignation would be accepted, but it 
was the most serious of many signs of insubordination that have slowed the 
Kremlin's plan to choke off Grozny with 10,000 or more troops. Dissent on the 
ground has apparently prompted Russia's high command to attack from the air for 
four days in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The result Thursday was the bloodiest since the Russians rolled tanks across 
their southern border with this tiny Muslim republic Dec. 11 to try to end its 
three years of self-declared independence. Television images and other reports 
from Grozny offered scenes of carnage on snow-covered streets. 
</P>
<P>
 A dead man's charred body sat inside his burned car, his hands clutching the 
wheel. Three corpses, one headless, lay on Red Front Street near the 
presidential palace beside a truck and four cars wrecked by a single blast. A 
woman raised her hands in prayer over a dying man in a park as black smoke rose 
against the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who are they trying to kill?" Larisa Vozlublennaya, a wailing Russian 
resident of Grozny, asked an Associated Press reporter outside her shattered 
apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people died when they rushed to witness the damage and help the 
wounded after an air strike on a residential neighborhood. The plane that had 
delivered the strike quickly returned and bombed the crowd, journalists 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those killed by the second bomb was Cynthia Elbaum, a 28-year-old 
free-lance photographer from New York City who was based in Moscow. She was the 
first journalist to die since the Russian offensive began. 
</P>
<P>
 While civilians ran for cover or fled to the countryside, Russian forces were 
seen edging their artillery guns closer to Grozny, and Chechen fighters were 
offering little resistance. Chechen antiaircraft guns, running low on 
ammunition or out of it, were reported silent for a second straight day. 
</P>
<P>
 A Russian government statement, denying witness accounts on the ground, 
insisted that Russian planes did not bomb Grozny. It claimed that Chechen 
fighters were simulating air attacks by blowing up their own buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Dzhokar M. Dudayev, the Chechen president, appeared on television to 
denounce "the Satanic methods of Russia." He repeated his offer to negotiate 
with the Kremlin "without preconditions" but added: "It is better to die in a 
holy war than be turned into a slave." 
</P>
<P>
 As outrage against the bombings mounted in Russia, President Boris N. Yeltsin 
rejected an appeal to appear Saturday before a joint session of Parliament. The 
Itar-Tass news agency said he was working on a peace proposal and would address 
the nation within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 The offensive, Moscow's largest since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan 15 
years ago, has divided the government and the armed forces. Opinion polls 
report most Russians oppose it. Support outside official circles has come 
mainly from the ultranationalist right. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its overwhelming numbers and the disorganization of Chechen 
resistance, the Russian army is wavering. At least one field commander has 
refused to advance on Grozny. Others have criticized the hastily assembled 
campaign for its poor coordination among army, airborne and Interior Ministry 
units whose officers had never before worked together. Sixty Russian soldiers 
have died in the fighting, according to Russian television. 
</P>
<P>
 The government denied reports by Tass and the RIA news agency, which have 
privileged access to military headquarters, that Defense Minister Pavel S. 
Grachev had taken personal command of the offensive and dismissed five senior 
generals, including his top deputy, Georgy Kondratyev. 
</P>
<P>
 Grachev was in the Russian city of Mozdok, the operation headquarters, 
reportedly meeting with three of the officers he did or did not fire: Alexei 
Mityukhin, Vladimir Chirindin and Vladimir Potapov -- the top leadership of the 
North Caucasus Military District, which has been running the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavel Felgenhauer, well-informed defense correspondent for the Moscow 
newspaper Sevodnya, said he could not confirm the dismissals but commented that 
the war is entering a critical phase. 
</P>
<P>
 "The motley Chechen units, which do not have any knowledge of modern warfare, 
and the Russian army, which does not really want to fight, have come together 
for the battle for Grozny, and no one can tell what will come of it," he wrote. 
"After a long sequence of defeats and humiliations, beginning in Afghanistan, 
the Russian army has reached a point where it might simply refuse to obey 
orders."

WET CHRISTMAS A POSSIBILITY FOR SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in more than a decade, Orange County residents may have a 
rainy Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said there is a 20% to 30% chance of showers starting Christmas 
Eve and continuing through Christmas afternoon. The last time it rained on 
Christmas in Southern California was 1983, said Curtis Brack, a meteorologist 
with WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a storm pushing in from Alaska, but it's not terribly strong," Brack 
said. "By the time storms get here from Alaska, they usually don't have too 
much of a cold push." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, temperatures throughout the holiday weekend will range from 
the mid-40s to the mid-70s, Brack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said that Santa Barbara and Ventura counties are expected to be 
hit by the first wave of the storm Saturday morning. In Los Angeles, the chance 
of rain over the weekend was put at 30% to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 In an average year, there is a one in four chance of rain on Christmas Day, 
Brack said. Another storm on the horizon is expected to arrive Tuesday, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday travelers should allow extra time because of the rain, especially if 
they are flying. This year, more than 300,000 people are expected to fly into 
or out of John Wayne Airport, an increase of 20,000 over last year, airport 
spokeswoman Pat Ware said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brack advised people over the holiday weekend to "drive safely and watch out 
for drunk drivers on wet roads." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol will increase its staffing over the weekend to 
assist drivers and arrest those under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP spokesman Glen Dominguez said that anyone driving in the rain should 
reduce speed and allow for extra space between cars. In anticipation of a 
storm, he said, motorists should perform basic maintenance checks -- such as 
inspecting tire treads and windshield wipers.

NAVAL NEST; STATION AN IMPORTANT SANCTUARY FOR BIRDS OF PREY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 The bait was set. A small wire cage containing a mouse and a sparrow sat in a 
field, easily seen by any of the sharp-eyed red-tailed hawks in a nearby grove 
of eucalyptus trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 20 minutes, one of the large birds swooped in for a late breakfast and 
was snared. 
</P>
<P>
 An elated biologist, Pete Bloom, had one more startled young bird to measure, 
weigh and hold firmly, carefully avoiding its sharp talons while he wrapped an 
aluminum identification band around its leg. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 116th red-tailed hawk that Bloom had banded and the 221st he had 
counted this season at the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloom, who is under contract with the Navy to identify and count all birds of 
prey that utilize the 5,000 acres of marsh and uplands, works even after 
sunset, searching the night skies and fields with spotlights for owls. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey is part of a joint effort by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and 
the Navy to protect and enhance wildlife in the undeveloped part of the 
military facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides warehousing weapons, the site is an important winter destination and 
rest stop for southbound birds of prey along their migratory flight path 
between the Arctic Circle and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, biologists have aided a resurgence of endangered shorebird 
species at the station by controlling predators and providing a man-made island 
and floating nests. 
</P>
<P>
 They also want to increase the numbers of hawks, owls and other birds of prey 
that hunt in the station's expansive uplands that shoulder the marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Off-limits to the public and protected from development, Bloom said the large 
expanse of open space at the station is "an incredibly significant resource 
that supports several species of raptors that are almost absent in the rest of 
Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 And it is increasingly essential to migratory birds, he added, as other 
wetlands and open spaces fall to development along the western coast of North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Birds that are migrating south along the Pacific Flyway have no safe place to 
land and catch a meal in the 30 miles between the Santa Monica Mountains and 
Seal Beach," Bloom said. "The most important aspect of the Seal Beach Naval 
Weapons Station is that it is protected and will remain a sanctuary."  
</P>
<P>
 Bloom said one of his most surprising findings is that the uplands provide a 
winter home to the highest density of red-tailed hawks in North America. The 
booming population of red-tailed hawks reflects an exceptional breeding year 
for the birds throughout California, Oregon and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The hawks, 90% of which were fledged last spring, are attracted to the base, 
Bloom said, by an abundance of ground squirrels and gophers that inhabit the 
burrow-pocked fields and offer good eating. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloom has found 20 species of birds of prey on the base, including eight pairs 
of burrowing owls, a once-common inhabitant of Orange County that has been 
decimated outside the Naval Weapons Station by development. "This is where they 
are making their last stand," Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the winter, the base is visited by a growing number of peregrine falcons, a 
bird of prey on the federal and state endangered species list. This fall and 
winter Bloom expects that at least 100 peregrines will stop at the base on 
their winter migration to feast on smaller shorebirds. 
</P>
<P>
 The peregrine population is starting to rebound nationwide because of a 
reduction in the use of agricultural pesticides and because of successful 
breeding efforts, Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
 While birds of prey inhabit the uplands, the marsh is filled with shorebirds 
and water fowl, including large flocks of Canada geese. The geese drop in this 
time of year to feed on leftover lima beans from harvests on nearby fields that 
the Navy leases to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 155 bird species use the Navy station, said Rodd Kelsey, a biologist 
who works for the Navy and oversees protection of wildlife on the base. Among 
his challenges, he said, is dealing with barn owls that raise their young 
inside some of the storage buildings.  
</P>
<P>
 Another of Kelsey's responsibilities, he said, is making certain that those 
who farm on the base do not endanger the birds by using pesticides or by 
exterminating rodents that the birds depend on for their diet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Credit for a significant local comeback of two bird species, the California 
least tern and light-footed clapper rail, both of which are listed as 
endangered, is given to the Fish and Wildlife Service, which since 1972 has 
operated about 1,000 acres of marshland on the base as a national wildlife 
refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the least tern population at the station dwindled to only five in 
1983, Kelsey said last spring biologists counted 198 pairs nesting on a 
man-made island that is surrounded with electric fencing to protect the terns' 
eggs from opossum, skunks, hawks and other predators. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Mitchell, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist at the weapons 
station refuge, said there has been an even more dramatic rebound of 
light-footed clapper rails, which over the last eight years have multiplied at 
the refuge from 10 birds to 150. 
</P>
<P>
 Artificial, floating nests have been provided to encourage the birds to breed 
on the water -- out of the reach of skunks and opossums.  
</P>
<P>
 Most important, Mitchell said, the Fish and Wildlife Service between 1986 and 
1993 trapped and removed about 300 red fox, a non-native species of fox with a 
wide-ranging appetite that had been thriving on the endangered birds at the 
weapons station. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an ecosystem coming back into order," Bloom said.

GROUP FILES NO-FAULT INITIATIVE; INSURANCE: DRIVERS WOULD COLLECT FROM THEIR 
OWN INSURERS REGARDLESS OF BLAME. SECOND PROPOSAL BY COALITION WOULD LIMIT 
LAWYERS' CONTINGENCY FEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Backers of last year's abortive campaign for "pay-at-the-pump" auto insurance 
filed ballot initiatives Thursday to create the nation's first "pure" no-fault 
auto insurance system in California and to limit contingency fees of 
plaintiffs' lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said the no-fault proposal, in which motorists collect from their 
own insurers regardless of blame, is intended to reduce auto insurance rates by 
squeezing fraud and excessive legal and medical fees out of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 The other measure, they said, would encourage quick settlements of legal 
disputes. It would also allow consumers to keep more of the settlement money by 
capping their lawyers' fees at 15% of an early settlement offer if a case does 
not go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The two initiatives, aimed for the March, 1996, election, are supported by a 
coalition that includes financial journalist Andrew Tobias, Silicon Valley 
software publisher Tom Proulx and Voter Revolt, the organization that sponsored 
Proposition 103, the 1988 insurance rate-cutting initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harvey Rosenfield, who founded Voter Revolt and spearheaded the 
Proposition 103 campaign, denounced the two new initiatives as anti-consumer 
and accused their sponsors of cynically using the Voter Revolt name to imply 
that the measures have grass-roots support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the no-fault system would deprive even the most seriously injured 
people of the right to full compensation," said Rosenfield, who is no longer 
connected with Voter Revolt. The fee-limiting measure will discourage lawyers 
from taking complex cases involving product liability or personal injury, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The no-fault proposal would require all motorists to carry personal injury 
insurance to cover their own and their passengers' medical expenses and lost 
wages resulting from any accident, regardless of who caused it. Organizers 
expect that most drivers would insure themselves for $1 million. But to make 
coverage affordable to lower-income drivers, motorists would be required to buy 
only $50,000 in coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Since motorists would recover all costs from their own insurers, lawsuits 
against other drivers would be prohibited except when a driver was convicted of 
intentionally causing an accident or driving while drunk, while on drugs or 
while committing a felony. Therefore, it would be unnecessary for motorists to 
buy insurance to cover collisions with the uninsured, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal "would cut insurance premiums dramatically by cutting out the 
lawyers, cutting out the uninsured motorist subsidy and cutting out the 
incentive to submit phony claims," Tobias said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobias championed last year's pay-at-the-pump proposal, under which motorists 
would have automatically received insurance coverage through an extra gasoline 
tax. That plan also contained no-fault provisions. He dropped it in the face of 
insurer opposition and consumer skepticism about its cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Trial Lawyers Assn., a traditional foe of no-fault, contested 
the money-saving claim. Association President Wayne McClean said studies have 
shown that no-fault "does not reduce premiums." 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Snyder, co-director of the Consumers Union in the western states, said 
of the fee-limiting measure: "The way this was drafted means poor people get 
poor lawyers." The 15% limit on plaintiffs' lawyers "means that good lawyers 
will work for the defense," where they are paid by the hour and not on 
contingency. 
</P>
<P>
 Gathering the signatures to place the questions on the ballot will begin early 
next year and will cost about $1.2 million, Proulx said. Depending on the level 
of opponents' spending, the ensuing campaign could cost many millions.

RAIN POSSIBLE, ON CHRISTMAS, FORECASTERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A storm swooping in from the Gulf of Alaska may dampen holiday spirits 
throughout Southern California this weekend -- and raises the possibility that 
the area will experience its first wet Christmas in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, it looks like there will be rain on Christmas, at least a 
chance of it," said Curtis Brack, a meteorologist at WeatherData, which 
provides forecasts for The Times. "It doesn't look like a terribly heavy storm. 
The heaviest rains will come over the mountains." 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said Santa Barbara and Ventura counties are expected to be hit by 
the first wave of the storm beginning Saturday morning. In Los Angeles, the 
chance of rain over the weekend was put at 30% to 40%, with scattered showers 
beginning Saturday afternoon and lasting through midday Sunday. Further south, 
forecasters say the chance of showers drops off in Orange County to 20% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Brack said that in an average year there is a one-in-four chance of rain on 
Christmas Day. The last time it rained on Christmas Day was 1983 when 1.16 
inches fell at the Civic Center. The last time it rained on Christmas Eve was 
1988, when 0.87 of an inch was measured. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the anticipated rain could range from about half an inch along 
the coast to an inch in the mountains, with snow likely above the 7,000-foot 
level. The storm is expected to usher in a cold front with temperatures dipping 
into the 40s in Los Angeles. Temperatures are not expected to drop below 
freezing except in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Another storm is expected to arrive Tuesday, Brack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brack advised motorists during the holiday weekend to "drive safely and watch 
out for drunk drivers on wet roads." 
</P>
<P>
 During the holiday weekend, the California Highway Patrol will increase 
staffing to assist motorists and apprehend those driving under the influence of 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP spokesman Glen Dominguez said that anyone driving in the rain should be 
careful to reduce speed and allow for extra space between cars. In anticipation 
of a storm, he said, motorists should perform basic maintenance checks -- such 
as inspecting tire treads and windshield wipers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smooth steering, smooth acceleration and smooth braking is the rule," he 
said. "Drivers should be cautious not to make abrupt movements, because that is 
what causes you to lose control."

CANCER RESEARCHERS FIND UNIQUE ENZYME IN TUMORS; HEALTH: TELOMERASE ALLOWS 
DISEASED CELLS TO PROLIFERATE, STUDY SAYS. IT MAY HOLD KEY TO BETTER 
ANTI-CANCER DRUGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a finding that opens the door to the development of less toxic, more 
effective anti-cancer drugs, and perhaps to new drugs to prevent aging, 
researchers at a Northern California company have discovered that virtually all 
human tumors contain a unique enzyme that blocks the biological clocks of tumor 
cells, allowing them to grow and proliferate virtually forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Normal cells, which do not contain the enzyme, lose a little bit of their DNA 
every time they divide, weakening them and eventually forcing replication to 
grind to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the presence of the newly discovered enzyme, called telomerase, the DNA 
of tumor cells is refreshed and renewed with every division, liberating them 
from the normal aging process. 
</P>
<P>
 The occurrence of the enzyme in ovarian cancer cells was reported earlier this 
year, but that report was greeted with some skepticism, said molecular 
biologist Al Rabson of the National Cancer Institute. Now a team at Geron Corp. 
in Menlo Park reports today in the journal Science what Rabson calls "much more 
impressive evidence" that telomerase is present in virtually every human tumor 
they studied. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has already identified several chemicals that block the action of 
telomerase and hopes to begin testing them in people within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage of this approach, researchers said, is that most human cells do 
not contain the enzyme and thus would be immune to any effects of the 
inhibitors. Furthermore, because the unusual enzyme seems to be present in 
nearly all tumors, any agent that could incapacitate the enzyme would work, 
theoretically, in all types of cancer.  
</P>
<P>
 "This has got the properties you'd be looking for in a magic bullet," said 
molecular biologist Huber Warner of the National Institute on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, if researchers could induce healthy cells to begin manufacturing 
the enzyme, it might retard the aging process, particularly in highly 
vulnerable cells such as those in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is certainly a finding that will stimulate a great deal of interest in 
researchers studying the basic biology of aging, as well as cancer," said 
gerontologist Richard Hodis, director of the National Institute on Aging. "Long 
term, our best hope for (halting aging) will depend on a better understanding 
of the biology of these systems." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists have long known that mammalian cells, unlike those of 
microorganisms, have a finite lifetime. When researchers attempt to grow them 
in the lab, the cells replicate about 60 times before they mysteriously die 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies by a variety of researchers, especially biologist Elizabeth H. 
Blackburn of UC Berkeley, have shown that the key to immortality in 
microorganisms is a long fragment of DNA, called a telomere, that sits on the 
end of each cell's chromosomes like the tip of a shoelace. Chromosomes are 
packets of DNA that contain the blueprint for reproducing an organism, and 
researchers now believe that telomeres keep the DNA stable, just like the tip 
keeps the shoelace from fraying. 
</P>
<P>
 The telomere represents a kind of bookkeeping device that controls aging. Each 
time a cell replicates, a fragment of the telomere is broken off and lost. When 
the whole telomere is gone, the chromosome breaks down and the cell dies. 
Microorganisms were found to have an enzyme -- telomerase -- that replaced the 
broken-off fragments, allowing the cells to continue thriving forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's paper in Science now shows that virtually all human tumors contain the 
enzyme as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a gorgeous example of a case where you begin with basic research on a 
microorganism and it turns out to have profound implications for human 
disease," Rabson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new study, researchers at Geron and the University of Texas 
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas used a new, highly sensitive test to show 
that telomerase was present in 98 of 100 human tumor cell lines grown in the 
laboratory and in 90 of 101 tissue samples from 12 types of human tumors. 
Conversely, the enzyme was not present in all 22 healthy cell lines grown in 
the laboratory and in all 50 biopsy samples that proved to be healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "These findings provide the strongest evidence to date that telomerase is 
linked to cell immortality and cancer," said molecular biologist Calvin B. 
Harley, a Geron vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Geron was formed two years ago specifically to take advantage of discoveries 
involving telomerase, and the research has been supported by $30 million in 
venture capital. Scientists are now isolating chemicals that block the action 
of telomerase. Such drugs would not kill tumor cells directly, but would halt 
their growth and render them more susceptible to attack by conventional 
chemotherapy.

U.S. TO REVIEW MAN'S FATAL SHOOTING NEAR WHITE HOUSE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: DEATH OF 
THE FORMER ANAHEIM RESIDENT RAISES QUESTIONS OF EXCESSIVE FORCE THAT MAY HAVE 
BEEN USED BY POLICE TO SUBDUE HIM.

<P>
 The Justice Department, reflecting government concern about questions of 
excessive force by U.S. Park Police, said Thursday that it will review the 
shooting death of a man who brandished a knife in front of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal section of the department's civil rights division does not 
usually get involved in potential brutality cases at such an early stage, but 
chief department spokesman Carl Stern said that representatives of the division 
and of U.S. Atty. Eric H. Holder Jr.'s office agreed to review an investigation 
of the matter conducted by the Metropolitan Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Anaheim resident Marcelino Corniel, 33, the knife-wielding man shot 
Tuesday in the abdomen and right leg, died Wednesday night after undergoing two 
lengthy surgical procedures at George Washington University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions were raised after a videotape of the incident, broadcast repeatedly 
on television here, showed Corniel standing still in front of a ring of Park 
Police and Secret Service officers on Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White 
House. He fell to the sidewalk as he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 However, an affidavit by FBI agent Scott M. Salter, filed in connection with 
federal charges against Corniel on Wednesday, described him carrying a large 
knife in his left hand and pursuing a Park Police officer shortly before he was 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Milton Grimes, a Newport Beach attorney who said that he would investigate 
Corniel's death at the request of Corniel's family, said: "It appears to me 
that he was not physically able to pose a threat to a kindergartner, much less 
a police officer. . . . It looks as though there was excessive force." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Salter's affidavit, throughout which Corniel's name is misspelled, 
said that Park Police Officer Stephen J. O'Neill observed him in Lafayette 
Park, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, about 6:30 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Corniel was sitting on blankets with four cups of McDonald's coffee, the 
affidavit said, and O'Neill, recognizing him as a regular visitor to the park, 
"acknowledged" him and continued to make his rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 About half an hour later, O'Neill assumed his foot patrol assignment on the 
sidewalk directly in front of the White House and minutes later "observed a 
sudden movement from Lafayette Park which caught his attention," Salter's 
affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill saw Corniel running toward him, holding "a large knife in his left 
hand. O'Neill ordered Corniel to stop and then ran to the east, away from 
Corniel, toward where he knew there were U.S. Secret Service Uniform Division 
officers stationed. Corniel pursued O'Neill, chasing him at a close distance." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill called for help on his radio and, after running 150 feet, was joined 
by Secret Service officers and another Park Police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, Corniel stopped and he was confronted by O'Neill and the other 
officers, who ordered him to drop the knife and then ordered him to lie on the 
ground," Salter's affidavit said. Corniel refused both orders and "was then 
shot twice by one of the other officers" who had joined O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 He then was disarmed and taken to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers said: "Obviously we're saddened by 
anybody being killed in a random act of violence. It again underscores the 
nature of violence in our society and that nobody is immune."

 Myers would not be drawn into a discussion of the propriety of the incident. 
"I'm certainly not going to stand here and second-guess the decision of a law

comments of other FBI agents as well as officers of the Park Police, Secret 
Service and Washington Metropolitan Police.

 A landlord may not impose his morality on tenants by refusing to rent to 
unmarried couples, a judge ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Jasniowski illegally discriminated against Benson Rushing and Mary Tews on 
the basis of their marital status when he refused to rent them an apartment, 
Cook County Circuit Judge Aaron Jaffee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One cannot impose one's moral or religious beliefs on a tenant," Jaffee said. 
"A landlord has a right to exercise religious freedom, but landlords' freedom 
of religion does not mean that tenants must practice the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Jasniowski refused to rent the apartment because, he said, "I have a problem 
with the conduct of fornication." 
</P>
<P>
 Jasniowski rents out a single apartment above his motor-repair business in a 
building owned by his mother. He says his religious convictions cannot allow 
his property to be used for "immoral purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Jasniowski said the couple originally told him that they were married but 
could not produce a marriage certificate. Jasniowski said he refused to rent to 
them because they were not married and because they had lied. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1992, Rushing and Tews filed a complaint with the Chicago Commission 
on Human Relations, charging that Jasniowski had discriminated against them. 
</P>
<P>
 City ordinance and state law prohibit discrimination on the basis of marital 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission ruled against Jasniowski in May and ordered him to pay $633 in 
damages, a $1 fine and the couple's legal fees, which then totaled $14,000. 
Jasniowski appealed to the court.

JOBLESS MAN IS CHARGED IN SUBWAY EXPLOSION; CRIME: EDWARD J. LEARY, 49, IS 
ARRESTED IN HIS HOSPITAL BED AFTER BEING BURNED BY FIREBOMB. POLICE SAY HE 
PLANNED TO EXTORT MONEY FROM TRANSIT AGENCY.

<P>
 Police arrested a badly burned 49-year-old unemployed computer consultant at 
his hospital bed Thursday and charged him with carrying the firebomb that 
exploded aboard a New York subway train, injuring 45 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they believe that Edward J. Leary was plotting to extort money 
from the city's Transit Authority. After searches of Leary's car, his co-op 
apartments in Brooklyn and his home in Scotch Plains, N.J., authorities charged 
him with enough counts of first-degree assault that if convicted, he will 
remain in a state prison for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation was under way to determine whether Leary may have been 
responsible for another subway firebombing incident six days earlier in Harlem. 
Three teen-agers were badly burned in that incident, and detectives said the 
explosive devices in both cases used similar materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on some of the evidence that has been retrieved . . . it would appear 
that the motive was an extortion scheme, and it has nothing to do with 
terrorism or any international forces," said Police Commissioner William J. 
Bratton. "That is still preliminary. We are still going through some of the 
evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 It was understood that investigators had found a memorandum Leary had written 
to himself outlining future actions, including a draft of an extortion note he 
apparently planned to send. The target was not spelled out. 
</P>
<P>
 Other law enforcement sources said articles on explosives, boxes of batteries, 
copper wires, timers and several canisters of gasoline were found in Leary's 
house in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 The Transit Authority operates the city's 842-mile subway system. 
Investigators were working on the theory that Leary planned an escalating 
campaign of terror to panic passengers and to scare Transit Authority officials 
into paying huge sums of money for subway peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Leary had not made any threats to the Transit Authority, a series of 
firebombings would certainly add credibility to a future extortion demand, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bratton, appearing with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other officials at City 
Hall, said federal authorities and forensic experts found materials in Leary's 
suburban New Jersey home that "are consistent" with both of the devices that 
detonated on subway trains. Leary, who was listed in critical condition with 
burns over 40% of his body, is an unemployed computer technician who was 
working as a consultant.  
</P>
<P>
 In Scotch Plains, neighbors said Leary; his wife, who is a nurse-practitioner; 
and their son had moved into their two-story white frame house about a year ago 
and recently decorated it for Christmas. Other neighbors said they believed 
that Leary became unemployed several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors of Leary's Brooklyn apartments said he apparently had been out of 
work for most of the year and was trying to sell two of the three apartments he 
owns. He lost his most recent job in January when the brokerage firm Merrill 
Lynch & Co. Inc., where he had worked as a senior systems architect, fired him 
for "performance reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Leary appeared to have a sophisticated knowledge of 
electronics. That knowledge, detectives said, sharply contrasted with the 
crudeness of the firebomb he is charged with carrying on the subway -- a jar 
filled with gasoline designed to be detonated by an external timing device. 
</P>
<P>
 The firebomb that flared through the crowded subway car brought both panic and 
heroism. People bolted from the train seeking to escape the flames and smoke, 
and in some of their minds, another bomb -- a report that proved to be 
unfounded. Some riders staggered in flames to a station platform. Disregarding 
danger, other passengers threw themselves upon some of the burning victims, 
smothering the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 As the smoke and flames engulfed the subway car, Leary apparently escaped and 
took another train underneath the East River to the Clark Street Station in 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 There, he approached a transit police officer, James McNamara. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing he said to me was: 'Officer, I need an ambulance.' I looked 
at the condition of this man and he was burned very bad from his knees down. I 
could actually see his toes." 
</P>
<P>
 As police prepared to escort an ambulance carrying Leary to the burn unit of 
the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, officers realized that he fit 
eyewitnesses' description of the suspect in the firebombing. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze aboard the train on Wednesday left a dozen people in New York 
Hospital's burn unit. Four, including Leary, were in critical condition.  
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey officials, who also attended the City Hall news conference, said 
they were reviewing firebombing incidents in the Garden State in an effort to 
link them to Leary. They declined to be specific. 
</P>
<P>
 Manhattan Dist. Atty. Robert M. Morgenthau, who praised the speed and 
efficiency of the investigation, said the minimum charge Leary could face would 
be first-degree assault, carrying a sentence of five to 15 years. But since 
there will be 45 different assault charges -- one for each of the victims -- he 
would spend the rest of his life in prison, if convicted.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A TWA jetliner with 112 passengers on board struck a bird Thursday, ripping a 
two-foot hole in the plane's nose and forcing an emergency landing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boeing 727 bound for St. Louis made a safe landing at Tampa International 
Airport shortly before 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hit a bird of some sort -- apparently a goose," airport spokesman Paul 
MacAlester said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flight 399 originated in Sarasota and the plane was climbing after a stop in 
Ft. Myers when the collision occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Most passengers weren't aware of the collision until they left the plane, but 
a few said they heard a thud. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could hear something happen," Barbara Bowers said. "It was pretty scary."

EUROPE; PRIEST RALLIES POWERFUL TO AID PARIS HOMELESS; FRANCE'S LEADING 
CONSERVATIVES HAVE LEAPED TO JOIN ABBE PIERRE'S LIBERAL CRUSADE WITH EYE TOWARD 
GARNERING LEFTIST VOTES IN COMING PRESIDENTIAL RACE.

<P>
 Next to Pere Noel, the most powerful man in France this week was a small, 
bespectacled, 82-year-old Roman Catholic priest with wiry white whiskers and a 
wooden cane. 
</P>
<P>
 His name is Abbe Pierre, and for 40 years he has been a tireless advocate for 
the poor and the homeless, badgering politicians and imploring the well-heeled 
to do more to help the less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week Pierre had the most important politicians in France leaping to 
join his crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 It began after church Sunday, when the father staged his latest attempt to 
draw attention to the sans abri, people without shelter. He led a group of 
several hundred homeless protesters in a brazen break-in, seizing a vacant 
apartment building in a fancy neighborhood on the Left Bank of the Seine River 
and turning it into their home. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Pierre and his supporters have watched in surprise as the nation's 
most important conservative politicians, their minds fixed on the presidential 
elections next year and the large numbers of left-wing voters without a strong 
candidate, elbow each other for the chance to help him. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, a front-runner in the presidential campaign, 
despite his as-yet-undeclared candidacy, welcomed a squatter delegation to his 
lush, cavernous office, where he promised them that the police will not try to 
eject them from their new apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 That put the problem squarely in the lap of Balladur's chief rival for the 
presidency, Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be outdone, Chirac went on national television to declare the situation 
facing the homeless "unbearable." And he promised to begin enforcing a 1945 law 
that allows the city to take privately owned vacant buildings and use them, 
temporarily, to house the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbe Pierre wasn't convinced. While Balladur was "a man with whom dialogue is 
possible," the priest predicted that Chirac would either renege on his promise 
or carry it out dishonestly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen him (Chirac) in action before," Pierre said. "Once is enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The newspapers of Paris have not failed to notice that the announcement by 
Chirac, a champion of business interests and virulent opponent of wealth 
redistribution, represented an about-face. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberation, the left-leaning Paris daily, sneered at the mayor's political 
"conversion." "To squash Balladur, Chirac is ready to do anything, even to 
throw everything he's done for the past 20 years into a sack in the Seine," 
Liberation said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, though, it is Abbe Pierre who has emerged as the consummate 
politician. The occupation of the apartment building, which had been set for 
demolition, was a ploy that homeless advocates had used before, with modest 
success. But this time, the timing could not have been better. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the country is awash in the warm, generous feelings of the Yuletide. 
But more than that, the campaign for retiring President Francois Mitterrand's 
job has reached a crucial juncture, just four months before the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacques Delors, the Socialist Party stalwart who had been leading all 
contenders in the polls, decided two weeks ago not to run for the presidency. 
That left the devastated Socialists with no strong alternative candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 So the race now is between Balladur and Chirac, like-minded men from the same 
conservative party. If, as expected, the two emerge as the top vote-getters in 
the first round of elections in April, they will need votes from the left to 
win the runoff in May. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The man playing all this like his own Christmas tune is Pierre, a man 
sometimes called the Mother Teresa of Paris. Born Henri Groues, he adopted the 
nom de guerre Abbe Pierre, or Father Pierre, when he joined the French 
Resistance during the Nazi occupation of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, Pierre served briefly in Parliament, using his salary to help 
the poor. He rose to fame on Feb. 1, 1954, when he launched a public appeal for 
money to help the homeless after the death from exposure of a woman who had 
been evicted from her Paris apartment for not paying rent. Today, opinion polls 
consistently list him as the person the French most admire. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of the homeless has been growing in France, where more than 3 
million people are jobless. Social service agencies estimate that as many as 
400,000 people are homeless and 2.4 million more are "poorly housed," squeezed 
into the homes of friends or family. And Paris has more than 100,000 vacant 
apartments, homeless advocates say.

ASIA; TEEN-AGE SUICIDES SHED LIGHT ON BRUTAL BULLYING IN JAPAN 
</P>

 "Grandmother, please live a long life. Father, thank you for the trip to 
Australia. Mother, thank you for the delicious meals. I wanted to live longer, 
but . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, Kiyoteru Okouchi slipped a rope around his neck and hanged himself 
from a back-yard tree. 
</P>
<P>
 He was all of 13. 
</P>
<P>
 His suicide last month rocked Japan and set off a public uproar over the 
phenomenon that caused him to take his own life: the dark, increasingly brutal 
practice of youth bullying. 
</P>
<P>
 In his poignant suicide letter, Okouchi described three years of torment at 
the hands of four classmates. All told, they extorted more than $10,000 from 
him, most of which he stole from his parents; they beat him, dunked his head in 
a nearby river and disdainfully called him "No. 1 Errand Boy." 
</P>
<P>
 On the day that Okouchi could not scrape up the $400 they demanded, he decided 
to die. Until his suicide, he never divulged his secret, even when his worried 
father pointedly asked him if he was being bullied and taking money. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the three weeks since the shocking case came to light, at least three 
other teen-age victims of bullying have killed themselves by hanging. 
</P>
<P>
 Okouchi's school in Aichi prefecture in western Japan has been deluged with 
furious phone calls and letters, blaming teachers for not detecting or stopping 
the problem. In a media blitz, the Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's leading 
newspapers, ran 195 articles or letters to the editor on school bullying in 
December alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has reached Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, who recently urged his 
ministers to tackle the problem until it was "thoroughly eliminated." The 
Education Ministry, calling an emergency meeting of all prefectural school 
chiefs for the first time ever, is proposing a $4-million counseling program. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullying and youth suicides, of course, occur in every country. 
</P>
<P>
 And, at least officially in Japan, the problem is declining. 
</P>
<P>
 School suicides have actually decreased to one-third the levels of the peak 
year of 1979 -- with 139 recorded in 1993. Incidents of bullying showed a 
slight increase only in high schools, with a decline in elementary schools and 
little change in middle schools, according to government figures. 
</P>
<P>
 But what seems to have struck a public nerve in Okouchi's case was his 
heart-rending suicide letter, the bullies' brazen demands for cash and their 
lack of remorse. When made to apologize to Okouchi's parents, some of the 
bullies blurted out that they had enjoyed tormenting the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say that, even if the number of incidents is dropping, their 
viciousness is escalating. 
</P>
<P>
 In one high school in Tokyo's neighboring prefecture of Saitama, bullies first 
threw eggs at one boy, then put a bucket over his head; they knifed his gym 
clothes and finally broke into his dormitory, slashed his chair and splashed 
urine throughout his room. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current bullying is a violent game leading to death," said Mamoru 
Tsuchiya, a Kyoto psychiatrist who wrote a book about the bullying of his 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 In a national case of soul-searching, the Japanese are groping for clues about 
why their children have outbursts of such dark impulses. Common reasons cited 
are too much educational competition, too little play, weakening ties between 
young and old, and a breakdown of family and community. 
</P>
<P>
 But psychologist Masao Miyamoto said the problem is not limited to children. 
Unlike other countries, where most children eventually outgrow bullying, it 
remains an accepted practice among adults here as a way to "force the logic of 
the group on others" by picking on those who stand out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many here seem to believe that the problem of bullying can't be solved without 
tackling broader social practices. And with Japan showing little sign of 
relaxing academic competition, changing group values or returning to the small 
communities of the past, some worry that the problem will be difficult to stamp 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Kiyoteru Okouchi said he had lost the energy to persevere. "There 
were so many things I still wanted to do," he wrote. "If it weren't for this, I 
think I could have lived happily forever."

75,000 EVACUATED AS MEXICAN VOLCANO RUMBLES; LATIN AMERICA: RESIDENTS OF 16 
VILLAGES FLEE AMID FEARS OF AN IMMINENT ERUPTION. NEW PERIL COMES AMID OTHER 
NATIONAL CRISES.

 Fearing an imminent eruption of the Popocatepetl volcano outside this nation's 
capital, the army and civil defense forces Thursday began emergency evacuation 
of 75,000 residents from 16 villages, as President Ernesto Zedillo's government 
struggled with a series of economic, political -- and now, natural -- crises 
just three weeks into its term. 
</P>
<P>
 With hundreds of other troops and riot police moving deeper into the mountains 
in the southernmost state of Chiapas, where Indian rebels took over dozens of 
villages in a peaceful one-day insurrection on Monday, Zedillo was forced to 
call on the army again in Mexico City: Experts determined that a towering plume 
of black smoke from Popocatepetl on Wednesday could herald a major eruption of 
the 17,887-foot mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities were on alert, preparing to implement a sweeping emergency plan 
for the region after 5,000 tons of ash coated dozens of villages in the state 
of Puebla, east of the capital, throughout the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's National Center for Disaster Prevention announced that a minor quake 
followed underground explosions Wednesday that were so intense they melted the 
snow on the peaks of the mountain known here as "Popo." 
</P>
<P>
 The blast of smoke and ash followed weeks of intense seismic activity inside 
Popo, which last erupted in 1947. U.S. and Mexican scientists have expressed 
increasing concern that the volcano was becoming dangerously active, and 
environmental groups have sharply criticized the government for failing to 
prepare nearby residents for their evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of an eruption that could endanger millions of Mexicans came 
against the backdrop of brewing economic and political disasters that are 
already testing Zedillo's government. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a month into a term that Zedillo vowed would usher in historic 
change, the 42-year-old economist and his young government are defending 
themselves not merely on natural-disaster preparedness but also on their 
handling of the Chiapas troubles and an ensuing financial crisis that Zedillo 
asserts is related. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo's financial advisers performed radical surgery on the Mexican economy 
late Wednesday night, allowing the nation's currency to float freely against 
the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a speech to economists, the president made an effort to justify the 
peso's free-fall as economic medicine needed for long-term stability -- 
although it will likely trigger higher inflation, cuts in spending power and 
continuing financial instability well into 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same speech, Zedillo took pains to defend his Chiapas policy and 
explain how the two are linked. 
</P>
<P>
 "There cannot be economic stability if there is no political stability," he 
said, conceding that his government must redouble efforts to negotiate a 
peaceful solution to the conflict in the embattled state, which began last Jan. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 But the president took no additional action on the uprising by the Zapatista 
National Liberation Army and its peasant supporters. He simply repeated his 
commitment to a proposed legislative peace commission to negotiate a political 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming less than a week before Christmas, the series of crises intensified 
public criticism of Zedillo, who was shown to have 58% of popular support in 
public opinion polls just a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Merry Christmas????" said the headline on an editorial in the independent 
daily Reforma on Thursday. The newspaper sharply questioned Zedillo's political 
skills and his timing in permitting the radical peso devaluation within days of 
one of this overwhelmingly Catholic nation's most important holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Signaling that the president's brief honeymoon with the Mexican press may be 
nearing its end, the same editorial page carried a cartoon illustrating what 
several analysts said was increasing dissatisfaction with the new 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In a clear poke at Zedillo's Chiapas strategy, the cartoon shows a frantic 
bureaucrat in coat and tie, pointing at Popo and shouting to the president, 
"Sir, Popocatepetl is threatening to explode." 
</P>
<P>
 A pensive Zedillo, drawn in enormous wire-rim glasses with hand on chin, 
responds, "We'll form a commission and ask it what it wants."

 The Canadian government stepped into the potentially incendiary area of 
cultural trade protectionism Thursday, announcing a steep new tax aimed at 
preventing American magazines from publishing regionalized editions in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. trade officials called the action discriminatory and threatened 
retaliation. That could prompt an escalating dispute between the two countries 
over publishing and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the plan, outlined by Heritage Minister Michel Dupuy at a news 
conference, is an 80% excise tax on advertising revenue realized by foreign 
magazines publishing "split-run" Canadian editions. These are remakes of 
domestic editions, substituting Canadian advertising for its American 
counterparts, while including a few editorial changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The government proposal has been under study since the April, 1993, appearance 
of a periodic Canadian edition of Sports Illustrated, which sparked protests by 
Canadian publishers who said it unfairly drains advertising from them and 
threatens their survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's announcement was the second setback this week for an American 
company in the Canadian cultural market. On Tuesday, the Canadian courts turned 
down an appeal of U.S.-owned Country Music Television, which is being expelled 
from Canadian cable television systems Jan. 1 to be replaced by a new, 
Canadian-owned country music video channel. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor's office called the developments 
"concrete evidence of an increasing and disturbing trend in Canada toward the 
implementation of policies which are intended to protect Canadian industry by 
discriminating against legitimate U.S. broadcasting, publishing and copyright 
interests in Canada." 
</P>
<P>
 Dupuy and Prime Minister Jean Chretien have been under mounting pressure from 
Canada's cultural Establishment to be more assertive in protecting Canadian 
arts, entertainment and publishing from American competition. 
</P>
<P>
 At Canada's insistence, cultural products were exempted from the North 
American Free Trade Agreement and from the earlier Canada-U.S. Free Trade 
Agreement, although the treaties do allow each country to retaliate, if it 
believes that the other has acted unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
 Dupuy said Canada does not regard the excise tax, which could take effect by 
mid-1995, as grounds for retaliation by the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 But, responding to a reporter's question, Dupuy went out of his way to slam 
American advocates of a free-market approach to culture: "We don't regard 
trading cultural products, if I may use the term, as trading chicken or beans. 
It is creating an identity and creating a culture. We have a fundamentally 
different view, and I stand for that view. We have a culture, (and) we are 
going to develop that culture with Canadian means, not American means." 
</P>
<P>
 A web of laws, regulations and subsidies already shelter Canadian publishing 
and entertainment companies. But American products still pervade the Canadian 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 The most-watched television programs are American; more than 90% of the time 
on Canadian movie screens is devoted to foreign films, mainly American; the 
book with the longest tenure on the Toronto Globe & Mail's bestseller list is 
"The Bridges of Madison County," and 39.9% of English-language magazines sold 
in Canada are imported, 99% from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 One law regulating cultural products is a 1965 Canada customs rule banning the 
import of "split-run" editions of American magazines. The only exemptions were 
for Canadian editions of Time and Readers Digest, which predated the law. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Sports Illustrated circumvented the rule by beaming the magazine's 
editorial content to Canada by satellite and printing it in a Toronto suburb. 
The magazine published 12 Canadian editions this year and plans 12 more in 
1995. The rest of the year, Canadian readers receive the American edition, 
without Canadian ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Publishers here complain that Sports Illustrated's editorial costs for its 
Canadian edition are negligible, and as a result it can sell ads at cut-rate 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this were steel, it would be called dumping," said Catherine Keachie, 
executive director of the Canadian Magazine Publishers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released in Toronto, Nick Wattson, Sports Illustrated Canada's 
sales manager, called the excise tax "a thinly disguised means of driving us 
out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the owners of Country Music Television said they will petition 
the U.S. trade representative, seeking retaliation for its ouster from Canadian 
cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The American service, with 25 million U.S. viewers who will be unaffected, has 
been available on Canadian cable since 1984 and has 1.9 million subscribers in 
Canada.

KILLING OF BABIES TESTS DUTCH LAW

<P>
 Two Dutch doctors who killed gravely ill newborns face criminal trial in the 
Netherlands in a test case of liberal Dutch euthanasia policy, the Justice 
Ministry said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 One doctor has admitted killing a 3-day-old severely handicapped girl at her 
parents' request. Her brain was only partly developed, she had spina bifida and 
partial paralysis, her limbs were malformed, and she faced a life of pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Minister Winnie Sorgdrager ordered the prosecutions to determine how 
the law applies to cases when a doctor ends the life of a person who is unable 
to ask for death. The law requires doctors to show that a patient was 
terminally ill, in unbearable suffering and had repeatedly asked to die.

3 INDIA MINISTERS FORCED TO RESIGN; ASIA: CRITICISM OF SCANDAL-TAINTED 
OFFICIALS THREATENED PRIME MINISTER'S PARTY CONTROL. CABINET RESHUFFLE IS 
EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the ruling Congress (I) party's most drastic reaction yet to its stunning 
defeat in state elections, three government ministers mired in corruption 
scandals were forced to resign Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A large-scale Cabinet reshuffle, and perhaps a reorganization of the party 
that governs the world's largest democracy, were said to be in the offing and 
likely to be announced soon after the winter session of Parliament ends today.  
</P>
<P>
 The scandal-tainted ministers' continued presence in office had come to be a 
grave embarrassment to the government of Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, one 
the political opposition exploited with gusto to paralyze the Parliament for 
most of this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Rao had been reluctant to act against his three subordinates, despite official 
reports criticizing their actions and the urging of about 50 Congress party 
legislators who met with him this week to demand that the trio be forced out. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, facing a wave of criticism that threatened his control of 
Congress, Rao reversed course and dropped Health and Welfare Minister Baburao 
Shankaranand, Minister of State for Food Kalpnath Rai and Minister of State for 
Rural Development Rameshwar Thakur from his Council of Ministers. An evening 
communique said India's head of state, President Shankar Dayal Sharma, accepted 
their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had the prime minister taken this action before the recent assembly 
elections, we would not have faced such a battering at the hustings in Andhra 
Pradesh and Karnataka," one relieved Congress lawmaker told the United News of 
India agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress lost control of those two important southern states, as well as of 
the Himalayan state of Sikkim, in elections for state governments in November 
and December. The autumn rout left Congress anxious about its future and 
divided on how to stanch the ebbing of voter support before more state 
elections take place in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Rao's highest-ranking minister, Human Resources Minister Arjun Singh, 
reportedly threatened to quit his government and party posts if Rao did not 
change his see-no-evil approach. He declined Thursday to confirm or deny rumors 
that he had already resigned from the Cabinet and the Congress (I) Working 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever I have to say, I will say at an appropriate time," Singh told 
reporters who came to his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Party spokesman V.N. Gadgil denied a power struggle was under way in the party 
that decades ago rallied Indians to demand their independence from the British 
crown, and that has since dominated this country's politics. But some news 
reports said senior members of the government would soon be brought into 
leadership roles in the party, constituting a potential danger for Rao, India's 
leader since June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 A joint parliamentary committee that probed a 1992 securities scam, the 
largest in India's history, cited Shankaranand, then petroleum and gas 
minister, and Thakur, who was serving as minister of state for finance, for 
their roles in the illegal diversion of surplus government funds to the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 The parliamentary panel delivered its report on the $1.2-billion scandal a 
full year ago, and Rao's refusal to fire the ministers was cited by the 
opposition as proof of his government's venality.

EIGHT KILLED IN COLOMBIA BUS BOMBINGS

<P>
 Firebombs were thrown into three buses Thursday in Colombia's famous tourist 
city of Cartagena, burning eight people to death and injuring four, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The local police commander, Col. Hector Dario Castro, told reporters that 
rebels from the National Liberation Army had been extorting money from the 
company that owned the three buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro said police were trying to determine whether the extortion was linked 
to the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack was the worst in years in the Caribbean port, which is brimming 
with thousands of tourists for the holidays. One bus was attacked as it passed 
the colonial part of the city, the most important tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel groups have been fighting a low-level war for three decades. The 
president has offered to negotiate, but skirmishes continue.

2 DIE IN SARAJEVO SHELLING ON DAY BEFORE SLATED CEASE-FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two people died as shells slammed into a Sarajevo marketplace Thursday, a day 
before a cease-fire brokered by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter was due to 
take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelling occurred an hour before the U.N.'s special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, 
arrived in Sarajevo for talks on the cease-fire and ensuing negotiations 
between the Bosnian government and Bosnian Serb separatist leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven people were injured in the market shelling. Another person was killed 
and five more were wounded in shelling of the northwest town of Bihac, a 
U.N.-declared "safe area." 
</P>
<P>
 The violence underscored the difficulty facing any cease-fire in the 
32-month-old war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and served as a reminder that many 
previous efforts to end the fighting have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a bad sign for the cease-fire," Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic said 
of the shelling. "We are very disappointed. Nevertheless, we are pushing for a 
cease-fire, and we hope we get a cease-fire." 
</P>
<P>
 A new truce is scheduled to go into effect at noon today, and the United 
Nations is trying to start talks between the Bosnian government and its Serbian 
foes on a longer truce. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi traveled to Bosnian Serb headquarters in Pale, a village 12 miles 
southeast of Sarajevo, after talks with the Bosnian government. He returned to 
Sarajevo, saying there still are a few issues to be resolved before a 
cease-fire agreement can be signed. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems appeared to focus on U.N. monitoring of the cease-fire, and 
Akashi said he hopes to have them resolved and an agreement signed today.  
</P>
<P>
 Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic said he had issued orders for his men to cease 
fire today even if Muslim troops do not withdraw from the strategic Mt. Igman 
in time for signing a truce accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not make it a precondition for the start of the cease-fire," Karadzic 
told reporters after meeting Akashi. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the Muslim withdrawal from Mt. Igman, Karadzic added: "We 
understand the withdrawal of Muslim troops should be completed by tomorrow 
noon, but if it is technically difficult we will wait one or two days." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials did not say who was to blame for Thursday's market shelling, 
but the site is just below Serbian-held Mt. Trebevic. Bosnian Serbs denied 
firing the projectiles. In a statement, the Bosnian Serb military accused the 
Muslim-led government of the attack, claiming that it wanted to influence 
public opinion and sabotage peace talks.

FUME DETECTORS CREATE CHAOS FOR CHICAGOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Freak weather set off oversensitive carbon monoxide detectors across the city 
on Thursday, deluging firefighters with more than 1,800 emergency calls from 
worried residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The detectors, required in city residences since Oct. 1, let out their 
high-pitched beeps late Wednesday and early Thursday, apparently because of an 
unusually high level of carbon monoxide in the air, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a lot of cases, the carbon monoxide level in the homes was less than it 
was outside," Fire Superintendent Raymond Orozco said. 
</P>
<P>
 A leading manufacturer of detectors -- Aurora, Ill.-based First Alert -- has 
agreed that its devices were too sensitive and will offer refunds to residents 
who return them by Jan. 31, Mayor Richard M. Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Underwriters Laboratories Inc., which certifies the detectors, has 
agreed to set new standards requiring the devices to be less sensitive, less 
prone to accumulate carbon monoxide and easier to clear once they go off, Daley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor told a news conference that the intent of the ordinance was to save 
lives. "However, it's clear the city can't dispatch firefighters to thousands 
of homes when Mother Nature decides to change the weather," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the flood of calls, Orozco asked residents not to call 911 merely 
because their detectors were going off. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not experiencing any symptoms" of carbon monoxide poisoning, such 
as dizziness or headaches, "and your alarm goes off, open your windows and 
ventilate your home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department will no longer send trucks and ambulances unless symptoms 
of poisoning are suffered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 1,852 calls logged by 911 in 24 hours, only one resulted in a 
hospitalization, Orozco said. 
</P>
<P>
 The high level of carbon monoxide was blamed on an unseasonably warm weather 
system that trapped the gas from vehicle exhaust and other sources close to the 
ground, said Tim Seeley of the National Weather Service. Thursday's high was 
near 60 degrees and there was virtually no wind, despite the fact that winter 
had just begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, there was a major case of carbon monoxide poisoning early Thursday 
in suburban Wilmette, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Four adults and five children were hospitalized after being poisoned by carbon 
monoxide leaking from a faulty furnace. The home had a detector, but it failed 
to go off, fire officials said.

MRS. KING SPARS WITH PARK SERVICE OVER MEMORIAL SITE; CIVIL RIGHTS: CRITICS 
ALLEGE SHE IS ARROGANT IN HER FIGHT OVER PLANS TO IMPROVE ATLANTA AREA. SHE 
SAYS ONLY THE FAMILY HAS RIGHT TO INTERPRET HUSBAND'S LEGACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Since Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot down in 1968, his widow, Coretta 
Scott King, has jealously guarded his legacy as champion of the 
disenfranchised. But now she is in a fight with the National Park Service for 
control of a memorial honoring her late husband. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle is laced with irony: It pits the King family not only against the 
Park Service but also against a substantial portion of the poor, black 
neighborhood in which the memorial sits. 
</P>
<P>
 This city reveres King. But, as the controversy is making clear, a good 
portion of black Atlanta has never known quite what to make of his widow, who 
has always come off as somewhat aloof. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a monarchy," said Mtamanika Youngblood, executive director of the 
Historic District Development Corp., a neighborhood organization that supports 
the Park Service in the battle. "She's a queen and Dexter (her youngest son) is 
a prince."  
</P>
<P>
 Many residents of the area now are angry that the King family's challenge to 
the Park Service might derail plans for $11.8 million in improvements to the 
area that they hoped would rejuvenate the struggling community. 
</P>
<P>
 The King family said in press conference Thursday that the dispute with the 
Park Service is over principle -- they alone should have the right to interpret 
King's legacy. Park Service officials say it's over money. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, including Mayor Bill Campbell, simply scratch their heads in 
bafflement as the city scrambles to limit what damage the family's opposition 
might inflict on a project they had hoped would spruce up the city's biggest 
tourist attraction in time for the 1996 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3 million people visit the King Historic Site yearly. Included in 
the 23-acre area are King's crypt, his birth home, the church he pastored and 
the family run King Center that opened in 1980 to preserve his legacy and 
advance his social goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Park Service, which took over operation of the historic site in 1983, had 
planned to build a visitors center, parking facilities and a pedestrian 
promenade in the area.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, it has arranged to lease the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King 
had been pastor. It would operate the church as a museum. Meanwhile, a new 
$7-million church is being planned next to the visitors center. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining how the plans came about, Troy Lissimore, the Park Service site 
superintendent, said a small exhibit on King's life at the family run King 
Center does not do justice to the civil rights leader. Since the family did not 
come forward to develop an adequate exhibit, he said, "it fell on the shoulders 
of the Park Service to design it. And we designed it with the cooperation of 
the King Center." 
</P>
<P>
 Others who participated in the process agree that the King family was involved 
from the beginning. But now the family, describing the Park Service as an 
"evil" force that was trying to usurp the family's rightful role, is trying to 
stop the project. 
</P>
<P>
 They want to build a high-tech, interactive, virtual reality center to 
commemorate the slain civil rights figure on the site where the visitors center 
and new church are planned. But financing has not yet been secured for the 
ambitious family project, while work on the Park Service project has already 
begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want the Park Service construction money to be used to finance their own 
facility -- I think that's probably pretty clear," said Rick McCollough, the 
Park Service's project manager for facility design at the site.  
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt dated Nov. 3, 1994, and 
in her press conference, Mrs. King accused the Park Service of cutting 
"back-room deals" to acquire historic King-related property and asked that the 
Park Service be removed from the historic district. Dexter King said Thursday 
that the Park Service had gone so far as to suggest buying King's crypt, an 
allegation Park Service officials deny. 
</P>
<P>
 They further charged that government officials and community organizations had 
been misled into thinking that the King family supported the Park Service's 
plans when they had really long opposed them.  
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Campbell, in a letter to Babbitt this month, said he was "surprised" 
and "disappointed" by Coretta King's assertions. ". . . The King Center and its 
representatives have been involved in the discussions from the outset," he 
wrote. "For Mrs. King or anyone connected with the King Center to suggest 
otherwise is simply inaccurate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The family's Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change sits 
in a once-thriving neighborhood that long ago fell into decay. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who live and work along struggling Auburn Avenue are the kind of 
people for whom Dr. King gave his life in the civil rights struggle. But ask 
them about the center in their midst that bears his name and you will likely 
get a blank stare. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the King Center does," said Youngblood. "I don't know what 
they do and I live three blocks from it. Everybody wonders." 
</P>
<P>
 Such grumbling about the King heirs is not new. But the intensity and 
outspokenness of the current attacks seem unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
 Dismissing the center as "no more than a 10-minute stop for tourists," a 
columnist in the Atlanta Constitution blasted the family this week, accusing 
them of wanting to turn King's dream into a "money-making scheme." 
</P>
<P>
 "The center shows little inclination to delve seriously into the problems that 
confront America," wrote editorial page editor Cynthia Tucker. "It shows little 
interest in the poverty of its own neighborhood, a rundown area of Atlanta."  
</P>
<P>
 It was this attack that apparently led to Thursday's unusual press conference, 
in which all four King children participated, along with an array of civil 
rights and labor leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never, not even for a moment, has personal enrichment been a motivation for 
me or my children," said Mrs. King at the press conference, which often took on 
the appearance of a Baptist church service, with scattered shouts of "amen" and 
"tell it!" from supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same evil forces that killed Martin Luther King Jr. are now trying to 
destroy his family," she said. "We stand before you today more determined than 
ever that those who slew the dreamer will not slay the dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Dexter King said: "The legacy of Martin Luther King belongs to everyone 
spiritually but to his heirs legally." He seemed particularly bothered by what 
he called unwarranted attacks on his mother.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Comparing his mother to Jackie Kennedy, who he said was never criticized for 
not carrying on the work of her husband, he said: "My mother never remarried. 
She was dedicated to the legacy of my father." 
</P>
<P>
 As for criticism that the King children in general and he in particular have 
not lived up to their father's name, Dexter King, who resembles his father and 
has a similar rumbling baritone voice, named a long list of African American 
leaders, such as Jesse Jackson and Andrew Young, who, he said, collectively 
could not fill his father's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked: "How can you expect me to fill his shoes?"

QE2 CRUISE WAS A NIGHTMARE, PASSENGERS SAY

<P>
 Disgruntled passengers on the luxury liner QE2 arrived in New York Harbor 
Thursday evening after what they called a nightmarish trans-Atlantic voyage in 
which toilets flooded, running water turned brown and debris spilled into the 
corridors. 
</P>
<P>
 John Olsen, chairman of Cunard, owners of QE2, boarded the ship and met with 
the passengers after they threatened a mutiny when faulty plumbing and repair 
problems turned their holiday into a foul-smelling fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 The debacle has been a publicity nightmare for Cunard and has left the elegant 
image of the world's most famous cruise liner in tatters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no excuse. We are accepting full responsibility. It has to be said 
that we underestimated the full extent of the difficulty," said Olsen, who 
offered passengers a full refund on their voyage and 25% off on another 
sailing. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Charleston, 38, of Upper Montclair, N.J., who was traveling with her 
husband and 4-year-old child, said: "There was no plumbing, no electricity the 
first day and literally no heat. We froze the first night," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Clark, a management consultant from Los Angeles, complained that 
"although we had water in the cabin, it was brown." 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the amenities of the ship were open until today . . . then they 
whitewashed everything in typical British response to everything," said Clark, 
who was traveling with her 11-year-old nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers said they used champagne buckets as makeshift toilets, swimming 
pools were unusable and construction debris turned corridors into dangerous 
obstacle courses.

'WE ARE INNOCENT VICTIMS'; AS LAYOFFS LOOM, COUNTY WORKERS ARE ANGRY, WORRIED 
AND FRUSTRATED 
</P>

<P>
 The county has always told its employees they were one big family, but when 
the heads of the household announced layoffs Thursday, that close-knit clan 
began to disintegrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This 'county family' crap is totally unreal," said Robert D. Wilberg, a union 
activist who works as a groundskeeper for the county parks. "We're not a 
family. We're the workers." 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Baird, who oversees a staff of 12 in the tax collector's office, 
implored her people not to panic. Privately, she was hopping mad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to form a group and see that the Board of Supervisors is put out in 
the streets!" she said, as a co-worker nodded vigorous assent. "We are innocent 
victims, sitting over here doing our jobs. And now we're done?" 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors tried to cushion the blow by repeatedly reminding employees 
that it was time for the "county family" to make sacrifices. But no one knew 
which of the 16,000 employees would lose their jobs as supervisors slash $40.2 
million in salaries over the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The move comes three weeks after the supervisors say they were forced to 
declare bankruptcy because of a crisis that is siphoning $10 million a month 
from county coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a drop in the bucket," said Larry Bales, who has 26 years with 
the assessor's office. "Aw, you haven't seen nothing yet." 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to start cutting management . . . who make a lot more money than us 
peons," said Lisa Williams, 28, a receptionist in the auditor-controller's 
office. Williams was especially fearful because she recently gave birth 
prematurely and faces massive medical bills that are only partly covered by 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to keep a good attitude, to try and serve the public the best I can 
and keep going," said Crystal Jacklin, 30, who has worked in the tax 
collector's office for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Laid-off workers will be the first to feel the pinch. In time, everything and 
everyone will be touched by the county's financial free-fall. The cutbacks will 
affect all county services, from parks and beaches to waste disposal and law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the courts, Presiding Orange County Superior Court Judge James L. Smith 
said administrators will look everywhere for extra dollars. But cutbacks will 
inevitably weaken the county's ability to provide legal defense for the poor. 
Shorthanded public defenders will now have to assume a greater burden. 
</P>
<P>
 "By golly, if someone can come in here and tell me how the public defender's 
office is going to do $3.7-million more worth of work with the same resources, 
it will be the modern-day equivalent of the fishes and loaves miracle," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one union official -- who represents 70% of county workers -- tried 
to remind the supervisors of their employees' longstanding loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "A dark day in the county has just been made darker by the Board of 
Supervisors," said John H. Sawyer, general manager of the Orange County 
Employees Assn. "I'm shocked and disappointed that the county would treat its 
employees so cavalierly. This is the most destructive action the board could 
take." 
</P>
<P>
 But moments after supervisors enacted the cuts, over Sawyer's protests, word 
began to spread that the ax was looming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called my kids up," Bales said. "I got two kids in college, and I said, 
'Well, you may not be going to school next semester. You may not have a car.' 
I've been trying to get my kids to pay attention to the fact that this may 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than fear, most employees said their first reaction was bitter 
resentment toward the supervisors and former Treasurer Robert L. Citron, widely 
blamed for the risky strategy that led to a $2.02-billion loss in the county's 
investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is it that no one is interested in the justice of this?" asked a longtime 
recorder's office employee, who declined to give his name for fear of 
jeopardizing his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are only five to six people who had authority over Citron, and they 
seem to be the only people emerging intact," he said. "I accept responsibility 
for my actions and I'm wondering why I have to accept responsibility for 
theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Hall of Administration, four employees from the treasurer's office 
sat waiting to hear some news about the layoffs. One woman, who asked that her 
name not be used, scanned a document outlining the salary cuts and said: "What 
a merry Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Carlson, a county mechanic for 15 years, said: "They (the supervisors) 
should all be fired. . . . This whole thing is ridiculous. Now I've got to go 
back to my shop and tell the guys the bad news." Job Cut Overview 
</P>
<P>
 The county layoff procedure will involve evaluating both job performance and 
actual need for the position. In some cases, individuals will be laid off; 
other scenarios include closing entire offices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Health, safety, welfare and other essential services will not face drastic 
layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Employees with special skills or unique knowledge necessary to county 
operations will not be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 * Departments may close or consolidate entire divisions or units. 
</P>
<P>
 * Layoffs will be based on employment status, performance reviews and length 
of county service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Temporary and probationary employees will be among the first laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 * Notices will be delivered by mail or in person two weeks before the 
effective date. 
</P>
<P>
 * Regular and recently promoted employees may seek lower-level jobs in lieu of 
layoffs. LAYOFF POINT SYSTEM 
</P>
<P>
 The layoff order will be computed according to a point system. Workers with 
few demerits and high seniority will be among the last to go. REHIRING PROCESS 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, the county will keep a list of employees who have been laid off 
or moved to lower-level jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Those laid off last will be the first rehired. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rehired personnel may be reinstated at or below their previous level of 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Benefits accrued before layoff will be restored, including sick leave and 
seniority.

BOND FUND RULING ALLOWS EMERGENCY PAYMENTS; COURTS: JUDGE SAYS $1 BILLION CAN 
BE TAKEN FROM TROUBLED INVESTMENT POOL BY ORANGE COUNTY AND OTHERS TO COVER 
PAYROLLS AND BILLS UNTIL JAN. 31. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge John E. Ryan approved an interim plan Thursday 
that will give Orange County and more than 180 cities and districts access to 
$1 billion to pay emergency bills and payrolls through Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which should help cities and other investors stave off potentially 
disastrous shortfalls, limits each investor to 30% of their individual 
investments in the county's troubled bond fund. It also puts an overall cap of 
$1 billion on the investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan called the plan fair. "It is not based on fears about what might happen, 
it's based on hopes about trying to resolve this terrible situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the county promised that the county will abide by the same rules 
governing other investors when it makes its request for emergency funds over 
the next 30 days. Orange County bankruptcy attorney Bruce Bennett said the 
county will probably ask for far less than $300 million. It was unknown how 
much other cash-strapped municipalities and government agencies would demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the more than 100 attorneys in court objected to the agreement, which 
also requires that emergency disbursement requests be reviewed by a creditors 
committee, a second committee representing pool investors and the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said that municipalities could begin filling out the two-page emergency 
withdrawal request forms Thursday afternoon, and that cash could begin flowing 
within days. He said he will be available next Thursday to rule on disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 But that quick pace is barely fast enough for some cash-strapped cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello said it must withdraw $14 million, or 30% of its investment, to 
make a partial payment on a debt that is due next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the $14 million is paid, debt holders are unlikely to roll the debt 
over and "if the city defaults, (it) faces the same problem that the county 
faces now," said Montebello's attorney, John Lapinski. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lapinski said the new procedure at least gives the city a chance to make 
its payment. "I'm cautiously optimistic that things will work out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett also made several important disclosures during the hearing for cities 
and districts that rely upon the county to collect and disburse property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some property tax payments that Orange County collected before the county 
declared bankruptcy Dec. 6 were pumped into the troubled investment fund, he 
said. Bennett did not give a figure for the tax money now entangled in the 
complicated bankruptcy proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bennett balanced that dose of bad news by saying that the county today 
will start disbursing to the cities property taxes that were collected after 
the bankruptcy filing. Bennett did not say whether the county's fiscal woes 
would result in smaller checks being mailed. 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent split between the county and other investors that could widen, 
several attorneys raised questions about who should be forced to bear the brunt 
of the $2-billion loss suffered by the county's troubled bond fund. The 
arguments provided a glimpse into the complex legal question of what role the 
county played in the fund's losses.  
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for two community colleges and a city objected to the plan because 
it did not limit more strictly the county's ability to make withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach City Atty. Gail Hutton argued that the county should not be 
able to withdraw any funds until it guarantees that all other investors will be 
reimbursed 100%. Hutton said her "fiscally responsible" city should be given 
back its entire $43-million bond pool investment because the county violated 
its role as a "trustee" by speculating with investors' money. She said the 
county had no authority to impound the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county will not agree to the city's terms, Hutton threatened to take 
the matter to Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "The monies in the pool fund are sacrosanct," Hutton told Ryan. "We are not 
unmindful of the county's dire straits, but unless the county can guarantee it 
will protect our interests, the city cannot agree to the county's invasion of 
the city's money." 
</P>
<P>
 County bankruptcy attorney Bennett stressed that the county has taken no stand 
on how the loss should be absorbed. He did suggest that pool participants 
attempt a negotiated solution. The other option: "Build a courtroom with 
roughly 200 attorneys' tables and take no money out of the pool for several 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the county and the Official Investment Pools Participants Committee, 
which represents investors, will meet over the next two weeks to come up with a 
proposal about how to handle the remaining funds in the pool, said committee 
attorney Patrick Shea. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; DAILY DEVELOPMENTS

<P>
 The Layoffs 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Orange County workers are expected to lose their jobs early next 
month under a sweeping budget-cutting plan. Sheriff Brad Gates, part of the 
county's three-member management council that has spent the past nine days 
considering where to cut spending, called the proposal "the necessary starting 
point to resolve our financial crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 The Backlash 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the layoffs was met with anger and disillusionment from Orange County 
workers, who rejected the notion that they were still part of a government 
family. "This county family crap is totally unreal," a parks groundskeeper 
said. "We're not a family. We're the workers." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Withdrawals Allowed 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Bankruptcy judge John E. Ryan approved a proposal for allowing agencies 
to withdraw as much as 30% of the money they invested in the fund to cover 
payrolls, debt payments and other urgent cash needs. 
</P>
<P>
 New Acting Treasurer 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Treasurer Matthew R. Raabe was demoted by county supervisors. Former 
Oklahoma state Auditor Thomas Daxon was named treasurer for the next four 
months. Daxon had been appointed as the county's special consultant to the 
treasurer's office two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Risk Assessment 
</P>
<P>
 Former California Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, the county's top financial 
adviser, said that although the sale of $3.3 billion in portfolio holdings by 
Salomon Bros. has succeeded in bolstering the county's troubled portfolio, "it 
is still very risky."

'LESS RISKY' POOL MAY HAVE LOST MORE; PORTFOLIO: FUND PAYING LOWER INTEREST WAS 
SUPPOSED TO BE SAFE, BUT ITS LOSSES MAY EXCEED 27% OVERALL RATE, ANALYSTS 
DISCOVER. INVESTORS ARE 'DUMBFOUNDED.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The 13 Orange County agencies and cities that invested in a "safe" investment 
pool managed by former county Treasurer Robert L. Citron may have lost a 
greater percentage of their money than those participating in the county's 
supposedly riskier -- and higher-yielding -- investment fund, county financial 
adviser Thomas Hayes said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes and financial analysts from the Salomon Bros. investment firm have found 
that the so-called bond pool, which was supposed to be a low-risk, low-yield, 
short-term depository for working funds, invested in risky "derivative" 
securities and borrowed money to make further investments, just as did the 
larger "commingled pool." 
</P>
<P>
 Its losses may match or exceed the 27% suffered by the county's $7.8-billion 
portfolio as a whole, Hayes said. The bond pool accounted for $1.27 billion on 
Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his attorney, Citron denied doing anything improper. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes, who was appointed a special financial adviser after the county filed 
for bankruptcy protection Dec. 6, made his remarks in an interview just before 
giving the Orange County Board of Supervisors his latest interim report on the 
condition of the crippled investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, he said, although the sale of $3.3 billion in portfolio holdings by 
Salomon Bros. had succeeded in sharply curtailing the portfolio's riskiness, it 
is still highly exposed to losses from increases in prevailing interest rates.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, the ultimate investment loss suffered by the pool still appears to be 
fixed at his Dec. 13 estimate of $2.02 billion. "It's still very risky, it 
still has derivatives, and it's still leveraged," he said. "But it's less 
leveraged and less risky than one week ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes said that the county might soon be turning its attention to whether it 
needs to return to the capital markets for new loans or help in restructuring 
its debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon Bros. has asked several Wall Street firms to propose how they might 
underwrite a new issue of Orange County debt securities if the county tries to 
raise fresh cash from investors. The firms, which included such leading 
underwriters of municipal debt as Goldman, Sachs & Co., Lehman Bros. and Morgan 
Stanley & Co., were asked to respond to Hayes by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes said no specific type or dollar amount of offering was being considered 
but he wanted to screen potential underwriters now so that their services would 
be available as needed. "It's another arrow in our quiver," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 But he warned that given the bankruptcy and the county's default on existing 
debt, a return to the credit markets "is going to be a very difficult 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not even close" to estimating what the cost to the county might be of 
floating a new debt issue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the so-called "bond pool" and "commingled pool," the distinction has 
become an issue in Bankruptcy Court and elsewhere as the 13 investors in the 
smaller bond pool contend that they should shoulder a lesser loss than the 
municipalities and agencies in the larger fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, they argue that Citron and his assistant, Matthew R. 
Raabe, implied that they were receiving a lower rate of return on their money 
because they tolerated less risk in their money.  
</P>
<P>
 But Hayes said Thursday that he has seen no evidence that the investments in 
the two pools differed in nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contention that there were only 'safe' investments in the bond pool is 
not borne out by the records that are available," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes said he could not explain why Citron paid a lower rate of interest to 
the smaller pool's investors. "The accountants are looking at where the money 
went," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, treasurers of some of the agencies with money in the bond pool 
expressed outrage Thursday at learning that their funds were invested so 
imprudently. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just dumbfounded," said Orange County Transportation Authority Finance 
Director James Kenan, whose agency was the largest investor in the bond pool, 
with $560 million.  
</P>
<P>
 "No one in their right mind would leverage a pool where there's no demand for 
yield and it's short-term duration," he said. "A short-term pool you have to be 
able to snap your fingers and get out. These derivatives, by definition, you 
can't get out. That's just suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us in the bond pool assumed that it was in safer, lower-risk 
investments and that's why we were getting a lower rate of return," said Vicki 
Baker, finance director of Yorba Linda, which had $6.5 million in the pool. 
"Now I'm sitting here thinking: 'Gee, we're going to take the same loss as the 
commingled and we got less interest?' That makes it even worse. You think that 
you've heard the worst through this whole thing, and every day there's 
something new." 
</P>
<P>
 But she and other officials said they never obtained written assurances from 
Citron or Raabe that the money would be specially handled.  
</P>
<P>
 "I remember saying, 'Do you have anything in writing?' " she said. "And they'd 
say no. And I remember thinking they never really got their paperwork act 
together. Now it all makes sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether Citron may have misled investors into believing the bond pool 
was invested conventionally, David Wiechert, Citron's attorney, said investors 
should have known that the bond pool was leveraged and tied up in derivatives. 
That's because, although it earned less interest than the county's commingled 
fund, it earned more than the state's conservatively run investment pool, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Citron didn't intend to defraud anyone with regard to the two funds," he 
said. "Bob never made it a secret from anybody how he was trying to make his 
money."

 Orange County appeared to have the law on its side as the Board of Supervisors 
tore up collective bargaining agreements with county employee groups Thursday 
in order to rescind pay raises and make it easier to lay off hundreds of 
workers in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The job cuts are part of an emergency effort to trim $40.2 million from the 
county budget. Orange County filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 6 after 
disclosing that the investment pool run by the county treasurer had lost $2.02 
billion from risky bond investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's unanimous decision Thursday to rewrite seniority-based layoff 
policies that have been central to labor agreements is not going to be accepted 
gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
 John H. Sawyer, head of the Orange County Employees Assn., which represents 
nearly 70% of the county work force, expressed outrage at the board's vote to 
allow department heads to order layoffs based on productivity. He said his 
group would consider a court challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The move could "violate the vested constitutional rights of county employees" 
and is "predicated on a crude and ill-thought-out application of Chapter 11 to 
a Chapter 9 proceeding," said John Sawyer Jr., the employee group's attorney 
and son of its general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eliminating seniority seems to be designed to replace the merit system with 
favoritism," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Some bankruptcy law specialists say an oddity of municipal bankruptcy law 
allows the board action. 
</P>
<P>
 In revoking sections of their collective bargaining agreements with nearly 
16,000 county employees, the supervisors and the county's attorney cited a 1984 
Supreme Court decision that says a company in bankruptcy can unilaterally 
abandon a collective bargaining agreement if revisions cannot be agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
 That case involved the Continental Airlines bankruptcy in 1983, when 
then-Chairman Frank Lorenzo took the airline into Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
specifically to break its union contracts during a protracted labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting at the behest of labor unions outraged by the airline's bankruptcy, 
Congress in 1984 added a section to the federal Bankruptcy Code that overrode 
the Supreme Court decision and prohibited employers from canceling labor 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that new provision was incorporated into Chapter 11, which regulates 
business reorganizations, Congress overlooked the little-used municipal 
bankruptcy rules of Chapter 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "They probably would have added it to Chapter 9 if they had they thought about 
it, but they didn't, and so the law (for government bankruptcies) gets thrown 
back" to the 1984 Supreme Court ruling, said Daniel J. Bussel, a UCLA law 
professor specializing in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth N. Klee, a Los Angeles attorney who was minority counsel to the House 
Judiciary Committee when Chapter 9 was revised and updated in 1975, said there 
is a history of Congress exempting governments in bankruptcy from the rules 
that bind private parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1975, when New York City was considering a Chapter 9 filing, it was 
considering abrogating its union contracts and the unions were very opposed," 
Klee said. "But when Chapter 9 was revised (later that same year), there were 
no special provisions put in to protect unions and their collective bargaining 
agreements." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that because Chapter 9 does not include special protections for labor 
agreements, a municipal bankruptcy is governed by an older provision of 
bankruptcy law that allows a debtor to void any contract if it determines that 
honoring it would be financially harmful. 
</P>
<P>
 Klee, whose law firm is advising Orange County in its bankruptcy, declined to 
comment on the appropriateness of the county's action Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rich Reuben, a labor law specialist with the Newport Beach office of 
Pillsbury Madison & Sutro, said the county seems to be supported by current 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, there haven't been very many Chapter 9 filings, so there probably 
isn't anyone who really knows how a court would treat this," he said. "This 
case is going to set ground rules for handling a host of issues in the Chapter 
9 arena, and this issue of collective bargaining definitely will be one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Labor attorneys and representatives were reluctant to lash out at the county 
without seeing first just how far supervisors are willing to go to slash 
personnel costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely have a different view of the law from that which the county 
apparently has," said John Sawyer Jr.

SUPERVISORS' PICK LAWYER WITH BROAD CREDENTIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In retaining Gerald Edmund Boltz to represent them, the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors chose a nationally respected securities lawyer whose career spans 
five decades as both an aggressive prosecutor and defender of those accused of 
securities violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Boltz, 63, was the regional administrator of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission's office in Los Angeles from 1972 to 1979 and before that was an SEC 
enforcer in Texas and Denver. For the last 15 years he has been in private 
practice, the last two as a senior partner at Bryan Cave in Santa Monica, where 
he specializes in federal and California securities law. 
</P>
<P>
 Other lawyers and analysts say that Boltz enjoys an excellent reputation and 
that his intimate understanding of the inner workings and procedures of the SEC 
are certain to be invaluable to the supervisors, who are being questioned by 
the federal agency as well as by state and local investigators over the 
nation's largest municipal bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the best securities lawyers in the country," said Robert Fusfeld, 
a senior counsel for the SEC's regional office in Denver. "He's an absolute 
expert on securities law, and he's got the reputation of utmost integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Boltz declined to be interviewed, saying that matters involving his clients 
are confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 As an attorney for the Board of Supervisors, Boltz is essentially representing 
Orange County against any potential action that may stem from regulatory 
investigations. His as-yet undisclosed fees will be paid by the county, which 
has already agreed to pay up to $435 an hour for some of its bankruptcy 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 The five supervisors, among other county officials, have been subpoenaed by 
the SEC, which legal experts say may be looking into the relationship between 
county officials and the brokers who underwrote county bonds, whether the 
county properly disclosed facts to investors before issuing the bonds, and the 
oversight responsibilities of the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were a supervisor and the SEC wanted to talk to me, I'd like to have 
someone like Boltz sitting next to me," said Robert F. Watson, a securities 
lawyer who worked with Boltz at the SEC in Denver and Texas and is now in 
private practice in Ft. Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Boltz, a native of Dennison, Ohio, graduated from Ohio Northern University's 
law school in 1955. After two years in the Army and a year as an assistant 
attorney general in Ohio, Boltz joined the SEC in Denver in 1959 as an special 
investigations attorney and later worked in the agency's Ft. Worth office. 
</P>
<P>
 In his seven years as head of the SEC's Los Angeles operations, Boltz is 
credited with having turned a sleepy local office into one of the commission's 
most aggressive branches -- quadrupling its staff, doubling its caseload and 
pursuing notable investigations involving Equity Funding Corp., Beverly Hills 
Bancorp and Lincoln Thrift in Phoenix, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were at the SEC, he was a very strong enforcement leader," said 
Charles Hartman, who was hired by Boltz in Los Angeles in 1972. Hartman 
co-authored with Boltz a chapter in "Securities Law Techniques" about how to 
litigate with the SEC and defend against an SEC injunction.

NEW COUNTY TREASURER IS NO STRANGER TO CRISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.R. MOEHRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The man asked to help save Orange County is a kind of financial firefighter 
with 20 years of front-line experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas E. Daxon, 46, the new Orange County treasurer, is the former state 
auditor and inspector of Oklahoma who has rescued government agencies, 
high-tech companies and a chaotic Resolution Trust Corp. processing center.  
</P>
<P>
 Appointed Thursday by the Orange County Board of Supervisors to a four-month 
term, Daxon succeeds Robert L. Citron, who was pressured to resign, and Matthew 
Raabe, Citron's chief assistant, who served briefly as interim treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Daxon entered the Orange County crisis as leader of a team of accountants from 
Arthur Andersen & Co., where Daxon was an adviser on government audit and 
account issues from 1983 to 1989.  
</P>
<P>
 Elected Oklahoma's state auditor in 1979, Daxon inherited an office that was 
on probation with the federal government and facing a cutoff of all federal 
money because of shoddy auditing practices. After one year under Daxon, the 
office was taken off probation.  
</P>
<P>
 Daxon tried to build on his political success with a 1982 bid for governor, 
but was easily beaten by the incumbent, Democrat George Nigh. After his loss, 
he returned to his career as a certified public accountant, moved to Virginia 
and signed on with Andersen. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, Daxon managed an investment partnership that made rescue loans 
to high-tech companies. He also took control of a widely criticized Resolution 
Trust processing center, clearing up six months of unreconciled accounts.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to get to the bottom of this and find out what the problem is," he 
said Monday, after his hiring was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Daxon, who has a bachelor's degree in economics from Oklahoma State 
University, said Orange County's crisis dwarfs most financial crises, but added 
that he and his team of accountants are up to the challenge. As his first 
formal act, Daxon gave approval to the supervisors' efforts at freezing 
spending.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was very pleased with the action that the board took today," he said. "They 
clearly want to do what's best for the county -- get control of the situation 
and turn it around."

$1 BILLION IN INTERIM WITHDRAWALS APPROVED; COURT: BANKRUPTCY JUDGE PERMITS 
ACCESS OF 30% OF WHAT AN INVESTOR HAD IN FUND. IT SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR CITIES 
AND AGENCIES TO COVER BILLS AND PAYROLLS THROUGH THE END OF JANUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge John E. Ryan approved an interim plan Thursday 
that will give Orange County and more than 180 cities and districts access to 
$1 billion from the county's bankrupt investment pool to pay emergency bills 
and payrolls through Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which should help cities and other pool investors stave off 
potentially disastrous shortfalls, limits investors to 30% of their individual 
investments in the county fund. It also puts an overall cap of $1 billion on 
fund withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan called the plan fair: "It is not based on fears about what might happen. 
It's based on hopes about trying to resolve this terrible situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Through its attorneys, the county promised that it would abide by the same 
rules governing other investors when it requests emergency funds over the next 
30 days. Attorney Bruce Bennett said the county will probably ask for far less 
than the $300 million it would be entitled to demand under the newly approved 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unknown how much other cash-strapped municipalities and government 
agencies would demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the more than 100 attorneys in court objected to the agreement, which 
also requires that emergency disbursement requests be reviewed by a creditors 
committee, a second committee representing pool investors, and the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said that municipalities could begin filling out the two-page emergency 
withdrawal request forms on Thursday afternoon, and that cash could begin 
flowing within days. He said he will be available next Thursday to rule on 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 But that quick pace is barely fast enough for some cash-strapped cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello in Los Angeles County, for example, said it must withdraw $14 
million, or all of its 30% allotment, to make a partial payment on a debt 
that's due Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Absent the $14 million, Montebello's creditors are unlikely to roll the debt 
over, and "if the city defaults (it) faces the same problem that (Orange 
County) faces now," said Montebello's attorney, John Lapinski. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lapinski said the new procedure at least gives the city a chance to make 
some payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm cautiously optimistic that things will work out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett also made several important disclosures during the hearing for cities 
and districts that rely upon the county to collect and disburse their share of 
property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the property tax payments that Orange County collected before the 
county declared bankruptcy Dec. 6 were pumped into the troubled investment 
fund, he said. Bennett didn't give a dollar figure for the tax monies now 
entangled in the complicated bankruptcy proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bennett balanced that dose of bad news by saying that today the county 
will start disbursing to the cities property taxes that were collected after 
the bankruptcy filing. Bennett did not say whether the county's fiscal woes 
would result in smaller checks being mailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all attorneys agreed with the plan Ryan approved. 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent split that could grow between the county and other investors, 
several attorneys raised questions about who should be forced to bear the brunt 
of the $2-billion loss suffered by the county's troubled bond fund. The 
arguments provided a glimpse into the complex legal question of what role the 
county played in the fund's losses.  
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for two community colleges and a city objected to the plan because 
it did not more strictly limit the county's ability to make withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach City Atty. Gail C. Hutton argued that the county should not 
be allowed to withdraw any funds until it guarantees that all other investors 
will be reimbursed 100%. Hutton said her "fiscally responsible" city should be 
given back its entire $43-million bond pool investment, because the county 
violated its role as a "trustee" by speculating with investors' money. She said 
the county had no authority to impound the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutton threatened to take the matter to Superior Court if the county will not 
agree to the city's terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The monies in the pool fund are sacrosanct," Hutton told Ryan. "We are not 
unmindful of the county's dire straits, but unless the county can guarantee it 
will protect our interests, the city cannot agree to the county's invasion of 
the city's money." 
</P>
<P>
 County bankruptcy attorney Bennett responded by arguing that under at least 
one scenario for resolving rival claims to the fund, the county could win the 
entire contents of the pool.  
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said it could be argued that the county merely placed funds for other 
investors and that "no valid or enforceable trust (agreement) existed or 
survived" between the county and other investors in the fund. That argument 
would lead to the conclusion that the county "is entitled to the entire 
(remaining) contents of the fund," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett also laid out several other possible scenarios. At the other extreme, 
he said, is Hutton's argument that the county acted as trustee for the other 
agencies and that, as a "failed trustee," the county's claims should be 
relegated to the bottom of the pile. 
</P>
<P>
 A third possibility would be to pro-rate the loss equally between the county 
and the other agencies that invested in the pool, or according to a more 
complicated formula, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett stressed that the county has taken no stand on how the loss should be 
absorbed, and that other attorneys probably could come up with other possible 
outcomes for the tough legal question of how to apportion the $2-billion loss 
among the fund's investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett did suggest that pool participants attempt a negotiated solution. The 
other option: "Build a courtroom with roughly 200 attorneys' tables and take no 
money out of the pool for several years." 
</P>
<P>
 But given the first possible scenario in which the county could win all of the 
funds, Bennett argued that the county is being generous in allowing other 
investors to take any money out of the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the county and the Official Investment Pools Participants Committee, 
which represents investors, will meet over the next two weeks to come up with a 
proposal about how to handle the remaining funds in the pool, committee 
attorney Patrick Shea said.  
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said that it is essential for all parties to try to work together to 
resolve disputes short of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an emergency and the question is how to deal with that emergency," 
Ryan said. "If we do it with litigation . . . that reminds me of Nero with a 
fiddle." 
</P>

END TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING FACES LEGAL TEST; LABOR: ODDITY OF MUNICIPAL 
BANKRUPTCY LAW ALLOWS SUSPENSION OF UNION PACT. EMPLOYEES LEADER HINTS COUNTY 
WILL BE CHALLENGED. 
</P>

<P>
 In tearing up collective bargaining agreements with county employee groups 
Thursday, Orange County supervisors have set the stage for a possible legal 
test over their right to rescind pay raises and overturn seniority rules 
without the workers' consent. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was taken as part of an emergency effort to trim $40.2 million from 
the county budget by laying off hundreds of workers beginning next month. 
Orange County filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 6, after disclosing that the 
investment pool run by the county treasurer had lost $2.02 billion from risky 
bond investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's unanimous decision Thursday, to rewrite seniority-based layoff 
policies that have been central to labor agreements, is not going to be 
accepted gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
 John H. Sawyer, head of the Orange County Employees Assn., which represents 
nearly 70% of the county work force, expressed outrage at the board's vote to 
allow department heads to order layoffs based on productivity. He said his 
group would consider a court challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The move could "violate the vested constitutional rights of county employees," 
and is "predicated on a crude and ill-thought out application of Chapter 11 to 
a Chapter 9 proceeding," said John Sawyer Jr., the employee group's attorney 
and son of its general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eliminating seniority seems to be designed to replace the merit system with 
favoritism," he said. "We're going to be evaluating our legal options." 
</P>
<P>
 Some bankruptcy law specialists say an oddity of municipal bankruptcy law 
allows the board action. 
</P>
<P>
 In revoking sections of their collective bargaining agreements with nearly 
16,000 county employees, supervisors and the county's attorney cited a 1984 
Supreme Court decision that says a company in bankruptcy can unilaterally 
abandon a collective bargaining agreement if revisions can't be agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
 That case involved the notorious Continental Airlines bankruptcy in 1983, when 
then-Chairman Frank Lorenzo took the airline into Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
specifically to break its union contracts during a protracted labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting at the behest of labor unions outraged by the airline's bankruptcy, 
Congress in 1984 added a section to the federal bankruptcy code that 
specifically overrode the Supreme Court decision and prohibited employers from 
canceling labor agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 But while that new provision was incorporated into Chapter 11, which regulates 
business reorganizations, Congress overlooked the little-used municipal 
bankruptcy rules of Chapter 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "They probably would have added to Chapter 9 if they had thought about it, but 
they didn't, and so the law (for government bankruptcies) gets thrown back" to 
the 1984 Supreme Court ruling, said Daniel J. Bussel, a UCLA law professor 
bankruptcy specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth N. Klee, a Los Angeles attorney who was minority counsel to the House 
Judiciary Committee when Chapter 9 was revised and updated in 1975, said there 
is a history of Congress exempting governments in bankruptcy from the same 
rules that bind private parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1975, when New York City was considering a Chapter 9 filing, it was 
considering abrogating its union contracts. and the unions were very opposed," 
Klee said. "But when Chapter 9 was revised (later that same year) there were no 
special provisions put in to protect unions and their collective bargaining 
agreements." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that because Chapter 9 doesn't include special protections for labor 
agreements, a municipal bankruptcy is governed by an older provision of 
bankruptcy law that allows a debtor to void any contract if it determines that 
honoring it would be financially harmful. 
</P>
<P>
 Klee, whose law firm is advising Orange County in its bankruptcy, declined to 
comment on the appropriateness of the county's action Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rich Reuben, a labor law specialist with the Newport Beach office of 
Pillsbury Madison & Sutro, said the county seems to be supported by current 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, there haven't been very many Chapter 9 filings, so there probably 
isn't anyone who really knows how a court would treat this," he said. "This 
case is going to set ground rules for handling a host of issues in the Chapter 
9 arena, and this issue of collective bargaining definitely will be one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Labor attorneys and representatives were reluctant Thursday to lash out at the 
county without seeing first just how far supervisors are willing to go to slash 
personnel costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely have a different view of the law from that which the county 
apparently has," said Sawyer, the employees association general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say right now that it is likely that we will go to court over this, 
but it is a possibility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal 
Employees union in Washington declined comment Thursday until the union has 
time to review the county action. AFSCME's Southern California Council 
represents 1,300 workers in the Orange County Social Services Department.

NEW COUNTY TREASURER IS NO STRANGER TO CRISES; FINANCE: THOMAS E. DAXON TOOK 
OVER A TROUBLED OKLAHOMA AUDITOR'S OFFICE IN 1978 THAT WAS IN SUCH DISARRAY 
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THREATENED TO CUT OFF FUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1980, the state auditor in Oklahoma was holding seminars for county 
treasurers, trying to persuade them to invest their idle public funds rather 
than let them sit in no-interest checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Thomas E. Daxon is a county treasurer, appointed in Orange County on 
Thursday to help recover from the catastrophic investments of his predecessor, 
Robert L. Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 Daxon, 48, was appointed to a four-month term, because Daxon is in demand. He 
already had been appointed Oklahoma's finance director, and it took an appeal 
from California Gov. Pete Wilson to Oklahoma Gov. David Walters to postpone 
that obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 Daxon won election as auditor in Oklahoma in 1978, unseating a 20-year 
Democratic incumbent who had let the office lapse to the point that the federal 
government was threatening to cut off federal funds. Daxon, then 32, became the 
only Republican to hold statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Oklahoma City, Daxon had been a Republican activist early on, 
serving as president of the Oklahoma College Republicans at Oklahoma State 
University, where he graduated with a degree in economics. He served as a youth 
coordinator for the 1968 Reagan campaign in Oklahoma. After graduation, he 
joined the staff of the Campus Crusade for Christ and the Tulsa CPA firm of 
Hurdman and Cranstoun. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in control of the state auditor's office, Daxon made changes that within 
a year restored the office to good standing with the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 He also began a series of controversial government audits, which opponents 
contended were politically motivated. He sued the state tax commission for 
access to its records, then issued a report accusing it of losing a fourth of 
its income-tax returns in 1978. Critics said he was merely positioning himself 
to run for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by voters' 1980 election of President Ronald Reagan, Daxon opposed 
incumbent Gov. George Nigh, a Democrat, in 1982. His campaign mirrored many of 
the successful Reagan tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Daxon criticized Nigh for "lavish spending," promised a 15% across-the-board 
income-tax cut and property tax cuts to be financed by reducing "governmental 
waste and inefficiency." But he was trounced by Nigh, who received 62% of the 
vote and became the first governor in Oklahoma history to win a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 As Daxon left the auditor's office in 1983, he issued a report listing 15 ways 
county governments could cut their costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: hiring temporary employees or rotating permanent employees among 
offices; sending state money directly to cities and school districts rather 
than relaying them, at added expense and delay, through the county treasurer; 
depositing tax money immediately into interest-bearing bank accounts to 
maximize interest yield. 
</P>
<P>
 He set up his own accounting firm in Tulsa and Oklahoma City, then in 1983 
moved his family to Virginia and signed on with accounting giant Arthur 
Andersen & Co., serving as an adviser on government audits and accounting until 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Daxon managed an investment partnership that made loans to bail out high-tech 
companies. He also took over a Resolution Trust processing center that had been 
criticized as nearly in chaos and later cleared up six months of unreconciled 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived in Orange County on Dec. 12 as head of a rescue delegation from 
Arthur Andersen & Co., but within 10 days was appointed to the county post. He 
will be paid the same wage that Citron received, about $8,667 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors had appointed Citron's chief aide, Matthew Raabe, as 
interim treasurer but reportedly became disenchanted by reports that Raabe 
continued to assure investors that their money was safe, even though the fund 
was collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
 Daxon reportedly has rented an apartment in Orange County and will fly his 
family here for the holidays.

NOTEBOOK; IRVINE'S IMAGE IS SUFFERING BUT NOT GARDEN GROVE'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 New respect: The financial crisis has gone a long way to change the images of 
some Orange County cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine -- long considered a model municipality with safe streets and 
outstanding schools -- now faces huge losses because of its investments in the 
county pool. The Irvine Unified School District is also suffering from the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceded one top Irvine official this week: "People are wondering if Irvine is 
still No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 None of that soul-searching exists in Garden Grove, one of the few cities that 
did not invest in the pool. Now, the city is getting new-found respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to make any Garden Grove jokes for a long, long time," said 
Fullerton Councilman Chris Norby. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Slow-news days: City and school district officials say that one of the most 
difficult parts of the financial crisis is the lack of solid information about 
the latest developments in the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Risner, La Habra's city manager, has a case in point. On Wednesday at 2:20 
p.m., he received a faxed news release from Supervisor Roger R. Stanton's 
office. The release, written by a public relations firm, was dated Dec. 16 -- 
five days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's fax," he mused. "Let's not talk about the inefficiencies of the 
U.S. Postal Service. They probably could have done it faster by Pony Express!" 
</P>
<P>
 Added Risner: "The press releases we're receiving from (the county's) public 
relations firm usually contain data that we read in the newspapers one to three 
days before." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pleasing procrastination: People who dumped their tax payments in the mail at 
the last minute have become heroes to some cash-strapped city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because all property tax payments received by the county before the 
Dec. 6 bankruptcy filing were frozen in the pool and won't be distributed to 
cities. The tax deadline was Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure all the people in Tustin were prudent and didn't pay until" the last 
minute, quipped Tustin Councilman Michael J. Doyle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parks feel the pinch: As a cost-savings measure forced by the bond crisis, 
most county regional park facilities will be closed the next two Mondays for 
the Christmas and New Year's holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 User permits and group reservations have been canceled for those two dates. 
Organizations hosting day-camp activities, sporting events or other activities 
should contact park offices about rescheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the county's camping parks, Ronald W. Caspers and O'Neill regional 
parks, will remain open Dec. 26 and Jan. 2.  
</P>
<P>
 Additional information is available from county parks officials at (714) 
834-6667 or (714) 771-6731. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 They'll be back: In Sacramento, state Auditor General Kurt R. Sjoberg 
announced Thursday that a preliminary report on the Orange County situation -- 
expected to be released today -- will be delayed until after the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Sjoberg said his team of five auditors, who met in Sacramento on Thursday 
after two weeks in Orange County surveying the fiscal landscape, determined 
there were "too many loose ends" left to be tied up before a report could be 
produced. 
</P>
<P>
 The team is expected to return to Orange County after New Year's Day and 
produce a report by the second week in January, Sjoberg said. The analysis will 
provide a "second opinion or some comfort" on cash flow and other issues as the 
county liquidates its failed investment portfolio, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sjoberg added that he doesn't feel the delay will hold up the county's efforts 
as it attempts to recover from the investment crisis. "I don't think that their 
own numbers are yet complete," he said. "Obviously if that's not complete, 
they're not going to be able to go forward." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bowing out: San Clemente City Treasurer Kenneth E. Carr sent out a news 
release Thursday announcing he would not seek reelection when his term expires 
in November, 1996. But he said the decision had nothing to do with the county 
financial crisis or San Clemente's $34-million investment in the troubled pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr said he made the decision shortly before the county's $2-billion losses 
were announced this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "While recognizing and accepting my responsibilities for city participation in 
the . . . (pool), I plan to devote my immediate energies and experiences to 
ensure that the financial interests of all San Clemente residents are enhanced 
in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Take my treasurer, please: Waving his latest canceled property tax check made 
out to former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, Laguna Niguel City 
Councilman Eddie Rose half-jokingly told the council this week: "We used to 
call Citron 'Sweet Old Bob.' Now we just use the initials." 
</P>
<P>
 The remark brought some wry smiles to the faces of council members and city 
staff, but no one laughed aloud.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; EDITORIAL COMMENTARY ACROSS THE NATION

 The nation's newspapers and magazines have had plenty to say about Orange 
County's plight: 
</P>
<P>
 If I were a resident of Orange County, Calif., and had just learned that the 
county had lost $1.5 billion of its $7.5-billion pool in derivatives trading, I

 In the mad dash for the exits of the Good Ship Orange County, the swifties of 
Wall Street have nothing on the politicians of America. Our elected officials 
profess to be just shocked and appalled that a government fund could have been

 The shock waves from the Orange County disaster will be felt for months. In 
the short term, other California counties may find it tough to raise 
funds....The meltdown also could invite an era of far more intense regulation 
in both the municipal and derivative markets -- both of which, until now, have 
largely avoided Washington's gaze.

SEEKING PEARLS, HE FINDS A GEM; POP MUSIC: DRUMMER JOSH FREESE MADE A BID TO 
JOIN ROCK'S HOTTEST-SELLING BAND. THOUGH HE DIDN'T GET THE GIG, HE'S EXCITED 
ABOUT HIS NEW GROUP, SLIDER. 
</P>

<P>
 Josh Freese has an interesting big-fish story to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Orange County-bred rock drummer, a wunderkind in alternative-rock 
circles with numerous impressive credits already notched at 22, the big one 
that got away was Pearl Jam. 
</P>
<P>
 Freese auditioned in October for the vacant drum chair in rock's 
hottest-selling band. He apparently was a finalist. Pearl Jam, which returns to 
live performance with benefit concerts Jan. 14 and 15 in Washington, D.C., has 
made no official announcement, but it appears the new drummer will be the 
veteran Los Angeles player Jack Irons, an old friend of the band. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was sitting on my butt right now, I'd be really bummed that I didn't get 
the Pearl Jam gig," Freese said Wednesday from his home in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the ever-enthusiastic drummer, who grew up in Placentia and began his 
touring career at 15, sounded as eager as ever as he talked about his hopes for 
his new band, Slider. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the trio is an unknown minnow in the rock world, but it has an 
opportunity to grow into a whale, or at least a good-size trout, thanks to a 
recording deal with A & M Records. Slider, which also includes two San 
Francisco-based players -- singer-guitarist Matt Winegar and a bassist known as 
Wic -- will play its first concert ever on Tuesday, opening for X at the Galaxy 
Concert Theatre in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Freese said Pearl Jam's bassist, Stone Gossard, first contacted him last 
summer about auditioning for the spot formerly held by Dave Abbruzzese, who was 
fired. Freese said that Abbruzzese had been a fan of Xtra Large, an Orange 
County band he played with in 1992-93, and that Gossard also had heard his 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the defunct Xtra Large, which put out a strong but commercially 
unsuccessful album on Giant Records, Freese had notched high-profile credits as 
a studio drummer for Suicidal Tendencies and Infectious Grooves, and as a 
member of Paul Westerberg's touring band. He also is the drummer on an upcoming 
album by Juliana Hatfield and plans to play on Westerberg's next solo album. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fun to play with (Pearl Jam)," Freese said of the audition in Seattle. 
"It was the first time I've literally jammed. We didn't play any of their 
songs. We just rocked for three or four days, improvised the whole time. They 
made me feel very comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Freese went back to Southern California to await the outcome, telling himself 
not to get his hopes up too high but also pondering the benefits of Pearl Jam 
membership: "I was really excited at the idea of not having to worry about 
money for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he had become enthralled with a demo tape put together by Winegar, 
a former member of Spent Poets and producer of two early Primus albums, and 
Wic, whose full name is William Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 Record producer Matt Wallace had introduced Freese to the two San Francisco 
rockers, who were planning to debut as a duo backed by session musicians. The 
three hit it off and began to play together. In November, Freese said, Slider's 
record deal came through, and Winegar and Coleman invited him to join as a 
full-fledged member. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Freese says he phoned Gossard at that point to ask about his standing with 
Pearl Jam. The answer, he said, was not definite: Gossard told him that Pearl 
Jam planned to work with another drummer, but it was possible that things could 
change and Freese would still be under consideration if they did. Pearl Jam's 
manager, Kelly Curtis, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of waiting some more for the big one to come in, Freese decided to 
join Slider, which takes its name from the title of an old T. Rex album. After 
spending most of his career as a session drummer and a hired touring pro, 
Freese said he was eager to be an intrinsic part of a band, involved in the 
songwriting, as he was in Xtra Large. In order to devote himself to Slider, he 
also turned down an offer to spend '95 touring with another high-profile band, 
Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slider is the kind of band I would be a fan of if I played in it or not," 
Freese said. "It's something I'll be able to grow with artistically as an equal 
member. I'd rather take the risk. The Slider record could come out and not sell 
a dozen copies. But I'd much rather be Josh Freese from Slider than Josh Freese 
from 30 different bands." 
</P>
<P>
 * Slider opens for X on Tuesday at the Galaxy Concert Theatre, 3503 S. Harbor 
Blvd., Santa Ana. 8 p.m. $19.50. (714) 957-0600.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 VANDAL-ISM: Actually, Josh Freese will maintain a rock 'n' roll equivalent of 
dual citizenship. Slider is his primary band, but he will continue to moonlight 
with the Vandals, the long-running Orange County/Long Beach satiric punk-rock 
band he joined about five years ago on a part-time basis. Drummer Chris 
Lagerborg, a member of the Joykiller, has been filling in on dates Freese can't 
make due to his other commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vandals are applying the finishing touches to their first studio album 
since 1991 and are planning to shop for a deal. Joey Escalante, the lone 
remaining founding member, says the Vandals' stock is running high these days 
thanks to punk's commercial explosion. The Offspring's singer, Bryan Holland, 
can be seen sporting a Vandals T-shirt in some shots of "Self Esteem," a video 
that airs incessantly on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six months ago we would have to beg decent labels to consider us," Escalante 
said. "Now they're coming out of the woodwork. (Members of the Offspring) have 
helped us enormously. They cited us before they got big, and now that they've 
gotten big, they still talk about us." 
</P>
<P>
 Escalante said that three of the four Offspring members -- Holland, Greg 
Kriesel and Ron Welty -- joined the Vandals at a recent San Diego show for a 
rendition of their 1982-vintage oldie "The Legend of Pat Brown."

NO PLAIN JAMES; BONEY, A NICKNAME HE GOT DURING LEAN YEARS AS A TOURING 
MUSICIAN, STUCK; NOW HE WANTS TO MAKE HIS NAME AS A SAXMAN WITH 'BACKBONE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saxophonist Boney James is familiar with the difficult life of a touring 
musician. In fact, it was during a low-paying overseas stint that he picked up 
his nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born James Oppenheim in 1961 in Lowell, Mass., and spent a number of 
years in the '80s toiling for the likes of the Isley Brothers, Sheena Easton, 
Bobby Caldwell and Teena Marie. It was during a 1987 European tour with 
vocalist Randy Crawford that the name he now carries surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in Norway -- Randy's real big over there -- doing an extended gig, 
and it was only paying $30 a day, which didn't cut it," said James, who plays 
the Galaxy Concert Theatre tonight on a1651076204to save some money. They said 
I'd end up being 'Boney' James. 
</P>
<P>
 "So Sekou Bunch, the bass player on the tour, kept introducing me as 'Boney.' 
The next thing I knew, I had a nickname." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't become his performing name until James cut his first album. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to make a decision about it," James said. "A lot of my musician friends 
thought of me as Boney, and the record company said that Oppenheim was not very 
catchy and that we needed to do something with the name. I said I had a 
nickname, and when I told them what it was, they loved it. I decided 'What the 
heck?' I'm used to it now. I think it actually intrigues people." 
</P>
<P>
 We'll never know whether James' career would have taken off so quickly had his 
recordings carried his birth name, but there's no denying that as "Boney" the 
saxophonist has done rather well. 
</P>
<P>
 James started playing the clarinet at 8 and the saxophone at 10. The family 
moved from Lowell to New Rochelle, N.Y., and then, in 1975, to Los Angeles. At 
19, while earning a history degree at UCLA, he started playing in the fusion 
band Line One. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the most fun I've ever had in my life. We opened for groups like 
Kitty Hawk, Flora Purim and Airto and the Yellowjackets. We basically (were no 
good), I'm sure, but we had fun." 
</P>
<P>
 James worked in a pizza joint to make ends meet but was looking into becoming 
a musician full time. He auditioned for Prince associate Morris Day's band as a 
keyboardist in 1985 and got the gig. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>

 Once James was inside the session scene, his fame began to spread, and he was 
called for a number of funk and pop gigs, doubling on sax and keyboards. In the 
meantime, he was making demo tapes in his home studio in the hopes of 
establishing a solo career. 
</P>
<P>
 While James was on the road in Japan with multi-instrumentalist Caldwell, the 
chance came. Caldwell's engineer, who had also produced albums for guitarist 
Marcos Loya and saxophonist Sam Riney, began to show an interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "And one day he called me and asked if I wanted to do a record," James said. 
"The next thing I knew, I was in the studio cutting these songs." 
</P>
<P>
 The result was "Trust," released by Spindletop Records in 1992, an album that 
got substantial radio play and worked its way onto the Billboard Contemporary 
Jazz chart. But the success proved to be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spindletop went bankrupt (and) the record just disappeared," James said. "It 
kept getting airplay, but people just couldn't find it to buy." 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't take long for James to land another, this time bigger, deal. 
Warner Bros. picked up "Trust" and reissued it this year. The label also 
released the saxophonist's most recent effort, "Backbone," which features 
guitarist Paul Jackson Jr. and percussionist Lenny Castro. The new disc has 
spent 25 weeks on the Billboard jazz chart. 
</P>
<P>
 James' appeal is easy to understand. Accessible beats and tunes strong on 
melody make his work well suited to the Adult Contemporary market. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I do best is take a bass line and make a whole pop opus out of it," 
James said. 
</P>
<P>
 His influences have largely determined his direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've listened to a big conglomeration of things. (Growing up) I was really 
into Yes, Jethro Tull -- the more musical bands that like to jam during the 
instrumental sections, like the Allman Brothers. As a kid, I really loved Barry 
White & the Love Unlimited Orchestra. It was funky and had those big 
instrumental sections. I thought this is really something." 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I heard Chick Corea's 'No Mystery' and got into fusion, people like Joe 
Farrell, Grover Washington Jr., L.A. Express, Ronnie Laws -- I really admired 
Ronnie Laws -- and Pat Metheny's first album for ECM. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the contemporary sax players, I really like Kirk Whalum. He's very 
emotional, very spiritual. I like sax playing that comes from an emotional, 
rather than a technical, place. Sure, I've listened to Michael Brecker and 
said, 'Isn't this great,' and transcribed the solos. But I like stuff that's 
much more song-oriented, melody-based stuff with phrases that are eloquently 
stated." 
</P>

<P>
 Just this week James has started to record his third album, which he hopes 
will be released by May or June. Though he still does the infrequent session 
supporting other players, his commitment, he said, is to his own career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Making records is a blast, an intensely satisfying thing to do," he said. "My 
main goal right now is to make myself a viable solo performer. I don't want to 
be considered a pop artist like Dave Koz and Kenny G. I'm not interested in 
that kind of success. But I am interested in making music."

QUAKE REBUILDING: HANG TOGETHER OR HANG SEPARATELY; A UNITED FRONT IS NEEDED TO 
MARSHAL THE HUGE SUMS OF NECESSARY AID MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are two important differences between the recovery periods following 
January's Northridge earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta temblor in the San 
Francisco Bay Area. One of those differences favors the Los Angeles area; the 
other certainly does not. We'll first consider the one that is good news for 
Los Angeles, because it figures to affect the other. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months after the Bay Area quake, there was considerable rancor among 
federal, state and local officials over what rebuidking and restoration 
projects would ultimately be approved and over the amount of federal funding 
that would be forthcoming. According to a 1993 report by the federal inspector 
general, the blame rested with regional officials of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency who "made frequent reference to ensuring the 'cost 
effectiveness' and 'reasonableness' of (the) applicant('s) permanent 
restoration design plans" without providing "any criteria for either of these 
concepts. As such, applicants' projects are constantly being evaluated against 
criteria that have not been made known to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, nothing so bureaucratically bizarre occurred in the Los Angeles 
area after the Northridge earthquake. The federal response was swift, and it 
surpassed the combined funding in seven natural disasters that devastated parts 
of the United States or territorial possessions from 1989 to 1993. In addition, 
the months following the Northridge temblor were marked by strong cooperation 
and agreement among federal, state and local officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the second difference -- the one that's clearly not pleasing to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the rebuilding effort had gotten underway after Loma Prieta, it was 
determined it would cost less to rebuild than first believed. That is far from 
the case here. In fact, the damage to public facilities alone in the Northridge 
earthquake now appears to have risen to $4.5 billion or even $6.5 billion, 
depending on the source. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has allocated about $3 billion for public facilities 
damaged by the quake and its aftershocks, and there is no dispute over the fact 
that federal funding in excess of that will be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions now are these: How much more federal money is legitimately 
needed, and will local, state and federal officials and California's 
congressional delegation display the unity and resolve needed to obtain it? The 
failure of California to produce its own source of funding for a 10% share of 
costs also looms large. 
</P>
<P>
 What we don't need is any repeat of what has occurred in the restoration of 
the Los Angeles Coliseum, where the foundations for future "skybox" suites 
seemed to have been thrown into the request. The public-policy goal is to 
repair the Buick, not to sue the money for a down payment on a Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, it is undeniable that much earthquake damage has 
been discovered only recently and that there has been damage from aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 One example: The City of Los Angeles is still assessing the damage to its 
enormous sewer system. This was not on the original list for quake aid; the 
damage became apparent only later, and it is considered extensive. A second 
example: An aftershock early this month appeared to have further damaged 
buildings at Olive View Medical Center in the east San Fernando Valley, raising 
repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet to be finalized are the negotiations over such big-ticket items as 
structures at UCLA and the USC Medical Center, where officials are hoping for 
perhaps more than $1.5 billion in funding. Already there is some dispute, but 
it has been handled quietly thus far. One sticky issue, say county officials, 
involves the psychiatric hospital at USC, which the school and others want 
replaced at a cost of $45 million to $65 million and for which federal 
officials seem inclined to offer only $1 million or so because they feel the 
building is not so badly damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't know how the new Congress and its leadership will respond to future 
requests for federal assistance for quake recovery. We do know that the spirit 
of compromise and cooperation that marked the initial months after the 
Northridge quake must continue. Only a united front among local, state and 
federal officials and the state's congressional delegation can persuade the 
rest of the nation to again open its pockets to make Southern California whole.
