 HOLDING ON: So far, so good for Metrolink. It's been just under a week since 
the Golden State-Antelope Valley freeway interchange reopened, and there's been 
no decline in ridership from the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys to Los 
Angeles. . . . But things could change in August, said Metrolink spokesman 
Peter Hidalgo, because that's when some commuters who hold monthly passes may 
choose to go back to driving. 
</P>
<P>
 COMING COMET: The big event is only a few days away. No, not the World Cup 
final. Heavens no. It's the long-awaited start Saturday of collisions by pieces 
of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 into Jupiter, which will continue for about a week. . 
. . The Valley's amateur astronomers are getting ready. Ray Coutchie of 
Woodland Hills plans to watch through his telescope near Frazier Park. "I don't 
know what I'll see, but I'm excited," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 BODY TALK: Your words may declare one thing, your body (above) quite another. 
So says a Pierce College lecturer on body language. A columnist discovers what 
it means if people cross their arms right over left, or if they stand with open 
palms. . . . And watch out for those who laugh with their eyes open. Not to be 
trusted at all. (B5) 
</P>
<P>
 MORE GUARDIANS: They're no angels, but they are doing their best for their 
community. They are the Guardian Eyes of Van Nuys, a neighborhood watch group 
that will hold a garage sale this weekend (B3). . . . But don't confuse them 
with the Guardian Angels, who set up shop locally last month. "There's plenty 
of room for lots of guardians in Van Nuys," said Eye member Leslie Bashaar. 
</P>
<P>
 TANKS AND GOODBYE: The Air Force is on a tank-destroying mission in the 
Mojave. Edwards Air Force Base is removing underground storage tanks that might 
pose environmental risks. . . . "We have got the dirtiest tanks out," said Don 
Cowen, project manager for the Underground Storage Tanks program (B18). Michael

 ATTENTION SHOPPERS: If you're at The Oaks mall tomorrow, prepare to compete 
with 120 Japanese sailors for bargains. . . . Three ships from the Japanese 
navy will berth at the Port of Hueneme on Friday for a debriefing after 
military exercises in the U.S. Navy's sea test range. Most of the 700 Japanese 
sailors will remain on base, playing golf or munching a barbecued meal. But 120 
lucky sailors get a "shop-op" at The Oaks. The mall plans to serve soft drinks 
and cookies and open a special room for the sailors to store their shopping 
bags.

 BIGGER FISH: Bud Smith has long shaped the Oxnard skyline. . . . First, he 
built the Wagon Wheel, then two towering office buildings. Now, Oxnard's real 
estate mogul has bigger fish in mind. He wants to build a public aquarium at 
Channel Islands Harbor like the one in Monterey to draw tourists (B1). . . . "I 
guess it's kind of selfish of me, because I've got so many properties down 
there," Smith said. "But I really believe it will be good for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 DEW DROP INN: Figured out a destination for your vacation? How about Santa 
Paula? Or Ventura? Or Ojai? Ventura County has seven bed and breakfast inns. 
And a surprising number of local residents seek refuge in their quaint or cozy 
rooms (Ventura County Life, Page 8). . . . Some vacationers can't afford to 
take off for two weeks, said Santa Paula innkeeper Cheryl Eigenhuis. "They 
don't want to spend all their time on the road," she said. So they hunt for 
spots to get away for a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
 HEMMED IN: Pity the badger. And the California coast horned lizard. And the 
Lodderhead shrike. . . . These are among the species that roam the shrinking 
wildlife corridor that stretches from the Pacific Ocean to the western Conejo 
Valley. . . . The corridor will narrow a bit more with Thousand Oaks' approval 
of the Dos Vientos housing project (B5). "This is a very high-quality habitat," 
said state park and recreation's Richard Rozzelle. "And we do not feel there 
can be any overriding consideration that would justify the extinction of these 
species."

MUSIC REVIEW; WILLIAMS & FRIENDS: ODD MIX AT BOWL; CONDUCTOR'S SOUFFLE: ADD A 
LITTLE PERLMAN, A DASH OF RONSTADT, A HINT OF E.T 
</P>

<P>
 World Cup Week at Hollywood Bowl continued its pretentious and circuitous 
course on Tuesday with the unsettling combination of two dissimilar pops 
concerts in one glitzy package. 
</P>
<P>
 Before intermission, a stoic John Williams showed his classical affinities 
(everything is relative) by waving the Los Angeles Philharmonic through a 
familiar Glinka overture and some Tchaikovsky goo: the hum-along violin 
concerto with Itzhak Perlman as stellar soloist. Then, for a would-be piece de 
resistance , the fiddler returned in a couple of excerpts from the maestro's 
score for the film "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 So much for high art. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission came a fancy fanfare by Williams, an unscheduled medley of 
tunes from Disney films, a half hour of Linda Ronstadt in classy-chantoozie 
ballads arranged by Nelson Riddle, and -- just before the clock struck 11 and 
overtime-costs loomed -- a sweet suite from another great cinematic hit by 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for easy listening. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole, in this instance, equaled less than the parts. Williams presided 
with speedy, unobtrusive efficiency over an amazingly proficient, minimally 
rehearsed Philharmonic in the so-called classical numbers. The more the 
repertory turned slurpy, the more animated and the more assertive he became. 
Interpretive conviction seemed to increase in inverse relation to musical 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The programming may have lacked consistency of focus. That's the 
understatement of the week. But the performances were never less than smooth. 
</P>
<P>
 Smooth? Make that slick. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Russlan and Ludmilla" overture ticked along briskly, not brusquely. In 
the typographical error of the week, the pathetic program booklet called 
Glinka's opera " Russian and Ludmilla." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tchaikovsky concerto found Perlman playing with the virtuosic ease and 
silken tone for which he is famous, and with the emotional detachment for which 
he is infamous. At this point in his brilliant career, he could drive this 
vehicle in his sleep, and he occasionally appears to be doing just that. 
</P>
<P>
 The simple formulas and modal cliches from Williams' "Schindler" soundtrack -- 
10 minutes in all -- found Perlman reading the score, and reading eloquently. 
The well-made, fundamentally commercial music exerts a gentle elegiac appeal 
even if it trivializes the cataclysmic tragedy that it is intended to 
accompany. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The "fun" part of the evening, which didn't always find this reporter on terra 
cognita , began with Williams' brassy ode to "Liberty." According to the 
pathetic program booklet, the agenda was supposed to continue with a "Salute to 
MGM." Without explanation, Williams & friends substituted a set of syrupy 
concoctions from the Disney kitchen. A spokesman identified the arranger as one 
Ferguson, but couldn't provide his/her first name. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact nature of the vocal portion of the festivities remained something of 
a mystery to the uninitiated. The pathetic program booklet listed only these 
words: "Nelson Riddle arrangements for orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
 No titles. No composers. No authors. 
</P>
<P>
 A biographical blurb did tell us that Ronstadt is "both a gifted pure singer . 
. . and a versatile interpreter of songs and style." 
</P>
<P>
 Gifted? Certainly. A pure singer? Beats me. Versatile? Not on the basis of 
Tuesday's evidence, but she is remembered for pleasant crossover excursions as 
Puccini's Mimi and Gilbert & Sullivan's Mabel. 
</P>
<P>
 A stranger in her current paradise recognized "Bewitched, Bothered and 
Bewildered" and "Am I Blue?" among the six languid songs offered. He also 
recognized "Happy Birthday, Dear Linda," with which some fans in the upper 
reaches serenaded the microphone diva. He also noted the obvious appeal of her 
suave and smoky timbre, the insinuating clarity of her diction, and the 
extraordinary strength of her breath control. 
</P>
<P>
 The pathetic program booklet labeled Williams' not-so-grand finale "Adventures 
on Earth." With the first maudlin measures it became clear, however, that 
"E.T." had come home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Bowl's renovated amplification system worked best when it was turned up 
loudest. That isn't a compliment to the designing engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 * The hills were alive with the sound of airplanes. Eight in all. The most 
effective intrusions occurred during Perlman's fragile cadenzas. 
</P>
<P>
 * The official audience headcount reached 14,048. That's 13 more heads than 
were counted at the Van Cliburn demi-concert the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 * The top ticket price for Perlman and Ronstadt was $150. That's $100 less 
than for Cliburn.

MOVIE REVIEW; THE SECRET LIFE OF 'TRUE LIES'; EXCITING ACTION IS UNDERCUT BY 
FILM'S MEANNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 James Cameron has a most active imagination. Not for him the mere copying of 
what has gone before, even if his past does include "Aliens," "The Terminator" 
and "Terminator 2." Compelled to come up with sequences that other manipulators 
of mayhem have yet to imagine, he pushes the envelope further and further into 
the unknown with each film he makes. 
</P>
<P>
 So "True Lies," Cameron's latest $100-million-plus effort as a 
writer-director, considerably ups the ante for action films with snazzy 
sequences like a horse and motorcycle chase through a hotel and the inventive 
use of Harrier jets (capable of both flying horizontally and hovering like 
helicopters). As the perfectionist creator of bravura set pieces, Cameron is 
still the leader of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the director's past films, "True Lies" is not nonstop action. Based on 
a French film called "La Totale!," it is partly a romantic spoof of action 
films in general and James Bond-type spy thrillers in particular. Even though 
this halfway house approach means less time for explosions, both Cameron and 
star Arnold Schwarzenegger prove pleasantly adept at kidding the superhuman 
image they've worked so hard to build up elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, and yet . . . . Despite all this success, all is not well with "True 
Lies." A strain of crudeness and mean-spirited humiliation, especially toward 
women, runs through the film like a nasty virus, vitiating all it touches. Most 
audiences, understandably diverted, will either not notice or perhaps not even 
mind, but it is disturbing and it shouldn't be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 The crux of that original French film is a twist on a Scarlet Pimpernel theme 
about a secret agent whose life is a secret to those closest to him. While 
timid Helen Tasker (Jamie Lee Curtis) thinks her husband of 15 years is a 
plodding computer salesman, in reality he's an ace operative for Omega Sector, 
"The Last Line of Defense," one of those clandestine government bureaus that 
filmmakers hold dear. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaker of six languages (all, apparently, with an Austrian accent) and a whiz 
with weapons and gadgetry, Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) is introduced in a 
Bond-like scene crashing a heavily guarded party hosted by a wealthy Arab 
banker and his femme fatale girlfriend Juno (Tia Carrere). 
</P>
<P>
 Both in that sequence and the ones that follow, "True Lies" is able to 
effectively kid itself, to playfully mock the conventions of espionage 
thrillers. Casting the breezy Tom Arnold as Harry's partner Gib helps, but more 
important is Cameron's unerring ability to find the humor in Schwarzenegger, 
something the people at "Last Action Hero," for instance, were unable to 
manage. 
</P>
<P>
 But, while Harry's been busy defending the free world, his marriage has been 
disintegrating faster than a U.N. cease-fire, and "True Lies' " plot revolves 
around his attempts to hold it together while duking it out with Juno, her 
cohorts at the terrorist Crimson Jihad and their stock of stolen nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Being the kind of exceptional action director it takes to bring all this off 
demands, in part, a willingness never to grow up, to retain a young person's 
enthusiasm for violence and things that explode. And it's that streak of 
juvenilia, unfortunately, that has come out in "True Lies" in other ways as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken individually, the cruder and childish things about this film, its 
determination to use caricatured unshaven Arabs as terrorists, the pleasure it 
takes in continually mortifying a weasely used-car salesman (Bill Paxton) in 
the most personal ways, might be overlooked, but added together they leave a 
sour taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more off-putting is "True Lies' " treatment of women, specifically 
Curtis' character. Although having Helen play most of the film as plain and 
mousy is perfectly OK, an extended sequence where she awkwardly prances around 
a hotel suite in skimpy underwear, although obviously meant to be funny, comes 
across as an exercise in painful humiliation. Perhaps Cameron, whose earlier 
films were noted for their strong women, simply lost his bearings in this new 
genre and miscalculated his effects, but the results are not pleasant to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, it could be argued, all this is taking a bit of diversionary fluff 
far too seriously. On the other hand, when a staggering sum of money is spent 
on a film that will get the widest possible exposure worldwide, a society 
ignores the regrettable parts of its message (which includes a casual approach 
to wholesale slaughter) only at its own risk. Good as he is in so many areas, 
even a celebrated perfectionist like Cameron can't perfect what he doesn't know 
how to do. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R for "a lot of action/violence and some language." Times 
guidelines: a very high body count and a general air of hostility, especially 
toward women.

 MTV Nominations: Rock group Aerosmith led the pack with seven nods, followed 
closely by pop band R.E.M. with six, in the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards 
nominations, announced Wednesday. Both groups were nominated for the year's 
best video (for "Cryin' " and "Everybody Hurts," respectively), along with the 
rap group Beastie Boys ("Sabotage") and Seattle's Nirvana ("Heart-Shaped Box"), 
which was led by the late Kurt Cobain. The latter two bands were also among the 
most nominated, with four nods each. Other top nominees included alternative 
singer Bjork ("Human Behaviour"), named in five categories, among them best 
female video; and pop divas En Vogue ("Runaway," "Whatta Man") and New Age 
group Deep Forrest ("Sweet Lullaby"), each nominated four times. The awards 
will be held in New York on Sept. 8, hosted by Roseanne Arnold. Performers 
include Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers and Snoop Doggy Dogg.

 Triple 'Dateline': NBC News is expected to combine its newsmagazine operations 
under the umbrella title of "Dateline NBC." News president Andrew Lack has 
wanted to put the newsmagazines into a "strip" across prime time for several 
months. NBC already is airing "Dateline NBC" two nights a week this summer, 
with Jane Pauley and Stone Phillips as anchors. The staff of the weekly "Now," 
currently anchored by Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric, is expected to be folded 
into the "Dateline" staff. Network sources also said that the third "Dateline" 
evening might be anchored by rotating NBC anchors, allowing Brokaw and Couric 
to devote more time to their daily programs -- "NBC Nightly News," which Brokaw 
anchors, and the "Today" show, which Couric co-anchors.

 * Fox Plans Simpson Movie: Fox confirmed Wednesday that it is developing a TV 
movie about the still-unfolding O.J. Simpson case. No details were provided, 
but the project was listed among original films planned for "Fox Night at the 
Movies" this season. Others include biographies of Mia Farrow and Madonna, a 
movie about the 30-year-old Boston Strangler case and a drama about a family 
that "finds itself in an unrelenting battle of life or death when a wrathful

 River Phoenix Estate Sued: The estate of actor River Phoenix, who died of a 
drug overdose outside a Los Angeles nightclub on Nov. 1, has been sued by 
insurance and production companies that claim they lost millions of dollars in 
conjunction with two unreleased movies he had committed to before his death. 
Both lawsuits, filed in the Aluchua County, Fla., Circuit Court where Phoenix's 
will is filed, allege the 23-year-old actor broke his contracts by denying 
illegal drug use during an August, 1993, physical examination. One suit is in 
conjunction with the almost-completed "Dark Blood," which was scrapped after 
Phoenix died, forcing insurers to pay producers and financiers almost $5.5 
million. The other centers on the film version of Ann Rice's "Interview With a 
Vampire." Producers recast Phoenix's role with Christian Slater, but still want 
more than $185,000 in damages. Phoenix's will, written in February of 1993, is 
under seal. RADIO

company, will be presented Oct. 6, and Fiesta Navidad, a holiday mariachi 
celebration, on Dec. 11. According to the agreement, the center will provide 
"significant technical and publicity support" while the Philharmonic will

ART REVIEW; THE UNUSUAL WORLD OF ROBERT OVERBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A well-chosen group of sculptures by Robert Overby (1935-1993) at Sue Spaid 
Fine Art pays overdue homage to this little-known artist's curious oeuvre. 
</P>
<P>
 From July, 1969, to August, 1973, Overby made 336 paintings, prints and cast 
objects. A graphic designer by trade, he catalogued each piece in a compact, 
fully illustrated handbook that records, like a Minimalist diary, the date, 
title, dimensions and materials of every item. 
</P>
<P>
 The chronicle begins with snazzy abstractions on shaped canvases. It swiftly 
moves through various renditions of such Pop objects as Coca-Cola bottles, 
clothes pins, hangers, flash lights, light bulbs, pencils and socks. Overby's 
selection of mundane articles echoes the anonymous objects Jasper Johns used in 
his art in the 1950s and 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Latex rubber casts of doors, windows, walls, stairways and even an entire 
living room follow, signaling the onset of Overby's artistic maturity. These 
detailed, skin-like sculptures precede his paintings of portraits and nudes and 
account for almost half of his catalogued work. The exhibition rightly focuses 
on a dozen of these fragile, well-preserved casts. 
</P>
<P>
 The most impressive are a set of bright orange and yellow kitchen cabinets and 
a wooden garage door's front and back sides. Each piece hangs on the wall like 
a droopy, textured bedsheet that exactly duplicates the contours of the 
household fixture from which it was cast. Running across the floor are two 
30-foot-long strips of rubber that bear the imprint of a brick wall and evoke 
tire tracks or skid marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Overby used some of his latex casts as molds for more rigid fiberglass 
sculptures, including a beautiful, blue screen-door and an electric-yellow 
door-frame that resembles a homeless 3-D "zip" from a Barnett Newman painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Overby also sewed canvas versions of selected latex casts. Unpainted, 
extremely detailed and meticulously stitched, they're less flexible but more 
durable than his rubber works. He called these pieces maps and modeled them on 
anything from broken windows to the corners of rooms.

 His art recalls that of Claes Oldenburg, Bruce Nauman, Gordon Matta-Clark and 
James Rosenquist. Overby's work is distinct, however, because of its diaristic 
nature. His tireless recording of the everyday environment -- and his thorough 
cataloguing of the activity -- leave you with ample evidence that the ordinary 
world is full of wonder, if seen from the right angle.

JAZZ REVIEW; MCLEAN'S LESSONS IN BE-BOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jackie McLean is a be-bop dinosaur. One of the few surviving horn players who 
can claim a direct lineage to Charlie Parker, Bud Powell and Miles Davis, he 
continues, at 62, to be among the most identifiably personal voices in jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 McLean's opening night appearance at Catalina Bar & Grill on Tuesday, however, 
did not always display the alto saxophonist at his finest. The brightly 
cutting, almost abrasive wail that is his trademark sound was fully evident, as 
were the sometimes frenetic phrasing and animated articulation that are equally 
essential to his style. But also present, occasionally to distraction, was a 
tendency to push his pitch far too close to the edge of sharpness, and a few 
too many musical lapses of concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, at his best, as he was in a surging romp through "Night in Tunisia," 
McLean can bring the be-bop era to life. His mid-'60s flirtation with 
avant-garde jazz and his more recent involvement with educational matters 
seemed, at least on this evening, to have been set aside in favor of classic, 
straight-ahead blowing. 
</P>
<P>
 The accompanying Cedar Walton Trio, with David Williams on bass and Billy 
Higgins on piano, had some good and bad moments. Walton was superb, spinning 
out gorgeous be-bop lines with a remarkably keen sense of tone and balance. 
Williams added several superlative solo passages, and Higgins demonstrated, as 
he has throughout the years, a capacity to effortlessly move from masterful 
section playing to timbrally fascinating soloing. 
</P>
<P>
 Less appealing was an intermittent failure by Williams and Higgins to agree 
upon rhythmic emphasis, with Higgins pushing the top, and Williams tending 
toward the bottom of the beat. Fortunately, it was a minor annoyance in an 
otherwise engaging evening.

CULVER CITY CONSIDERS 11% SURCHARGE ON CELLULAR PHONES; FINANCES: OFFICIALS SAY 
THE TAX WOULD ADD $60,000 TO BEEF UP SOME SERVICES, SUCH AS PARK SUPERVISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Culver City may soon join the growing list of Los Angeles County communities 
that tax cellular phone users. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council two weeks ago voted 3 to 2 to tentatively approve an 
ordinance that would extend an 11% utility users tax to cellular telephone 
users with a Culver City billing address. The tax would cost Culver City users 
an average of $4 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Steven Gourley, Edward Wolkowitz and Mike Balkman voted in favor of 
the tax; James D. Boulgarides and Mayor Albert Vera opposed it. The council 
will vote again on the tax July 18. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the additional revenue from the cellular phone tax would 
allow the city to beef up some services, such as park supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 A growing number of cities, including Santa Monica, Malibu and Los Angeles, 
have implemented cellular phone taxes in recent years. Los Angeles and Santa 
Monica both impose a 10% tax; Malibu's is 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on reports that some of those cities have seen a 2.5% to 4% increase in 
revenue from the taxes, Culver City officials estimated an initial $60,000 
annual boost in revenue to the $43.8-million budget for the 1994-95 fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax would go into effect by Oct. 1, after the phone company sets up a 
billing system. In the future, officials said the city could expect an 
additional annual revenue of $80,000, based on the extension of the tax to 
other mobile communications services -- a catchall phrase meant to encompass 
future developments in communications. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax would be based on the standard fixed monthly access charge, said 
Candice Maloney, a spokeswoman for L.A. Cellular, one of the larger companies 
providing cellular phone service to Culver City. "For instance, if a customer 
has a plan where they pay $69 for 100 minutes, the $69 would be taxed. It has 
nothing to do with how much they use the phone, or where they call. Air time 
and usage is not taxed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far the company has not received any complaints from customers, Maloney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. Cellular never enjoys playing the role of tax collector, but we're 
always happy to work with local municipalities," Maloney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents said the tax would send a negative message to Culver City 
businesses. During the next council meeting, Vera said, he will ask the council 
to shelve the idea for six months, saying that the timing for the tax proposal 
was poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't raise taxes right after balancing a budget," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he said, he would seek alternatives. "I would go after some 
of those fat (administrative) salaries before taxing people." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that representatives from the Sony studios on Washington Boulevard 
have complained. A spokesperson for Sony could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera also said that because the city has balanced its budget, the need for 
additional revenue is not crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 Gourley countered that, based on the experience of the other cities, the tax 
is an ideal revenue source. He is confident that the proposed ordinance will be 
approved on the next vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone else is taxing," he said. "So why not do it here instead of letting 
Los Angeles take it away from us?" 
</P>
<P>
 Other utilities taxed by the city includes gas, electric, telephone, water and 
cable television.

TINY BUGS, MAJOR MESS; INSECTS: APHIDS' STICKY DROPPINGS ARE BUGGING BEVERLY 
HILLS RESIDENTS. ONE SOLUTION IS TO CUT DOWN THE STATELY TREES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There is something bugging the residents of Beverly Hills: an infestation of 
woolly aphids, pesky insects that are tiny in size but which have created a 
major mess. 
</P>
<P>
 The aphids hang out on tree leaves and drip their sticky excrement, 
euphemistically called "honeydew," on anything and everything below. The gooey 
stuff covers streets, sidewalks, cars and the soles of pedestrians' shoes. When 
tracked into homes it makes carpets sticky and dark with dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fun to walk outside anymore," declared resident David Gingold. 
"They're eating away at the quality of life in Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 So serious is the problem, in fact, that the city is debating a plan to cut 
down aphid-friendly trees and replace them with trees that are inhospitable to 
the insects. Such an effort, however, would be sure to draw criticism, since it 
would mean doing away with stately elms and ash trees and planting replacements 
that would take years to reach similar size. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember, you're taking out 60-year-old trees and putting in little stick 
trees. There would be virtually no shade," said Steve Miller, director of the 
Beverly Hills Recreation and Parks Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Aphids are nothing new. They make their presence felt every year in the spring 
and early summer. But this year, experts say, the aphid infestation has been 
particularly severe. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot weather, coupled with substantial growth of the insects' favorite 
trees -- the Arizona ash and the American elm -- has created an aphids' 
paradise. Portions of Los Angeles, including the Fairfax District and the area 
south of Beverly Hills, have reported similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills, however, is believed to have a particularly serious problem 
because it has such a high concentration of Arizona ash and American elm trees 
in a relatively small area, Miller said. More than 3,000 of those tree species 
line 26 residential streets, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've received a few hundred calls about the aphids over the last month, 
mostly people complaining about the sticky honeydew," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woolly aphids are roughly the size of a pencil tip and can be identified 
by their white, fuzzy appearance. The insects live on the underside of leaves 
and suck the juices, or carbohydrates, from the new spring growth, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents' angry telephone calls about the aphids peaked around Memorial Day 
weekend -- probably because the insects despoiled decks and patio furniture set 
out for traditional barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected officials are feeling the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know how terrible it is. (Councilman) Allan (Alexander) and I both live on 
blocks that are severely impacted," Mayor Vicki Reynolds said to a handful of 
residents who recently complained to the Beverly Hills City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander said he had received many calls from residents. "Their comments 
range from 'Tear out the trees' . . . with adjectives attached, to 'You haven't 
done enough trimming,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills City Manager Mark Scott said the city has called arborists, 
entomologists and county agricultural experts in search of a way to control the 
aphids. But, unfortunately, the options appear to be limited, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spraying water or soap onto the underside of leaves brings only short-term 
relief, and citywide spraying of pesticides is no longer recommended because of 
concerns about the toxicity.  
</P>
<P>
 "No experts will even be part of (pesticide spraying)," Scott told the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as in past years, the feeling is to let nature take its course -- with a 
little help from the city. As part of an overall integrated pest management 
program, millions of lacewings, ladybugs and midges have been released into the 
areas of aphid infestation, pitting bug against bug. 
</P>
<P>
 The lacewings and the other "beneficial insects" eat the aphids and then, in 
turn, are eaten by birds. Releases of these insects were doubled in May to once 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Experts are saying that what we're doing is all we can do. It is just so much 
worse this year," Scott said. "We just don't know when the beneficial insect 
program will get ahead of it." 
</P>
<P>
 At the recent council meeting, one resident suggested helicopters could drop 
water from the air to wash the trees, or else the fire department could use 
their high-pressure hoses to spray the trees from below. 
</P>
<P>
 But desperate times call for desperate measures. Gingold, who lives on a 
so-called aphid hot-spot street, dubbed the trees a public nuisance and 
demanded the city remove them immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've put up with it for years, and now we need a long-term solution," he 
said. "It comes down to aesthetics of the street compared to quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the aphid problems and the overall declining health of ash and elm 
trees, city officials are likely to agree those species must be replaced, 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, replacing the trees is not an easy, speedy -- or cheap -- solution. 
To buy about 3,000 trees of species that do not attract aphids would cost about 
$3 million, Miller has estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing the trees would also affect the character of the city's streets, now 
lushly green and shaded by the old, stately trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members have suggested that there will be some citizen opposition 
to whatever action is taken. Some residents are likely to oppose any tree's 
removal; others may want all the ash and elm trees taken out at once. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the department was working on computer-aided pictures that would 
show residents what their streets would look like when the old trees were 
removed and replaced with trees about 36 inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid a denuded appearance, Miller said, the city could replace one-third 
of the 20-plus trees on a block every few years. In eight to 10 years, all the 
ash and elm trees could be replaced with several species of trees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While city officials pledge to do what they can -- stepping up street cleaning 
and continuing to consult with experts -- residents this year may simply have 
to wait out the aphids. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to think we're getting close to the hump and things will get 
better soon," Miller said. "But I'd better not go out on a limb and predict 
that. Mother Nature has a way of doing what she wants."

SANTA MONICA COUNCIL PREPARES TO ISSUE SKATING BAN; REGULATION: OFFICIALS CITE 
SAFETY CONCERNS IN PLAN THAT WOULD ALSO PROHIBIT SKATEBOARDING AT THIRD STREET 
PROMENADE AND DOUGLAS PARK. AFICIONADOS OF THE SPORT DECRY PROPOSAL AT PUBLIC 
HEARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite pleas from aficionados of roller skating, the Santa Monica City 
Council on Tuesday set the stage to ban roller skates, in-line skates and 
skateboards from the Third Street Promenade and Douglas Park because of safety 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The council balked, however, at giving city park and traffic officials the 
authority to select specific places for such bans, should they become 
necessary, without council approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, each proposed ban, including the Promenade and Douglas Park, must be 
approved by a resolution of the City Council after notices are posted warning 
the public of the proposed action. No date was set for reconsidering the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Park was proposed as a place to ban bicycles and skates because it 
caters to a large population of older people, who have complained about safety 
and have requested restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the ban at the Promenade on all forms of skating was postponed, 
officials and council members left little doubt they believed it to be 
necessary. Police reported a recent accident in which a person on in-line 
skates mowed down three people. 
</P>
<P>
 A Promenade official complained about skaters zooming down the crowded 
three-block outdoor mall, putting others at peril. And Councilman Ken Genser, 
who walks with a cane, referred to how his own impaired mobility has affected 
him when confronted by skaters. "I have often felt threatened on the 
Promenade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Asha Greenberg said she favored also banning bicycles on the 
Promenade, but the city attorney said state law prevents the city from banning 
bicycles from a roadway -- even a barricaded one. 
</P>
<P>
 During a public hearing, skaters decried the proposed ban on their hobby, 
saying it curtailed freedom and would force them to rely on pollution-creating 
cars, instead of energy-efficient skates, to get around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't shut down a viable way of transportation for real people," said Mike 
Feinstein. "I reject the idea it's a public-safety hazard."

 Two earthquakes shook the Westside and other parts of Los Angeles County 
shortly before midnight Monday, Caltech reported. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11:49 p.m. Sunday, a 3.6-magnitude quake struck three miles southeast of 
Simi Valley, seismologist Jim Mori said. It was followed at 11:50 p.m. by a 
3.7-magnitude temblor in the same location. Both were aftershocks from the Jan. 
17 Northridge quake, Mori said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reports of injuries or damages, but the jolts were felt strongly 
across the Westside.

TOPICS / MEDICINE; FILM WIZARD LENDS A HAND (AND A GALLBLADDER AND . . .) 
</P>

<BYLINE>

By KURT PITZER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Flanked by the severed heads and drooling monsters he created for movies such 
as "Aliens" and "Slumber Party Massacre," Rick Lazzarini seems an unlikely 
pioneer for the health sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 One might not expect the man behind television's Foster Farms chickens and 
Duracell boxers to know much about the human pancreas or bile duct. 
</P>
<P>
 But with techniques honed for Hollywood, the puppeteer and special effects 
wizard has crafted a set of lifelike organs to help train surgeons for the 
developing field of endoscopic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Practicing with Lazzarini's silicone and rubber hernia or uterus models, 
surgeons say, could help dramatically lower the number of botched jobs that 
have plagued early endoscopy -- the use of tiny video cameras and surgical 
tools inserted into the patient through extremely thin tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surgeons have been searching for models to work on forever," said Dr. Leo 
Gordon of EndoCare, a West Los Angeles-based surgery center that developed the 
models with Lazzarini. "This is the closest you can get to the real thing 
without a beating heart and an anesthesiologist yelling at you." 
</P>
<P>
 The use of endoscopy revolutionized surgery during the late 1980s. The 
technique meant shorter hospital stays and smaller scars for patients needing 
relatively minor operations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the procedure required surgeons nationwide to trade scalpels for a whole 
new set of tools and watch their movements on a video screen instead of 
directly in the patient. 
</P>
<P>
 As surgeons quickly tried to learn the tricky, Nintendo-like methods of 
removing gallbladders, treating hernias and diagnosing stomach, lung and eye 
problems, mistakes were made. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the largest postgraduate training effort ever attempted," Dr. Edward 
H. Phillips, director of endoscopic surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 
said of the switch to the new method. "There was simply no precedent or systems 
to train the 20,000 to 25,000 surgeons who wanted to learn the technique right 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Some older and less-nimble surgeons had trouble adapting. In 1992, New York 
hospital data revealed a rise in injuries to gallbladder patients since 
laparoscopic surgery -- endoscopic surgery performed through the abdomen -- 
became a popular method of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear the surgeons needed practice. The demand for practice subjects 
became a boon for pig farmers, who suddenly found hospitals a market for 
thousands of their animals. The gastrointestinal systems of swine are similar 
to those of humans. 
</P>
<P>
 But pig parts wear out. Gordon said he and EndoCare Director Stephen Shapiro 
built a box in 1990 to simulate the human frame but were "frantic" to find 
materials that resembled human tissue to put inside. They tried broccoli 
spears. Too soft. They tried elbow macaroni. It ripped too easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Gordon said, EndoCare office manager Nancy Senter, tired of grocery 
shopping one item at a time, pointed out the office window toward the nearby 
Fox Studios building. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said: 'Look over there. If they can make aliens fly out of Sigourney 
Weaver's chest, they can probably make you a gallbladder,' " Gordon said. "So 
we made a few calls and married the two great industries of medicine and 
Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 At his Canoga Park studio, the Character Shop, Lazzarini demonstrated one of 
his newest inventions, peeling back the silicone skin from a face model that 
may soon be on the market for simulated plastic surgery and face lifts. On a 
table next to him sat a model of a knee with an authentic bone structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Although neither is fully developed, Lazzarini said, they represent the 
mushrooming possibilities for endoscopic surgery. So far, the Character Shop is 
believed to be the only company in the nation making such models. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, he keeps several staff artists busy molding and painting models of 
the uterus, gallbladder and hernia for dozens of orders from hospitals and 
practitioners in the United States and Europe. They work alongside others 
creating mechanical horses, elephant heads and ghoulish masks for films and TV 
ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's kind of an irony there," Lazzarini said. "On one film, we might be 
spilling someone's intestines out, but the next week the same person could be 
working on a model with the viscera intact." 
</P>
<P>
 Creatures for the movies must look real from the outside, but when designing 
surgery models, Lazzarini has focused on making the human parts seem authentic 
on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 For surgeons, texture counts. Each organ has a different feel against the tug 
of surgical graspers, cutting tools and staplers. Lazzarini's bile duct has 
received the most praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you put your endoscope inside that model, it really looks like the real 
thing," said Phillips of Cedars-Sinai.

Foodbank's Feed the Hungry While You Feed Your Ears food drive, staged earlier 
this month at the Moby Disc music store in Santa Monica.The food drive, 
coordinated with Moby Records, Bam magazine and KROQ-FM, was the first of its 
kind involving the music industry, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Music fans who donated one can of food received a $1 to $5 discount on any CD 
in the store.

 The Getty Conservation Institute, in collaboration with the Instituto Nacional 
de Antropologia e Historia, the Governorate of Baja California Sur and Amigos 
del Sud California, is underwriting the restoration of a prehistoric rock art 
site known as El Raton.The project will document the rock art in the central 
mountains of the Baja California peninsula, measure the rate of deterioration 
and seek the best means of preserving the 4,000-year-old paintings. The origins 
of the mysterious animal, bird and human forms depicted in the cave paintings 
are not known. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort will continue for three years, with the team collecting 
environmental data, studying water flows in the site and analyzing rock samples 
and pigments.

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; JOINT LABORS OF LOVE REOPEN KIDS' CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA BIRCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reopening of the Las Doradas Children's Center couldn't have come at a 
better time for Rosa Alvarado. 
</P>
<P>
 During the six months the day-care center was closed for renovation, the young 
mother scrambled to find baby-sitters for her two sons, Arturo, 4, and Edwardo, 
3. Already struggling to make ends meet on her salary from a part-time job, 
finding good, low-cost child care meant she had to dig deeper into her pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the reopening of the center this week, Alvarado and other parents 
were again comfortable, knowing their kids were in good hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which had been closed since December to move to a new location, 
reopened Monday, thanks to volunteers and donors ranging from parents of the 33 
children enrolled in the day-care programs to actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents volunteered countless hours assembling toys, scrubbing floors, 
cleaning, painting and decorating walls, gardening and plastering, to make sure 
everything was in order when the doors opened. The center is now at 804 
Broadway St. near Pleasant View Avenue, in the Oakwood neighborhood. It had 
been at 917 Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Different people pulled together because they recognize the need for a nice 
environment for children," said Gail Bryant, director of Las Doradas. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Abigail Vibiano was one of the many volunteers. Her 9-year-old daughter 
has attended Las Doradas since she was a toddler, and, Vibiano said, the center 
is "an important part of our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 With all the excitement surrounding its reopening, it was almost forgotten 
there was a time not long ago when Las Doradas' future was uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, parents feared the center, one of only a few in Oakwood, would 
have to close. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Las Doradas, operated by the nonprofit Neighborhood Youth Assn., had 
leased the Broadway Street building from the Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power. But in 1990, the DWP said it planned to tear down the building to 
expand its power distribution site there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Neighborhood Youth Assn. didn't have the money to find an alternative 
site, said the association's executive director, Adel Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials, private businesses, philanthropists and parents came up 
with a plan so the day-care center could stay open. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first to provide help was Westside developer Rick Caruso, former 
DWP president, who persuaded the department to donate the building to the 
neighborhood association instead of tearing it down. All that was needed was a 
new location so the building could be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Ruth Galanter found the perfect spot, only a block or two away 
from the old site -- a parcel of land next to Broadway Elementary School and 
owned by the Los Angeles Unified School District, which agreed to donate the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his charitable foundation, Caruso donated $75,000 to have the building 
moved and its foundation rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oakwood neighborhood has been plagued by a gang war that left at least 17 
people dead during the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about a tough area," said Caruso, who has two young children 
himself. "Providing a place like (Las Doradas) is the most important thing you 
could give these families. The children are getting proper . . . day care at a 
nominal cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents pay $40 a month for children 4 years old and younger, and $30 for 
older children, who are provided after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the building was moved, landscaper Jay Griffith transformed the barren 
dirt lot into a grassy, tree-lined play area. Interior designer Melinda Engel 
decorated the classroom walls with colorful murals of letters, numbers and 
dinosaurs. Schwarzenegger donated new outdoor play equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 All the work was done pro bono, Martinez said. She estimated the project would 
have cost the association about $170,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, she is still overwhelmed by the support Las Doradas received from 
all over the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a labor of love," she said. "With all the problems going on in 
Venice, the children's center represents a ray of hope, despite the bloodshed 
going on." DONNA BIRCH

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-WILSHIRE; REWARD IS OFFERED IN EFFORT TO FIND 2 ASSAULT 
SUSPECTS

<P>
 A $25,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and 
conviction of two men who assaulted, raped and robbed five women after breaking 
into a home. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, armed with handguns, attacked the women at a house in the 800 block 
of South Norton Avenue about 8:30 p.m. on May 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailants filled pillowcases with household items and stole two cars from 
the driveway after sexually assaulting and beating the five women. 
</P>
<P>
 The reward was established last week by the City Council after a motion by 
Councilman Nate Holden. Police Detective Mike Buttitta said friends of the 
victims are gathering resources and hope to double that reward. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the stolen cars was abandoned and set on fire in the 4300 block of 
Exposition Boulevard the morning after the incident. The second was discovered 
abandoned June 3 in a vacant lot near Washington and Crenshaw boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the incident should call Buttitta at (213) 
485-2921 or, after hours and on weekends, the tip hot line at (213) 485-2504. 
Tipsters may remain anonymous. GEOFF BOUCHER

HOUSING: PROPOSED BARRINGTON PLAZA PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Real estate developers are seen by some as Goliath, the big guy, versus David, 
the little guy. However, when it comes to the proposed Barrington Plaza project 
(Community News, June 23), David and Goliath are on the same team. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Senior citizens, men, women and families looking for housing, which is in 
such short supply, will benefit. All of us who want the economy to rebound can 
take heart that things are beginning to happen.  
</P>
<P>
 The Barrington Plaza proposal means that 335 new apartments will be built, of 
which 67 will be for seniors. And the project will create more than 1,000 
construction jobs, a construction payroll of about $30 million and 97 permanent 
jobs with an annual payroll of $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The site is an excellent location for housing. It makes sense to add apartment 
housing along already-developed major corridors served by public 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 No battle here. Everyone wins.

PLANNING: REDOING THE SUNSET STRIP AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The exterior of the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip is an absolute affront 
to all civilized people. It is just one more example of the trashy taste of the 
West Hollywood Planning Commission and their City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 When one realizes that these same people are about to redo the Sunset Strip, 
permitting 14 high-rise buildings and adding 28,000 cars to the daily traffic, 
it gives new meaning to the words disgust and despair.  
</P>
<P>
 Just remember, when you vote, and do VOTE, that two candidates who approve of 
this Sunset Specific Plan, which will ultimately trap us in our homes and choke 
us to death, are running for the 42nd State Assembly seat. They are Abbe Land 
and Paul Koretz.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST HOLLYWOOD; GUNMAN INJURES 2 WOMEN IN PARKED CAR WITH 1 
BULLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 26-year-old Torrance woman remained in critical condition Wednesday after 
she and a friend were wounded by the same bullet during a shooting early Monday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Ann La Pierre regained consciousness on Tuesday and is able to recognize 
family members, said a spokesman for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The other victim, 21-year-old Samantha Holcomb, also of Torrance, was treated 
at Cedars Sinai and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide detectives planned to meet with the victims on Wednesday to develop a 
detailed composite drawing of the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Deputy Larry Mead said the shooting occurred about 2 a.m. as the two 
women sat in their parked car on North Sweetzer Avenue just south of Santa 
Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 A gunman approached the driver's side of the car and fired a shot from a 
large-caliber semiautomatic handgun, Mead said. The bullet passed through La 
Pierre's neck and struck Holcomb in the left thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect in Monday's shooting matches the description of a man sought in a 
holdup on July 2. 
</P>
<P>
 That incident occurred in the 8500 block of Sunset Boulevard when a gunman 
approached a man while he was sitting in his parked car. The suspect pulled out 
a handgun and demanded the victim's money and car keys. The gunman fled on foot 
with about $30 in cash, Mead said. No shots were fired.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST ADAMS; TOILET TRADE-IN GIVES CONSUMERS A LOW-FLUSH 
ALTERNATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standing beside the warehouse ramp waiting for new goods to be loaded into her 
car, Gloria Guillory admitted that her initial misgivings about getting 
low-flush toilets proved a washout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have one, and it works great," said Guillory, a Crenshaw resident who owns 
a home and an apartment building. "I wasn't sure at first if they were very 
efficient. . . . I'm getting four more. This sure beats buying them." 
</P>
<P>
 Other property owners have discovered the Water Conservation Project operated 
by FAME Renaissance, the nonprofit economic development agency run by First AME 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the Metropolitan Water District and the Department of Water and Power, 
the agency has set up a center and warehouse in South-Central where customers 
can trade in their old toilets for new low-flush models that typically save DWP 
customers about 40% on water bills. Any DWP customer who brings in a water bill 
less than two months old is eligible for the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 MWD and DWP rebates $100 on each old toilet FAME turns in. FAME buys new 
models, which usually retail for about $150, for roughly $80 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's Water Conservation Project is the busiest of the six exchange 
centers in Southern California, purchasing toilets at the rate of about 10,000 
a month since opening a Western Avenue office and warehouse 1 1/2 years ago. 
About 42,000 toilets have been given away thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 April Stokes, an account executive with the project who targets residential 
property owners, said the water agencies turned to FAME to help spread the word 
in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just weren't responding to the notices that the MWD was putting out at 
first," she said. "We're aggressive -- we send letters, flyers, make sales 
appointments and presentations. We're successful because we run this like a 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to saving countless gallons of water -- about 1 billion thus far 
-- in a city still in the throes of a drought, FAME Renaissance director Mark 
Whitlock says profits from the project help support other FAME programs, fund 
scholarships and provide jobs for residents. The center at 11100 Western Ave. 
employs about 30 clerical, computer, sales and warehouse workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This job pretty much saved my bacon," said warehouse worker T'Roshia 
Blessingame. "I hadn't worked for a year and a half before I got this." ERIN J.

COMMUNITY NEWS: FAIRFAX DISTRICT; WALL OF MEMORIES HONORS MOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many people, paying homage to a deceased parent means a trip to the 
cemetery to lay flowers at the grave or to gaze at the headstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Rosenau visits a mural on an alley wall outside the elementary school 
she attended 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother is buried in Westwood, but I come here," said Rosenau of the mural 
next to Play Mountain Place, an alternative-style private school. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (mural) is more alive, and it reminds me of my mother," she said. "It's 
a great way to honor someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenau, 27, who lives in Boston, was in town last weekend to help repaint the 
mural, which was done originally 20 years ago to honor her mother, Norah, an 
active volunteer at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Norah Rosenau was killed in a traffic accident on Pacific Coast Highway on 
July 4, 1974. When she died, teachers decided to support the grieving family by 
having the children paint a mural in her honor.  
</P>
<P>
 After the original began to fade, a new generation of children painted a mural 
of their own in 1987. As the 20th anniversary of her mother's death approached, 
Rosenau called the school to ask if the wall could be painted yet again. The 
school welcomed her idea, and Rosenau flew to Los Angeles to oversee the 
project, which faces an alley near the intersection of Venice and La Cienega 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 She told her story to the children at Play Mountain Place, saying that she was 
on her way back from a horseback riding expedition with her best friends when 
another car slammed into theirs as her mother was making a U-turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenau received a cut on the right side of her head that required 60 
stitches. The other children sustained minor injuries. Even though she was 7 
years old, she said, she knew her mother would not survive. Norah Rosenau died 
a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 The trauma of the accident and the loss of her mother left her in shock, Heidi 
Rosenau said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even cry at the funeral. It took three years before I cried about 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children have a different concept of death than adults do, said Gaile Price, 
director of Play Mountain Place, which was founded in 1949 and serves children 
from preschool through sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "At ages 7 to 9, children feel a sense of loss, and understand that death is 
permanent," she said. "But their grief is different from adult grief. Adults 
have more information and can project into the future. Kids just know that 
something terrible has happened."  
</P>
<P>
 Standing in the alley watching the children paint, Rosenau pointed to the 
quilt-like work in progress on the plywood wall. 
</P>
<P>
 One child drew a tow truck pulling a badly dented car. A former teacher 
painted a frame with the yellow and blue footprints of her 6-month-old child. 
</P>
<P>
 Graduates of the school and grandchildren of retired teachers joined Rosenau's 
father to help paint the mural, which will also include the names of other 
deceased mothers from the school.  
</P>
<P>
 At Play Mountain Place, Price said, the death of a child's family member is 
shared by the school community because the child's unhappiness affects all the 
children.  
</P>
<P>
 "The school is based on humanism, and we try to address children's feeling 
issues as well as their intellectual issues in life," Price said. "We feel this 
is part of our job." 
</P>
<P>
 Although other walls nearby have been vandalized by taggers, the mural has not 
been touched by graffiti, Price said.  
</P>
<P>
 Rosenau works as an education consultant. She credits her experience at Play 
Mountain Place for pulling her through a tragic experience at an early age. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was lucky to have an education that supported me," she said. CAROL CHASTANG

OUT AND ABOUT / CULVER CITY ICE ARENA: A PLACE TO CHILL OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Westside residents tired of battling the summer heat, there is relief: the 
Culver City Ice Arena. It may not be Arctic Circle, but the ice is hard and the 
air is cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Rink manager Joe Setta says the temperature is kept at 55 degrees -- ideal for 
those seeking to cool off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hot outside," said Morgan Brinson, 13, a Beverly Hills resident who 
stopped by the rink on a recent Saturday afternoon. "I wanted to get together 
with my friends and exercise." 
</P>
<P>
 So lace up those skates and take some laps around the rink. The arena offers 
daily afternoon and evening sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Skate rental is $1.75. Admission is $5.75 for adults and $4.75 for children. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular sessions are Friday evenings and Saturday afternoons. During 
the summer months, however, attendance declines drastically. Absent from the 
arena are long lines and crowds, making the experience that much more 
enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
 "My business drops off 44%," said Setta, a former Ice Capades performer who 
has worked at the rink for more than a decade. "You would think everyone would 
come here but they go to the beach or barbecues." 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City Ice Arena, 4545 S. Sepulveda Blvd. (310) 398-5718. Sessions are 
12:30 to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, 8 to 10:30 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday 
and 1:30 to 5 p.m. and 8 to 10:30 p.m. weekends.

SPORTS; WESTCHESTER'S SANDERS IS ON WAY TO BECOMING HOT PROPERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westside housing market remains sluggish, but the value of an aspiring 
real estate agent and current Westchester High basketball player has 
skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning from two national basketball tournaments, Ben Sanders of Westchester 
received telephone messages from 15 Division I basketball coaches who are 
interested in the senior-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got home (Sunday) night and I had messages from (Nevada Las Vegas), 
Oklahoma, UCLA, Arizona, Utah, Purdue and Kansas," Sanders said. "I couldn't 
believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, a 6-foot-4 guard, and teammate Danny Walker played for a Southern 
California team at the Nike Sports Festival in Deerfield, Ill., and Great 
American Shootout in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 After competing for the first time against the nation's best prep players, 
Sanders received rave reviews from recruiting evaluators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ben is a high major college prospect," said Bob Gibbons of the Lenoir, 
N.C.-based All-Star Sports Publications. "He should emerge from the summer as 
one of the top 50 players in his class." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders' ultimate dream is to play in the NBA, but he knows a college 
scholarship will also help him accomplish his second dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do see myself playing in the NBA," he said. "That's a dream. But if I don't 
make it, I want to do some real estate." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders appeared to be a tough sell, playing in the shadows of his brother 
Jason, a sophomore at San Diego State, and Walker, who as a sophomore was The 
Times' 1994 Westside Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, Westchester has produced several outstanding high school 
players, including Zan Mason, Sam Crawford and James Gray. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was selected to The Times' team last season as a junior, Sanders' 
game lacked the polish of his predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's great talent, but a raw talent," Westchester Coach Ed Azzam said. "He is 
improving daily. He has a lot of skills, but he is a long way from being as 
good as he is going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Capable of playing point or shooting guard, the 6-4 Sanders has a quick move 
to the basket. But he lacks consistency as a three-point shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's little bit streaky as shooter because of the motion of the shot," Azzam 
said. "He's not consistent because of mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 "James Gray was an awful shooter in high school, but right now he's one of 
best shooters around," he said. "It takes time and work." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Sanders did not spend long hours practicing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a kid who has interests other than playing basketball," Azzam said. 
"There's nothing wrong with that." 
</P>
<P>
 That changed in June when Sanders decided to work out five hours a day with 
his brother at Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed to improve my outside shooting," said Sanders, who would jerk the 
ball when he shot. "I'm starting to stroke it now." 
</P>
<P>
 The workouts have already paid dividends for Sanders, who was selected to play 
for the Southern California all-star team.  
</P>
<P>
 In the quarterfinals, the Southern California team defeated Southeast Breeze, 
a team featuring the nation's top two players -- 6-foot-10 center Kevin Garnett 
of Mauldin, S.C. and 6-7 forward Ron Mercer of Madison, Tenn. -- and later beat 
the Hartland Jammers in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders more than held his own. "That was the best I've ever seen him play," 
Walker said. "He was shooting the ball better, taking the ball to the 
(basket)." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders plans to major in business in college and lists UNLV, Arizona State, 
Temple and Long Beach State among his top choices. He has a 2.5 grade-point 
average and scored 750 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, which qualifies him for 
a scholarship.

SCOTT HARRIS: IS SCHOOL BOARD JUST A POLITICAL SPRINGBOARD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rita Walters and Jackie Goldberg now serve on the Los Angeles City Council. 
Diane Watson is a state senator. Bobbie Fiedler made it to the U.S. House of 
Representatives. And then there's state Treasurer Kathleen Brown . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "What ever happened to her?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Slavkin was joking. Humor is one way to soften the perception that the 
Los Angeles Board of Education is not merely an important body in itself but an 
excellent political launching pad. Slavkin, who has served on the board since 
1989, hoped to join this unofficial alumni association, but last month he 
finished a dreary fourth in a state Assembly primary. This week, Slavkin 
rebounded with a consolation prize: His fellow school board members elected him 
to the board presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board does important work. Still, it's obvious that Slavkin and 
fellow board members Julie Korenstein, Warren Furutani and Leticia Quezada 
would rather be politicking elsewhere. Korenstein and Furutani lost races for 
City Council; Quezada fell short in a run for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of a political steppingstone wasn't the only topic when I visited 
Slavkin at district headquarters Wednesday. I also wanted to revisit a related 
issue that last year raged like a volcano but this year seems dormant -- the 
campaign to break up the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there may not be worth the effort, but I've long felt sympathetic 
toward the notion of busting up gargantuan L.A. Unified, the nation's 
second-largest school district. Call me sentimental, but there is something 
very appealing about the Norman Rockwell portrait of a school board composed of 
civic-minded folks whose interests are very close to home. Instead of gearing 
up to run for higher office, they are busy practicing medicine or law, owning a 
store or selling real estate. They aren't going anywhere -- and that's why they 
care enough to get involved and assume the headaches. Chances are, you'd bump 
into a board member or two at every high school football game. 
</P>
<P>
 I think of a friend's father, a real estate man who served on the school board 
in my hometown, and of my dentist, a former board president in Burbank. I also 
think of an Arleta activist, a Latino, who complains that Quezada, though a 
Latina, doesn't represent his views. How can someone from that other Eastside, 
he complains, adequately represent the East Valley? 
</P>
<P>
 Now, contrast that with the reality that Slavkin faces. He represents an 
elective district that stretches from Chatsworth to Los Angeles International 
Airport, essentially covering most of the Westside and the West Valley. He 
represents more than 600,000 residents -- more than a typical member of 
Congress. Parents are interested in nothing so much as the care and education 
of their children, but in the Los Angeles schools, their elected representative 
is a distant figure whose attention can't help but be spread thin. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin, however, doesn't think L.A. Unified is too large. If the San Fernando 
Valley went its separate way, he points out, it would still be the 
seventh-largest district in the nation. "Think of all the trouble and heartache 
to move the school district headquarters to Van Nuys. You would achieve nothing 
in my view," Slavkin says. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the Rockwell portrait assumes much smaller districts, such as 
Glendale, Santa Clarita, Las Virgenes and Santa Monica. Wouldn't smaller 
political units help restore the sense of community? 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin's answer is yes, but he disputes that creating smaller districts is 
the answer. It's the schools themselves, he argues, and not school boards, that 
should be the focus of community involvement. Establishing greater control and 
accountability at school sites, he points out, is the primary goal of LEARN 
reforms. The progress of the district's charter schools in managing their own 
affairs, he says, is another heartening sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of my Rockwellian utopia, Slavkin envisions the worst of small-town 
America. The politics would be petty. Small-town boards would wonder "about 
who'll be the football coach, what teacher is sleeping with what other 
teacher," he warns. "That's not the kind of local control I'm interested in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin is most convincing when he describes what ails Los Angeles' schools -- 
the public's sense that the public schools no longer are the foundation of a 
sound community, but a kind of charitable obligation. When Slavkin and I were 
in school, California was among the nation's leaders in spending per student, 
and in student achievement. Now the state is near the bottom, and so are the 
test scores. In a more perfect world, Slavkin suggests, people would understand 
that their neighborhood schools represent the future of their communities, 
their nation, their world. And if he ran for Assembly in my district, he'd get 
my vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But you've still got to wonder. In a more perfect world, would school board 
members really be so eager to move on?

PARK WATCH; BEAUTY AND BUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mounting evidence suggests a link between the lack of parkland and urban 
crime. Los Angeles remains one of the most "under-parked" urban areas in the 
nation.Thus the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreational Area is of even 
greater importance than its 66,000 acres of parkland might suggest.  
</P>
<P>
 Created by Congress in 1978, the park includes the Santa Monica Mountains and 
the Simi Hills, from Griffith Park in Los Angeles to Point Magu State Park in 
Ventura County. The area remains a patchwork of public and private parcels, 
wilderness and developed areas. The stunning mountains and meadows are home to 
a wealth of wildlife and flora and each year are visited by countless hikers 
and nature enthusiasts.  
</P>
<P>
 Backers intended the park to ultimately include key parcels, still in private 
hands, that would complete hiking trails and wildlife corridors linking public 
holdings. But after years of steady federal funding for park purchases, 
congressional interest appears to be flagging.  
</P>
<P>
 Declining property values mean that park officials can make do with less money 
than they once could. But less money is not no money. And no money was what the 
Clinton Administration had originally budgeted for the park last year; Congress 
eventually allocated $ 4 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, the state acquisition 
agency, have taken deserved heat lately for their interest in land far from the 
Santa Monicas. But for Congress to now turn a deaf ear to park officials 
punishes all who use and value this magnificent resource.

REDEVELOP -- DON'T DISSIPATE; IS THE FRACTIOUS L.A. CITY COUNCIL ABOUT TO 
DILUTE EARTHQUAKE-TARGETED AID? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much as San Francisco did after the Loma Prieta quake, the cities of Santa 
Monica, San Fernando and Santa Clarita have turned to the redevelopment process 
in the effort to recover from the Northridge earthquake. Each is using or is 
attempting to use emergency provisions of the state's redevelopment law to 
quickly establish recovery areas in their disaster zones.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, local redevelopment agencies can keep all of the additional 
property tax generated by new construction in an established project area, then 
use that money to help fund rebuilding and recovery efforts. It's a fine idea. 
Now, Los Angeles is finally jumping onto the redevelopment bandwagon. Well, 
sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously on Tuesday to instruct the 
Community Redevelopment Agency to study the possibility of establishing such 
areas. Yes, we said study , when relative speed is of the essence. Because the 
city proposal also falls under state emergency provisions, these areas must be 
established by October or November at the latest, and even that does not sound 
very quick to us. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, it was originally believed that such zones could help fill the gaps 
in aid for the recovery of the "ghost towns" that have sprung up in parts of 
the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and the Mid-City area. These damaged 
sections have been abandoned since the Jan. 17 earthquake and reoccupied by 
criminals and opportunists. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment effort stands to get bogged down by delays and by being 
spread too thin. For example, a staff of six to 10 workers will be looking at 
potential sites in Council Districts 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13. That will 
not only be an arduous and time-consuming task, replete with arguments over 
what is to be included; it also ranges quite far afield from the areas that 
suffered momentous earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to focus on those areas that sustained truly heavy damage. Even so, 
the funding that might emerge from such an approach would come no earlier than 
September of next year. If the federal government had delayed similarly in 
getting the aid rolling, we all would have howled in anger.

POLITICAL ARIDITY OVER THE DESERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to create a Mojave National Park have become entwined with complex 
national politics that have nothing to do with preserving the California 
desert. The House Tuesday voted to downgrade the 1.2-million-acre tract in the 
Mojave to a national "preserve," still run by the National Park Service but 
open to hunters . 
</P>
<P>
 Having rebuffed the National Rifle Assn. on the Brady and assault gun bills, 
many in Congress wanted to avoid another fight with the gun lobby. It was easy 
for members from Michigan or Georgia to duck on a remote patch of ocotillo, 
creosote and sand dunes in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote to amend the California Desert Protection Act was surprising only in 
its margin, 239-183. The amendment came from Larry LaRocco (D-Ida.), a vassal 
of the NRA. The base politics of this bipartisan vote were obvious on the House 
floor, as 20 or so members who had promised to vote "no" slunk in to vote "yes" 
only after its passage was assured. Another lesson in profiles of courage. 
</P>
<P>
 LaRocco, backed by Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), argued that hunting offered 
rare "quality time" for fathers and sons. This is fatuous. Only 28 deer were 
taken in the area in 1992 and there are still 10 million acres of public lands 
open to hunting in the area but outside the proposed park.  
</P>
<P>
 This setback potentially affects only a fraction of the 6.3 million acres in 
the bill, which also creates two other national parks and 74 wilderness areas. 
But we hope the noxious hunting provision will be deleted when the bill is sent 
to conference to resolve differences with the Senate version, which provides a 
full Mojave National Park. Loss of the park status would limit its 
attractiveness to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, 
shares the blame, having been outmaneuvered by Lewis, LaRocco and the gun 
lobby. And the Democratic leadership, careless about what may seem like a local 
California issue, obviously did not give it high priority. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real culprit here is Lewis, leader of a back-stage sabotage. On 
Tuesday he ate up valuable time on the House floor debating amendments that no 
one objected to. He is a pragmatic moderate Republican whom we have endorsed 
for election more than once. We are disappointed in him.

THE TRUTH ABOUT COLOSIO'S MURDER?; CREDIBILITY GAP DOGS MEXICAN GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mexican government's formal investigation into the assassination of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, at the time of his death the leading candidate to be Mexico's 
next president, has concluded that he was the victim of a lone gunman and not a 
conspiracy. But a lot of people just don't believe that. 
</P>
<P>
 That poses a profound challenge for outgoing President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari -- to overcome the deep cynicism many Mexicans have about their 
government and, more specifically, about the powerful Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has virtually controlled the government for 
the last six decades. That cynicism is reflected in polls indicating most 
Mexicans believe they will never know the truth about Colosio's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Colosio was the PRI's candidate in the Aug. 21 presidential 
election. That made him the front runner, in that PRI members traditionally 
have used government power -- and electoral fraud when needed -- to push their 
candidate. Yet Colosio was also considered a reformer, handpicked by Salinas to 
follow through on the political and economic reforms of the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Colosio was shot to death by Mario Aburto Martinez, 23, at a campaign 
rally in Tijuana, the conspiracy theories bloomed almost immediately. Some 
blamed a conservative PRI faction that resented Salinas' efforts to rein in 
their power and perks. Others focused on Mexico's increasingly powerful drug 
lords. Still others suspected leftist guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, however, the special prosecutor charged with investigating the 
killing issued a formal statement concluding that Aburto, a former U.S. 
resident given to rambling writings about odd political beliefs, was the lone 
gunman and the only person involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Conspiracy theorists may find more grist in whatever comes out in Aburto's 
trial. The United States' sad experience with the assassinations of President 
John F. Kennedy, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
illustrates how conspiracy theories never die for lack of true believers. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas must try to win over those sensible but skeptical Mexicans who want to 
believe their government but need much more convincing. For starters, he could 
go far in that direction if he followed through energetically on his efforts to 
guarantee an open and honest election next month. Some impressive steps have 
already been taken, including the development of new high-tech voter cards and 
election rolls. But the real proof will come when the votes are cast and 
counted. 
</P>
<P>
 A clean election with a widely accepted outcome will be evidence that the 
reforms Salinas began, and Colosio vowed to continue, have begun to take on a 
life of their own.

 The O.J. Simpson preliminary hearing was a blockbuster for the armchair 
legals. It was thrilling to watch the power lawyers, detectives, etc., in 
action. Robert Shapiro and Gerald Uelmen showed us some of their brilliant 
color in defensive rhetoric. But let us not overlook the preparation and 
persuasive delivery of Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark. Though on opposite 
sides, Uelmen had to be proud of his former student.

 While the Fourth Amendment may have survived the O.J. Simpson hearing, it 
survives with diminished strength. Jerome Skolnick (Commentary, July 8) argues 
that the court's ruling upholding the police's warrantless entry into the 
Simpson estate was correct. He also argues that the ruling was correct because 
the public would have been outraged otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 His analysis omits two important points. First, search warrants can be 
obtained by telephone in about 45 minutes. Second, if the integrity of the 
Fourth Amendment is to be maintained, it must be viewed in the context of the 
protection of 300 million Americans. It is far better that many O.J. Simpsons 
continue to run free (regardless of guilt or innocence) than to subject all 
Americans to the increased possibility of unwarranted intrusions by police.

 Thanks to the worldwide televising of the Simpson case everyone can see our 
American justice system in action. It's a sophisticated maneuvering contest 
between attorneys to determine which parts of the evidence will be used in the 
trial. What really happened is not the concern of the system! The public may 
never know the real truth. Justice may be served, but only by accident.

 Too much already has been written about the O.J. Simpson case and the legal 
pundits have taken over the airwaves. The preliminary hearing was subjected to 
minute scrutiny and ongoing analysis by every "name" criminal attorney in 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
 As the legal process makes its tortuous way through our court system, does 
anyone else get the impression that it's less a matter of Simpson's guilt or 
innocence and more of a game with arcane rules, restrictions and prohibitions 
known only to a few high-powered lawyers? 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate verdict lies with a jury of laymen who are not privy to the rules 
of the game but get on-the-job training as they go along. Only the opposing 
lawyers presumably know the rules and they are more often than not in 
disagreement, with the presiding judge as initial arbiter (subject to appeal). 
</P>
<P>
 If any case demonstrates the value of name and money, it's this one and it 
highlights the inequality of our legal system. Simpson is represented by the 
redoubtable Shapiro, assisted by the renowned Alan Dershowitz, F. Lee Bailey 
and Uelmen with an able corps of forensic scientists, investigators, 
psychiatrists, et al. Every step of the way is contested.  
</P>
<P>
 Can you imagine an ordinary impecunious defendant standing in Simpson's shoes 
and how those legal proceedings would unfold!

 Re "Public Defense for Everybody Equals Justice," by James Lafferty, Column 
Left, July 7: 
</P>
<P>
 I was delighted to read Lafferty's commentary, as it took a positive view of 
the much-maligned office of the public defender. Yet I must take issue with his 
recommendations to reform the system. Lafferty suggests that private criminal 
defense be entirely replaced by state-appointed attorneys. He justifies this 
socialization by noting that criminal defendants are charged by the state with 
a crime against the state. However, it is not the state that goes to jail; it 
is the individual who retains a very personal interest in staying out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice is a commodity as well as a principle. More money can mean better 
justice if both sides have access to comparable funds. However, in cases where 
the prosecutor cannot match the purse of a wealthy defendant, justice may be 
harder to achieve. Private criminal defense is thus a double-edged sword. 
Lafferty's proposal would eliminate its benefits along with its potential for 
abuse at the hands of those rich enough to "buy" justice. I agree with 
Lafferty's premise that justice is best served by a level playing field. 
Therefore, I would suggest that defendants who choose to spend more than a 
certain sum be required to partially subsidize the prosecution.

 Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature just agreed to a budget that signifies

programs. At the same time, local taxpayers are apparently going to have to 
foot the bill for pursuing and prosecuting Simpson.

 Why cannot our local representatives send Simpson a bill for the civic 
resources spent to bring him to justice? Why should his lawyers be reimbursed 
for their resources expended -- but not we taxpayers? The same question applies 
to the expensive Menendez trials, etc.

 Re "Public Schools Can't Deliver Science Education Alone," editorial, July 5: 
</P>
<P>
 You call justifiably for more science in American school education. The issue 
is surely partly as you state it: Incentives are needed for those in academic 
science to teach in the school system. There are, however, very powerful 
disincentives of another sort that stem from the school system's inability to 
establish a teaching environment where scientists have the freedom to teach the 
basics underlying these disciplines, unencumbered by religious advocacy. For 
example, the textbook stance with respect to evolution is a disgrace, not 
encountered in any other "advanced" nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Science" is not merely the mechanics of various scientifically based 
technologies which produce television and automobiles. To teach science is to 
teach skepticism, with a reverence for the fundamental mysteries of how we got 
here, and what life, particularly human life, might mean. The proposed 
scientific answers to such questions are all tentative, and attempts are made 
to state them in a refutable manner, based on measurement and observation. 
(With respect to the origin of the universe, the "Big Bang" theorizers merely 
place the ultimate mystery at a greater and more abstract distance than most 
conventional religions.) 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of wonder that science imparts is as real as that of any other 
worldview, and is integral to scientific teaching. So also is the sense of the 
incompleteness of our understanding, and the sense that scientific knowledge, 
however unwelcome and unpleasant, is to be sought after.

 * Your editorial seemed especially pertinent as we approach the 25th 
anniversary of Apollo 11's landing on the moon. I appreciate your pointing out 
the great need for science education and the public conviction necessary to 
accomplish science literacy. One remark especially caught my attention: "Partly 
the problem is that science is widely considered, particularly among minority 
youngsters, as irrelevant or too hard." 
</P>
<P>
 As a board member of Friends of the Observatory I have an overwhelming 
opportunity to see how youngsters are affected by understanding something 
scientific. Two million visitors inside Griffith Observatory each year are 
largely made up of youngsters and a huge percentage of them are minorities. The 
excitement, involvement and interest shown by kids, both little and near-adult, 
are what keeps most of us involved with our volunteer efforts. Everything in 
sight is read, touched, questioned and experienced. Watching these spirited 
encounters makes it look far harder to fear learning than to actually learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Science is understanding the beauty and elegance of all that exists around us. 
Each time a child is a bit more educated and enthusiastic about learning more, 
the means to do so should be available and encouraged.

MR. PRESIDENT, THIS PIZZA CAN'T GET ANY SMALLER; HEALTH COSTS: SMALL BUSINESS' 
ONLY OPTION UNDER THE CLINTON PLAN WOULD BE TO CUT JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Watching the televised reports marking the D-day anniversary, I was reminded 
of how well the Clinton Administration had learned the cardinal rule of 
warfare: You are better off deceiving your enemies than attacking them head on. 
It worked at Normandy, and now the President is relying on it to pass health 
reform. "Just raise your prices 1% or 2%" and health- care reform won't cost 
you anything, Clinton responded to Herman Cain, president of Godfather's Pizza, 
during a televised town hall meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 It all sounded good over the airways, but you will search in vain through the 
proposals littering Washington looking for a guarantee that costs are limited 
to a couple of cents on each slice of pizza. What you will find are references 
to thousands of dollars in mandated costs per worker. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an irony here. For years, the federal government has been unable to 
raise taxes fast enough to cover its costs. More often than not, it hasn't even 
been able to accurately predict how much it would lose in a given year. This 
year it will overspend its budget by well over $1 billion. Now that same 
government wants to act as my business adviser and help me set prices. We used 
to call government actions designed to raise prices inflation. Now it's a 
mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 The marketplace, for pizza as well as many other products and services, 
doesn't work according to the President's description. If it did, discount 
retailers like Wal-Mart and Price Club or low-frills airlines like Southwest 
would not exist. Prices matter. Consumers have consistently shown themselves 
willing to sacrifice service -- not to mention the people who provide it -- for 
a lower price. (Who pumped your gas this morning?) My customers can always eat 
out less often when prices rise. They won't have any more money to spend in my 
restaurants just because I raised my prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Our industry would happily provide broader health-insurance coverage (we 
already offer substantial coverage to our employees)if consumers were just as 
willing to pay higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's mathematics ignores a word that never seems to get mentioned 
in health reform: profits. I've never incurred a substantial cost in my 
business without asking what it does to our business' health. History is 
littered with failed businesses, lost jobs and broken dreams for those who 
disregarded this practice. Yet, Washington stands ready to impose costs on each 
and every business in the country without ever defining those costs in relation 
to profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the service sector, annual profits per employee are less than $2,000. They 
are more than $9,000 in manufacturing. Yet by all accounts, the costs to 
employers from a health-insurance mandate will exceed $2,000 per employee. When 
the added costs per employee are greater than profits from that employee, it's 
easy to see why those jobs are at risk. For many companies, these higher costs 
will exceed their entire year's profits. 
</P>
<P>
 And the loss of these jobs should not be taken lightly. We provide an entrance 
to the world of work, a bridge from school to career and often a ticket from 
welfare to independence. Eating and drinking establishments, in particular, are 
among the greatest sources of opportunity in our economy. 
</P>
<P>
 If, on average, every restaurant in America cut only one employee per shift, 
we would lose 750,000 jobs, more than the industry's total employment has grown 
in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to estimating employment and benefit costs, I'll put my track 
record up against the government's any day. During my 37 years in the 
restaurant business, I have been responsible for the employment of more than 2 
million people. I doubt anyone in the Administration can top that. But its plan 
could end it.

PERSPECTIVE ON NORTH KOREA; THE NUCLEAR CARD IS BACK IN PLAY; KIM JONG IL'S 
SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON IT, SO HOPES WANE FOR WINNING COMPLIANCE WITH CARROTS 
INSTEAD OF STICKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN D. POLLACK, Jonathan D. Pollack is senior adviser for international 
policy at RAND Corp., where he specializes in East Asian political and 
strategic affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even in death, Kim Il Sung has reshuffled the deck one final time in the 
high-stakes drama unfolding among Washington, Seoul and Pyongyang. The delay in 
the U.S.-North Korean negotiations in Geneva and the indefinite postponement of 
the first-ever North-South summit once again frustrate international efforts to 
stymie and reverse Pyongyang's worrisome nuclear activities, buying the 
embattled North Korean regime additional time for weapons development. Kim 
would undoubtedly have enjoyed the irony. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial impulse of the Clinton Administration has been to remain as 
conciliatory as possible toward North Korea. In public comments following Kim 
Il Sung's death, President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
have sought to keep avenues open to the successor leadership in Pyongyang. The 
Administration clearly has no desire to upset the elaborately choreographed 
bilateral discussions in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean responses have been decidedly different. Although President Kim 
Young Sam voiced token disappointment that the scheduled summit is off, the 
South Koreans are actually in no hurry to resume the dialogue. Seoul was 
originally prepared to accept inherently disadvantageous summit terms for one 
overriding reason -- a meeting with Kim Il Sung would have conferred legitimacy 
and stature on the South Korean government in the eyes of its long-term enemies 
in Pyongyang. The passing of the legendary old leader removes all such 
incentives. Rather than bestow legitimacy on the south, a summit now would 
principally benefit Kim Jong Il. 
</P>
<P>
 Although initial indications seem to point to a smooth succession, these signs 
are illusory. The South Koreans are well aware that Kim Jong Il is reclusive, 
untested, quite possibly unstable and very likely resented by his father's 
senior compatriots, including his politically powerful stepmother, Kim Song Ae. 
As a result, President Kim Young Sam has little to gain and much to lose in 
immediate talks with a leader whose hold on power may be tenuous. That the 
younger Kim's hand is so weak helps explain why North Korea took the initiative 
in postponing the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the South Koreans believe that Kim Jong Il is no conciliator. Since 
March, 1993, when Pyongyang announced its intention to withdraw from the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, North Korean propaganda has repeatedly 
identified the younger Kim as the architect of this policy. Now he is likely to 
view determined pursuit of the nuclear weapons program as integral to his 
efforts to consolidate his power. And he's probably right. The younger Kim's 
survival is likely to depend on the skill with which he handles the next stages 
of the nuclear crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 As leaders in Pyongyang mourn, the 8,000 fuel rods removed from the Yongbyon 
nuclear reactor in late spring continue to cool. North Korean spokesmen have 
already claimed that for reasons of safety (supposed deterioration of the 
aluminum cladding in which the fuel rods are encased) Pyongyang will need to 
remove some of the spent fuel from the cooling ponds by the end of August. This 
suggests that North Korea may be preparing to violate Kim Il Sung's pledge to 
freeze the nuclear program in return for negotiations with the United States. 
If so, the Clinton Administration will soon face a vexing decision -- whether 
to resume talks with North Korea or seek complimance with sticks rather than 
carrots. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a preemptive move by Pyongyang would be consistent with North Korean 
behavior under Kim Il Sung. With his father gone from the scene, there is 
little to suggest that the younger Kim will be prepared to barter away the one 
instrument of North Korean power that could keep the outside world and his 
internal rivals at bay.

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: WHERE'S THE LEFT'S REPLY TO LIMBAUGH?; A LIST 
OF ERRORS WILL ROLL OFF HIM LIKE IT DID OFF REAGAN. ONLY A POLITICAL CHALLENGE 
CAN DENT HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A dedicated band of masochists has gone over tapes of Rush Limbaugh's 
performances and flagged some of the errors and distortions of reality pouring 
out each day from this self-advertised "truth detector." 
</P>
<P>
 On the basis of this research, the media watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy 
in Reporting says that "journalists, in particular, have an obligation to 
challenge Limbaugh's brand of hysteria. Someone who has amassed a powerful 
political following through the regular use of half-truth and distortion is 
begging for tough media scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
 When I first heard about the FAIR study, I was puzzled. Why look for mistakes? 
The challenge would be to find if he'd ever got anything right. Limbaugh is 
virtually incapable of uttering a sentence without hijacking the truth. FAIR's 
itemization just nips at the heels of his follies. 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh: "Don't let the liberals deceive you into believing that a decade of 
sustained growth without inflation in America (in the Reagan 1980s) resulted in 
a bigger gap between the haves and the have-nots. Figures compiled by the 
Congressional Budget Office dispel that myth." 
</P>
<P>
 FAIR: "CBO figures do nothing of the sort. Its numbers for after-tax incomes 
show that in 1980, the richest fifth of our country had eight times the income 
of the poorest fifth. By 1990, the ratio was more than 20 to 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh: "It has not been proven nicotine is addictive, the same with 
cigarettes causing emphysema and other diseases." 
</P>
<P>
 FAIR: "Surgeon General C. Everett Koop's 618-page 1988 report on nicotine 
addiction left no doubt on the subject." 
</P>
<P>
 The error is to suppose that zealous itemizing of Limbaugh's errors will make 
any difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Reagan proved the opposite once and for all. Year after year he trotted 
out his old favorites: welfare queens in Chicago shopping by limo; more 
environmental toxins put out by nature than by every industrial facility on the 
planet; more American Indians alive today than at the time of Columbus, etc., 
etc. (Many of these have been plucked by Limbaugh from the same old barrel of 
hokum.) 
</P>
<P>
 Diligent researchers tracked down Ron's bloopers. Newspapers devoted long 
features to them. It never made any difference. Unabashed, Ron went on 
recycling the bilge, just as he'd done ever since the basic anthology was put 
together for him at the dawn of his political career. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberals used to think Reagan fooled the people. I'm not so sure. In campaign 
seasons I followed him around and it was clear enough that many in his 
audiences had already discounted for the fact that the old fellow had most of 
his stories wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't matter to them. They were there for the act and to catch the flavor. 
You could prove a hundred times over that welfare recipients in Chicago never 
shopped by limo and it made no difference. They were ready to get riled up by 
welfare and Reagan had the handy anecdote there to sum up their concerns. This 
is what demagogues, whether Reagan or Limbaugh, do. They address peoples' 
concerns, shape reality to suit the prejudices of their audience and press 
their own agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Demagogues aren't done in by careful itemization of error. They fizzle out 
because people weary of the act or because the political equation changes or 
because they face a real political challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 There's almost no one out there fighting the political battles with Limbaugh 
in language ordinary people can understand and enjoy. If National Public Radio 
wasn't a bunch of terrified elitist liberals with basically the same agenda as 
Limbaugh in more polite language they'd field a tough talk show with a radical 
democrat, small d. 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh is open to challenge precisely because he's such a faker where it 
truly counts, not in his facts but in whom he claims to speak for. He says he's 
the champion of the ordinary Joe, which is nonsense. He speaks for the elites, 
which is why the Republican high brass love him so. He's a safe demagogue, 
sedately lunging about on the end of his chain, singing hymns to the innocence 
of the tobacco companies and assuring the small-business people that the Reagan 
tide lifted them in the '80s along with the super-rich. 
</P>
<P>
 So why can't the liberals field their champion to go up against Limbaugh? The 
problem is that on issue after issue -- welfare, military spending, crime -- 
both sides are in sync, which is why Limbaugh and the right have to invent or 
recycle all the personal gossip about Clinton to show there's a devil in the 
White House rather than someone who's doing basically what they want.

 For clean minds only: In addition to finding LOVE at our local food stand, we

PERSONAL BEST: A CLSE-UP LOOK AT ; NURSERY TRIES TO TAKE CARE OF PARENTS TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Her job description may be to oversee the care of 36 children from low-income 
families, but Jackie Tomasik sees her duties as much more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to take care of their parents, too," said Tomasik, director for the 
Assistance League Day Nursery in Lancaster. "They don't have anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of her clients are single parents, many of them women who have 
recently left their husbands. They may come to Lancaster struggling to support 
their small children, drawn by the promise of affordable housing and a chance 
to make a better life for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, they find out how tough it really is. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come in at the end of their rope," Tomasik said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tomasik, 29, who appears to have inexhaustible energy, won't let them give 
up the battle easily. In her nine years as the nursery director, she can count 
on the fingers of one hand the parents who have given up. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomasik encourages newcomers with the success stories of parents who have 
preceded them, such as a welfare mother of four who graduated last year as an 
honor student in the nursing program at Antelope Valley College. That woman had 
wanted to quit three times, but Tomasik and her staff at the nursery talked her 
out of it. Others have been able to go on to four-year universities and even to 
graduate school. 
</P>
<P>
 Run by the Assistance League of Antelope Valley, the day nursery was opened in 
1959 before the population in Lancaster and Palmdale boomed because of the 
aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Child care at the facility is not free but is provided on a sliding scale 
according to the parent's ability to pay. Parents with incomes of less than 
$1,500 a month can enroll their children ages 2 to 5 in the low-cost child care 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The children are dropped off as early as 6:30 a.m. by some parents. They can 
stay at the nursery as late as 5:30 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Driven by the influx of people into the community and a poor economy, the 
nursery's waiting list jumped to 200 children two years ago and has stayed 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had a waiting list like we have now," said Donna Temeer, president 
of the league, which is about to start a $300,000 fund-raising campaign to 
build a larger facility for as many as 72 children.  
</P>
<P>
 The league also is planning to open a thrift shop to support a larger program. 
The organization is a 1994 winner of a $5,000 Community Partnership Award given 
by the Los Angeles Times Valley Edition for its efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger facility will be quite a contrast from the nursery where Stephanie 
Slater started doing volunteer work in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 'It was a beautiful town at that time, you knew people," Slater said of the 
Antelope Valley, remembering the community's alfalfa farming and sheepherding 
roots. Then, the nursery was used mostly to care for children of nurses at 
Antelope Valley Hospital, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the nursery has changed from an all-volunteer organization 
with a limited clientele, to a staff-run program serving low-income families. 
Volunteers -- 99 of them -- still help out with staffing, as well as fund 
raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomasik works hard to befriend parents and gets to know them well. Often, she 
is their only friend in a new town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm someone who really likes to talk to them and who tries to be friendly," 
Tomasik said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pressure of a long waiting list takes its toll, and necessity 
sometimes forces Tomasik to be firm when a parent appears to be taking 
advantage of the program. Lying about economical circumstances could be grounds 
for her to throw a parent out of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the years go by, I'm getting a little bit more mean," she said.

AROUND THE VALLEY: DO YOU READ ME? EXPERT SAYS IT'S OFTEN A TOUCHY SUBJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Phill Miller paced back and forth in the classroom at Pierce College, eyeing 
the 20 people who had come to hear him unlock the secrets of body language. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking around the room, I can tell a lot about each of you," declared 
Miller, a white-haired stand-up comedian, corporate consultant and sometime 
teacher from Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell what you're thinking -- and shame on you, sir!" 
</P>
<P>
 The laughter that rippled through the room showed Miller he had already won 
over his audience. They had paid $24 apiece to hear Miller provide the key to 
the mystery that perplexes us all, the most basic of human queries: 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you like me? Do you really, really like me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Miller says men take 30 seconds to make up their minds whether they are 
interested in somebody or not. Women, shallow creatures that we are -- or 
faster thinking -- take just three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller says he can show us what to look for in those crucial early 
moments. Sure, the lips may say, "No, no, no." But the hands, the feet, even 
the pupils of the eyes may be saying, "Yes, yes, YES! " 
</P>
<P>
 Think of the opportunities, once body language is mastered. Promotions at 
work. Success in romance. Why, we could rule the world, or at least be more fun 
at parties. 
</P>
<P>
 We started with an exercise, crossing our arms, in the fashion of Mr. Clean. 
Go ahead, cross 'em.  
</P>
<P>
 Most people -- about 75% of the population -- cross their arms left over 
right, Miller said. If you are a lefty-over, you are the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 And, according to Miller: You are introverted, a linear thinker, fond of words 
and numbers. Detail-oriented, you could write nonfiction for a living or 
program a computer. You are nature's ideal bean counter. Or a politician, an 
attorney, perhaps even a burglar. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefty-on-tops worry a lot, and their feelings are easily hurt. They crave 
praise, have scruples and consider arguments to be intellectual exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who cross their arms right over left are extroverts and very 
visually oriented, Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, that's me. I have found my people. 
</P>
<P>
 We think in pictures, our brains spinning nonstop videos. We have problems 
with deadlines (note to editor: shut up) and can create chaos out of order. But 
we make dandy musicians and artists and actors, even magicians and statesmen. 
We see the big picture, we're high-concept. Writing fiction comes easily (note 
to editor: shut up again). 
</P>
<P>
 We take risks. We laugh easily. Miller says we are quite attractive to the 
opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Who am I to argue? 
</P>
<P>
 Miller pointed out that no one is 100% righty or lefty, so the characteristics 
are a mixed bag.  
</P>
<P>
 But after the self-knowledge came the good stuff: how to read others. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone projects unconscious clues, Miller says. The best news is open palms, 
and a forward-leaning stance. That means the other person is open to you. 
Pupils dilated? Oh, they like you all right. (Or perhaps it's just getting 
dark.) 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up means the person is feeling a bit superior to you. Crossed arms say, 
"No trespassing." Crossed arms with thumbs up means "Out of my way, road kill." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Interlaced fingers signal frustration. Fingertips steepled together indicate 
confidence. But if someone rubs a hand over their face or mouth while they 
speak, they are lying. If this gets you fired, expelled, divorced, evicted or 
sentenced to death, complain to Miller, not me. But that's what he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Locked ankles speak volumes of fear. Legs crossed at the calves and the ankles 
means the human pretzel is thinking about sex, Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
 While Miller ran through his list of body language tips for job interviews, I 
took a look around. Fine, the room was full of polite body language. But 
everyone leaned forward, and several sets of pupils dilated when the topic 
turned to romance. 
</P>
<P>
 However, these are dangerous waters. The signals come naturally, Miller said, 
but some people have learned to fake them. 
</P>
<P>
 Eye contact is a good thing. Lots of it could mean a trip on the Love Boat. In 
normal conversation, we make eye contact about 60% of the time. More than that 
means the other party is interested in more than just conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidgeting signals more than a case of nerves. It also means: "Look at me!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Movement attracts attention and that's why we move," Miller said. Squirming, 
on the other hand, probably means deceit. Time to check the tan line on the 
ring finger. 
</P>
<P>
 And everything Cosmo has ever told you about leaning is true, girls. If he 
invades your space, it means he wants to invade your bed, your checkbook, your 
refrigerator, your life. Good thing we can see those guys coming now. 
</P>
<P>
 Laughter is a good sign. But wait. It's a bad sign if someone laughs with 
their eyes open, a tip-off that he or she's a phony. So no need to wait for 
those Hollywood air kisses and a lunch date that will never happen. 
</P>
<P>
 The $75 clue, though, is touching. People don't touch people they don't like, 
according to Miller. Women who play with men's ties and lapels are waaaaaay 
interested. (Did you need us to tell you that? Can you spell . . . "thick"?) 
Men place their hands on their hips, rock on their toes, hold their heads high 
and perhaps, if they have the stuff, fondle their chest hair, Miller says.  
</P>
<P>
 He adds that a woman can return the compliment by mimicking the man's behavior 
(although chest hair fondling rarely has the desired effect). 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've mastered the love signals, you are ready for Miller's next course, 
at Pierce Aug. 11: "Where Singles Meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Time to flex those pupils and curl a few chest hairs.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; NEW HOPE FOR AILING SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is welcome news that Orange Unified will have Orange County's first 
so-called charter school -- one of a growing number of California schools 
largely free of control by district and state education officials. The change 
could be a major boost for the troubled district. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation allowing up to 10 charter schools in each school district and up 
to 100 statewide took effect last year. Although we think the statewide number 
is too low for this worthwhile experiment, it does represent an innovative 
start on giving more power to parents and teachers at local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Santiago Middle School in Orange will not become a charter school 
until September, 1995, the excitement over the educational experiment already 
has brought fresh air into the district. The principal, Mary Ann Owsley, said 
the school staff would work harder and smarter because the members would have 
more control over their efforts and results. One school board member likened 
the innovation to having a research and development unit in the district's back 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a good attitude: View Santiago as a laboratory, much like the 
chemistry labs inside the schools. What reactions occur when parents are 
required to donate time or money to the school? What happens when dress codes 
and tough discipline are mixed with students' signed contracts to attend 
classes? 
</P>
<P>
 Some problems undoubtedly will crop up, but they could not be worse than those 
the district has suffered in recent years. Teachers and support staff have 
struck; board members have quarreled and been voted out of office; 
superintendents have come and gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of making Santiago a charter school wisely included the teachers 
union, the school board and parents in their plans. Teachers will be allowed to 
retain their union membership and seniority; the district will supply some 
services to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago's charter will run for five years, and the school must meet the 
standards it specified in its application for the new status. The concept of 
having management based at the school, away from a centralized bureaucracy, 
should be watched closely by other schools and districts hoping to improve 
public education.

SCHOOLS AND PRISONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the father of two school-age children, I am again disappointed to read that 
education is taking another back seat in the budget process. Our 
representatives are once more misusing the state's most precious resource, its 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it a coincidence that school classes and prisons are overcrowded? Could it 
be that our underfunded school system and increasing inmate populations are 
positively correlated? I suspect it is. . . . The state is contributing to the 
delinquency of its people. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget, as approved by the Senate, increases the allocation to prisons by 
9% compared to schools whose increase will be less than the rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 If more money were spent on education, maybe there wouldn't be a need for the 
state to build additional prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 By not adequately funding education, California creates its own demand for 
prisons to house the increasing inmate population (a self-fulfilling prophecy). 
Build them (prisons) and they (prisoners) will come.

WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; THE DREAM TEAMS: ITALY-BRAZIL; SWEDEN SURVIVES 
25 SHOTS BUT NOT ROMARIO'S HEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The World Cup will always find its own level. It might allow upstart teams to 
join the party and play for a time, but it is emphatic about rejecting those it 
feels have lingered too long. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden on Wednesday was relegated to the third-place game and thanked for its 
participation, as was Bulgaria. Now it's serious, the tournament seemed to say, 
and it's time for the nations dripping in soccer tradition to take center 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be Brazil and Italy. Brazil toyed with Sweden before finishing it 
Wednesday, 1-0, before 84,569 at the Rose Bowl. Italy earlier had beaten 
Bulgaria. Thus the two stalwarts had rid the tournament of the teams whose 
hopes and aspirations had taken them further than their skill. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great clash of international football," said Brazil Coach Carlos Albert 
Parreira, eyes dancing at the thought of meeting Italy in Sunday's championship 
game. "There are two teams that are tri-champions. Finally, the world will have 
a four-time champion."  
</P>
<P>
 Soccer traditionalists awakening this morning and noting the teams in the 
championship game will smile and remark to themselves that all is right with 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden was, as always, game and determined and totally and absolutely 
committed to defense. Its players were athletic and undaunted and also utterly 
outplayed and overrun. For its part, Brazil put together its best game of the 
tournament and Romario, who scored the winning goal in the 81st minute, darted 
and slashed and repeatedly made dangerous runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil lacked only the ability to finish -- it outshot Sweden, 26-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira's assessment of the game might have lacked in charity but not in 
accuracy: "Tactically and physically we controlled the game; all aspects, all 
situations, all game (long). The score of 1-0 does not translate Brazil's 
supremacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Swedish forwards Martin Dahlin and Kennet Andersson had no forward support, 
but it didn't matter as Sweden showed it had no real stomach for the attack. 
Even its midfield played deeply and copied the packed-back defense that had 
yielded a 1-1 tie when the teams played two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "To go through the Swedish penalty box was almost impossible," Romario said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a curious comment coming from Romario, who appeared to have little 
hindrance with his forays forward. Romario teamed with Bebeto and Jorginho, 
whose constant overlapping runs on the right side bypassed the clogged 
midfield. Among them, the three Brazilians peppered Swedish goalkeeper Thomas 
Ravelli with a fusillade of shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the percentage was, (but) they controlled it," Ravelli said 
of the ball, the game and every other significant statistic. "I think it was 
70-30, or maybe even 80-20. The ball always came back whenever I shot it out." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in the first half it was not even left for Ravelli to save the 
day; after Romario had pulled the Swedish goalkeeper out of position, leaving a 
gaping net, defender Patrik Andersson raced to the rescue, kicking away 
Romario's shot that appeared to be a sure goal. 
</P>
<P>
 It got worse for Sweden in the second half. Jonas Thern, the team's defensive 
midfielder, was red-carded for a foul on Dunga. Sweden played a man down in its 
last game against Romania and survived, but a player down against Brazil is far 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after that Dahlin the striker was taken out in favor of Stefan Rehn the 
midfielder, a defensive substitution, and Swedish Coach Tommy Svensson made 
known his intentions. It was the soccer equivalent of a boxer retreating to a 
corner and shielding his face with his gloves, content to absorb the blows. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later Romario scored. The inevitability was clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had many goal opportunities," Svensson said. "It had to count sometimes. 
It was not a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 Jorginho, on the right, curved a high cross toward goal. Ravelli stood his 
line, noting that Romario was to his right but marked by two Swedes. The 
5-foot-6 Romario leaped and knocked the ball sharply off the side of his head 
and into the near corner of the net, his fifth goal of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravelli: "It was a hard and wicked cross." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravelli knows. He knows that Brazilians can do odd and dangerous things to the 
ball on their crosses. They can coax a curve and dip and call the ball back to 
them. So Ravelli held his line, fearing a trick. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no trick, only Romario. Opposing goalkeepers in this tournament 
would argue the semantics. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the Brazilian fans pounded their drums and flapped their flags, Sweden 
held. Its defense bent but rarely broke. Brazil had done it, it had done enough 
and everyone knew it would need to do no more on this day. 
</P>
<P>
 There was still Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian assistant coach Mario Zagalo, reflecting on the win, offered this: 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a proverb in Brazil," he said. " 'Dripping water on a hard rock 
keeps dripping until it wears a hole.' There was never a time I believed Brazil 
was not going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Trust in Zagalo's judgment. He was the coach of Brazil the last time it was in 
the World Cup championship match, in 1970. The Brazilians played Italy. And 
they won.

WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; DREAM TEAMS: ITALY VS. BRAZIL; ROMARIO FINALLY 
HAS TO USE HIS HEAD TO DEFEAT SWEDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The prevent defense just doesn't work. Brazil proved that again Wednesday, 
qualifying for the World Cup final with a 1-0 victory over Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 While Sweden laid back and played for a tie and penalty kicks, Brazil pressed 
throughout their semifinal at the Rose Bowl. Time after time, wave after wave, 
the creative South Americans attacked and were turned back. 
</P>
<P>
 But that strategy doesn't work forever, and Romario headed home a goal in the 
81st minute, lifting Brazil into its first final since 1970. That year, the 
Brazilians defeated Italy for their third world soccer championship. On Sunday, 
they meet the Italians again, and the winner will be the first four-time World 
Cup champ. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden's chances were severely diminished in the 63rd minute when captain 
Jonas Thern was ejected for a vicious tackle on Dunga. That made the Swedes 
turn even more conservative, rarely venturing into Brazil's end of the field. 
Sweden was outshot 26-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli, a hero in Sweden's most successful World 
Cup since it lost to Brazil in the 1958 final, kept the Brazilians frustrated 
with several sensational saves. 
</P>
<P>
 He was helpless, however, on Romario's goal, which came off a brilliant 
crossing pass from the right corner by Jorginho. Romario had beaten defender 
Roland Nilsson and had plenty of time to redirect the pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal set off a torrent of cheering, drum-beating and dancing in the aisles 
by the overwhelmingly pro-Brazil crowd. As the clocked ticked away, the stadium 
reverberated with the sounds of the samba. And the expectations that 24 years 
of soccer frustration will end Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only real opportunity that we had, I was able to convert," Romario said. 
"Thank God I was able to get it in and get on to the final." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil worked inexorably toward the first goal for 80 minutes, but it never 
came, mainly due to Brazilian misplays. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario and Bebeto had ample opportunities to create goals, but they either 
sent shots wide or hesitated and lost the chance to shoot. In the 20th minute, 
Romario broke free in the penalty area and evaded Ravelli, but his shot was 
cleared off the goal line by Patrik Andersson. The rebound went to Mazinho, but 
his shot went wide. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the day, the game eerily resembled Brazil's last World Cup defeat, 
in Italy four years ago. Argentina's ultraconservative approach made for a 
one-sided match, but the Brazilians couldn't score and the Argentines 
eventually broke through on one of its few attacks for a 1-0 win. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, as their fans grew impatient -- often whistling and hooting at the 
Brazilians' inability to finish -- the South Americans could show nothing more 
than a 15-1 shooting edge for the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 That edge grew along with Brazil's anxiety as the match remained scoreless. 
But the Swedes, who tied Brazil 1-1 in the opening round -- this was the first 
World Cup rematch since 1982 -- never abandoned their defensive shell. And 
Brazil never stopped attacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil now is 5-0-2 against Sweden in the World Cup. But the important number 
has become four: Either Brazil or Italy will be holding up that many fingers 
Sunday, which no nation has done.

WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; THE DREAM TEAMS: ITALY-BRAZIL; THIS TIME, BAGGIO 
WORKS MAGIC EARLY AGAINST BULGARIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Italy's little prince stood at the corner of the end zone Wednesday, arms 
outstretched, 70,000 voices roaring through his braid, a piece of fabric gently 
floated from the crowd to his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a flag. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. flag. 
</P>
<P>
 And so America claimed Roberto Baggio as its own, embracing him with blown 
kisses, waves and directions to Pasadena after he had led Italy to a 2-1 
victory over Bulgaria in the World Cup semifinals at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 We know a good thing when we see it. Baggio, the world's most exciting athlete 
who doesn't wear high-tops, sold us Wednesday with two goals in five minutes in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first goal in the 21st minute, he bounced off one defender, stepped 
around another, then hit a 20-yard shot past a third. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, he broke free from a pack of defenders, took a pass and knocked 
a 12-yard shot into the far corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roberto Baggio," forward Gianfranco Zola said, "is a treasure for our 
nation." 
</P>
<P>
 On his day, Baggio even threw in a sentimental ending. 
</P>
<P>
 As the game's final minutes ticked away, he stood on the sideline, hands 
folded and touching his lips as if meditating. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon the final whistle, he began crying. 
</P>
<P>
 He wept as he buried his face into the chest of taller Dino Baggio. He wept as 
he hugged teammate Demetrio Albertini and the other Baggio at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 He fell into the arms of Italian soccer legend Luigi Riva and continued crying 
as he hobbled off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he crossed the end line, though, he broke away from the embrace and 
looked up in the crowd, nearly all of the 77,094 still at their seats, all 
waiting for him. 
</P>
<P>
 He raised his hands. They stood and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 A part of him belongs to us, now. Once he arrives in town for the World Cup 
final Sunday at the Rose Bowl against Brazil, we might not let him go. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my work, this is my life," Baggio said when asked about his postgame 
scene. "It is made of sweat and tears." 
</P>
<P>
 And pain. After his second goal had given the Italians a 2-0 lead, the 
Bulgarians made him pay. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 30th minute, he was pushed around by Zlatko Iankov and suffered a 
strained hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
 Six minutes later, he was hit in the mouth by Trifon Ivanov's shoulder and 
suffered a broken tooth. 
</P>
<P>
 He eventually limped off the field in the 71st minute. But no matter what you 
hear in the next four days, believe that he will be back for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 In its fifth title game, Italy has a chance to become the first nation to win 
four world championships. So does Brazil. Baggio has a chance to add to a 
streak of five goals in the last three elimination-round games. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria flies to LAX with a different agenda. After failing to win in their 
first 17 World Cup games, the Bulgarians find themselves playing for third 
place on Saturday against Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 They are happy but not overjoyed, not after feeling they were victims of two 
calls by referee Joel Quiniou. 
</P>
<P>
 They said that Costacurta hit a ball with his hand in the penalty area in the 
70th minute, yet it wasn't called. 
</P>
<P>
 And they said that Yordan Letchkov was fouled by Roberto Mussi in the penalty 
area in the 90th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither call was really questionable, but they weren't buying. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoitchkov, who played an indifferent game, scoring his goal on a penalty kick 
in the 44th minute, was asked if he stood by his earlier quote that God was a 
Bulgarian. 
</P>
<P>
 "God is a Bulgarian, but the referee is French," he said. "This match proved 
the refereeing in this World Cup has been the worst in the history of the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio and Albertini made Bulgaria's defense look like the worst in the world 
during a stretch of the first half when they could have scored four goals. 
</P>
<P>
 It started with Baggio's first goal, after a throw-in from Roberto Donadoni. 
Baggio shrugged off would-be tackler Iankov, hopped over Petar Houbtchev, and 
shot past paralyzed Ivanov. 
</P>
<P>
 Four minutes later Albertini hit the left post. Seconds after that, 
Albertini's chip shot was barely knocked over the net by goalkeeper Borislav 
Mihaylov. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Baggio scored his second goal, on a perfectly chipped pass from 
Albertini. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians only gave up a goal later because of a foolish push by Alessandro 
Costacurta and dive by goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca, who caused Nasko Sirakov 
to tumble in the penalty area. Result: Stoitchkov's kick. 
</P>
<P>
 That the Bulgarians didn't even come close to scoring in the second half is a 
tribute to an Italian defense that has turned up the level of its play. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that this victory was enough. The curse of being Italy is that nothing but 
a world championship will ever be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest part for us is just starting," said Roberto Baggio, who then 
hobbled to the team bus. 
</P>
<P>
 But before boarding he was grabbed in the parking lot by wide-eyed Bulgarian 
forward Petar Alexandrov. 
</P>
<P>
 A fight? No, a memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandrov handed his camera to a friend, nervously put his arm around the 
little prince, and asked his friend to snap.

MORNING BRIEFING: IN THIS LOOK-ALIKE CONTEST, NO ONE COULD MATCH ORIGINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jorge Paez, the former featherweight champion, is known as "the clown prince 
of boxing," mainly because his appearance is sort of unusual. Not only does 
Paez do back flips in the ring, he wears colorful clothes, shaves messages into 
his hairdo, shaves the hair from the sides of his head and keeps a 
Mohawk-looking strip down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, somebody thought it would be a good idea for Paez to judge his own 
look-alike contest last Friday night at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't such a good idea, as it turned out. No one entered. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they should lower their sights slightly for the next contest. How about 
a ring-post look-alike contest? Can't do any worse than the last one. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What golfer holds the record for most consecutive appearances in 
a major tournament? 
</P>
<P>
 Futility award: For what it's worth, here is a list of four long-suffering pro 
sports franchises and the U.S. president who was in office when the last title 
was won: 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Cubs -- Teddy Roosevelt (1908). 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona (Chicago) Cardinals -- Harry Truman (1947). 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento Kings (Rochester Royals) -- Truman (1951). 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit Red Wings -- Dwight Eisenhower (1955). 
</P>
<P>
 Typecasting: Why was actor Jim Sloyan the right choice to do the voice-over on 
a video called "The Great Ben Hogan?" Simple. Sloyan once shot a hole in one at 
Winchester Country Club in Rye, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Or something: New York Yankee outfielder Luis Polonia doesn't understand why 
more fans aren't coming to Yankee Stadium: "Maybe they like losing baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 There goes the bride: Dikembe Mutombo's wedding was called off only hours 
before the event in Washington when his intended would not sign a prenuptial 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutombo said he will reimburse anyone's expenses for the wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Rev 'em up: Houston Astro General Manager Bob Watson is disappointed at the 
team's home attendance, projected to peak at just over 2 million, which would 
be down from last year and probably not enough to sustain a $32-million 
payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Watson: "Here in Houston you have a tractor pull on a Friday night and 
there will be 52,000 people." 
</P>
<P>
 Wordsmith: When Boston Globe writer and NBC commentator Bud Collins was 
enshrined in the Tennis Hall of Fame last weekend, he was asked for his 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Collins: "It's too soon. I'll have to let it sink in. Now I'm talking 
like an athlete -- I'm playing one word at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 Was it worth it? The most pitches thrown by a pitcher in a game this season? 
Seattle's Randy Johnson threw 151 and all it got him was a no-decision against 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Sam Snead, 44 consecutive Masters, 1937-83. The Masters was not 
played 1943-45. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Florida Marlin scouting director Gary Hughes, after watching a 
450-foot home run by double-A catcher Charles Johnson: "It was way, way out. If 
this were the '60s, I'd say it was far out." THOMAS BONK

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; FOLSTON, A SECOND-ROUND PICK, SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders signed another of their 1994 draft choices, James Folston of 
Northeast Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Folston, a second-round pick who has played both at linebacker and in the 
defensive line, will be tried at outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have three of their six draft choices signed. Still out are No. 1 
pick Rob Fredrickson, a linebacker from Michigan State; third-round selection 
Calvin Jones, a running back from Nebraska, and fourth-round choice Austin 
Robbins, a defensive lineman from North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Also signed was free agent Mike Alexander, a wide receiver originally picked 
by the team in the eighth round of the 1988 draft. Alexander has since played 
for the Buffalo Bills, the 49ers and the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian 
Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders continue to talk to fullback Tom Rathman. The unrestricted free 
agent, who made $985,000 last season with the San Francisco 49ers, has been 
offered $600,000 a year for each of the next two seasons by the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest the 49ers wanted to go to retain Rathman was $500,000 a season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As always, the first week of camp has been designed for the rookies and 
newcomers. But it has been a little different this season. The sessions are 
shorter, and the agenda is geared toward the mind as much as the body. 
</P>
<P>
 With the veterans due in Friday, Coach Art Shell has used the first week for 
instruction rather than destruction. "We've gotten in a little bit more 
teaching time," he said. "In the past, by the time we got to Friday, the guys 
were worn out. There has not been a whole lot of running and a whole lot of 
hitting this year. It's been more teaching." STEVE SPRINGER

 A surprising number of tickets were available less than half an hour before 
Rose Bowl game time Wednesday to those willing to shop among the scalpers. 
</P>
<P>
 And there were hundreds of empty seats when the game began. 
</P>
<P>
 Brothers Kieran, Justin and Dominic Walsh shopped for quite a while before 
snaring three $90 seats for $50 each. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been here about an hour, and (the price) is going down all the time," 
said Kieran, the oldest of the three at 27. "We've been going around to games 
since Ireland went out (was eliminated). We've always paid less than face 
value."

 Several British tabloids have noticed the hair -- or lack of it -- on the 
heads of Bulgarian players. 
</P>
<P>
 Borislav Mihaylov, the goalkeeper and captain, spent $20,000 on a Paris hair 
transplant while playing for Mulhouse in the French Second Division, they 
report. Mihaylov is said to have his personal hairdresser, Romain Steffan, in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Other commentators pointed to the dramatic header by Yordan Lechkov against 
Germany and suggested that Lechkov's baldness may have contributed to his 
effectiveness in making the goal that beat Germany. He had no hair to get 
between his skull and the soccer ball, they noted.

WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; SPOTLIGHT; IT'S MORE LIKE GUFFAWS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the most part, global fear about what the American pagans might do to the 
World Cup once they got their mitts on it has been unwarranted. So far, no 
World Cup matches have been played in indoor hockey rinks.The ball has not been 
painted neon orange. Despite a cry for more offense, the "designated striker" 
proposal went by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, we are not batting 1.000. 
</P>
<P>
 This you can tell as you drive east from LAX on Century Boulevard -- or, as it 
has been known since the beginning of the World Cup, Snickers Alley. 
</P>
<P>
 Snickers' logos on the bottom of every World Cup banner on both sides of the 
street from the airport to the San Diego Freeway -- there must be a hundred of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Snickers' logo, as big as a basketball court, plastered on the side of a bank, 
wiping out two floors of windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Snickers' billboards on both sides of the Century-La Cienega intersection, 
featuring a soccer ball bursting through a fistful of peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you missed those, as you turn right to board the southbound San Diego, 
there's a Snickers billboard overlooking the off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 It is corporate America run amok, and what must foreign soccer fans think as 
they fly in for the games at the Rose Bowl? That we all look like Rush 
Limbaugh? 
</P>
<P>
 To the good people of Brazil, Sweden, Italy and Bulgaria, a disclaimer: 
There's a hunger inside us, all right -- a hunger to run these eyesores through 
the shredder.

 In a related development, there is no truth to the rumor that Brazil defender 
Leonardo elbowed the United States' Tab Ramos in the head because he was sick

 The FIFA decision to ban Italy's Mauro Tassotti for eight games for his foul 
on Spain's Luis Enrique in last Saturday's World Cup match, the first such FIFA 
decision judged from a video replay, is a hot topic in British sports sections. 
</P>
<P>
 In his comment in The Times of London, Rob Hughes observed: "What this is 
inevitably leading to is instant video replay to decide contentious issues on 
the field.Those have been anathema to some of us for a decade, but now FIFA has 
gone this far, it surely will arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "If so, then the sooner the better, for if video is to dictate another facet 
of sporting life, far better to mete out justice where it can affect the 
outcome of the foul play, rather than in some retrospective committee."

 As channel surfing foreigners here for the World Cup discovered Tuesday night, 
a sport is not considered legitimate unless it has an all-star team.

<P>
 So, for the first time, the international soccer federation, FIFA will 
announce an 11-man all-star team from the 1994 World Cup on Friday at the 
Ritz-Carlton Huntington in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the finalists being considered by FIFA's Technical Study Group include 
the United States' Tab Ramos and Alexi Lalas. RANDY HARVEY

 Way back on June 18, on the second day of the World Cup and weeks before the 
United States became a soccer country, they held a venue opening ceremony at 
the Rose Bowl before the Colombia-Romania game. 
</P>
<P>
 Doing the dignitary duties -- "We welcome you to our fine city and state, and 
we give you the key to Pasadena and blah, blah, blah" -- was California Gov. 
Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 But as he walked toward the center of the field, shortly his name was 
announced, Wilson knew something was amiss. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a crowd of about 90,000 on hand and 89,452 were booing and hissing. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wilson's major programs has been his quest to tighten state borders 
against illegal immigration, and suddenly, here he was, in a stadium filled 
with Latinos, there to root Colombia on against Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody heard his speech. 
</P>
<P>
 When he finished what he had to say, he walked back toward the sidelines and, 
for some unexplained reason, decided to wave to the crowd. A large percentage 
of the crowd decided to wave back, with their middle fingers. BILL DWYRE

 Her feathered headdress was the most substantial item she wore, and her

 "Bulgaria was a one-party state in the early hours of Thursday -- the party 
being a mass get-together to mark Wednesday's World Cup semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even before the first thud of football boot on leather in New Jersey 
Wednesday, tens of thousands were swarming toward Bulgaria Square in Sofia, 
preparing to celebrate victory at best, or the fact the national team had come 
so far.Win or lose, Bulgarians at home and abroad were bent on a celebration, 
which many predicted would eclipse even the euphoria which marked the fall of 
communism four years ago. 'No one will go to work in Bulgaria tomorrow,' said 
one Sofia journalist Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nation is so overwhelmed that newspapers in Sofia have even been 
suggesting that striker Hristo Stoitchkov should run for president. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current incumbent of that post, Zhelyu Zhelev, was moved to say that 
Bulgaria's success in the World Cup would change the country. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The transition that we are going through is very difficult, and I hope that 
football will make things easier for other things that will happen in 
Bulgaria,' Mr. Zhelev said before leaving Sofia to watch the match in America. 
'In any event, after this World Cup championship, Bulgaria will not be the 
same, and the Bulgarian nation will not be the same.' "

lose if we fall into the trap of arrogance, of self-confidence that 
underestimates our opponents . . . for 1938, 1950 and 1982 (World Cup years in 
which Brazil was highly ranked) taught even the hardest heads that being a

 The most marked man in New York this week? Roberto Baggio? Hristo Stoitchkov? 
</P>
<P>
 Try Ilian Petrov, 22, one of three interpreters for the Bulgarian national 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrov was minding his own business as a student at Columbia University in New 
York when World Cup officials called him in desperation before Bulgaria played 
Mexico in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 He was not a soccer fan, but officials couldn't find anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrov soon found himself caught between a group of players who spoke 
virtually no English and hundreds of reporters who suddenly wanted to know all 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrov has been pushed, screamed at and criticized by British reporters for 
misquoting Yordan Letchkov, the Bulgarian midfielder with quick wit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read on the wires that reporters claim Letchkov cannot possibly be as funny 
as he sounds," Petrov said. "But I am just interpreting exactly as he says it. 
The Bulgarians are very nice, funny guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Petrov, who is not paid, says he has been rewarded by hearing Bulgarian folk 
songs drifting from the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 He has not told his parents in Sofia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I will be on TV, they will see me then. That will be a much better 
surprise than a phone call, no?" he said. BILL PLASCHKE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Weiss threw a no-hitter and struck out 11 as Van Nuys South defeated 
Burbank North, 11-0, in an American Legion District 20 game at Burbank High on 
Wednesday.

 Weiss (3-1), pitching with two days of rest, did not walk a batter in the 
six-inning game that was called because of the 10-run rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Burbank North batters reached base when the Van Nuys South catcher 
overthrew first base after dropping third strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Scorza, Greg Levine and Aaron Amitin led a Van Nuys South offense that 
racked up 15 hits. 
</P>

BLUE CHIPS RISE; NASDAQ SOARS 9.76 POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blue chip stocks, helped by a rising dollar, advanced Wednesday but were 
unable to keep pace with the Nasdaq index, which soared more than 9 points on a 
sharp rally in technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3,704.28, up 1.62 points on Big 
Board volume totaling 266.34 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue chip average gained as much as 20 points after a Labor Department 
report said consumer prices were in check. It gave back most of those gains by 
late morning, dipped briefly into negative territory late in the day as sell 
programs kick in, then popped back up near the closing bell. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than 5 
to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology stocks extended Tuesday's rally, boosting broad market indexes. The 
Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller companies added 9.76 to 719.35, its 
best level since June 20. The NYSE's composite index rose 0.38 to 247.85. The 
Standard & Poor's 500 composite gained 0.78 to close at 448.73. 
</P>
<P>
 The market opened on a positive note after the Labor Department said consumer 
prices rose 0.3% in June, about in line with economists' projections. The data 
came just one day after the Labor Department said prices at the manufacturing 
level were flat in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street also rose in response to the dollar, which sold off directly after 
the consumer price data was released but then recovered against the yen and the 
mark in midmorning. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Gallagher, head stock trader at Oppenheimer & Co., said the recovered 
dollar was keeping the Dow above a critical support level of 3,700.  
</P>
<P>
 "The improvement in the dollar helped bonds a little bit, and that took some 
of the pressure off the stock market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar rose from a 20-month low compared to the German mark and 
strengthened against other European currencies. But analysts said economic 
fundamentals and overall market sentiment remain negative for the U.S. 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
 After rising in Asia and Europe, the dollar continued to gain when trading 
shifted to the United States. Buying accelerated on rumors that the Federal 
Reserve Board will raise short-term U.S. interest rates by half to a full 
percentage point, market participants said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 98.30 Japanese yen, up from 97.50 yen on 
Tuesday. It finished at 1.54 marks, up from 1.529. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks got a little encouragement from the bond market, where the 30-year bond 
yield ended the day at 7.67%, down slightly from Tuesday's 7.68%. Its price, 
which moves in the opposite direction, rose 5/32 point, or $1.56 per $1,000 in 
face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market was subdued, dealers said, because market participants are 
waiting to see what economic data due out today and Friday suggests about 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * IBM rose 7/8 to 56 3/4, Compaq rose 1 7/8 to 36 7/8, and Digital Equipment 
added 3/8 to 21 3/8. In Nasdaq trading, Intel rose 1 3/8 to 61 1/2, Apple 
advanced 1 5/8 to 30, Wellfleet Communications rose 2 1/4 to 22, and 3Com 
surged 3 7/8 to 55 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS swung widely, first falling 10 1/2 points after the broadcast company 
ended its agreement with QVC in response to a surprise bid for the home 
shopping channel operator by Comcast. It then rose as much as 9 points after 
announcing a stock buyback and stock split, closing up 8 at 308. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comcast K series issues fell 1 3/8 to 15 1/4, but QVC rose 5 7/8 to 41 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average rose 139.93 points to 20,540.41, and 
Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average ended up 5.95 at 2,054.0. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index closed 23.31 points lower at 2,264.97.

MACY-FEDERATED MERGER MAY BE GAINING MOMENTUM AMID TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Representatives for R.H. Macy & Co. and Federated Department Stores met 
Wednesday to continue discussing a merger proposal that now appears to be 
gaining momentum.  
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was held in New York one day after a lengthy meeting between Macy 
Chairman Myron E. Ullman III and his Federated counterpart, Allen I. Questrom. 
Questrom sought Ullman's support for Federated's $4-billion plan to combine the 
two department store chains. Macy has resisted the merger offer since Federated 
first suggested it in January, but it now appears willing to consider such a 
deal after the Ullman-Questrom meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based Macy, whose holdings include the Bullock's and I. Magnin 
chains, is reorganizing under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and has proposed 
paying creditors $3.93 billion of its nearly $6 billion in outstanding debt 
under a preliminary reorganization proposal.  
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators did not reach an agreement Wednesday, but officials at Macy and 
Federated said discussions will continue. The companies would not comment 
further, citing a request by court-appointed mediator Cyrus Vance to refrain 
from publicly discussing bankruptcy negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Questrom has been trying to convince Ullman that Macy's reorganization 
proposal, which would maintain Macy as an independent company, would not be 
approved by New York Bankruptcy Court because major creditors support the 
Federated plan.  
</P>
<P>
 Under a Bankruptcy Court ruling, Macy has the exclusive right to file a more 
detailed reorganization plan with creditors, but it must submit that proposal 
by Aug. 1. Macy's secured creditors -- those with collateral claims on Macy 
assets -- were planning to ask the court to allow a detailed Federated plan to 
be considered before Aug. 1. However, those creditors have withheld that 
challenge because Macy and Federated are now discussing the merger proposal.  
</P>
<P>
 Macy's board last week postponed action on Federated's offer, citing concerns 
about the possibility of antitrust sanctions if a merger develops. Macy and 
Cincinnati-based Federated, which operates the Bloomingdale's chain, have 
competing retail operations in New York and many other cities.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Federated continues to try to woo Macy bondholders who have not yet 
endorsed the merger plan.

 Maybe it began with olive oil, Tuscan oils and Provencal oils and Napa Valley 
oils, each a lot more expensive than the little conical bottles of Pompeiian 
we'd grown up with, but also (we persuaded ourselves) worth the cost. Then came 
the $12 cruets of vinegar, the baby lettuces at $9 a pound, the $6 loaves of 
bread -- old-fashioned, earthy food for the kind of urban peasants who drove to 
work in BMWs instead of oxcarts. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in Southland health-food stores comes upscale, rustic, 100% organic milk , 
from cows grazing the expensive hillsides of Marin County, no less. I am 
dismayed to report that though the milk from Straus' Family Creamery has a 
richer, grassier intensity than any milk you've ever had, and the milk, though 
pasteurized, is unhomogenized so that the cream literally rises to the top, a 
quart of the stuff costs a good three times what you'll pay for Knudsen or Lady 
Lee . . . and that's without the buck deposit on the bottle. Then again, 
anything else is just milk. JONATHAN GOLD

SUMMER FRUIT; GARDEN FRESH; DRIBBLER'S DELIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the luscious summer fruits that dribble down our chins, peaches are the 
dribblingest. Some summers, peaches are great. Other summers -- well, you could 
build a rock wall with the fruits pretending to be ripe. And once off the tree, 
they just don't ripen as sweet as they could. 
</P>
<P>
 So grow your own! 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a patch of well-drained soil in full sun that's about 15 feet 
around, and if you plan it right, you can pick tree-ripened peaches in parts of 
June, July, August and even September -- heavenly flavored peaches the likes of 
which you can't buy anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 How? Plant three peach trees of equal vigor two feet apart in a triangle, each 
with a later fruiting time. Each mature tree will give you at least two weeks 
of glorious peaches for eating fresh -- and perhaps for putting up. 
</P>
<P>
 Peach trees like their winters cold, their springtimes warm and dry and their 
summers hot. But peach people have been working away on cultivars that will 
produce good-tasting peaches in which these elements are marginal. Little of 
Southern California is classic peach territory, but now we have peaches that 
will ripen everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the mountains near Idyllwild, our season begins in June with Early 
Redhaven, scrumptious yellow freestones on a prolific small tree. In our 
garden, they ripen over several weeks. Late in July comes Polly peach, a 
delicious and delicately blushed white freestone. In late August, we can pick 
Indian Blood Clings such as Thomas Jefferson grew. Crimson through and through, 
with marvelous white peach flavor, these are beautiful fruits. 
</P>
<P>
 If you live in the High Desert, you can also start picking in June with Gold 
Dust, a yellow freestone with exceptional flavor. The Nectar variety ripens in 
July, and some consider it the best-flavored white freestone of all. You can 
also grow Indian Blood Cling for August, or wait for White Heath Cling, a 
superb peach that matures in the high desert in September. White Heath has a 
particularly long blooming period. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost can be a problem late in the blossom season, especially in the Low 
Desert. Flordaprince ripens very early -- sometimes in late April -- producing 
lots of yellow semi-clingstone peaches of good quality. Midpride is a fine 
yellow freestone that ripens in July. However, in the Low Desert, it might be 
wiser to grow genetic dwarf trees in tubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Genetic dwarf peach trees have been bred to stay four to six feet tall once 
they mature. Their blooms are exceptionally beautiful, being thick on the 
limbs. They are adaptable to all of Southern California and are easy to move 
into a convenient spot; just use a large redwood planter or half-barrel (give 
the container rollers for easy moving). Plant two genetic dwarf peaches in a 
container for best pollination, mulch with manure, keep stringently pruned, and 
let the soil mix dry out just slightly between deep waterings. Two small trees 
with low chilling requirements are tasty yellow freestones: Southern Sweet, 
which is early, and Southern Rose, which is midseason. Add fresh soil mix to 
the top third of the container every spring. 
</P>
<P>
 You can even grow one standard peach tree in a very large container. Just 
prune the roots as well as the branches every couple of years when the tree is 
dormant.  
</P>
<P>
 In those parts of Southern California where there aren't many hours in January 
and February below 45 degrees (called chilling hours), you might plant in your 
three holes Flordaking -- a red-blushed yellow clingstone of high quality that 
ripens late May; then Shanghai, a juicy, wonderfully sweet white freestone for 
July -- or Santa Barbara, a very peachy yellow peach; and for August, aromatic 
yellow freestone August Pride. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll plant slender, leafless bare-root trees in late winter or early spring 
(in the mountains, plant in spring). Whether you get it through the mail or 
from a local nursery, bare root means the little tree is shipped without soil 
after being dug while dormant -- when it's leafless. In a state of suspended 
animation, the tree can endure a two-day trip through the mail. Companies ship 
varying sizes of trees, so inquire before you order. 
</P>
<P>
 You can bring a potted peach tree into your temperate garden any time of the 
year. In cold winter areas, wait till spring. 
</P>
<P>
 When you plant, tip each tree in the triangle slightly outward and remove the 
largest inside branches. Standard peach trees start bearing when they're three 
years old; dwarf trees can bear the first or second year. Life expectancy for a 
peach tree is about 20 years, although production may decline sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's fruit was formed on last year's growth. Once it has offered up 
fruit, that piece of branch will never bear again. What insures that there will 
be new branches this year to bear next year's fruit? Heavy pruning. Probably 
more than any fruit tree, peaches respond to being cut back -- in fact, 
unpruned trees grow cranky and miserable.  
</P>
<P>
 On its own, a standard peach tree (most of the best flavors come on standards) 
will grow to 15 feet tall, but you can keep the height down to where you can 
just stretch to pick from the top branches, and you can trim back width to suit 
your space. Your peach tree will respond to all this pruning by growing more 
lush. While the tree is dormant, either cut each branch back by one-third, or 
cut back two of every three branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the peaches are set, thinning is imperative. Otherwise branches break 
under the load and next year's crop is severely reduced. Thinning results in 
bigger, sweeter peaches on a healthier tree. Wait until fruits are an inch or 
so across, then pick so they're a hand's breadth apart. 
</P>
<P>
 When a tree receives 30 inches of rain divided evenly through the year, it 
doesn't need to be irrigated. In fact, peaches from trees receiving only about 
20 inches of water annually are smaller and fewer, but they're sweeter and more 
flavorful than those receiving more water. This is called dry farming -- it's 
the way Native Americans raise incomparable peaches in the Southwest.  
</P>
<P>
 In good soil, the only food you should give a peach tree is a six-inch mulch 
of well-aged rabbit or steer manure in early spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem you might encounter is peach leaf curl -- it happens when 
winters are wet. If such a winter is forecast, cover the tree with white or 
brown (not clear or black) plastic between mid-December to mid-February; don't 
tie the bottom. Or place the tree under an overhang where it won't get wet.  
</P>
<P>
 Birds will take their share unless you use a bird scare. A bright yellow 
plastic balloon with big glinting eyes is the only thing I've found that works. 
You hang one on a limb for every 85 square feet. Alter the balloon's position 
every week or 10 days during peach season -- the birds think: Good grief! It 
moved! It's real! 
</P>
<P>
 When is a peach ripe for picking? Press the bottom ever so gently. If it gives 
to the pressure, the peach is ripe and will come off the branch with a touch.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to eating out of hand and wiping off the dribbles, we celebrate 
peaches in cobblers, pies, turnovers, tarts and crisps, as pickles, preserves, 
marmalade and cold peach soup. But is there any better way to enjoy peaches 
than slicing them into a bowl, sloshing over the cream and shaking on powdered 
sugar? Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 To me, fresh peach ice cream is the treat of summer treats. My feeling is, 
don't stint on the cream and don't make ice cream unless the peaches are 
perfumed and ultra-peachy. And make it Philadelphia-style. Rather than cloud 
the subtlety of ripe fruit with thickeners and emulsifiers such as flour and 
egg yolks, Philadelphia ice cream is pure fruit, cream, sugar and vanilla -- 
the cleanest, clearest flavor.  
</P>
<P>
 Second only to the quality of ingredients, the most crucial thing about 
homemade ice cream, I think, is to serve it while it's soft -- within an hour 
or two of churning. This isn't the usual advice, but I find that great cold 
blunts the flavor. Should your cream freeze hard, leave it at room temperature 
10 to 20 minutes until it softens enough to stir into fluffiness.

 To peel peaches, drop them in boiling water and lift out after about 10 
seconds. Peaches that are still firm may need 30 to 60 seconds. Lift out with a 
slotted spoon, then slip off skin. Peaches mashed and mixed with sugar may 
deepen in color. If they start to turn brown, add a little fresh lemon juice. 
Some or even all of the cream may be replaced with chilled half-and-half.  
</P>
<P>
 PHILADELPHIA FRESH PEACH ICE CREAM 
</P>
<P>
 2 heaping cups peeled, mashed peaches, about 2 1/2 large peaches 
</P>

SUMMER FRUIT; SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL PEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to peach-growing areas in California, South Carolina, Georgia and New 
Jersey, U. S. consumers enjoy a peach season that lasts from May to October. 
But as marketing expert Martin Eubanks put it in a recent conversation, "When 
you hit the month of July, well, everybody that's going to have peaches has 
'em." 
</P>
<P>
 That's everybody including home gardeners, truck farmers and small orchard 
owners, as well as major growers. From Alabama to Oklahoma, Pennsylvania to 
Kansas, in Idaho, Texas and Kentucky, ours is a nation just dripping with 
lovely ripe fruit. But much of it is far too fragile to travel more than a few 
hundred miles. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a few hundred yards is more like it in the case of the best old-time 
varieties, which is why the peaches you see in supermarkets are sturdy 
commercial types such as Red Haven (from Eastern growers) and Flavorcrest (from 
the West). Though the list of peach varieties is fairly long, it's not much use 
to the average shopper, because peaches are marketed generically, like carrots, 
with no more identification than the state they came from -- if that. 
Fortunately, all of the major varieties can be quite tasty when conditions are 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, "quite tasty" is damning with faint praise when you're talking 
about what should be the most luscious of fruits, melting, perfumed and sweet. 
But these are qualities that do not lend themselves to long-distance shipping, 
multi-week storage and mass marketing. Even the old standard Elberta, once an 
industry staple, has become a specialty item now that there are more durable 
varieties. Loring, a delicious big yellow Southern peach that was on the 
most-grown list for years, is now getting harder to find because it lacks the 
red coloring that consumers have come to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet red has nothing to do with ripeness. The sweetest, juiciest peaches of all 
aren't even yellow but a pale cream color usually called white. The high sugar 
content of white peaches makes them particularly vulnerable to bruising, but 
any truly ripe peach is very fragile. That's why they're all picked green. The 
trick is finding the ones that were the right green when they were gathered. 
</P>
<P>
 Peaches don't mature all at once, so pickers must distinguish among various 
stages of readiness. "Field walkers" accompany pickers in the orchards, 
carrying color chips to double-check for the proper shade of 
green-but-not-too-green. Once picked, the fruit must be cooled rapidly, then 
stored very cold for the shortest possible time. Unlike tomatoes, peaches don't 
mind this treatment. Once they warm up again, they'll ripen. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, within limits. Late peaches may be able to stand as much as a month in 
hibernation (early types scarcely store at all), but the dry or woolly flesh 
and brown hearts so common in end-of-season peaches come from spending too long 
in the cooler. So get 'em while they're hot. PICKING A PEACH 
</P>
<P>
 Farm stands and farmers markets offer the greatest chance of delight, since 
they can sell tree-ripened fruit and unique local specialties. The color that 
matters most is green; the less of it there is, the better. Even among peaches 
picked at the right time, some will have been readier than others. Check around 
the stem area for "background color"; it should be yellow or cream, not 
chartreuse. Peaches that smell good will probably taste good. Be sure there are 
no specks or spots, early signs of the moisture-induced brown rot that can 
destroy a peach within hours. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This is one of those sauces that's good on just about everything. It's 
slightly sweet, slightly hot, very fruity and aromatic with basil. But eat it 
right away; the fresh flavor and color do not keep.  
</P>
<P>
 PEACH AND ONION SALSA FOR GRILLED AND ROASTED MEATS 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium onion, cut into small dice 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/4 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
 4 medium or 3 large peaches 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 1 jalapeno chile, seeds removed, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup loosely packed basil leaves  
</P>
<P>
 Combine onion with 2 teaspoons salt in non-reactive bowl. Allow to stand at 
least 1 hour but not more than 1 1/2 hours. Onion will wilt slightly, throw off 
some juice and become much less pungent. 
</P>
<P>
 Drain juice from onion, rinse with cold water and drain again. Peel peaches 
and chop medium-fine with knife. Do not use food processor. Combine peaches in 
non-reactive bowl with onion, vinegar, jalapeno and remaining salt.  
</P>
<P>
 Finely mince basil and stir in. Serve at once. Makes 2 cups, 6 to 8 servings.

 This is right on the edge between pudding and cake. Serve it hot from the oven 
with a pitcher of cold, heavy cream or turn it out of the pan, let it cool 
overnight, then slice it like upside-down cake.  
</P>
<P>
 PEACH AND ALMOND COTTAGE PUDDING 
</P>
<P>
 Butter, at room temperature

<P>
 Cut almond paste into chunks and place in food processor or electric mixer. 
Process or beat briefly to break up. Beat in 9 tablespoons room-temperature 
butter. Cream in sugar. Add eggs, beating well after each addition. Beat in 
vanilla and almond extracts. Add flour mixture and process or beat just long 
enough to blend. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour batter over peaches. Bake at 350 degrees until top is browned and 
toothpick inserted in center comes out dry, about 1 hour. Makes 1 (8-inch) 
cake, or 8 servings.

GOOD COOKING: LIBERTE, EGALITE AND MOUSSAKA?

<P>
 A new bistro boom is on in Paris. Many of the top chefs have opened at least 
one casual counterpart to their more serious restaurants. Guy Savoy, Michel 
Rostang, Claude Terrail, Joel Robuchon and Jacques Cagna have all jumped on 
this bandwagon of reasonably priced spin-offs -- reasonably priced at least in 
comparison to their super-high-priced Michelin star-rated restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacques Cagna has now opened two bistros: Rotisserie d'en Face around the 
corner from his Michelin two-starred Jacques Cagna, and La Rotisserie 
d'Armaille. Rotisserie d'en Face is especially beckoning with its beautifully 
paneled interior and delicious $35 prix-fixe three-course menu. Enjoy a 
house-baked five-grain bread with a variety of starters, fish, meat and 
rotisserie dishes, especially chicken and lamb, in addition to dishes typically 
associated with French home cooking. Desserts range from a warm Alsatian apple 
tart to a warm chocolate fondant. 
</P>
<P>
 Since today is Bastille Day, celebrate with your own bistro fare. The 
following recipes are adapted from Jacques Cagna's Rotisserie d'en Face. Start 
with a plate of smoked salmon and horseradish chive cream as a leisurely 
introduction to the main dish -- a casserole of eggplant, lamb, tomato and 
onion -- which Cagna suggests serving with a green salad tossed in a walnut oil 
vinaigrette. The dessert, a simple gratin of bananas, is a perfect conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon that is gently smoked and lightly salted works perfectly with the 
horseradish chive cream. Cagna serves his house-smoked salmon with a scoop of 
the cream placed in the center of the plate and a three-inch round blini tucked 
on the side. You can also serve the salmon with thin slices of toasted 
baguette.  
</P>
<P>
 Whipping the cream in a food processor yields denser cream. But you have to be 
careful. The machine works fast, and if you let it go too long, the cream may 
turn to butter. If you are using a mixer, whip the cream until it's really 
thick.  
</P>
<P>
 SMOKED SALMON WITH HORSERADISH-CHIVE CREAM 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 pound thinly sliced smoked salmon 
</P>
<P>
 Horseradish-Chive Cream 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon snipped chives  
</P>
<P>
 Thinly sliced rounds of baguette or triangles of thin firm bread, lightly 
toasted and warm, or blini, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange salmon attractively on 6 chilled salad plates, dividing evenly. Drain 
off any liquid from Horseradish Chive Cream that may have accumulated during 
refrigeration. Shape cream into smooth oval with large soup spoon and place on 
center of plate. Sprinkle with snipped chives. Place toasted bread on side of 
plate. Serve immediately. Makes 6 servings.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 Whip cream until very thick with food processor or mixer. Transfer to 2-cup 
bowl. Gently fold in chives, horseradish, sour cream and lemon juice. Chill at 
least 4 hours or overnight for mixture to firm up.

 This is a surprisingly light and mild moussaka that goes very well with a 
salad of mixed greens tossed in a walnut oil vinaigrette. Cagna fries the 
eggplant in oil but I found that it takes less time, attention and oil to broil 
the eggplant. You can choose which method to use. Also, the bistro's moussaka 
is molded into individual portions and presentations. Here, I've made it in one 
easy large shape.  
</P>
<P>
 BISTRO D'EN FACE'S MOUSSAKA 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 medium eggplants, peeled, cut into 1/3-inch-thick lengthwise slices 
</P>
<P>
 5 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 large cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium onion, minced 
</P>
<P>
 6 medium firm but ripe tomatoes, juiced, seeded and coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons tomato paste 
</P>
<P>
 2 pounds ground lean lamb 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange eggplant in single layer on baking sheets. Heat 2 tablespoons oil. 
Lightly brush eggplant with hot oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Broil about 6 inches from heat source until browned, about 4 1/2 minutes. Turn 
slices. Brush with hot oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Broil until 
browned, about 3 minutes. Set aside until cool enough to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. 
When hot, add garlic, onion, chopped tomatoes and tomato paste. Stir well. 
Cook, uncovered, until mixture has cooked down and is thick, about 10 minutes. 
Turn heat up to evaporate any remaining liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in 10-inch non-stick skillet. When hot, add 
lamb and cumin. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cook, uncovered, until 
lamb is cooked through and brown, about 5 minutes. Drain off any excess liquid 
that may accumulate in pan. Add drained lamb to tomato mixture. Adjust 
seasonings to taste.  
</P>
<P>
 To assemble, arrange eggplant slices in shallow 8-cup baking dish. Place 
slices in overlapping spokes, meeting at center, extending beyond edge of 
baking dish. Fill in any spaces with pieces of eggplant so that base is solid. 
Once moussaka is inverted, this will be top surface. Add tomato-lamb mixture. 
Use rubber spatula to smooth out and gently compact. Fold any extending pieces 
of eggplant back onto meat mixture. Cover with foil. Can be made to this point 
up to 2 days in advance and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before 
reheating. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 400 degrees on center oven rack, uncovered, until very hot and lightly 
browned, about 40 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes on cooling rack. Drain off any 
accumulated juices. Place heated serving platter over dish. Gently reverse and 
unmold moussaka. Use serrated knife to cut moussaka into serving portions and 
metal spatula to transfer to dinner plate. Serve hot or warm. Makes 6 servings.

 Here, bananas are the star of the simplest preparation. Served warm with a 
scoop of vanilla ice cream or frozen vanilla yogurt, it's a most satisfying 
dessert. The bananas need to be ripe for the best texture and flavor.  
</P>
<P>
 JACQUES CAGNA'S WARM BANANA GRATIN 
</P>
<P>
 8 firm but ripe bananas, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons melted butter 
</P>
<P>
 6 tablespoons powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Vanilla ice cream or frozen vanilla yogurt 
</P>
<P>
 Divide bananas among 6 greased 1 1/2-cup souffle dishes, overlapping evenly 
and attractively. Place souffle dishes on baking sheet. Lightly brush tops with 
melted butter. Can be prepared 2 hours ahead to this point and kept at room 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 Before cooking, evenly press powdered sugar through fine sieve to cover 
surface, about 1 tablespoon per gratin. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake on center oven rack at 400 degrees until bananas are very warm, about 8 
minutes. Turn oven to broil and move baking sheet to within 8 inches of heat 
source. Broil until surface lightly browns, about 2 minutes more. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, place 1 small scoop of ice cream on warm gratin. Serve immediately. 
Makes 6 servings.

HOME COOK: WEDDING COOKIES: FOR RICHER, FOR CRUMBIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every year I grow more fond of cookies, but I've become fussy about them. 
There are lots of ordinary cookies; it's the rare, wonderful cookie that I 
crave. 
</P>
<P>
 I had one of those at Rubicon, a restaurant in San Francisco. Elizabeth 
Falkner, the pastry chef, created her own version of the old classic Mexican 
wedding cookie -- a triumph. The original Mexican wedding cookies are little 
walnut-size balls, rich with butter, crumbly with ground nuts and heavily 
dusted with confectioner's sugar. They are pleasantly sweet, but messy to eat 
with the sugar flying around. 
</P>
<P>
 Falkner's creation is the same size as the original, but she added more flour 
to the recipe so it doesn't crumble as much. And she substituted toasted ground 
pecans for walnuts, which greatly enhances the flavor. She finishes the dough 
balls by rolling them first in granulated sugar, then in confectioner's sugar. 
The granulated sugar melts into the confectioner's sugar during baking to form 
a crisp thin icing. 
</P>
<P>
 These simple changes in the basic recipe produce an outstanding cookie. When I 
asked Falkner if she would share her recipe she said she was happy to. The 
dough is crumbly before baking, but it easily forms into walnut-size balls. 
</P>
<P>
 A frittata with cheese and bread crumbs served with tomatoes and scallions on 
the side would be an easy lunch or supper, with the wedding cookies for 
dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 You could also serve the cookies with a fresh fruit compote. Soft summer 
fruits, such as peaches, nectarines or apricots (or all three together) 
preserved for a few days with sugar work well. Peel, pit and slice about 5 cups 
of fruit, place in a bowl and add about 1/2 cup of sugar. Mash the fruit, but 
leave it in small pieces. Taste and correct the amount of sugar if it's not 
sweet enough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. 
Serve with the cookies. FRITTATA WITH CHEESE AND CRUMBS

THE COLLECTORS; THE PASSION OF BUYING AND CELLARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It starts modestly enough. The merchant says: "This wine is really in limited 
supply, so if you like it, buy it now or you'll never see it again." So you buy 
three bottles instead of one. 
</P>
<P>
 The merchant's remark may not be intended to get you hooked, but ask any of 
those who watched a couple of extra bottles stashed in the closet grow into a 
collection that had to be moved to the back of the garage, then to a dugout 
under the house and finally to a rented wine locker -- and soon, perhaps, to a 
room addition under discussion. They know better. 
</P>
<P>
 A bottle here, a magnum there. Pretty soon, we're talking about a collection. 
</P>
<P>
 People collect wine for various reasons. One is to have a fine red (or even 
white) wine develop the mature flavors that only age can produce. Such wines 
are bought young, when they are fruity and simple, and held in dark coolness 
until a date far in the future when they'll be served with ceremony befitting 
their smoothness and rare, aged character. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other reasons to buy more wine than can be drunk immediately: To 
guarantee ownership of difficult-to-get wines. To be able to grab, at a 
moment's notice, a bottle of Rose for a friend who pops by unexpectedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Wine collectors usually share their treasures with friends at dinners; 
occasionally they stage simple tastings with bread and cheese. Often these turn 
into small, private "gourmet societies" in which three or four couples agree to 
get together on a rotating basis for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 A few collectors are speculators who buy rare and expensive wine with the aim 
of selling it at a later date at a profit. Such schemes are difficult to 
undertake (selling wine usually requires a license), and often such speculators 
end up losing money. 
</P>
<P>
 Collecting wine is seen as a hobby of the rich, and it's true that a case of 
the great 1990 Chateau Latour would set you back more than $1,500 today. 
Serious collectors who bought that wine early paid only half that price, but 
that's still more than $60 per bottle -- a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet collecting wine needn't be expensive. Many $10 wines will mature nicely. 
Years ago I bought Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignons for $6 a bottle; a decade 
and a half later they have become glorious examples of how a lighter but 
perfectly balanced wine can improve just as interestingly as more expensive 
wines. 
</P>
<P>
 The following stories of three collectors are pictures of different approaches 
to collecting wine. Each collector profiled here loves wine with a passion, and 
each finds the hunt for great wine as fascinating as the tasting of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Not one of them regrets anything about the journey that got him here, except 
that each wishes he had started sooner. 
</P>

<P>
 When Beringer Vineyards was acquired by Wine World in 1970, the new owners 
walked through the hand-dug aging caves behind the famed Rhine House and 
discovered a cache of some 4,000 bottles of old Beringer red wines dating back 
to Prohibition days. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottles hadn't been touched in decades and retained all the old cobwebs 
and dust of the ages. However, in March of 1993, the winery realized that some 
of the wines were undrinkable, and that the remainder would soon lose their 
corks through deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
 So a team of winemakers cleaned out the old bins and recorked some 1,800 
bottles that were considered to be drinkable, including the pictured bottle of 
1937 Cabernet Sauvignon. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the wines were spoiled and were discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, one perfect bottle of 1937 Beringer Cabernet was the first 
bottle ever sold at the first Napa Valley Wine Auction in 1981. The bottle was 
purchased by Marvin Shanken, editor and publisher of the Wine Spectator 
magazine, for $400.

THE COLLECTORS; BIPIN DESAI: ALL THE WORLD'S A TASTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One might assume that particle physicists talk about nothing but quarks and 
bosons and such. But Bipin Desai, a professor of theoretical physics at the 
University of California Riverside, got a surprise when he visited a nuclear 
research center on the French-Swiss border in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a vegetarian and a teetotaler," says Desai between sips of an old 
Vouvray at Mario's, his favorite Riverside Italian spot, "and all the particle 
physicists talked about was wine and food." 
</P>
<P>
 This happened when Desai was in his late 20s. He was the youngest of five 
children of a wealthy Bombay family, and to that point, he had never had a sip 
of wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Later on that trip, dining with a close friend, Desai and his wife, Blaire, 
ventured into foreign gastronomic territory: meat and red wine. "And what I 
found out was, I liked it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Desai immediately bought a copy of "Harry Waugh's Wine Diary," written by the 
director of Chateau Latour. He read about the greatness of the 1961 Bordeaux. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a very passionate person about certain subjects," says Desai, who's also 
a fan of movies and jazz, "so I decided to buy some of the 1961s. Obviously, I 
bypassed all the cheaper wines." 
</P>
<P>
 While seeking out wines from a great vintage from great chateaux, he bumped 
into Ed Lazarus, then a young Los Angeles wine collector. They became friends, 
trading stories of fine wines tasted.  
</P>
<P>
 A wine tasting staged around that time by Dr. Robert Borrelli, a professor at 
Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, prompted Desai to join Les Amis Du Vin, a 
national wine society that stages tastings. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife encouraged me to join," he says. "She said that tasting the wines 
before we buy them was pivotal, and she was right." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1980, Desai was building a large collection of rare old wines, though it 
was an increasing strain on his budget. He came from a wealthy family of Indian 
diamond merchants, but the wine lifestyle he wished to pursue was still beyond 
his means. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1982, he hit on an idea that he admits was audacious, but which 
turned him into a front-rank wine collector. He wrote to some of the world's 
top wine professionals, including the esteemed Waugh, and announced he was 
going to stage a massive, three-day tasting of 131 Bordeaux from the 1961 
vintage at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The event not only sold out but generated tremendous publicity. Instantly 
Desai saw that by staging such tastings, he would gain the gratitude of wine 
collectors who don't have many wines and become a conduit for French producers 
who wished to stage such publicity-generating events in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, using his own collection as a base, Desai has staged 35 such 
extravaganzas at such restaurants as Valentino, Citrus, Spago, Patina, Yujean 
Kang, Opus and a dozen other wine-oriented restaurants. Desai says even with 
ticket prices ranging from $100 to $2,000, these events are not very 
profitable, but they rarely lose money either because the price is calculated 
to cover the cost of the wines. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the game, Los Angeles attorney Manny Klausner and his wife, Willette, 
who are prominent in food and wine circles, recommended that Desai do the 
tastings in the context of a fine meal, rather than as a traditional 
cheese-and-cracker wine tasting. Desai usually reserves the restaurant for 
lunch on a Saturday or Sunday and has the chef prepare a set menu, the price of 
which is included in the tasting. "I'd love to do dinners," he says, "but when 
you do lunch you can get the entire restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 Desai says staging a tasting doesn't take much time. He simply comes up with 
an idea (such as multiple vintages of Chateau Pichon-Longueville) from the 
wines he and his friends have in their cellars and writes to the chateau to see 
whether it will participate. (Few say no, and most contribute wines not already 
in his cellar.) 
</P>
<P>
 Today, his wine is stored in temperature-controlled public facilities in 
Riverside. Surprisingly, the inventory list is not computerized. It is kept in 
a wire-bound booklet in which Desai writes additions and corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many collectors, Desai has scarcely any full cases of wine, let alone 
multiple cases. The inventory list shows three bottles of this, four of that. 
There aren't many giant-sized bottles, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Some years ago, Desai obtained an import license so he could more easily get 
certain rare wines, some of which he makes available to restaurants and a small 
coterie of collector friends. He also stages small, private dinner/tastings for 
groups of younger collectors as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Desai has participated in private tastings of the tiny Order 
of the Purple Palate, a private group of local collectors who gather 
occasionally to pour fine wines for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Theoretical particle physics still occupies the bulk of Desai's time (he has 
just published a significant scientific paper on black hole analysis), but a 
much more earthly subject is gaining him a greater share of headlines. DAN

THE COLLECTORS; JOE SMITH: HE'S GOT TO HAVE IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was 1964. Joe Smith, then an executive with Warner Bros. Records, was in 
Paris to close a recording deal. One evening he dined with executives of an 
affiliated record company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never ordered a bottle of wine in my life," recalls Smith. "The first 
course of the meal was foie gras and Chateau d'Yquem. I loved the way the wine 
and food went together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to myself, 'What have I been missing?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Smith vowed never to miss anything like that again. He had just completed a 
memory course, so he bought a copy of Frank Schoonmaker's "Encyclopedia of 
Wine" and memorized the contents. "And then I called Roy Kavin (at Greenblatt's 
Deli on Sunset Boulevard) and told him I wanted to buy a little wine," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kavin sold him bottles of 1961 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild for $9 each and 
bottles of 1962 Chateau Lynch-Bages at $3. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1971, Smith was a dedicated wine collector. That year, he and his wife, 
Donnie, moved to Beverly Hills. He air-conditioned the attic and set up the 
wine "cellar" there. That same year he discovered Beaulieu Vineyard Private 
Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon, and soon his collection included 11 cases of the 
famed 1970 vintage. Eventually he ran out of room in his attic and was forced 
to convert the pool cabana into a formal wine storage facility with a tasting 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the collection reached 8,000 bottles, however, Smith realized his mania 
was ruling him; he was in danger of buying more than he could ever drink. So 
instead of curtailing his wine buying, he simply started buying less of each 
great wine. Say, two cases instead of four. 
</P>
<P>
 "My collection today is very eclectic," he says, over a bowl of berries at 
Citrus restaurant. "I buy the big names and I seldom get a bad bottle. I love 
La Tache, so I buy it." 
</P>
<P>
 I ask whether he buys only wine from great vintages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that gets me," he says, his voice escalating, "is when you tell me 
I can't get something. Then I go berserk." 
</P>
<P>
 He was told, for instance, that he would not be able to get much, if any, of 
Guigal's 1985 Cote Rotie "La Turque," and that if he found any, it would cost 
him $250 or more per bottle. He took this as a personal challenge and went out 
and found a case. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 65, however, Smith now says, "At some point we have to face our own 
mortality, and I bought these wines to drink, and there's a lot of them . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is now retired from his position as chairman of Capitol/EMI Music, but 
he did much to educate musicians about wine. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, he visited the Eagles backstage after a concert and found a 
scene that appalled him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had been sipping some awful wine," he says. "I pulled out a bottle of 
'62 Lafite, opened it and poured it for them, saying, 'Now, this is wine.'  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, they loved it. So they put into their contract that after each concert 
they had to have '62 Lafite. The concert promoters hated me." 
</P>
<P>
 Another time he poured a bottle of Chateau Petrus for Steve Ross, the late 
chairman of Time-Warner. "Steve liked the wine a lot," he says, "and the next 
time I visited him at his place in New York, he showed me his cellar. It was 
filled with cases and cases of Petrus! Nothing else! 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Steve, there are other wines.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Smith was chairman of Elektra/Asylum and president of Warner Bros. 
Records, wine was an escape from the notorious show-biz treadmill. "If you're 
in the entertainment industry in this town," he says, "it can envelop you. 
You're scrambling for 'the deal' so much you're missing life. There's a 
screening one night, a party the next night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "But this," he says, lifting a wine glass, "this means more to me than a lot 
of that. It's not what I do; it's who I am." DAN BERGER

 Andre L. Simon, the French expatriate who wrote more than 100 books on wine 
and the wine industry from London, amassed a marvelous collection of rare 
wines. As he reached his mid-70s, however, Simon reportedly believed he would 
never drink all the wine he had collected unless he began drinking it 
immediately. He set to the task with determination. 
</P>
<P>
 As the story goes, Simon died at 93 with only one bottle remaining in his 
cellar.

 In 1985, for a dinner to celebrate Napa Valley wine collector Bernard Rhodes' 
65th birthday, San Diego collector Tawfiq Khoury promised an imperial (equal to 
eight standard-size bottles) of the very rare 1920 Chateau Margaux that he had 
purchased from a London auction house a couple of months before the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, on arrival in this country, the bottle broke. "I accidentally 
kicked it," says Dennis Foley, who now works for the San Francisco auction 
house Butterfield and Butterfield. "It was packed in a wooden box, which I had 
set down on the pavement as I opened the door. I kicked it only enough to move 
it an inch, but wine started leaking out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really strange. One side of the bottle was very thick, and the other 
side was as thin as a sheet of paper. Bottles were all hand-made back then, and 
the mold must have been off-center." 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred, Khoury called the auction house, which located another imperial of 
1920 Margaux, and the bottle was served on schedule at the dinner.

 Larry Seibel, then a San Francisco wine merchant, was at his in-laws' house 
one Sunday in 1966 when the phone rang. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife said it was Dr. (Benjamin) Ichinose. He was calling to say he wanted 
to buy some wine. I got on the phone and he said, 'Meet me at the store 
immediately. I just sold an orange grove and I want to buy some wine.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I met him at the store and he bought $30,000 worth of 1959 
Trockenbeerenauslesen ," says Seibel.

 Marvin Overton, a Ft. Worth neurosurgeon, amassed one of the world's top 
collections of wine. Included were dozens of cases of rare Bordeaux and 
Burgundies, and one of the world's best collections of vintage Port. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Overton was an omnipresent force at major wine tastings and 
auctions, and even acted as auctioneer at a few events. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, however, Overton announced that he had found religion. He sold off 
his entire collection of wine, netting more than a million dollars.

 Andy Lawlor and Linda Lutz of Dexter, Mich., have collected some of the 
greatest wines in the world and often taste them with friends in very casual 
settings. 
</P>
<P>
 One day in 1985, a number of wine collector friends came over to their house 
for a pool party. On the spur of the moment, Lawlor decided it would be nice to 
taste all the First Growth Bordeaux -- chateaux Lafite-Rothschild, Margaux, 
Haut-Brion, Latour and Mouton-Rothschild -- from one of the greatest vintages 
of all time, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 The five wines were served in that order on a patio table. All the tasters 
agreed that the Mouton was best. 
</P>
<P>
 When all but a scant ounce remained in Lawlor's five glasses, the couple's 
then 3-year-old son, Jarrad, toddled out. 
</P>
<P>
 "He grabbed the Lafite glass and took a sip," says Lawlor. "Then he took a sip 
of the Margaux and so forth. And when he got to the Mouton, he gulped the whole 
thing down and he turned to Andy and said, 'This is pretty good stuff, papa.' "

 Wine collectors who'd rather not store their bottles in a space reserved for 
the family car or the washer and dryer can now rent public wine storage lockers 
in temperature-controlled locations. Some of these are run by wine merchants. 
The facilities differ -- some are elaborate, others bare-bones. So prices vary. 
</P>
<P>
 Each listing below includes the smallest wine locker available at each 
facility at the lowest price (which may require climbing a ladder to reach the 
locker) and the largest locker. In most cases, the large lockers are walk-in 
units. Prices listed are per year. Users normally provide their own padlocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some wine authorities believe that refrigerated facilities are better than 
air-conditioned ones because it's easier to maintain the higher humidity levels 
needed to prevent corks from drying out. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours of operation, insurance and other services may vary greatly. For 
example, one operator is open only two days per week. Contact each to see which 
facility fits your needs. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't be surprised if the facility you prefer has no space. Demand for 
wine locker storage has increased recently, and some facilities may have 
limited vacancies. WEST LOS ANGELES

THE COLLECTORS; WINE CELLARS FROM THE GROUND UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If someone tells me, "I have a wine collection," I look carefully to see 
whether the speaker shows signs of the same affliction I had many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs are subtle, but the trained observer can make a diagnosis without 
asking embarrassing questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at the fingers. Are they slightly redder than yours? Perhaps this is a 
sign of having just come from a wine tasting (red wine dripping from glass). 
Look at the pants. Are the knees a bit worn? Could be an indication the person 
has been rummaging about on hands and knees in convenience stores that once had 
a wine section, looking for a long-forgotten prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Other signs: purple-stained teeth, a fascination with old Chenin Blanc, an 
inability to chat about dates in history without bringing up how good or bad a 
vintage it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Persons so afflicted are unlikely to know they are suffering from a mania that 
a psychotherapist might term "obsessive-compulsive." 
</P>
<P>
 For most people, collecting wine starts the way it started with me: with the 
taste of a great wine that I just had to have more of. In my case it was 1970 
Oakville Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon "Van Lobel Sels." In 1976, it was $10 a 
bottle, almost as expensive as Chateau Latour. 
</P>
<P>
 I found six bottles. I called a friend, not really to gloat. OK, to gloat. He 
was blase. He said if I was starting a collection, I should get 1970 Simi 
Cabernet. It was only $6.50 and it was better. 
</P>
<P>
 I froze! Better? I dashed down to my local store. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you have 1970 Simi Cabernet?" I asked, hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're out," said the clerk. "Look on that shelf." 
</P>
<P>
 I was crestfallen. Cases of the 1971 Simi were there; no '70. I started 
pushing the boxes around. There, way in back, was a case of the '70! It was in 
my trunk in seconds. I had won my first treasure hunt. I now realize that was a 
seminal moment in my fixation. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing led to another -- a few bottles of 1973 Diamond Creek, a bottle of 
1973 Mouton, nine bottles of 1974 Caymus Cabernet bought one at a time. I 
started going to my favorite wine shop every Saturday, then to wine tastings, 
then to wine auctions. I joined a small wine club. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, my car began acting strangely. It automatically stopped at 
every store that had a "Liquor" sign on it. I had nothing to do with it; the 
car was possessed. Once I was an hour late getting home. I walked in with two 
bottles of 1976 Chateau Laville Haut-Brion. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much . . . ?" asked my wife. 
</P>
<P>
 I replied, "Eleven doll . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "A bottle ?!" 
</P>
<P>
 I know people whose lives are consumed by collecting. Not to mention their 
closets, cabinets and garages. Pretty soon there is serious discussion about 
using other space in the house to store wine. ("Does Cindy need all that space 
in the nursery? She's only 2.") 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, a way to manage the mania, to keep it under control and to 
assemble a respectable collection of wine without losing a sense of reality. 
But it must be done with a sense of proportion. If collecting gets out of hand, 
you could be in trouble: Few therapists specialize in treating vinomania. 
</P>
<P>
 * DECIDE WHAT YOU LIKE: Start by deciding what kind of wine you like. Then see 
if you like that wine with age. No sense aging something if you like to drink 
young wine, and many people do. 
</P>
<P>
 Should you buy a wine newsletter to help you find such wine? Newsletters 
typically tell you only what someone else thinks of a young wine now, not how 
you will like this same wine in a decade. Your best bet is to see if you can 
find an older version of it and try it alongside the youngest version 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the older bottle may set you back a few bucks, but it's a surer and 
cheaper way to see if you should be investing a lot of money in young wine that 
you intend to consume later. If you buy now without knowing how the wine ages, 
you may pay later too. 
</P>
<P>
 To find an older version of a current favorite, phone your local wine shop and 
ask to speak to the wine buyer. Good wine shops have a specialist; great wine 
shops have many. 
</P>
<P>
 * BUY IN MODEST AMOUNTS: Once you know that you like a certain type of wine 
and have a good idea of what is worth buying in quantity, buy a small amount of 
the wine, perhaps six bottles at most. Sure, I bought full cases of wine years 
ago, but I found that I usually ended up buying too much. And although it's 
tempting to buy a case of something when it's young, in most cases within five 
years you can usually find the same wine at a price not much more than it 
originally sold for, factoring in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 This may not be true for something like Chateau Latour or one of my favorite 
wines, Chateau Margaux, but the aftermarket for fine wine -- other than certain 
highly sought items -- is pretty broad, and these days a lot of collectors are 
selling off older wines through wine shops. 
</P>
<P>
 My best advice is: If you plan on having a good-sized, broad-based wine 
collection, start with small amounts of very good wines. 
</P>
<P>
 * DIVERSIFY: Most people start by collecting one or two things. In California, 
the mania for young collectors is Cabernet Sauvignon. But older collectors I've 
interviewed almost all say they wish they had gotten more 1971 Barolo, 1985 
Solaia, 1971 German Rieslings, or 1977 Port. So even if you have no present 
interest in, say, red wines from the Rhone Valley, it might be a good idea to 
buy a few bottles of top-rate Hermitage from 1990, one of the greatest vintages 
of all time, and lay them away. Later, you may find you love the character of 
old Rhones. If not, you can certainly trade them for something you like with 
other collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN TO BUY A LOT: There is one exception to this admonition: With extremely 
hard-to-get wines (such as Grange Hermitage of Australia, Guigal's Cote Roties, 
Chateau Le Pin of Bordeaux, some of the Gaja Barbarescos), you may have to buy 
the amount you desire up front, because so little is ever seen in the 
aftermarket. A little homework will tell you if your favorite wines fall into 
this category. 
</P>
<P>
 * TASTE BEFORE PURCHASE: It's best to try a bottle of an expensive wine before 
you buy a large quantity of it. How many people would buy a pricey car without 
taking a test drive?  
</P>
<P>
 Especially with expensive wines, buy a bottle as early as you can and taste 
the wine with knowledgeable friends. Take careful notes. Pay attention to how 
the wine tastes alone, then with food. How does it develop over an hour or two? 
Do you like it more as time passes, or less? In particular, is it worth what 
you paid for it? 
</P>
<P>
 * SPLIT CASES WITH FRIENDS: Often the best way to buy is with others who like 
the same wines. (You can find these people by joining wine-tasting clubs, 
attending winemaker dinners, or even meeting people with like tastes in wine 
shops.) Since most great wines are shared with friends anyway, having a friend 
with a half case of a wine you like is a little like an insurance policy. In 
case you drink all yours while the wine is still in its ascendancy, you may 
have another chance or two to try it again. 
</P>
<P>
 * BARTER: Trading wine with others is a good way to maximize your exposure to 
great wines. It's not always easy to determine whether you made a fair trade, 
but if both parties are satisfied, the trade is a good one, and it is 
especially good for collectors who have more than they need of a particular 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
 My best trade: In 1976 I got a bottle of 1961 Chateau Mouton-Rothschild from a 
collector who couldn't find two wines that I had -- 1974 Caymus Cabernet and 
1973 Freemark Abbey Edelwein. 
</P>
<P>
 * INITIALLY, STORE SIMPLY: Temperature-controlled wine cabinets are lovely to 
look at and keep wine at optimum temperature. However, they are anything but 
cheap, and wine doesn't seem to age significantly better in them than with 
simpler methods. 
</P>
<P>
 A starter wine "cellar" is the back of a closet that doesn't change 
temperature much. (A bit of additional insulation is an inexpensive insurance 
policy.) Keep wines out of direct light; keeping them in original boxes is 
practical. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people use a room such as an office for storing wine and add a room air 
conditioner. But since air conditioners draw moisture out of the air, wine 
corks can dry out. Moreover, this storage method works only until all the space 
is used up. 
</P>
<P>
 One man I know built an extra little "home" on his property to house his wine, 
then a mere 400 cases. He installed a large commercial refrigeration unit to 
keep everything cool. Often on hot days, he'd wander down to the house and do 
an inventory, sipping a 20-year-old white Burgundy as he went. 
</P>
<P>
 Constant temperature is more important than cool temperatures that fluctuate. 
Readings as high as 70 will not harm most wine as long as they are constant, 
but at this level young wine ages a bit faster, and older, more fragile wines 
can deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Areas underneath houses are popular storage spots, as are public storage 
lockers (see accompanying story). 
</P>
<P>
 * DRINK THE WINE BEFORE IT'S DEAD: Most red wine matures enough in its first 
five years to gain some bottle bouquet; few red wines require more, but unless 
you taste a wine now and then, you won't know how it's developing. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a saying that addresses the problem: I'd rather drink a wine on the 
way up than on the way down. Waiting for a wine to reach its peak is some 
mystical trick that is more often frustrating than rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 If you like wine, drink it before it turns nasty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for my own addiction to collecting wine, I thought I was cured two years 
ago when I ran out of space to store the stuff. I called a friend to inform him 
of my freedom from dependence. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked me if I had bought any wine in the last 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 I admitted I had. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked me if I was still on a winery's mailing list and buying from it. 
</P>
<P>
 I admitted I was, on three, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked me what I knew about D-day in 1944. I said 1944 was a lousy vintage. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not cured," he said. "You're in denial."

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: THANH MY:; WRAPPER'S DELIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here we are again in San Gabriel, a couple blocks past the big Chinese mall 
and right before you get to the brand-new Chinese strip malls of Rosemead. And 
here we are at Thanh My, a fancier brother of one of the first Vietnamese 
noodle shops in Chinatown, which is decked out with crab tanks and marble, and 
skeins of Christmas lights all year round. There is something comforting about 
Vietnamese food on hot summer afternoons -- piles of leafy herbs, cool dipping 
sauces, iced filter coffee, dripping-cold bottles of beer. July is made for 
lemonade soda, the beverage of choice here -- unless you like mung-bean drinks 
-- fresh juice, granulated sugar, ice and a bottle of Canada Dry club soda, 
mixed together to taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the well-set Vietnamese table: a plate of fresh lettuce leaves, a 
bowl of sweet fish sauce, squirt bottles of sriracha chile sauce and hoisin, a 
basket of herbs. There's a great basket of herbs at Thanh My, flowering basil 
tops and cilantro and fresh sprigs of mint, purple Vietnamese basil and a 
spikier, lemony basil, a long, narrow leaf with a strong metallic taste, a 
small pile of sliced raw cucumber and another pile of bean sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing here is the homemade rice vermicelli, banh hoi , cooled into 
noodle webs and cut into flat squares, garnished with scallion and chopped 
peanuts, which you wrap into little lettuce-leaf burritos with handfuls of the 
herbs and bits of barbecued beef, charbroiled pork, chopped spring rolls, or 
bouncy grilled meatballs made with both beef and pork. (If you order dac biet 
ba mon an , you can cook everything yourself in an iron pan at table, but 
grilled food somehow tastes better when it comes from the kitchen here.) 
</P>
<P>
 There are chunks of chao tom to wrap with the noodles, shrimp pounded with 
herbs into paste, formed into sort of a Vietnamese kebab around a stick of 
fresh sugar cane and grilled -- improbably light, delicately sweetened by the 
juice of the cane. 
</P>
<P>
 But man does not live by lettuce wraps alone; banh trang must be considered 
also: rice-paper wraps for whole fish, roasted in foil with chopped peanuts, 
scallions and lime; for beef, briefly swished through a boiling vinegar bath at 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanh My serves the usual noodle soups, a fine, clear version of the Saigon 
noodle specialty hu tieu , a murky and strong-flavored version of the famous 
Northern beef noodle soup pho dac biet , but they're not the best things on the 
menu. And oddly enough, though the restaurant is thoroughly Vietnamese-Chinese, 
few of the Chinese dishes -- especially the stir-fries -- are all that good: 
mushy frog's legs fried with a dusting of underseasoned spicy salt; clams fried 
with mint in a brown gravy that is nearly dense enough with cornstarch to 
support a chopstick upright; a nondescript seafood hot pot; a dish of sticky 
five-flavor shrimp that tastes mostly of sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 The classic Vietnamese-Chinese stir-fry, lemon-grass chicken, is a little 
better, heady with black pepper, fragrant with exotic spice, and I was once 
talked into ordering a giant lobster, the size of a B-52 bomber, that had been 
fried in a wonderful hot curry, but you're better off sticking with the cool 
Vietnamese dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 You might try cool prewrapped rice-paper rolls, cuon , stuffed with salad 
greens, and bits of barbecued pork, pork and shrimp, or sweet stewed pigskin, 
sharp with the bite of fresh herbs. There is a peculiar though refreshing beef 
salad, rare slices of the meat laid carefully atop a hillock of lettuce, 
dressed with something not far removed from lemonade. Rounds of Vietnamese 
sausage, flavored not unlike a rustic French pate, are served with shreds of 
crunchy pickled carrot instead of cornichons. Because if there's one thing I've 
learned, it's that not everybody is into wrap. 
</P>

THE COLLECTORS; THE ART OF NOT COLLECTING WINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROY BRADY, Brady is a cynical old wine writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A spacious cellar full of noble bottles is a fine object of contemplation. 
Unfortunately, it is not entirely practical, nor, as I began to discover a 
generation ago, entirely satisfying. Possessiveness is one thing, enjoyment of 
wine another. Having reached the much-desired point of being able to open an 
old bottle of, say, Chateau Mouton Rothschild whenever the spirit moved, I was 
surprised to realize that it didn't move all that often. Increasingly the hand 
reaching for the old Mouton would dart off and seize a stripling Zinfandel or 
sprightly Beaujolais. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand dinners with imposing processions of great wines are splendid in their 
way, but, like coronations, lose their force if too frequently repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Three basic factors have changed drastically since I began to collect a 
cellar. First, wines are enormously more costly, especially the famous. Second, 
wines are made to be drinkable early; they neither need nor can they profit 
from long aging. Third, interest rates are much higher; when I began collecting 
wine, my mortgage was 4 1/2%. Wines that I bought for less than $20 a case were 
Chateau Calon-Segur 1945, Chateau Lynch-Bages 1949, and BV Private Reserve 
Cabernet 1951. They were not special bargains. The cellar book shows hundreds 
of similar wines. It made good sense to buy such wines, drink them freely and 
to keep a few bottles for 20 or 30 years to see what would happen. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day I opened my last bottle of Martin Ray La Montana Cabernet, 
non-vintage, but bottled in 1946. It was very feeble, but still true to the 
fine vineyard from which it came and of good color. I might have been a little 
upset if it had cost $50 a bottle, but I paid $16 a dozen. It was fun to try 
out all sorts of things at small risk. During the '50s I put down various 
Ficklin Ports, both vintage and non-vintage, and watched them move gracefully 
into their 30s. The 1951 Touriga, though quite brown and heavily crusted, is 
sweet and clean and still displays the remarkable personality of that grape. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can usefully advise on building a cellar, any more than choosing a 
spouse. One has to consult his own tastes and interests, then take the plunge.

PORK LIKE IT OUGHTA BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIE SIMMONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I like pork lean. I also like it juicy. When overcooked, today's lean pork -- 
30% leaner than it was years ago -- can become dry and bland. To compensate for 
the lack of fat, which adds both moisture and flavor, I stuff the following 
pork roast with a mixture of sauteed onions, dried apricots and prunes and coat 
it with a crust of rosemary, garlic and salt. To keep the meat from drying out 
in the oven, I turn it over halfway through the roasting time. 
</P>
<P>
 The boneless pork loin roast I use is a slim, lean cut that cooks in about 1 
hour and 10 minutes. Don't confuse this cut with a pork tenderloin, which 
weighs in at only about 12 ounces and is so thin and small that it will cook in 
a hot skillet in a matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The loin roast is usually about 2 1/2 inches thick and three to four inches 
wide. A roast about eight inches long will serve four generously, with 
leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare the roast for stuffing, simply cut as if cutting a loaf of Italian 
bread for a hero sandwich, but be careful not to cut all the way through. 
Instead, cut just enough so that it can be opened up like a book. I prefer to 
tie the roast with a few pieces of cotton kitchen string. 
</P>
<P>
 Roast small red potatoes along with the meat and add a side dish of fresh 
green beans, simply boiled until tender. For dessert, serve strawberries that 
have been dribbled with a little honey. STUFFED PORK LOIN WITH ROSEMARY AND

RICE PUDDING: FAST AND LEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE LEVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rice pudding is loved throughout this country. But it's also loved in France, 
from Provence to Burgundy to Normandy. Home cooks use a time-honored technique 
that involves baking the rice with milk and butter for three hours. A classic 
French restaurant formula does it in two: The rice is cooked in milk for an 
hour, egg yolks are added and whipped egg whites are folded in, and the mixture 
is baked in a caramel-coated gratin dish for another hour. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as we love this soothing sweet in America, many of us are just too 
busy to make it because of the time it requires. 
</P>
<P>
 In my home, rice pudding has always been our ultimate comfort food. Two or 
three hours seems a long time to wait for comfort, so I decided to devise a 
quick, low-fat way to prepare it. My first goal was to make rice pudding in 
less than 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 I took advantage of a tip I learned in Paris from a professional chef. He 
boiled the rice for three minutes in water before cooking it in milk, thus 
shortening its cooking time considerably. I took this idea further by blanching 
the rice in water a few minutes longer until it was half cooked and then 
simmering it in milk. The total cooking time was less than 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 My next challenge was to prepare a delicious rice pudding without any fat. To 
achieve a creamy consistency, I used Arborio rice, the short-grained type 
preferred for risotto. Even when I made the pudding with nonfat milk and no 
butter, cream or eggs, Arborio produced a luscious result. 
</P>
<P>
 To flavor my rice puddings, I like to add a vanilla bean or a cinnamon stick 
to the simmering milk, or to stir vanilla or grated orange or lemon rind into 
the cooked pudding. When I lived in France, I used to add candied fruit, but 
now I prefer dried fruit -- golden or dark raisins, or dried cherries, 
blueberries or cranberries. Adding the fruit to the still-hot rice mixture 
makes it plump and tender. 
</P>
<P>
 A traditional French presentation is to layer rice pudding on a platter and 
decorate it with poached fruit. Fresh fruit or berry sauce also make perfect 
toppings. Still, as a snack or dessert, the simplest way of serving rice 
pudding is perhaps the most appealing -- sprinkling it with cinnamon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rice pudding is convenient to make because most of us have the ingredients on 
hand. Be sure to use a heavy saucepan and to stir the rice often as it cooks in 
the milk to keep it from scorching. Choose a large saucepan so the milk will 
not boil over. FAT-FREE RICE PUDDING 
</P>
<P>
 6 cups water 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup rice, preferably Arborio or other short-grain rice 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups nonfat milk 
</P>
<P>
 Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
 4 1/2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup raisins or dried cherries 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 Ground cinnamon, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Bring 6 cups water to boil in heavy, large saucepan. Add rice and boil, 
uncovered, 7 minutes. Drain well. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring milk to boil in same saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring 
occasionally. Add rice and salt. Cook, uncovered, over medium-low heat, 
stirring often, until rice is very soft and absorbs most of milk, about 15 
minutes. Rice should look creamy, not soupy and not dry. 
</P>
<P>
 When rice is cooked, stir in sugar. Cook and stir 1 minute. Remove from heat. 
Stir in raisins and vanilla. Serve warm. Sprinkle with cinnamon to taste. Makes 
4 servings. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This isn't a low-fat dessert, but the creamy rice is delicious, sweetened and 
flavored with citrus zests and vanilla then topped with strawberries and served 
with strawberry sauce. Peaches, apricots or any tender fruit in season can be 
substituted for the berries.  
</P>
<P>
 FRENCH RICE PUDDING WITH STRAWBERRIES 
</P>
<P>
 1 quart water 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup rice, preferably arborio or other short-grain rice 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/4 cups milk 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 3 tablespoons chopped candied fruit or golden raisins, optional 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups whole strawberries 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh Strawberry Sauce, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Bring water to boil in heavy, large saucepan. Add rice and boil 7 minutes. 
Drain well. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring milk to boil in same saucepan. Add rice and salt. Cook, uncovered, over 
medium-low heat, stirring often, until rice is very soft and absorbs milk, 
about 15 minutes. If rice absorbs milk before becoming soft, gradually add 
several more tablespoons milk and continue to cook. 
</P>
<P>
 When rice is cooked, stir in sugar and grated lemon and orange zests. Cook and 
stir over low heat 1 minute. Remove from heat. Stir in candied fruit, vanilla 
and butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread mixture in round mound about 1/2-inch high on round platter. Cover and 
refrigerate 1 hour or until ready to serve. To serve, arrange strawberries on 
rice. Serve Fresh Strawberry Sauce separately. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This bright-red sauce is a good complement for either of the rice puddings 
above.  
</P>
<P>
 Fresh Strawberry Sauce 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups strawberries, hulled 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup sugar, or to taste

THE MANGO KINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's mango season in South Florida. From June through September, these 
tropical, handsome fruits bejewel the back-yard groves and orchards there. 
Fruit stands spring up along roadsides, selling softball-size mangoes for as 
little as two for $1. At the height of the season, this luxurious fruit is so 
abundant that I cut mangoes into my breakfast cereal, whir them into milkshakes 
and generally pig out on a fruit that has become for me the saving grace of the 
steamy Floridian summer. In California, mango lovers must search out the fruit 
in grocery stores and farmers markets, but they are abundant now. 
</P>
<P>
 Novelist Tom Robbins has likened mango to a "ripe peach doused with kerosene." 
The first part of his description is accurate: A ripe mango does have a peachy 
fragrance and sweetness. The sweetness is balanced by a musky tartness that 
some people compare to pineapple. 
</P>
<P>
 And many mango varieties (especially the Asian ones) do, indeed, have a 
kerosene or turpentine aftertaste. This quality is highly prized, for instance, 
in India, where mangoes are so popular that up to 1,000 varieties are grown. 
</P>
<P>
 To Floridians, mango means one of a half dozen varieties, all of them sweet, 
fruity and intensely flavored. The most famous is the large, round, sweet 
Hayden mango, named for Capt. John J. Hayden, who first planted them in Coconut 
Grove in 1902. The most popular commercial mango is the Tommy Atkins, a big, 
oval, bright red fruit with a fine flavor but sometimes fibrous flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Extensive plantings in the Caribbean and Central and South America mean 
mangoes are available virtually year round, but to my mind, nothing beats a 
Florida mango at the height of the season. Thanks to varying ripening times, 
mango lovers can enjoy Florida mangoes from the end of May through September.  
</P>
<P>
 Early ripeners include the Tommy Atkins and the Florigan. Mid-June brings a 
red, medium-size, peach-flavored mango called the Van Dyke. July ushers in my 
personal favorite, a large, red-skinned, lusciously tart and virtually 
fiber-free mango called the Kent. Another mid-summer treat is the Palmer, an 
elongated, S-shaped mango with yellowish flesh and a flavor that hints at 
papaya. August brings a huge, oval, pink- or orange-tinged, sweet, mild-tasting 
mango called Keitt, which will carry into September.  
</P>
<P>
 When buying mangoes, look for unblemished fruits free of shriveled skin or 
soft spots. Mangoes are usually picked green and will ripen if left at room 
temperature (so don't put unripe mangos in the refrigerator). Ripen them in a 
sealed paper bag.  
</P>
<P>
 When a mango is ripe, it will smell very fragrant and be squeezably soft. 
Contrary to popular belief, a red or orange skin isn't the only sign of 
ripeness. Florigans and Palmers, for example, stay green even when ripe. Once 
mangos are ripe, they can be stored in the refrigerator. Diced or pureed mango 
can be frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Eating mangoes can be a messy proposition. Indeed, here in Florida we say 
there's only one way to eat a ripe mango: naked in the bathtub. Actually, there 
are two ways to separate the fruit from the flat, elongated seed. The first way 
is to peel the skin off with a sharp paring knife, then cut the flesh off the 
seed. 
</P>
<P>
 The second way is the "hedgehog" method, so called because it produces 
diamond-shaped spikes of mango that stick out like the spines of a hedgehog. 
Slice the top and bottom halves off the fruit, getting as close to the flat 
seed as possible. Using a sharp knife, cut a cross-hatch or tick-tack-toe 
pattern in the flesh down to the skin, but not cutting through it.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, holding the edges in your hands, press the skin with your thumbs to turn 
the slice inside out. Bite-size chunks of fruit will extend from the skin, 
ready to be scooped up with a spoon. Cut off any flesh that remains on the seed 
with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do mangoes taste good, they're good for you, being rich in potassium 
and in vitamins A and C. A medium mango contains about 135 calories and will 
serve two. A one-pound mango yields about 1 1/2 cups diced fruit or one cup 
mango puree. 
</P>
<P>
 To make mango nectar, cut the flesh off a couple of ripe mangoes (this is a 
good way to use up bruised or fibrous mangoes) and place in a blender with an 
equal volume of water and a little sugar and fresh lime juice. Puree until 
smooth and strain. 
</P>
<P>
 One of my favorite ways to use mangoes this time of year is in salsa. So fire 
up the barbecue grill and give the following recipe a try. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This colorful salsa combines two of South Florida's favorite foods: mango and 
black beans. It makes a great accompaniment to roast chicken, grilled seafood 
or pork. It's also good served as a salad or with chips as an appetizer.  
</P>
<P>
 MANGO AND BLACK BEAN SALSA 
</P>
<P>
 2 ripe mangoes 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup cooked black beans 
</P>
<P>
 4 green onions, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 Scotch bonnet chile or to taste, or 1 to 2 jalapeno chiles, minced and 
seeded, or for spicier salsa, leave seeds in 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons minced ginger root 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup chopped cilantro or mint 
</P>
<P>
 3 to 4 tablespoons lime juice or to taste 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon brown sugar, packed, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Peel mangoes and cut flesh off seeds. Cut mangoes into 1/2-inch dice to make 
about 3 cups. Place in bowl along with black beans, green onions, chile, ginger 
root and cilantro.  
</P>
<P>
 Toss gently to mix. Add lime juice, olive oil and brown sugar. Season to taste 
with salt and pepper. Serve at once. Makes 4 servings.

 Around the clock, workers in white smocks scrambled to assemble the world's 
most advanced technology in Rockwell International's Building 290. Newsmen, 
scientists and astronauts visited, seemingly watching their every move. The 
floor of the hangar-like facility was littered with half-built spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, during the days of the Apollo space missions, this building in 
Downey was known as Tepee Village, nicknamed for the capsule-like shapes of the 
command and service modules that were readied there for shipment to Cape 
Canaveral. 
</P>
<P>
 It was here, 25 years ago, that a work force assembled a spacecraft that took 
men to the heavens and returned them safely home to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission enlisted workers from all over the Southland: In Redondo Beach, 
they designed and built the engines that landed men on the moon. In Seal Beach, 
they erected part of the rocket that blasted those three astronauts into space. 
In El Segundo, they created the docking ports that linked spacecraft modules 
together during a celestial rendezvous. 
</P>
<P>
 The Apollo program, which let men walk, drive and hit golf balls on the moon, 
is over. But for many of those who worked at area aerospace firms to design and 
build much of the equipment to get there, the mission is the highlight of their 
careers, even if they were far from the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Many have retired. Others were laid off not long after the moon landing. Some 
are now top executives or have started their own companies. But most agree that 
nothing was quite like working on the lunar landings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The objective was very clear: Man. Moon. 1970," said former Apollo astronaut 
David Scott, 62, who walked on the moon in 1971 and now lives in Manhattan 
Beach. "Everyone understood exactly what the objective was." 
</P>
<P>
 Many thought that, by now, NASA would be embarking on a manned exploration of 
Mars or building a lunar base. But even a scaled-back space station has had 
trouble getting funding from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Building 290 in Downey, where the lunar modules were assembled, is 
silent. Offices are darkened and shuttered, with little activity except for 
space shuttle upgrade work.  
</P>
<P>
 The Apollo program "built to a crescendo, then kind of died away," said 
Westchester resident John Gibb, 75, who headed the development of the 
propulsion system in the spacecraft. "They had the climax, and then it was all 
over. It doesn't seem to amount to much anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 And many of the spacecraft engineers who worked on Apollo have gone on to 
other work -- or are out of work.  
</P>
<P>
 "I see them in my classes," said Shirley Thomas, a USC professor who has 
helped aerospace engineers retrain as environmental engineers. "Bright men, a 
third of them with Ph.Ds, are just bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 They've sold the first car, they've sold the second car, they've sold the 
home, and they can't find work." 
</P>
<P>
 Many former workers, plus retirees such as Palos Verdes Estates resident Rocco 
A. Petrone, 68, long for the days when space exploration was a national goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 25 years, I'm still enthused," said Petrone, then-director of launch 
operations at Kennedy Space Center and later the president of Rockwell's space 
division. "I wish the nation was." 
</P>
<P>
 Those on the Apollo projects often worked more than 60 hours a week, getting 
little sleep. Many saw their families break apart, and some developed health 
problems because of the demanding work. Even on July 20, 1969, when Neil 
Armstrong took that first step on the moon, employees at Rockwell continued 
working, peering at black-and-white TV sets during breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some thrived on the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were really unbelievable times," said Beverly Gresham, a Rockwell 
secretary in customer relations who has been with the company since 1958. "(If) 
you talk to the people who are retiring, they will say it was the most fun they 
have ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, billions of dollars poured into the space programs. And for 
young engineers with brand-new degrees, it meant opportunities. Robert Sackheim 
was still taking college courses when he went to work for TRW Inc., which was 
designing the engine that lowered Armstrong's lunar module from the hovering 
spacecraft to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 As a development engineer, he split his time between the headquarters in 
Redondo Beach and a testing facility in San Juan Capistrano. He remembers 
all-nighters, with some people taking catnaps in their chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lot of just grinding out the details," said Sackheim, now the 
manager of TRW's Propulsion and Combustion Center. "We were doing a lot of 
mundane details. But, overall, it was a real technical challenge, not a minor 
feat. The lunar module had to land safely, and that was very important." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the work was not thrilling, former workers say, working on the 
program was. At Cosmodyne in Torrance, workers had previously perfected 
cryogenic systems, which were put to the test in cooling lunar module 
components. "Technically, it was not very challenging," said President Russ 
Brown. "(But) the mission itself excited the imagination. You could not help 
but feel it." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the activity during the Apollo days was at Rockwell International 
Corp. (North American Aviation until 1967 and North American Rockwell until 
1972). At the time, North American's space operations were based in Downey, 
where the spacecraft was made, and in Seal Beach, where the company built the 
second stage of the Saturn V rocket that launched the astronauts into space. 
Its Rocketdyne Division built boosters for the rocket in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The mastermind of the company's foray into space was Harrison (Stormy) Storms, 
an aerospace maverick who lived on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 When he took over the company's missile division in Downey in 1960, Storms 
already had played a pivotal role in the development of the P-51 Mustang during 
World War II, the F-86 Sabre Jet of the Korean War, the F-100 Super Sabre and 
the X-15 rocket. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, he could see that defense contracts were on the wane. Author Mike 
Gray, in his book on North American's Apollo program, "Angle of Attack," wrote: 
"The romantic era when half a dozen guys could gather in a hotel room and 
design a bomber over a couple of cases of beer was about to be replaced by 
something off the scale of everyone's experience -- something monumental." 
</P>
<P>
 The change started in 1961, when President John F. Kennedy called for a trip 
to the moon by the end of the decade. Storms had shared the same goal since he 
was a young man. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I can remember, he said, 'I want the moon with a red ribbon on 
it,' " said his widow, Phyllis Storms, who lives in Rancho Palos Verdes. "This 
was a whole new adventure, whole new worlds." 
</P>
<P>
 But competing aerospace firms had a head start on the moon shot, and some 
called North American's team "tin benders," according to Gray's book. So Storms 
assembled a team of experts that eventually became known as the "Storm 
Troopers," named for the group's swift action in launching the Downey 
facility's space program.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were a well-organized, well-managed team," said David Levine, 67, who was 
chief electrician and has since retired in Palm Springs. "Certainly Stormy was 
the fire, the incentive, the motivator." 
</P>
<P>
 Storms also was tough to work for: He often pitted teams of engineers against 
each other to come up with solutions to solve a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "He fired me about five dozen times," said Hermosa Beach resident Earl Blount, 
who was in charge of the space division's public relations. "Stormy, of course, 
he was the guy (who) made it happen. We were just the unseen ditchdiggers." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the work force of North American's space division multiplied. By 
1964, at the height of the development, 35,000 employees worked there, most of 
them in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant gained national attention. Astronauts, including Armstrong, Buzz 
Aldrin and Michael Collins from Apollo 11, often came to perform flight 
simulations and tests, staying overnight at the Tahitian Village, a hotel down 
the street with a Polynesian theme. The astronauts became friendswith some of 
the top designers and engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good feeling to get on top of a rocket ship with 6 million pounds 
under you, and you can say, 'These are my friends who built this,' " said 
astronaut Scott, who also went on the Apollo 9 mission in March, 1969, which 
tested the spacecraft's docking functions within earth's orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the safeguards were designed by trial and error. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, one of the titanium tanks for the spacecraft's engines exploded 
in a test at the Downey plant, said Gibb, the Westchester engineer. But there 
was no explosion in identical tests done by the tank's manufacturer. The 
problem: Pure nitrogen tetroxide, the chemical that was placed in the tanks, 
undergoes a violent reaction with titanium. They added water to dilute it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You were dealing with problems with technology that was never designed 
before," Gibb said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, because of NASA's efforts at quality control, all of the metals 
had to be traced back to their origins -- right down to where the metals in 
screws were mined. 
</P>
<P>
 That meant taxing hours. Employees sometimes were away for days, or were 
called to work in the middle of the night to fix a problem. If a test failed, 
it could mean working into the night until it was corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 "One Christmas, I spent the morning with my family, but at 11:30 I got on an 
airplane in Southern California and headed off (for Houston)," said Manhattan 
Beach resident George Merrick, 66, then the chief engineer of the command 
service module programs. "I said, 'OK, guys, I'll see you later.' The way it 
was, if it took six days a week to get the job done, you did it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The long hours and the workers' single-minded dedication to the job were often 
hard on the their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could get down to a 10-hour day, we were lucky," said Bud Benner, 70, 
of Cowan Heights, who was chief of engineering for spacecraft design. "Your 
family suffers. I was very fortunate I had a wife who brought up our boys in 
good shape." 
</P>
<P>
 During the height of development in the mid-1960s, Benner's 13-year-old son 
died of a blood infection. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was pretty rough," he said. "It was devastating for my wife. I had to go 
soft for a while and pull back. But then you get involved again, all kinds of 
hours. These are very challenging programs. You can't just coast. I was back 
within a couple months." 
</P>
<P>
 Other employees suffered health problems or serious stress effects. Storms had 
a heart attack at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He, of course, didn't want to go to hospital, but, of course, they took him," 
Phyllis Storms said.  
</P>
<P>
 Her husband suffered a major setback in January, 1967, when three astronauts 
were killed in an explosion at Cape Canaveral. Later, Long Beach's three 
offshore oil islands were named in their honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Stormy "was extremely depressed," Phyllis Storms said. "It was just terrible. 
Those were his friends." 
</P>
<P>
 The cause was believed to be a spark that ignited the pure oxygen that filled 
the capsule. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Feltz, then the spacecraft program manager, said he and others argued 
for an escape hatch, but NASA told them to take it out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, part of the blame eventually was passed to the company, and the 
accident cost Storms his job. He was replaced as president of the space 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stormy happened to be the one who paid the price," said Blount, the public 
relations worker. Storms served briefly as a vice president of the company, and 
then became a consultant to the aerospace industry. He died in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems caused some workers at the facility to become even more driven. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a kind of anger when everyone pointed fingers at everyone else," 
Blount said. "But there was a determination to do even better." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, North American delivered a spacecraft light enough to be thrust 
into space and durable enough to withstand the 3,000-degree heat upon re-entry 
into Earth's atmosphere. The command module -- the only part of the spacecraft 
left by the end of the mission -- contained about 15 miles of wire and had 2 
million functional parts. But it was just under 11 feet tall and 13 feet wide, 
and weighed 12,800 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 When Apollo 11 was launched, Storms watched from a boat that a friend had 
chartered. He was not invited to Cape Canaveral. And 4 1/2 days later, when 
Armstrong set foot on the moon, Storms was watching TV at home in Palos Verdes 
Estates, alone with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 At the North American plant, a model of the solar system was set up in the 
auditorium, along with speakers to carry the astronauts' radio communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees who were off that Sunday tell stories of swarming to TV sets and 
radios. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was on the golf course with my wife and a couple of other people," said Dan 
Brown, 60, of Fountain Valley, who was director of manufacturing and now is a 
company vice president. "A man came up to me and said, 'You want me to believe 
that man is walking on the moon? Not in my lifetime.' He didn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At North American, employees got to celebrate when the astronauts came back to 
earth. There was a big splashdown party at the Tahitian Village. Several weeks 
later, the three astronauts came to thank the workers for their contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as they celebrated, the program was winding down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were laying off hundreds of people almost instantly," Blount said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Walter Cronkite went to the plant to do a story on the layoffs, the 
employees he interviewed all said they were proud of the Apollo program, Blount 
said. Thinking that it was a public relations ploy on the part of the company, 
Cronkite approached an elderly woman who had been laid off. Her response was 
the same.  
</P>
<P>
 "She told him, 'My grandkids will know I worked on this program,' " Blount 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell went on to build the space shuttle, and the company currently is 
constructing a docking module and shuttle upgrades at its Downey site. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the astronauts have tried entrepreneurial ventures. Former astronaut 
Scott is president of Scott Science and Technology in Santa Monica, a business 
that is promoting smaller lunar missions and satellite salvage operations. 
Apollo 12 astronaut Richard F. Gordon of Manhattan Beach runs Space Age 
America, a small company gathering artifacts for a Japanese space museum. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of other Apollo veterans, meanwhile, are planning a 25th anniversary 
celebration of the moon landing for July 20, when a host of engineering firms 
will be honored for their role in the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have lost touch with their colleagues. Levine, the electronics 
engineer, says he's spent the past 15 years getting to know his family. Few of 
his Palm Springs neighbors even know that he worked on Apollo. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's almost no interest," he said. "A good basketball game has almost more 
interest than space. It's hard to believe. But every time I see the moon, I see 
the guys walking up there, and I think about what an incredible journey this 
was."

 Redondo Beach: TRW Inc. designed and built the engine for the lunar module 
that allowed astronauts to descend onto the moon from their hovering 
spacecraft. In 1970, Apollo 13 astronauts used the engines to return to Earth 
after an explosion in their capsule forced the moon mission to be aborted. 
</P>

 Downey: North American Aviation, later Rockwell International, designed and 
built the spacecraft for the Apollo missions, including the command and service 
modules. It also built the adapter that housed the lunar module.

 Seal Beach: Rockwell built the second stage of the Saturn V rocket, which 
thrust astronauts from Cape Canaveral into space. The rocket part was loaded on 
a barge from the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station and shipped to Cape

 DIAMOND BAR: Ending a deadlock over development proposals for Sandstone 
Canyon, the Diamond Bar City Council last week approved a developer's plan to 
build 91 homes on 40 acres of canyon property. 
</P>
<P>
 On the following night, the Walnut Valley Unified School District, which has 
delayed building a new middle school until a place could be found to deposit 
dirt excavated from the site, voted to purchase 77 acres of adjacent land, 
including the southern portion of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The decisions came unexpectedly after several years of stalemate during which 
the City Council was unable to reconcile the developers' plans with the 
concerns of those who feared that construction in the canyon would upset its 
rich ecological diversity and destroy hundreds of ancient oak trees that shade 
the canyon floor. 
</P>
<P>
 ALHAMBRA: About 50 people -- police officers, their families and residents -- 
marched on City Hall Monday evening to protest a tentative police contract that 
they say would cut benefits for officers hired after the agreement is signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters marched along Main Street just over a mile through the city's 
business district carrying signs proclaiming: "Alhambra Police: Tops in Service 
Lowest in Pay." Alhambra Police Assn. President Joseph Flanigan said officers 
could not sign a contract that creates second-class police officers. Monday's 
protest was the second since officers rejected a tentative contract two weeks 
ago that offered a 3% pay raise but cut some benefits. Police have said they 
want a 6% pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks are scheduled to resume today, with the association represented by new 
negotiators. City management and the officers association both blame each other 
for the dispute. City officials say they negotiated in good faith and it's the 
police association that cannot get its act together. 
</P>
<P>
 MONROVIA: In a move toward building more affordable housing in the center of 
town, the City Council acting as the Redevelopment Agency's board of directors 
has approved the purchase of 131-133 W. Colorado Blvd. for townhomes. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will pay $423,000 for the property at the south end of the Myrtle 
Avenue shopping district. The site is currently occupied by an automobile 
repair shop. The agency had already purchased another property at 145 W. 
Colorado Blvd. for $280,000 and is negotiating for a third. Together they would 
provide a one-acre site for 18 to 22 townhomes for those with low to moderate 
incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 PASADENA: A Pasadena Water and Power Department supervisor has requested a 
restraining order against Councilman Isaac Richard. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pasadena Superior Court judge will decide Aug. 2 whether to issue the order. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor, Glenn Boggs, in court documents said he suffered headaches and 
chest pains after two run-ins with Richard in recent weeks. Richard has said 
that Boggs' work crews were causing a traffic hazard in his Northwest district. 
</P>
<P>
 The city took the unusual step of hiring a law firm to file the request for a 
restraining order on Boggs' behalf against Richard. A judge has already issued 
an order telling Richard to keep his distance for the next three years from 
Councilman Chris Holden. The restraining order was issued to Holden after a 
run-in with Richard at a UCLA football game at the Rose Bowl. Richard has been 
censured twice before by the council for his behavior toward city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTH EL MONTE: Close to 300 residents attended a town hall meeting held by 
the City Council to hear arguments for and against an Aug. 9 ballot measure 
that if approved would allow a card club to be built in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of Proposition A outnumbered supporters by a 4-1 margin at the 
city's senior center last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the opponents objected to placing the club 200 yards from South El 
Monte High School and cited concerns about crime. Representatives of San 
Gabriel Valley Enterprises, which proposed building the club, countered by 
passing out an artist's rendering and literature depicting the club as a 
Mission-style building with restaurants, a coffee shop and meeting rooms 
separated from the school by a grassy area and row of shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The club would be built on 21 acres of open land on the west side of Santa 
Anita Avenue, just South of the Pomona (60) Freeway. Company representatives 
also guaranteed that the city would receive a cut of the club's gross revenues. 
But opponents said no formal agreement had been signed.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: IT'S A RISKY BUSINESS FOR SVORINICH AT HIS SAN PEDRO 
DISTRICT OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OFFICE SPACE AVAILABLE: "This building is not earthquake safe. Enter at your 
own risk." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the anxiety-producing sign that greeted City Councilman Rudy Svorinich 
Jr., who represents the harbor district, when he went to work at his district 
office in San Pedro recently. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, citizens doing business with the Los Angeles City Hall district 
office will soon find employees working out of trailers or a new building. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismic tests on the San Pedro Municipal Building on South Beacon Street, 
which was built in 1928, have determined that the building is unsafe, Svorinich 
told residents at a town hall meeting last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Just to be on the safe side, Svorinich's staff will be moved out later this 
year while the building is retrofitted, he said.

 NOT-SO-CLEAN SWEEP: Some Manhattan Beach residents say they'll take dirty 
beaches over ugly streets any day. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Manhattan Beach City Council voted to post "no parking" signs around 
much of the city to clear streets of cars during the street sweepers' weekly 
visits, officials received a host of complaints. According to many residents, 
the signs are just too ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say street sweepers that now must maneuver around parked cars 
could collect an additional 200 tons of trash every year if the streets were 
cleared -- trash now winds up in the city's storm drains and, ultimately, in 
the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to dozens of complaints about the proposed signage, the council 
tabled the proposal last week. Instead, the city will institute an educational 
program to inform residents of the benefits of street sweeping on clear 
streets. Officials hope residents will move their cars voluntarily on 
designated sweeping days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people protesting are a small minority," said City Councilman Jack 
Cunningham. "If we find that a number of people are not moving their cars, I'm 
sure the council will push through" a proposal to post the signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Street sweepers clean nearly all of the city's streets, but parking is banned 
on only 25% of the streets during street-sweeping hours.

 DUNK THE MAYOR: Think Hawthorne Mayor Larry M. Guidi is all wet? For $5 you 
can make sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Guidi has agreed to sit in the dunk tank at the Hawthorne/Kiwanis Fair on July 
30 to help raise $2,000 for the Kidz Power Program at the Del Aire Assembly of 
God church. But don't look for the mayor in a bikini-style Speedo swimsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking into wearing an old suit and tie" for the event, Guidi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guidi said he'll stay in the tank as long as he keeps making money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll go down 400 times if that's what it takes," Guidi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will go to benefit the Kidz Power program, which helps area kids 
"get on the right track before they get into gangs and drugs," said Jeff S. 
Miles, associate pastor of the church. The program uses games, music, drama and 
lessons to teach community children motivation and self-worth, Miles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles hopes the mayor's appearance will generate enough community interest to 
raise a good percentage of the program's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people in the community will say 'Here's my chance to take a shot at the 
mayor' . . . but in a fun way," Miles said.

 A DIFF'RENT STROKE: Gary Coleman, the former child star who once sued his 
adoptive parents for stealing over $1 million of his money, is establishing a 
new home away from home -- a game parlor in Marina Del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm absolutely loving it. It's a lot of fun," said Coleman, adding that he is 
working with a producer on a possible new sitcom, "Arcade," featuring himself 
as, guess what? -- the operator of a game parlor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of like art imitating life but bigger than life," he said. 
Meanwhile, he's at the shop four or five nights a week, keeping busy behind the 
register, demonstrating games and helping with the occasional maintenance job. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are coming down in small droves," he said. But the fans are not 
wasting a lot of time in idle chat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people who come in are looking for the self-indulgent aspect that 
an arcade provides, so once they meet me and I shake their hands, they want 
their tokens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his parents, "all that is completely settled and we no longer discuss 
it," said Coleman, now 26, who starred for eight years on the popular 1978-1986 
sitcom, "Diff'rent Strokes." QUOTE OF THE WEEK

SILENCE OF WITNESSES IS HINDERING MURDER CASE; CRIME: TRADITIONAL RELUCTANCE OF 
ASIANS TO TALK TO POLICE HAS HAMPERED INQUIRY INTO GRADUATION NIGHT SHOOTINGS. 
SAN MARINO OFFICERS SEEK HELP OF CULTURAL EXPERTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a month after gang members opened fire on a San Marino graduation 
party, killing two youths and wounding seven others, police still have made no 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, authorities say, is silence from witnesses, many of them Asian 
Americans who traditionally do not cooperate with law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
 That cultural phenomenon, well-known in many cities, seems to have caught 
police in this affluent and generally peaceful city off guard. Although nearly 
a third of San Marino's 13,000 residents are of Asian heritage, police are just 
now turning to experts on Asian crime and culture for a quick lesson on how to 
bridge cultural differences and communicate more effectively with residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't anticipate to what extent some witnesses would be reluctant to talk 
to us," admits San Marino Police Chief Frank Wills. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 young people, most of them Asian American, were at the Lombardy 
Place party where the shooting occurred in the early morning of June 5. Dennis 
Buan, 18, of South Pasadena, and David Hang, 14, of San Marino, were shot and 
killed by a group of up to 12 gang members who had been kicked out of the party 
earlier and returned just as it was ending. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At least 15 party-goers witnessed the shooting, Wills said. One witness even 
argued heatedly with gang members, face to face and inches away from them, 
shortly before they chased him on foot to the back-yard party site and opened 
fire, he said. Yet, when police interview witnesses, the young people say they 
don't know anything or anybody or can't identify people, said Sgt. Lily 
Hadsell, a detective on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of witnesses, many of whom are not involved in gangs and are from 
upstanding families, made for favorable initial "solubility factors," as Wills 
calls them. It prompted his optimistic public statements early in the case that 
suspects would be arrested within a matter of days. 
</P>
<P>
 But fear and discomfort around police quickly silenced some key witnesses, 
Wills said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, a youngster who appeared initially cooperative and willing to 
talk to investigators was sternly warned in Chinese by a parent to say nothing, 
said Det. Tricia Gough, another investigator on the case. Afterward, when the 
English-speaking detectives sat down to interview the youth, the teen-ager 
suddenly would only relate the barest of details. Detectives came away with 
nothing usable, Gough said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The young people have told us that, among Asians, any contact with police is 
bad, even if you are the victim," Gough said. "They believe that, if you talk 
to police, it means you have done something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of those questioned by police have been unfailingly polite, 
investigators sense that information is being withheld, Wills said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, people are afraid," the chief concluded. "The other part 
is that they don't want to have their names involved with a police 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Such reluctance among law-abiding, well-educated and economically well-off 
Asian Americans is not surprising, said San-Pao Li, a professor of Asian 
studies at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The better the family, the less they want to get involved," Li said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any involvement with law enforcement or the legal system is traditionally 
considered a disgrace in China, he said. Disputes are supposed to be solved by 
elders or local gentry, not in court, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even today a person involved in a lawsuit is considered a problem person," Li 
said. The same applies to those who have dealings with police, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Asian Americans also believe that the cultural ideal of peace and harmony 
is shattered when witnesses, however innocent, talk to police. Initial 
statements can lead to more involvement and a shattering of valued peace and 
harmony, Li said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear also silences Asian Americans who are victims, not of random crimes of 
opportunity, but of well-planned robberies or extortions, said Jones Moy, a 
sergeant with the Monterey Park Police. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian American victims know that often their assailants have planned crimes 
against them in detail, learning about their family life, their phone numbers 
and where they work. Accordingly, they fear reprisals and lack faith in the 
American legal system, where accused criminals are freed on bail and trials can 
take up to a year or more to get to court, Moy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "During that whole year, they live in fear of what might happen to them," the 
sergeant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcoming such reluctance takes time and special effort, Moy said. His own 
city, whose population is more than 56% Asian American, recognized in 1978 its 
changing demographics and created a special unit to reach out to Asian 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a quarter of Monterey Park's police force of 80 officers is Asian 
American, Moy said. And the special law enforcement team is building trust 
between police and Chinese business owners and young people. Some now feel 
confident enough to call or page officers at the first sign of trouble, Moy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino police are consulting with experts on Asian gangs from the 
Sheriff's Department and surrounding cities such as Alhambra and Monterey Park, 
Hadsell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite San Marino's unexpected cultural roadblocks, Wills is cautiously 
optimistic about solving the graduation party murders. Police are 
re-interviewing witnesses in hopes of persuading them to give information, he 
said, and are building up physical evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're far from having reached a dead end," he said.

REINING IN A DONATION; $1.6-MILLION GIFT FROM 'MAN WITH THE MULES' AND HIS WIFE 
FUNDS NEW SCOUT CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "Smiser Scout Center" reads the sign in front of the new San Gabriel Valley 
Boy Scout headquarters building in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 To most, the name means little. 
</P>
<P>
 But mention "Sam the Mule Skinner" and the smiles and stories flow: 
</P>
<P>
 * The guy who used to drive a team of four perfectly matched mule pairs down 
Colorado Boulevard in the Rose Parade, some will say. 
</P>
<P>
 * The fellow who averted disaster one year when a float hitched to his mules 
lost its brakes and he reined in the skittering animals, using their muscle and 
weight to help stop the 40,000-pound runaway behemoth. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Missouri-born mule fancier whose lovingly restored antique wagons and 
teams of skilled mules help set the standard for the Mule Days Celebration in 
Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
 * The self-made San Marino millionaire who used to own a business fleet of 
Mercedes-Benzes but preferred bib overalls and Windbreakers to business suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an average American who just happens to be a millionaire," says Tim 
Estes, a float maker from Azusa who knows Sam Smiser from his years with the 
Rose parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Smiser, 79, is also a former Eagle Scout with three Scout grandsons, part of 
the reason he and his wife, Sue, donated $1.6 million to help finance 
construction of the $2.3-million building. The couple will be honored Saturday 
during dedication ceremonies at the new structure on Sierra Madre Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Smiser jokes that he made the donation "because of the tax advantages." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the Smisers' first tax advantage. They previously gave $750,000 to 
build an alumni center at Sam's alma mater, Central Missouri State University 
in Warrensburg. Their donations created the Mary Miller Smiser Heritage 
Library, named for Smiser's mother, in Warrensburg and helped restore a 
historic high school for community use in Hubbard, Tex., Sue's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sam likes his name on things," joked his wife of 52 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the donations, like Smiser's entire life, are characterized less by ego 
than by intense, personal enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Battling Parkinson's disease that has robbed him of most of his hearing and 
speech, Sam doesn't take the reins anymore behind his beloved mules. In fact, 
the mules are gone, donated to schools. And his 20-acre mule ranch in Newhall 
in the Santa Clarita Valley is now a refuge for horses saved from slaughter by 
a nonprofit agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gruff, stubbornly independent businessman with a twinkle in his eye 
leads far from a sedentary retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a fax machine, televised stock market reports, plenty of pen and paper, 
and the help of a trusted employee who serves as his mouth and ears, Smiser 
still oversees three trucking terminal companies and a variety of real estate 
and stock market holdings. On weekdays, he's in his South Gate office, 
surrounded by the noisy gear-shifting of 100 trucks as they pull in and out of 
his truck yard. At home, his working perch is a lounge chair in front of three 
television sets with a phone at his side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sam can't be still because he's been active all his life," explains his wife, 
Sue, 72, with affection in her soft Texas accent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri-born and proud of it (a small bronze bust of another Missourian, 
former President Harry S. Truman, adorns his home), Smiser and his wife 
parlayed a couple of trucks out of their Bakersfield home after World War II 
into a trucking empire. The 18-wheelers bore the name, Smiser Freight Service, 
on highways up and down California for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Sam visited his home state, wanting to buy some mules to promote his 
freight company. Teaming up with boyhood friend Keith Jones, now 76, Smiser 
embarked on what would become a 12-year enchantment with the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next dozen years, Jones and Smiser traveled to Kentucky, Kansas, 
Missouri and Tennessee to buy more than 200 champion mules. Smiser's collection 
included mini-mules, animals 46 inches tall, and a variety of wagons and 
hitches, as well as custom-made trailers to carry them all, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knew him in Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri," Jones said in a 
phone interview. "They all knew he had the best mules." 
</P>
<P>
 Smiser also honed his Missouri-bred driving skills to win numerous 
weight-pulling and trick driving contests at Bishop's annual Mule Days 
celebrations. "Sam Smiser put on the classiest arena events that we ever had," 
said Carl Lind, president of the Mule Days event. 
</P>
<P>
 His driving skills may have even saved lives in Pasadena on New Year's Day, 
1991, when brakes on the 55-foot Farmer's Insurance Float gave way on a 
downhill stretch of the Rose Parade. Smiser's team of mules, which had been 
pulling the float, began trotting, pushed behind by the runaway float. But he 
reined them in, bringing the mules and float to a stop between a gap in the 
crowd and another float. Only four people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of like threading a needle," said float builder Estes. "Nobody 
could have done it any better." 
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper reports identified Smiser then as a "Santa Clarita mule driver." 
Typically, there was no mention of San Marino, his trucking business, his money 
or his charitable donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Said wife Sue, "The man with the mules, that was good enough for him."

NUDE BEACH UNVEILS POLITICAL DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KASS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one typically blinks an eye in Rancho Palos Verdes when Mark Horn leaves 
his bathing suit in the bushes and trolls for aluminum cans on a secluded local 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a dozen years, Horn and others have enjoyed the sun's rays 
relatively free of any interference from cotton, nylon or city regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 But that may change after this week, when the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council 
is expected to receive a report from city staff and Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies on what goes on, and comes off, at the internationally known 
nude beach -- referred to as both Smuggler's Cove and Sacred Beach -- near 
Narcissa and Palos Verdes South drives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've ignored this stuff for too long," Councilman John C. McTaggart told the 
council last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The council asked for a report after Rancho Palos Verdes resident Kathy Snell, 
who lives near the beach, complained that her 15-year-old daughter was 
surprised to see a naked man "sunning himself" as the sun set. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no sun for the guy to bask in," said Snell, who is outspoken on a 
number of city issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, various city councils have discussed the issue and sometimes 
taken action, such as cutting nearby shrubs that were reportedly home to sexual 
encounters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city probably would have to pass an ordinance prohibiting nude 
sunbathing if it wants to effectively shut the beach down, said Denis Petty, 
the deputy district attorney who oversees Rancho Palos Verdes. State and 
federal laws do not prohibit such activity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Jo Purcell said Rancho Palos Verdes does not have an ordinance 
prohibiting nude sunbathing but McTaggart, an 11-year council veteran, said 
closing the beach should not be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 McTaggart said he believes a Los Angeles County ordinance prohibiting nude 
sunbathing already applies to Rancho Palos Verdes and that the city only needs 
to enforce it more aggressively. But he added that whatever it takes, the 
council has the political will to close the beach since conservatives Marilyn 
Lyonand Lee Byrd were elected in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department Capt. Herb Pettus, who oversees Rancho Palos Verdes, did 
not say whether he has received more complaints about the beach lately. But he 
did say that more naked people are being sighted outside the beach's 
traditional boundaries. "And people are offended by what they're seeing," 
Pettus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pettus guessed that the Lomita substation fields "a couple" of complaints a 
month regarding the nude beach. Pettus said deputies do not regularly patrol 
the beach, but do respond to complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The nude beach actually appears as two adjacent, horseshoe-shaped beaches, 
separated by a small point. On the eastern beach, what most agree is the 
"straight" or heterosexual side, nine men and three women were sunning 
themselves one recent afternoon. Most were naked. Half a dozen men, some of 
them naked, were on the western beach. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why they frequent the beach, sunbathers on both beaches invariably 
reply "freedom" from clothing and society. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels a lot more natural," said a 32-year-old West Hollywood businessman 
who wished to remain anonymous because he worried about offending his clients, 
"and I'm always naked at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Horn, the aluminum can collector, was wearing a white tank top, a neon 
baseball cap, a necklace with a jade figurine, and nothing else. He said he has 
been living in nearby bushes for three years, and first came to the nude beach 
in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn says beach attendance has increased since his first visit, and three 
months ago a city staffer asked him to help control those wandering from the 
beach's traditional borders because the city had "suddenly" received a number 
of complaints.

LOCATION FOR GARDENA RETAIL PROJECT ASSAILED; BUSINESS: THE NORTH END OF TOWN 
HAS FAR MORE NEED OF THE SHOPPING AREA, ACTIVISTS SAY. CITY OFFICIALS POINT TO 
LOWER LAND COSTS THAT ENCOURAGE BUILDING IN THE SOUTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Philip Johnson has lived on the north end of Gardena for 25 years and can 
recall the store he would run to as a child on errands for his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The store was a Ralph's supermarket on Rosecrans and Van Ness avenues, but it 
closed about 10 years ago, Johnson said. An Alpha Beta was once on Rosecrans 
too. It shut earlier this year and still stands boarded up. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, one shopping center -- Supreme Market on Western Avenue -- lies within 
Gardena's boundaries north of Rosecrans, where African American and Latino 
residents make up 90% of some neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 According to census data, the shopping center serves a population of about 
15,000. By contrast, in southern Gardena, the ratio is one market for every 
2,300 residents, most of whom are white or Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a newly formed group of activists is criticizing city officials as they 
move to bring another major chain to the south end, at Artesia Boulevard and 
Vermont Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The city recently bought a vacant 10-acre site from Caltrans for $3.74 
million. It plans to sell it for the same price to De Anza Properties of 
Sunnyvale, which will build a 64,000-square-foot Smith's Food and Drug Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The development could bring the city as much as $500,000 a year in sales tax, 
City Manager Kenneth W. Landau said. And, Landau added: "If we hadn't bought 
it, it would have gone to a private developer and we'd have no control over 
what development would be there." 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents, who call themselves the South Bay Open Space and Youth 
Recreation Committee, argue that the plan is an example of the economic 
"redlining" that, they say, appears to have gone on in Gardena for many years. 
Committee member Frank O'Brien said the area south of Redondo Beach Boulevard 
is particularly concentrated with market development -- 10 markets, or one for 
every 1,750 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We question the decision of the city to actively assist a private developer 
locate a new store in an area already well-served by markets when the north 
side entirely lacks these facilities," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has notified the local chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People about his group's discrimination concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent disparity in the number of markets on the two sides of town is 
not intentional, Landau said, but he agreed that the city's development plans 
are based on economics. 
</P>
<P>
 As city officials have aggressively encouraged development during the past 
nine years, they have often offered incentives such as sales tax rebates, he 
said. As a result, enough business has been attracted to recoup losses 
experienced in the 1980s, when four of the city's six card clubs -- then a 
major source of revenue for Gardena -- closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're one of the most financially secure cities because of the 
private/public partnership we've sought," Landau said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said city officials are working to revitalize northern Gardena, but they 
have found more willingness to invest in the south, where land is cheaper and 
less industrial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've talked of trying to relocate other businesses from other cities," 
Landau said. "I personally have spent a lot more time trying to attract 
development in the area north of Rosecrans rather than in the south, but the 
price of land is so high in (the city's north) that it's not feasible for 
developers to come in." 
</P>
<P>
 However, opponents say the city is not doing enough to ensure that all 
citizens are represented with equal services. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, they point out, no public hearing on the Smith's development has been 
held, and O'Brien said repeated requests to meet with individual council 
members to discuss alternative sites have been refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, they say, a state-required Environmental Impact Report has not been 
done, even as grading has begun at the site on Artesia and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
 Landau said the work is soil remediation. He added that public hearings on the 
report and the site plan will be held in about 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intention is to do everything possible to have the Smith's food center at 
that site," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When O'Brien's committee first objected to the new development, it was worried 
about harm to an adjacent natural area of rare willow wetland that is used by 
migratory birds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the committee's concerns go beyond the environment, O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not using the issue of economic redlining as a means to achieve our 
environmental goal; we want to improve the city generally. We want to preserve 
open space and also make sure all parts of the community have access to all the 
services they need," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said the committee has been meeting with business and community 
leaders on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, the 25-year resident of the city, ran a mayoral campaign in the April 
city election criticizing the city for neglecting the north and doing business 
behind closed doors. He said he can understand the city's business rationale. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he would like a development such as Smith's in the north because 
there are high-income earners in some neighborhoods who can support it. That 
they don't have it, he says, is an indication that something more than 
economics might be at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I've been trying to avoid for a long time, the racist 
picture," Johnson said. "But that's what it looks like."

R.P.V. LANDSLIDE ABATEMENT HITS PERMIT, FUNDING SNAGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KASS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rancho Palos Verdes council members are trying to stop local landslides by any 
means necessary, even if it means breaking the law. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 5, the council considered three measures aimed at halting landslides 
at Portuguese Bend and Abalone Cove, but the council may have moved onto shaky 
legal ground by voting to leave an undetermined number of square metal baskets 
filled with rocks, known as gabions, on the shoreline between Inspiration Point 
and the Portuguese Bend Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The boxes, stretched out along almost 2,000 feet of coastline, are designed to 
prevent landslides by minimizing beach erosion. But storms in March, 1992, 
destroyed a number of gabions and the city has been unsuccessful in snagging 
Federal Emergency Management Agency money for new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a temporary gabion permit, issued by the California Coastal 
Commission, expired in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Trent Pulliam, the director of public works, suggested on July 5 that the 
council remove any remaining gabions. But the council decided that protecting 
Palos Verdes Drive South, a main roadway, from landslides is more important 
than permit compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's politically correct to fix the infrastructure people use to get back and 
forth from work," said Councilman John C. McTaggart, who criticized FEMA for 
not providing money to replace the damaged gabions. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA refused the city's request for funds to replace the gabions because they 
don't last long, and because Rancho Palos Verdes failed to document the damage 
or obtain the necessary permits, according to a FEMA memo dated Jan. 19. 
Pulliam has countered that FEMA does not want to pay for the gabions and is 
simply stalling. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA, however, did agree to contribute $20,000 toward removal of damaged 
gabions. A city report estimates the total cost of removal at $20,000 to 
$30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the city finds any undamaged gabions and leaves them in place, it could be 
in violation of the coastal commission permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Cave, the coastal commission's superintendent of enforcement, said the 
case has not been brought to her attention. But she said that if the coastal 
commission deems the city a "knowing and intentional" violator, Rancho Palos 
Verdes could be fined up to $15,000 per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on July 5, the council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, considered 
two measures to curb landslides at Abalone Cove, adjacent to Portuguese Bend. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency held a public hearing on drilling six dewatering wells, which 
function like standard wells and are meant to lower the ground water level. A 
final vote on the wells is expected Tuesday.

JUDGE REJECTS SUIT OVER DENIAL OF LIQUOR PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge has rejected business owner Jerry Jamgotchian's lawsuit 
against the city for denying him a permit to sell liquor at his billiards hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamgotchian sued the city and City Council after he was denied a conditional 
use permit three times. The permit would allow Jamgotchian to obtain a state 
liquor license. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has denied the permit because Jamgotchian's business, South Bay 
Billiards, is within 600 feet of Hawthorne High School, said acting City Atty. 
Glen Shishido. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ruling filed last month, Judge Robert H. O'Brien said the law was not 
vague and that city officials had shown that issuing a permit would lead to 
problems for area residents.

HAWTHORNE CUTS 30 JOBS, HIKES UTILITY TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with a new $1.1-million deficit, long-term million-dollar debts and a 
sluggish economy, the Hawthorne council this week balanced its 1994-95 budget 
by trimming its work force and raising the city's utility users tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The $27-million spending plan, adopted Monday on a 3-1 vote, will mean 
Hawthorne residents and business can expect a little less than they are 
accustomed to. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget includes a cut of 30 positions, which will mean longer waits for 
city services such as road repair and building inspection, and delays in public 
facilities repairs, said interim City Manager James A. Algie. In addition, city 
officials are seriously looking at raising water rates and sewer fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "For non-public safety departments, we've cut through the muscle and chipped 
halfway through the bone," Algie said. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase of 1.5% in the utility tax is expected to raise the average 
resident's rate about $1 a month. The current utility charge is about $65. 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposed water rate increase would be much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a city water rate study, since 1989 the city has absorbed a cost 
increase of almost 200% for the water it buys from outside sources. But 
residents' water rates have not gone up for the five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The study puts average monthly residential water rates at $19.30 and 
recommends an increase of at least 44% over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The city can no longer absorb the costs and must pass the increases on to the 
consumer, Algie said. Some businesses will be expected to pay far more than 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Schoenfeld, a local business owner for more than 30 years, told the 
council last month that the utility tax increase will raise his monthly bill 
from $350 to $500 -- a 43% hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenfeld said his business, A-1 Catering, has seen its gross sales plummet 
over the last few years from $5 million to $1.8 million annually. The 
recession, he said, has forced him to cancel profit sharing and health 
benefits. The tax increase, Schoenfeld said, would hurt his business even 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of how many nails you can drive into the coffin," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rerouting of taxes to the state over the past few years has cost the city 
$6 million to $7 million a year, Algie said. "The state doesn't give anything 
back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make up for the loss, city officials are studying ways to bring in revenue, 
including leasing out city office space, developing city land and levying new 
assessments to pay for public safety services. 
</P>
<P>
 And more money may be needed soon. Councilman Steven Anderson said he fears 
that lawsuits against the city could add up to millions of dollars.

EL SEGUNDO SLASHES BUDGET, 15 JOBS; ECONOMY: DEFENSE CUTBACKS FINALLY TAKE 
THEIR TOLL, FORCING A $1.1-MILLION CUT IN TOWN COFFERS AND THE LAYOFF OF CITY 
EMPLOYEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 El Segundo city employees for years have worked in the eye of an economic 
hurricane, quietly going about their duties while, within only a two-mile 
radius, scores of merchants went broke and struggling defense firms laid off 
thousands of workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defense cutbacks that have devastated commerce in the small, 
industrial town over the last five years finally have taken a toll on the work 
force in City Hall. The council slashed a $28-million budget last week by $1.1 
million and cut 15 positions, including the assistant city manager, to pay for 
a plan to attract new businesses to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The job cuts will offset a 10% reduction in business license taxes, the fees 
firms pay to operate in El Segundo. Officials hope the tax breaks, which will 
cost $1.1 million a year and save some businesses as much as $70,000, will 
attract high-technology firms to fill the office buildings once packed with 
aerospace workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will send the message to businesses that we're willing to make the 
difficult calls (to attract them), and this was a tough call," said City 
Manager James W. Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
 But while city officials said the job cuts are essential if El Segundo is to 
regain its reputation as a high-tech, business-friendly giant, many city 
workers were shocked by the extent of the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disappointing, especially when you're looking at the fiscal condition of 
the city and other opportunities to cut," said Assistant City Manager Don 
Harrison, whose position was among those cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than cut so many jobs, including a fire marshal, a purchasing agent and 
a librarian, El Segundo could have drawn on its more than $20 million in 
reserves, Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the 15 positions eliminated were vacant, and the remaining layoffs will 
take effect Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not popular people with the city employees, I'm sure," acknowledged 
City Councilman Liam B. Weston. "But I don't want to be responsible for 
rearranging the furniture on the Titanic, and (El Segundo is) about five years 
away from hitting the iceberg." 
</P>
<P>
 Weston believes the city's precarious position demands a tough policy. "We 
need to re-navigate the ship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, nearly 100,000 workers descended on El Segundo each morning 
on their way to work at Hughes, TRW or one of the many other firms owing its 
existence to defense contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 But since then, the work force has shrunk steadily. Some estimate that fewer 
than 60,000 workers now make the commute to and from El Segundo each day. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials fear the next blow could come from Hughes Aerospace and 
Electronics. The company plans to cut several thousand jobs next month, many of 
which could come from its military and electronics system plants in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline in workers continues to take a toll on the city's small machine 
shops, cleaners and burger stands, many of which have closed in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the city's business license revenues -- based on a firm's square 
footage and number of workers -- totaled about $11 million, almost $1 million 
less than in fiscal 1991-92. Business license tax revenues were projected to 
bring in about $9 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope to fill the void created by the aerospace exodus with a 
variety of industries, including electric car, solar power and 
telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scary part is exactly how to do that," Weston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council recently voted to hire an economic development manager to 
oversee the city's plan to attract new businesses and retain successful firms 
in El Segundo.

CARSON TO LAY OFF 7, CUT MAINTENANCE SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Struggling to balance a $30-million budget for fiscal 1994-95, the Carson City 
Council this week voted to lay off seven part-time employees and reduce the 
maintenance of municipal property including streets and parks. 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Lawrence G. Olson warned that these cuts still might not be 
enough to keep the city financially healthy if state budget problems cause 
further reductions in city funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very fragile, delicate budget," Olson said. "There is virtually no 
room for either mistakes or problems on the revenue side or the expenditure 
side." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said the budget approved Tuesday assumes that costs for the city 
attorney can be reduced by $180,000, and that other projected revenue sources 
remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also cut funding for a sheriff's department vehicle that patrolled 
the South Bay Pavillion. City officials said the mall should pay for its own 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 Cultural events such as the Jazz Festival, Cinco de Mayo, Martin Luther King 
Day and others will not be held this year. Instead, the city will hold one 
spring event, tentatively titled "Friendship Day." 
</P>
<P>
 Street sweeping and grass cutting, which used to be done every week, will be 
cut back to twice per month. 
</P>
<P>
 City employees, who have not had a pay raise in four years, will not get any 
increase this year either, although the council has proposed using surplus 
funds from the 1993-94 budget to give each employee a one-time payment of $500. 
</P>
<P>
 The laid-off employees worked primarily in the parks and recreation and 
maintenance departments. Although classified as part-time workers, many of them 
worked 40 hours a week and had been employed by the city for more than two 
years, said Councilwoman Lorelie S. Olaes. 
</P>
<P>
 Olaes asked the council to consider cuts in other budget categories such as 
supplies, professional memberships and conference travel in order to keep the 
part-time workers for one more year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council passed the tightened budget 3-1, with only Olaes voting 
against it. Councilman Peter D. Fajardo was absent.

RICK PEREZ, BASEBALL STANDOUT, DIES AT 20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID A. AVILA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The former coach of a college baseball star who died in a recent hiking 
accident remembers Rick Perez as one of his surprises, a youth the coach at 
first thought lacked talent but who proved him wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have the guts to tell him he couldn't be on the team, and instead 
he ended up being one of our all-stars," said Ken Weldon at Perez's funeral 
Saturday. Weldon coaches a Babe Ruth baseball team in the San Gabriel Valley 
named the El Monte Dukes, which Perez joined in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, 20, a former student at El Monte High, died July 2 when he fell off a 
trail while hiking with a friend in Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a standout baseball player this year at Upper Iowa University in 
Fayette, Iowa, where he played outfield and set several batting records. He was 
also a star outfielder for East Los Angeles College and had plans to become a 
police officer in his hometown after his baseball career. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was an overachiever," said Weldon, an El Monte Police officer. "By the 
time we realized how special he really was, he was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Weldon and others said Perez was continuously misjudged by his peers and 
instructors. Eventually, through persistence and hard work, he persuaded others 
to judge him again in school and sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never spoke much on the field," said Mando Santa Anna, a teammate of 
Perez's at both East Los Angeles College and in high school. "He led by 
example." 
</P>
<P>
 At Upper Iowa University, Perez broke the all-time record for hits in a season 
with 57, a spokeswoman said. He also had a .401 batting average and was 
selected for the all-regional team comprising the best players in the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Academics was a secondary goal until he attended the tiny, 100-year-old 
Iowa-based university. He was a psychology major and had above-average grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called me from Iowa to tell me he had finally decided on a major," said Al 
Cone, his baseball coach at East Los Angeles College. "He was very happy and 
his grades were good." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez is survived by his younger brother and parents, who live in El Monte.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MANHATTAN BEACH; WILSON JOINS CEREMONY HONORING SLAIN OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A marble and bronze monument was dedicated Wednesday to Manhattan Beach Police 
Officer Martin Ganz, whose slaying during a traffic stop in December shocked 
the community and sparked a nationwide manhunt that continues today. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson was among the dignitaries who attended the ceremony at Live 
Oak Park, a block south of the police station. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Guidone, 50, a Manhattan Beach dentist who raised $16,000 to build the 
monument, said he hopes the memorial will give community members a place to 
resolve painful memories of Ganz's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in this beautiful, isolated bubble in Manhattan Beach, and I hope 
this will remind people to be more aware that there are some people in this 
society who have ill will," said Guidone. 
</P>
<P>
 A bronze casting of Ganz's helmet, keys, badge and gloves sits on a pillar 
that rises from the circular, marble memorial.

<P>
 Skeletal remains found behind a Mammoth Lakes shopping mall on Friday have 
been identified as those of a Gardena woman who had been missing almost four 
years, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Hitoma Koga had been missing since December, 1990, when she rented a 
condominium in Mammoth Lakes but never checked out.Mammoth police officers 
found her belongings in the room. 
</P>
<P>
 After two boys reported finding skeletal remains in thick brush and trees near 
the large shopping center, forensics experts used Koga's dental chart 
comparisons to confirm the identity of the remains. They will perform further 
tests to determine a cause of death, said Steve Maris, Mono County chief deputy 
coroner. 
</P>
<P>
 After her disappearance, friends and relatives reported that she was 
despondent over medical problems and the loss of her job as a dental hygienist. 
Koga's brother, Richard Koga, circulated flyers in 1990 with the hope that 
someone had seen his sister, who was 30 when she disappeared. BENETT KESSLER

TOPICS / ROADS; EXTENSION OF LONG BEACH FREEWAY OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate Transportation Committee approved a bill last week allowing the 
California Dept. of Transportation to build the long-delayed extension of the 
Long Beach Freeway through South Pasadena without the city's agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 After two hours of debate July 5, the committee voted 6 to 2 in favor of the 
bill proposed by Assemblywoman Diane Martinez (D-Rosemead). 
</P>
<P>
 The committee was considered a major challenge for the bill that has already 
received approval from the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased. This was one of our toughest hurdles," said Mary Kelley, 
spokesman for the city of Alhambra, which supports the freeway extension 
because it would pull traffic from the city's streets. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena, a decades-long foe of the freeway extension, is one of four 
cities on the proposed 6.2-mile extension to run north from the San Bernardino 
Freeway to the Foothill Freeway. South Pasadena officials vowed to take the 
fight to the Senate floor, where opposition is likely to be strongest.

TOPICS / WILDLIFE; ARREST SPOTLIGHTS UNLAWFUL TRADE IN BEAR GALLBLADDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LISA O'NEILL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In addition to ginseng, one of the strongest and most sought-after medicines 
in the Asian community is bear gallbladders, wildlife officials say. But there 
are few bears in Asia, they say, leaving a community with a demand that needs 
to be met elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 And, according to wildlife officials, the demand is being met in the United 
States by people who buy animal parts and export them to Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Case in point: the June 23 arrest of Joseph S. Chang, a 39-year-old Rosemead 
man who allegedly bought 164 bear gallbladders, with the intent, officials say, 
of transporting them to Asia for use in folk remedies. 
</P>
<P>
 "(We) suspect when a buyer like this obtains bear gallbladders, his best 
markets are South Korea and China," said Lt. Eddie Watkins of the California 
Department of Fish and Game. In Korea, bear gallbladders can go for as much as 
$20,000 at a street price, Watkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang, owner of AA Radiator and AA Fur and Leather on East Garvey Avenue, was 
arrested on suspicion of two felony counts of illegal purchase and sale of 
animal parts. It is a felony in California to buy or sell bear parts. Chang 
denied the charges, each of which could mean a year in state prison and a 
$10,000 fine if he is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang's arrest ended an 18-month multi-state investigation of illegal wildlife 
trafficking. Officials say that Chang bought the parts from dealers in Utah, 
Colorado, Alaska and California, and that most of the gallbladders came from 
American black bears.

<P>
 San Gabriel Valley state lawmakers are cautiously eyeing a controversial 37% 
pay raise, with only two -- Sens. Newton Russell and Charles Calderon -- saying 
outright they will accept the unexpected windfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the 10 area legislators either refused to state their intentions or 
have not responded to numerous calls from The Times about whether they will 
accept the $19,500-a-year pay raise that takes effect Jan. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Fred Aguiar (R-Chino) is the only Valley legislator who has 
pledged not to take the pay raise, according to the National Tax Limitation 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington-based group asked candidates to sign a pledge not to take the 
raise until the economy improves and the state balances its budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the wrong time for a pay raise with the economy the way it is right 
now," said Aguiar, who represents parts of Pomona and the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Many, like Assemblywoman Hilda Solis (D-El Monte), who is competing for a 24th 
District Senate seat, have refused to take a position. "At this moment I 
haven't decided what to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent citizens' commission decided May 6 to boost legislators' 
salaries from $52,500 to $72,000 a year.  
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the pay decision during both the state's continuing economic 
problems and an election year has turned the matter into a campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Diane Martinez (D-Monterey Park) refused to state her position. 
Four area legislators did not return repeated telephone calls asking for their 
position on the pay raise: Assembly members Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena), Grace 
Napolitano (D-Norwalk), Richard Mountjoy (R-Arcadia) and Sen. Ruben S. Ayala 
(D-Chino).

TOPICS / ARCHITECTURE; PASADENA COMPLEX WINS BEAUTIFICATION AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After four years and $90 million in renovations, one Colorado Boulevard 
shopping complex has won the Los Angeles Business Council's Beautification 
Award in the historical renovation/adaptive reuse category. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex in Old Pasadena has 23 businesses, ranging from bookstores and art 
galleries to clothing stores and restaurants, as well as the city's first jail, 
general store and City Hall, which date back to the late 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 An outdoor courtyard with sculptures and benches was created from back alleys 
and brick doors. "It was generic space," said Scott Bates, an architect who 
worked on the complex. "But outdoor spaces are just as important as indoor 
spaces in Southern California. So we designed a place where people can eat and 
relax." 
</P>
<P>
 The council, which consists of various Los Angeles businesses, has awarded 
annual beautification certificates since 1970 to recognize and promote the 
architecture, landscapes and historical renovations in Los Angeles County.

 The City Council passed a 1994-95 budget of $12.3 million Tuesday, although 
the city must still conclude salary negotiations with sworn officers and other 
police department employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Tuesday's 4-0 vote, the council had held four special budget meetings 
and a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The new budget is 7.2% less than last year's $13.5-million spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bill Yeomans, the city finance director, said residents should notice 
little change in services. He said last year's budget was larger because it 
included a number of public works projects, such as storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 The city reported a $3.5-million surplus, but officials say strings are 
attached to most of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the budget are 3% pay raises for all city employees except 
department heads and public safety workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers have been asking for raises of 5% to 6% and rejected a recent 
offer of 3% with a 1% signing bonus -- about $400, according to city and police 
officials. JEFF KASS

COMMUNITY NEWS: HERMOSA BEACH; COUNCIL TABLES VOTE ON ANTI-DRILLING INITIATIVE

<P>
 The City Council this week postponed a vote until Aug. 9 on whether to put an 
anti-oil drilling initiative on the statewide November ballot or hold a special 
election next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative's proponents, who collected 1,628 signatures, hope to quash a 
plan by MacPherson Oil Co. of Santa Monica to dig 30 wells at a slant under the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they want to study how a public vote will affect the 
project before they decide whether to place the initiative on the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hermosa voters approved two pro-oil initiatives in 1984, the oil company 
was granted a lease from the city to drill the wells in a city yard at 6th 
Street and Valley Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the project poses safety hazards, and contend that voters then 
were swayed by high gasoline prices. But Donald MacPherson Jr., president of 
the oil company, said a vote either way will not affect the project. JAMES 
BENNING

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; 2 WOMEN IN PARKED CAR INJURED BY 1 BULLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 26-year-old Torrance woman remained in critical condition Wednesday after 
she and a friend were wounded by the same bullet during a shooting in West 
Hollywood early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Ann La Pierre regained consciousness on Tuesday and is able to recognize 
family members, said a spokesman for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The other victim, 21-year-old Samantha Holcomb, also of Torrance, was treated 
at Cedars-Sinai and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Deputy Larry Mead said the shooting occurred about 2 a.m. as the two 
women sat in their parked car on North Sweetzer Avenue just south of Santa 
Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 A gunman approached the driver's side of the car and fired a shot from a 
large-caliber semiautomatic handgun, Mead said. The bullet passed through La 
Pierre's neck and struck Holcomb in the left thigh.

<TEXT>
<P>
 AlliedSignal Inc. was cited by air quality officials for a hydrofluoric acid 
leak June 15 that forced the closure of two streets and the evacuation of a 
golf course and a construction site. 
</P>
<P>
 The company violated two South Coast Air Quality Management District rules by 
creating a public nuisance and failing to operate its equipment according to 
its permit, said AQMD spokesman Sam Atwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody was injured by the leak, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said about 85 pounds of the chemical leaked from faulty 
lining connecting two pipes in the plant on Sepulveda Boulevard, where 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons are manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
 The company could be fined, and AQMD officials will decide in several weeks 
whether to refer the case to the district attorney's office for criminal 
prosecution. JAMES BENNING

outside an El Segundo hotel in March. He has since been placed under the 
protection of the district attorney's office.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WILMINGTON; FREE CHILD VACCINATIONS, LEAD TESTING AVAILABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Free vaccinations and lead testing for children will be offered in Wilmington 
this month at three health fairs organized by medical students and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The testing is a project of the Department of Family Medicine at Harbor/UCLA 
Medical Center near Torrance, which offered vaccinations in Wilmington last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Free lead screenings for children are being added because many area homes are 
older and may have been painted with lead-based paint.  
</P>
<P>
 Lead screenings, vaccinations and physical examinations are free for children 
ages 6 and under, and free tetanus vaccines are available for adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The health fairs will be held 1 to 7 p.m. Saturday at the Wilmington Fiesta in 
Banning Park; 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. July 24 at the Holy Family Church, 1122 E. 
Robidoux St., and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. July 30 at the Dana Strand Community 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 More information is available from the Wilmington Vaccination and Lead 
Screening Project, 508 East E St., Wilmington, (310) 830-3401, 830-4254 or

COMMUNITY NEWS: ARCADIA; TWO GIRLS, 16, ESCAPE KIDNAPING ATTEMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arcadia police are searching for a man who shot two teen-age girls with a stun 
gun and tried to kidnap them as they walked home in a quiet residential 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Police describe the suspect as an African American man between the ages of 30 
and 35; he is 6 feet, 3 inches tall, weighs more than over 200 pounds and has a 
shaved head.He was wearing what appeared to be a red nylon warm-up suit at the 
time of the incident, police said. The two 16-year-old girls were attacked 
about 10:30 p.m. July 5 while walking in the 1300 block of Golden West Avenue, 
which borders Temple City, Arcadia Police Capt. Dave Hinig said.  
</P>
<P>
 They were approached from behind by a man who grabbed one of them by the neck 
and tried to pull her into a maroon 1990 or 1991 Dodge van. He discharged the 
stun gun at her back, Hinig said, as the teen-ager resisted and screamed. He 
then grabbed the other girl and shot her with the stun gun in the upper torso. 
</P>
<P>
 A 29-year-old Temple City man heard the girls' screams, Hinig said and ran to 
their aid. The suspect jumped into the van and fled. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' injuries were superficial, police said.

 BALDWIN PARK: A 14-year-old Baldwin Park boy was arrested Monday in El Monte 
after he allegedly used a gun to steal a car and other property two days 
earlier in Baldwin Park. The youth, whose name was not released, had allegedly 
stolen a car, a wallet and a pager from Jose Luis Alcala, a 23-year-old West 
Covina resident who was washing his car at a coin-operated carwash when the 
incident occurred at 3:10 a.m. Saturday. The suspect was spotted in the car at

COMMUNITY NEWS: CARSON; SKATER TO SHOW RUSSIANS A THRASH OR TWO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Carson teen-ager Wes Watanabe will pack his bags full of beef jerky, Chinese 
noodles and five skateboards for a trip to the Goodwill Games in Russia later 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Watanabe, 16, is one of nine skaters from the California Amateur Skateboard 
League invited by the Leningrad Skateboarding Federation to appear at the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting July 23, more than 2,000 athletes from 50 countries will compete in 
St. Petersburg. Although teams from all over the world will participate in 
slalom, downhill and ramp skateboarding competitions, the sport is considered a 
cultural exhibition rather than an athletic event. 
</P>
<P>
 Watanabe, who has never been out of the country before, plans to rely on ramen 
and jerky, figuring he won't like the food in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 He also got a Russian phrase book, but found the Cyrillic alphabet and foreign 
pronunciation daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says he'll just use sign language," said his mother, Karen Watanabe. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip to St. Petersburg will cost $3,000, about half of which the Watanabes 
have raised through donations from individuals and manufacturers. Wes Watanabe 
is also working with his father to earn money for his trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Wes and his older brother, George, raced Big Wheels in the 
driveway, competition has been part of the family.  
</P>
<P>
 Wes Watanabe has only been skateboarding competitively for about three years. 
George, now 21, has been a professional skateboarder for more than six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wes Watanabe leads his semi-professional division at CASL, which is the 
highest level that is not sponsored by a store or manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 CASL officials said they invited good skateboarders on the trip who would also 
make good ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think CASL looked at him as a good diplomat," said Ted Okamoto, who owns 
Vanguard Surf Culture, a skateboard shop in Redondo Beach where Watanabe 
practices. "I think they picked him not only because of his skating ability but 
his personality. . . . He's very low-key." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the cream of the crop," said Jeanne Hoffman, who's organizing the trip 
for CASL. 
</P>
<P>
 Wes Watanabe is the only member of the group from the Los Angeles area. The 
others come from San Bernardino, Upland, San Clemente and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 After the games, the group will take a train trip to Moscow and do some other 
sightseeing during their two-week trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman said she thinks the experience will be an eye-opener for the group 
because the California team will stay with Russian skaters' families during the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want this to be a cultural experience," Hoffman said. "And maybe they'll 
appreciate what they've got here." MARY GUTHRIE

 In a celebration of the World Cup soccer tournament, the team from one of 
Europe's smallest nations will play the Falcons, one of the Southland's

<P>
 The Walnut Valley Unified School Board has removed a major obstacle to the 
construction of the South Pointe Middle School in Diamond Bar by voting to buy 
land to accommodate dirt that occupies the proposed school site. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction of a $16-million school on open land purchased from R-N-P 
Development in the Sandstone Canyon area has been held up awaiting removal of 
400,000 cubic yards of dirt from the site. The district paid $1.5 million for 
the 78-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials had planned to move the dirt to a site next to the school owned by 
the developer, but they later discovered it would require environmental permits 
that could take nine months to acquire.

<P>
 Former Mayor Raul Pardo is facing a misdemeanor charge of battery after what a 
sheriff's report calls a deliberate and unprovoked assault on a local newspaper 
photographer outside a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred July 6 after a heated town hall meeting concerning an 
Aug. 9 ballot measure on whether to allow a card club in South El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardo, who was voted out as mayor last April but is still a city planning 
commissioner, allegedly assaulted Larry Rodriguez, a photographer for the South 
El Monte Mirror, and David Santos, an El Monte resident who tried to stop the 
brawl, according to a Sheriff's Department report of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardo, 32, is a strong supporter of the card club; Rodriguez's newspaper has 
opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 The former mayor was taken into custody after a citizen's arrest by the 
alleged victims and was later booked at the sheriff's Temple City station on 
suspicion of battery. A citizen's arrest was made because no law enforcement 
official saw any blows make contact with the victims, said sheriff's Lt. 
Anthony Torres, the City Council sergeant-at-arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy James Kozak, who interviewed four witnesses, wrote in his report that 
Pardo's attack was "deliberate and unprovoked." 
</P>
<P>
 Pardo was released on his own recognizance. He has denied the charge.

 The bodies of two San Gabriel Valley men were found by Coast Guard searchers 
Tuesday morning amid debris from a boat that apparently sank in mysterious 
circumstances along a busy shipping corridor 10 miles off Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members identified one of the dead as Khanh Nguyen, 50, of Alhambra.The 
Coast Guard identified the second man as Nhieu Van Nguyen, 52, of San Gabriel. 
The men are unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of Khanh Nguyen told investigators that the two men set out on a 
fishing trip late Monday night, said Los Angeles County Coroner's spokesman 
Scott Carrier. He said the relatives did not know where the boat had been 
docked. The family became worried when Khanh had not returned by Tuesday 
morning and called authorities after hearing reports that the bodies had been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities received no distress calls overnight and did not know what 
happened to the two men or their boat. "This case is unusual," said Lt. Jeffrey 
C. Jackson, commanding officer of one of the Coast Guard boats. "The mystery of 
it all is that usually people have a chance to get at least one radio call in." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither man was wearing a life jacket. However, one was found clutching a life 
preserver, and the other was holding onto a boat fender -- a plastic barrel 
hung over the side of a boat to cushion it while at a dock, said Coast Guard 
spokeswoman Liz Brannan.  
</P>
<P>
 Brannan said a private boater spotted one of the bodies shortly before 7 a.m. 
She said a Coast Guard cutter recovered the second body about two hours later 
amid a floating trail of ice chests, line, a tarp and other debris.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY; A FULL BOWL HAS ITS PRICE; AS MAJOR EVENTS AT 
THE STADIUM REACH AN ALL-TIME HIGH, ADDING MORE MONEY TO CITY COFFERS, SOME 
NEARBY RESIDENTS ARE FRUSTRATED BY THE INCREASED TRAFFIC, BRIGHT LIGHTS, UNRULY 
FANS AND NOISE.

 The World Cup game was going full tilt and, at times, the Rose Bowl's public 
address system drowned out Cam Currier as he talked on the deck of his hillside 
home about half a mile west. 
</P>
<P>
 Three helicopters and two airplanes towing banners buzzed overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody can tolerate almost anything as long as it's temporary and 
occasional," said Currier, a member of the influential Linda Vista/Annandale 
Assn., which represents the owners of the pricey homes west of the Rose Bowl. 
"But I can see it getting to the point where it gets intolerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Anchored by eight World Cup games, including the finals this weekend, the Rose 
Bowl this year is hosting more major events -- 23 -- than ever before. Indeed, 
the number is almost twice as many as a 6-year-old cap on bowl events allows. 
</P>
<P>
 More events bring more money to city coffers, more recognition for Pasadena, 
potentially more business to local stores and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also bring more street-clogging cars, more unruly fans and noise, and 
more nights disturbed by the stadium's bright lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents on both the more affluent west side of the Rose Bowl and the 
more modest east flank accuse the City Council of wanting to turn the Rose Bowl 
into a "cash cow" to pay for services citywide at the expense of those who live 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the council will approve as many events as they can without causing 
an absolute uproar or revolt," said Penny York, another activist who lives to 
the west of the Rose Bowl. "If they think they can get away with more, and 
they're offered more money, they would do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some city leaders, on the other hand, accuse aggressive residents of selfishly 
wanting the Rose Bowl to be a "lawn ornament." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of World Cup revenue, city officials plan to plunge an additional $1 
million into gang-prevention and other city programs in coming months, at a 
time when other cities face cutbacks because of state budget balancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not in a financial position where we can let the Rose Bowl sit unused," 
Councilman William E. Thomson said in a recent interview. "We're going to have 
to put more concerts in there, or something of that sort that brings in money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to decide soon whether to raise the cap permanently 
and if so, how many events of each type -- sporting, concerts and so forth -- 
to allow each year. The directors of the Rose Bowl Operating Co. established by 
the council, of which York is vice president, are developing a master plan for 
review later this year that would include those issues as well as making 
possible improvements to the bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the Rose Bowl will host about twice as many major events this year 
as it did in 1993: the Rose Bowl game, two Pink Floyd concerts, 10 World Cup 
events, six UCLA football games, as many as three Rolling Stones concerts and 
an Eagles concert. 
</P>
<P>
 The year is more than half over and there have been few problems so far, city 
officials and residents say. But the Stones and Eagles concerts are yet to 
come, and residents remember unpleasant times from similar events. 
</P>
<P>
 David Withers, a neighborhood association member who lives on Linda Vista 
Avenue, just south of the stadium, got an eyeful the day of the Guns 'n' 
Roses/Metallica concert in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the concert they were arresting people," Withers said. "They had them 
face down and handcuffed in front of my house." 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Fortlage, who lives on Richland Place just east of the stadium, said 
Pink Floyd fans urinated on the bank below his home during a concert in April. 
Residents also remember terrible traffic jams from one of the Pink Floyd 
concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Currier, who lives on the hillside west of the stadium, endures a different 
kind of problem with concerts. Rose Bowl lights are left on into the early 
morning as workers alter or tear down stages after the events. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can read a newspaper in my bed at any hour of the night," Currier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say the World Cup soccer tournament so far has been one of the most 
hassle-free of Rose Bowl events. 
</P>
<P>
 A small army of Pasadena police, California Highway Patrol officers, sheriff's 
deputies and security officers have kept traffic to a minimum in the 
neighborhoods. Extensive use of shuttles has also helped. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the soccer games have ended before nightfall, when noise and 
stadium lights become the most bothersome. Some neighbors of the bowl have even 
been able to cash in on the Cup, renting parking space in their driveways and 
selling cold sodas out of ice-filled garbage cans. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, residents must carefully plot out their personal times of 
departure and routes on game days to avoid being ensnared by traffic. And 
noise, even in the day, can annoy. 
</P>
<P>
 The blustery debate over use of the Rose Bowl kicked up relatively recently in 
the life of the stadium, which opened in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, the only major events held annually were the Rose Bowl game 
and a Fourth of July fireworks show. The "Turkey Tussle," a football showdown 
between intra-city rivals Muir and Pasadena high schools, is also an annual 
fixture, but it is not counted as a major event because attendance is only 
about 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Cycling events were held at the Rose Bowl during the 1932 Olympics, and the 
stadium hosted soccer games during the 1984 Olympics. Super Bowls, including 
the 1993 game, have been played in the stadium as well. 
</P>
<P>
 More bothersome was the invasion of rock bands in the 1970s. Residents of 
nearby Arroyo Seco began complaining after groups such as Crosby, Stills & Nash 
and Journey fired up their amplifiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the most unpleasant was the invasion of the neighborhoods by people 
who were attendees of the concerts," said John Crowley, a former councilman and 
member of the Linda Vista/Annandale Assn. "People left trash, and urinated and 
defecated on private property, causing a serious disruption on both sides of 
the Arroyo." 
</P>
<P>
 Committees formed in response to the early concerts. And, in 1988, the City 
Council passed the "Arroyo Seco" ordinance, setting an annual limit of 12 major 
events a year. The ordinance defines a major event as one attracting at least 
20,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents were happy. They still had to put up with bothersome rock 
concerts, but figured a few times a year was no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, for example, there were two rock concerts out of 10 major events at 
the Rose Bowl, a bowl official said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cap led to a new set of concerns, this time about the stadium's bottom 
line. Especially after a consulting firm, McGlandrey & Pullen, reviewed stadium 
operations and found that from fiscal 1986 through 1991, the Rose Bowl lost 
money every year but one. The largest loss was in fiscal 1990, when the Rose 
Bowl had 10 events and recorded a $570,413 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 City financial reports indicate the Rose Bowl operated at a deficit in the 
1992 and 1993 fiscal years as well. Final financial figures were not available 
for the 1994 fiscal year, which ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 One recommendation from McGlandrey & Pullen was to increase the use of the 
stadium, a suggestion that has been embraced by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of major events reached the limit last year. And this year, the 
City Council shattered the limit like an Olympic sprinter going for a world 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 The council waived the limit on major events to enable the city to host World 
Cup. Residents grumbled but accepted the decision. After all, it was the 
world's most popular sports tournament, and it would pump millions of dollars 
into the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last December, the council approved the Pink Floyd and Rolling Stones 
concerts. Arroyo residents protested but gained some comfort by extracting a 
promise from the council that no other events would be added this year. 
</P>
<P>
 That assurance held until April, when Avalon Attractions came along and 
offered the city $250,000 to add an Eagles concert to the bulging Rose Bowl 
itinerary. Again, the council decided 4 to 2, with one abstention, to go for 
the cash and infuriate some residents. 
</P>
<P>
 At that April meeting, York circulated copies of City Council minutes showing 
the majority promised no more events would be added after the Pink Floyd and 
Stones concerts. Relations were definitely strained. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made a commitment there would be no more events, but when a proposal 
came along with money, they still overrode it," York said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen William M. Paparian and Bill Crowfoot voted to allow the concert, 
saying they are still unsure, despite the minutes, whether they voted for the 
cap last December. And anyway, the Eagles deal was too attractive to reject, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Isaac Richard, who also voted to add the Eagles concert, could not 
be reached for comment, but Thomson acknowledged the council had broken a 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would certainly be better if we would have abided by the commitment that 
was made, but there are times when opportunities come along and you have to 
look at those opportunities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Rick Cole and Mayor Kathryn Nack voted against the Eagles concert, 
while Councilman Chris Holden abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Eagles concert is a great concert, but we made the commitment," 
Cole said. "If you keep your word you have much better success in the long 
run." 
</P>
<P>
 So some area residents will be understandably skeptical as the City Council 
sorts out relevant issues in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of events should be held at the Rose Bowl? Some city officials and 
residents would like to see a professional football team make its home there, 
while others are haunted by images of hard-drinking, brawling football fans. 
Some don't mind rock concerts, while others do. And there are always motorcycle 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 What if the council permanently lifts the lid on major events at the Rose 
Bowl?  
</P>
<P>
 More events and hassles won't necessarily follow, all parties say. World Cups 
don't dribble into town every year, and the demand for large concert stadiums 
is erratic. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials are likely to be aggressive in their attempts to secure 
events. They say they also will be aggressive in protecting the neighborhoods, 
using some of the tricks learned from World Cup, such as extensive use of 
shuttles. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing we've realized this year . . . we can accommodate this large number 
of events in a year without major consequences for the neighborhoods," said 
City Manager Philip A. Hawkey, who lives on one of the streets closest to the 
stadium. "The Rose Bowl can make money and provide funds to support city 
services." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood activists indicated at a recent council meeting that they are 
willing to take strong measures to protect their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had met to discuss the possibility of the Los Angeles Raiders 
playing at the Rose Bowl while the quake-ravaged Los Angeles Coliseum underwent 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the Raiders decided to stay put in the Coliseum, which is to 
be ready for the start of the National Football League season. But first, Nina 
Chomsky, vice president of the Linda Vista/Annandale Assn., gave the council a 
piece of her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a group of us who are willing to go to court if necessary," she 
warned.

NOTEBOOK / ROB FERNAS; COACH, AREA SOCCER PLAYERS WILL GIVE PELE A RUNNING 
START 
</P>

<P>
 One day you're teaching children how to play soccer, the next you're part of 
the world's most popular sporting event. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Larry Seibel is excited. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redondo Beach resident and two youth soccer teams he coaches will have 
their 15 minutes of fame Sunday during closing ceremonies for the World Cup at 
the Rose Bowl. Seibel and his players have been chosen to run behind Pele when 
the Brazilian soccer great carries the World Cup trophy into the stadium before 
the 12:30 p.m. championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our team is about two feet away from him," Seibel said. "We're going to 
follow him out on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Area youngsters taking part in the ceremony are from American Youth Soccer 
Organization teams based in south Redondo Beach -- the Raptors, for boys 5 to 
6, and the Hot Shots, for girls 8 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Seibel, whose daughter plays on the Hot Shots, will lead the players onto the 
field at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to keep them in line," Seibel said. "(Organizers) have already told 
me, 'Don't outrun Pele.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It's reminiscent of Rafer Johnson lighting the Olympic torch (at the 1984 
opening ceremonies at the Coliseum). I'm probably more excited than the kids, 
but I won't let on." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the players participating in Sunday's closing ceremony is Mikhail 
Marinovich, son of Marv Marinovich and half-brother of former USC and Raider 
quarterback Todd Marinovich. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably the greatest 6-year-old athlete I've seen in my life," Seibel 
said. "Marv trains him like he did Todd, the same regimen, but he's a sweet, 
sweet kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Seibel said after Marinovich scored several goals in a game this season he 
moved the player to goaltender, thinking that would stop him from overwhelming 
opponents. It didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kicked it all the way down the field into the goal," Seibel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The El Segundo American Legion baseball team posted a 6-5 record during a 
two-week trip to South Dakota and Montana. The team reached the final of the 
Rapid City tournament in South Dakota, losing to the host team, 5-1, in the 
championship game. El Segundo didn't fare as well in the Miles City tournament 
in Montana, finishing 1-3, but shortstop Morgan Ensberg and catcher Jake 
Coulter were named to the all-tournament team. No all-tournament team was 
selected at Rapid City. El Segundo (15-8-1) resumed Bay-Pacific League play 
this week and meets West Torrance in an important game at 7:30 Sunday night at 
Recreation Park. Entering the week, El Segundo was 7-0-1 and West was 8-1 in 
league play. West suffered its first loss Sunday to Mira Costa, 12-5, in eight 
innings. . . . El Segundo pitcher David Reed has signed with Pepperdine and 
Redondo pitcher Scott Albin, who is playing for El Segundo's American Legion 
team, has signed with Nevada . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Scott McKinley of Sacramento became a three-time champion of the Manhattan 
Beach Grand Prix bicycle race Sunday by winning the featured Senior 1-2/Pro 
main event. McKinley, who collected the first prize of $1,000, also won the 
race in 1987 and '92. Second-place finisher John Brady of Ireland was injured 
after the race when he fell from his bike after allegedly being kicked by 
another rider, Robert Gaggiolo. Brady and Gaggiolo reportedly exchanged words 
after jostling for position late in the race. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Yvette Angel, the new girls' basketball coach at Bishop Montgomery High, is 
holding a three-on-three tournament July 23 at Bishop Montgomery for girls 10 
to 18. Competition will be in four divisions: middle school, freshman, junior 
varsity and varsity. Prizes will be awarded through third place in each

Registration is scheduled from 4 to 7 p.m. July 21 at Bishop Montgomery. 
Information: Angel at (310) 986-5782 or the school at (310) 540-2021 . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Registration has begun for a Southern California Municipal Athletic Federation 
men's C/D slow-pitch softball tournament to be played Aug. 7 in Gardena. All 
teams in SCMAF-sanctioned leagues through the parks and recreation departments 
in Southern California are eligible. Registration is $150 a team. Information: 
Deryl Lloyd at (310) 217-9542. . . .

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: ENCHANTING DINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are people for whom dining out means the food. As long as the lobster 
ravioli is sublime, it wouldn't bother them if the dining room were in an 
abandoned tenement in the South Bronx. Others care only about the surroundings. 
The chicken may be underdone and the foie gras may be chopped liver, but if the 
room is luxurious and the service attentive, all is swell. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there are places notable for both atmosphere and food. Such as 
Meridian 1050, located at Ports O' Call in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly Nizetich's, the restaurant is now owned by Andrew Marincovich and 
Robert Rados. The elegant black-and-white room, with fresh flowers splashed on 
every table, features an alluring view of the San Pedro harbor. Romantic travel 
fantasies rise unbidden in the mind, setting the stage for the cuisine of chef 
Brian Finn, whose resume includes a two-year stint at the renowned Waldorf 
Astoria in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Appetizers include oysters Rockefeller ($7.25): oysters topped with a spinach, 
butter and breadcrumb mixture, baked on the half shell and -- in this version 
-- topped with Mornay sauce. Fried artichoke hearts ($6.95) are served with 
tomato sauce, ricotta and provolone cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the menu highlights is the crab ravioli ($10.50), pasta pillows stuffed 
with crab and topped with a fresh tarragon butter sauce. Sand dabs are 
pan-fried and topped with lemon butter ($13.95). 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of fish you could order a mixed grill ($21.95) consisting of a chicken 
breast, a small filet mignon served with a Bordelaise sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 At lunch there is an interesting pork salad ($8.95), featuring tender slices 
of cinnamon-marinated pork served over mixed baby greens with strips of papaya, 
avocado, and green and yellow bell peppers. A calamari steak sandwich ($6.95) 
comes on a bun with a lemon-caper-butter sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Meridian 1050 is at 1050 Nagoya Way, San Pedro. (310) 514-3978. Open 11:30 
a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 to 10 p.m. Monday through Friday; 5 to 10:30 p.m. Saturday 
, and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. (brunch) and 5 to 10 p.m. Sunday.

MEMORIAL: PASADENA'S DAY OF THE AFRICAN CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Katie Nack proclaimed June 16, "The Day of the African Child" in 
Pasadena.The pronouncement says Pasadena will be "remembering the children of 
Soweto, South Africa, who were massacred in 1976 while speaking out against the 
injustice of apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
 Shockingly, nowhere to be found in the proclamation is any mention of the 
African children slaughtered in Rwanda, starved in Ethiopia and Sudan or 
massacred in Somalia and Uganda during recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought the moral bankruptcy of such politically selective compassion had 
been left behind with our previous mayor, Rick Cole. But apparently I am wrong.

TRASH: WALNUT'S OPPOSITION TO RECOVERY FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walnut residents are opposed to the Material Recovery Facility (MRF) being 
proposed by the City of Industry at the corner of Grand (Avenue) and Valley 
(Boulevard). 
</P>
<P>
 Walnut is surrounded on the west by the BKK Landfill and on the east by the 
Spadra Landfill.We believe a "fair share" approach should be made to siting 
trash facilities. Industry's draft environmental impact report says Industry 
needs capacity to handle 600 tons of trash per day, but the MRF would handle 
5,700 tons per day, generate up to 3,444 vehicles per day and add 500 tons of 
pollutants into the air each day. The draft environmental impact report says 
the MRF would have 35 "significant" and "unavoidable" environmental impacts 
that "cannot be mitigated." 
</P>
<P>
 Walnut is opposed to such a massive regional facility next to homes. Walnut 
has asked Industry to reduce the size and relocate its MRF to an industrial 
area away from homes. To date, Industry has not responded to Walnut in any 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Walnut City Council established a citizens task force to lead the 
community's opposition to this MRF, and the city has budgeted $334,000 at this 
time, including more than $200,000 for special legal counsel, to oppose the MRF 
as it is currently planned. Walnut will continue to vigorously and vehemently 
oppose this project by all legal means in order to protect the health and 
safety of our residents.

EDUCATION: GIVING LESSONS ABOUT LIFE TO KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with interest your article "Life Lessons" (April 7) concerning student 
community service programs in schools. As both an elected official and an 
educator, I believe such programs are of critical importance to both the 
students and their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years I have been concerned that nearly one half of my students (11- 
and 12-year-olds) cannot name the city in which they reside. Our modern 
suburban cities have lost what we used to call "a sense of community." Kids who 
used to seek a sense of security from their neighborhoods and communities are 
turning to street gangs to provide that same feeling of security. 
</P>
<P>
 Our kids need to know, at a very early age, that their ideas count and that 
their efforts are important. Youth service gives them experiences that provide 
immediate positive feedback for their efforts. It helps eradicate the seeds of 
"me-ism" that so pervades society today. To put in a more graphic way, I'd 
rather have candy stripers than car strippers. I'd rather see peer tutors than 
drug touters. I'd rather have kids do toy wrapping than gangsta rapping. Having 
kids helping out is better than their hanging out any day!

GAMBLING: POMONA COUNCIL'S VOTE ON POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I stand with those of Pomona and the local communities in opposing the Pomona 
City Council votes in favor of the changes of law that will allow card clubs 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 I support all the reasons the church leaders have given along with the 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 I would add my voice in the context of Matthew 5.25 when Jesus speaks of the 
"least of our brothers and sisters." The targeting of vulnerable people is not 
what Pomona needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people point out churches have bingo. It is as if this argument should 
shut us up. Groups that have bingo are primarily nonprofit groups and churches. 
I support those who will sign the referendum keeping the ordinances as they 
have been. 
</P>
<P>
 The least we can do as a community is slow the process down so the citizens of 
Pomona can vote. I call on the community to work to bring respectable jobs to 
the people of Pomona and business that will bring in money needed for this 
wonderful community of peoples.

THEATER REVIEW; 'PETER PAN' WORKS BETTER THAN FAIRY DUST FOR ENCHANTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps the best measure of a good production of "Peter Pan" is the 
open-mouthed, bedazzled children sitting in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 By that gauge, the show at the San Gabriel Civic Auditorium is a hit. 
Concluding the 10th season of the Music Theatre of Southern California 
(formerly known as San Gabriel Civic Light Opera), "Peter Pan" blew away a 
large house of children and their parents. Even at nearly three hours, 
including two intermissions (one more than necessary), tykes in the audience 
remained wide-eyed and, even more amazing, stone-silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, when Peter Pan (Susie Starr) wrapped up the show by flying high and 
fast over their heads, the crowd let out a whoop that must have gratified the 
immortal pixie, not to mention sidekick Tinker Bell. The two unaging stage 
personalities turn 90 years old this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on an episode in James M. Barrie's 1902 novel "The Little White Bird," 
"Peter Pan" opened on the London stage in 1904 and on Broadway in 1905. Since 
then "the boy who wouldn't grow up" has been played by such actresses as Elsa 
Lancaster, Maggie Smith, Marilyn Miller, Jean Arthur, Mary Martin, Sandy Duncan 
and most recently Cathy Rigby. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Gabriel, Susie Starr captures that childlike fairy dust an actress must 
suggest to personify a young, ageless boy who flies a Victorian family's three 
children to Never-Never-Land, where they encounter the bombastic Captain Hook 
and his obsequious pirates, not to mention Indians and a gaggle of Lost Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most amazing about Starr's performance is that she's a grandmother and 
first appeared as Peter Pan in the San Gabriel Civic's premiere season 10 years 
ago. Starr has cut her dark brown hair to a boyish trim, and her high voice, 
sterling vocal qualities and graceful body language perfectly express the 
apparition of dream wings. 
</P>
<P>
 But other elements keep the fantasy aloft: Crucial is Jamie Torcellini, who 
performs both Captain Hook's smarmy flunky pirate called Smee and the Victorian 
Darling family's big woolly house dog, Nana. In a dog suit, flopping around the 
children's fairy tale of a bedroom, Torcellini is hilarious, as much a 
character as the human-animated Snoopy in the stage show "Peanuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Featuring more than 40 cast members and 20 black tie-clad musicians in the 
sprawling orchestra pit, the production also sails under the dual role-playing 
of Michael G. Hawkins, who segues from a dapper Victorian father to the 
comically elitist Captain Hook. Hawkins' approach follows recent 
interpretations that view the unloved captain as psychologically maimed and 
deserving of some pity. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldilocked, blue-ribboned Heather Viau as the daughter Wendy who flies to 
Never-Never-Land and Kris Kennedy as her mother running around that big 
Victorian house also fuel the production, smoothly directed by Bill Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially fun are the buoyant flying numbers (with the silvery suspension 
cables noticeable but hardly intrusive), Peter Wolf's expansive original 
Broadway scenery and the animal actors, including Cynthia McIntosh's ostrich 
and Chris Straiter's crocodile. 
</P>
<P>

SPORTS; KICKER BARSUHN KEEPS FOOTBALL GOALS IN SIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dana Barsuhn cannot be blamed for wanting to have a few kicks before he takes 
off for Seattle to attend the University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Barsuhn, a recent graduate of South Pasadena High, has been one of the top 
kickers in the San Gabriel Valley the past two seasons. In the fall, he will 
attempt to join the Washington football program as a walk-on. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday night, he will be out to have some fun -- and split the up-rights -- 
when he participates in the 15th annual National Football Foundation Hall of 
Fame all-star game at Citrus College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking at this as another opportunity to play and show the (Washington) 
coaches what I'm capable of," Barsuhn said. "It's a good way to get ready for 
the tryout I'm going to be going through when I get up there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hall of Fame game, which serves as a fund-raiser for the Pasadena/San 
Gabriel Valley chapter of the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame, 
has served as a springboard to scholarships and college opportunities for many 
players, said Jim Brownfield, the chairman of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year, two or three kids pick up scholarships from this game," 
Brownfield said. "College coaches who have players that are hurt, or players 
that are not coming back for some reason, will call us and say, 'We're looking 
for a wide receiver,' or another position. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come out to the game, and if a kid plays well, boom, he's on his way." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hall of Fame game began in 1980 to provide players from high schools 
located West of the 605 Freeway with a chance to display their talents. Two 
years later, after the Citrus All-Star Game folded, schools East of the 605 to 
Chino were added. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, 80 players from an area that includes 80 high schools will compete 
on the East and West teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Mount of West Covina will coach the East, which has a 9-3-2 advantage in 
the series. Don MacKinnon of Arroyo will coach the West, which broke a 
four-game losing streak last year with a 27-14 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Multitalented West Covina quarterback Miguel Meriwether, who will attend 
Washington State in the fall, leads an East team that includes Washington-bound 
running back Jason Harris of Bishop Amat and Nebraska-bound linebacker Sheldon 
Jackson of Damien. 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo quarterback Gabe Agredano leads a West team that also features 
Oregon-bound receiver/defensive back Damon Griffin of Monrovia and 
Wyoming-bound linebacker Albert Camou of Marshall Fundamental. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Hall of Fame game, and most other summer football all-star games, is 
really designed to showcase the talents of less-heralded players who will 
attempt to walk-on at Division I schools, attend small colleges or community 
colleges or conclude their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Barsuhn, for one, intends to take advantage of the opportunity as a member of 
the West squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since I was a kid, it's been a dream to play Division I," Barsuhn said. 
"My mom used to go jogging at Glendale High and I would go with her and fetch 
balls for a guy who was practicing kicking field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "After awhile, he let me kick a few. I kept getting better at it and really 
began to like it." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-10, 170-pound Barsuhn began emerging as a outstanding kicker during 
his sophomore season when he was summoned to the South Pasadena varsity after 
league play began. He made all three of his field-goal attempts, including two 
in a playoff game against La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, Barsuhn converted six of 10 field-goal attempts. Last season, he 
was seven of 10, including one of 47 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Barsuhn was approached by several small colleges such as Azusa Pacific and 
Redlands and considered walking on at Oregon, Colorado and USC before deciding 
on Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always liked the school and their kicker just graduated," said Barsuhn, 
who also played soccer and baseball at South Pasadena. "The (Washington) 
coaches told me there are going to be about four or five kickers trying out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not worried. I expect to do well." 
</P>
<P>
 Barsuhn kicked a 39-yard field goal last week in the Fiesta Bowl all-star 
game. He's hoping to do at least as well Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a nice way to finish and get ready for the next level," he said. "You 
always want to finish something on a high note."

 HAPPY ENDING: A group of junior lifeguards visiting here from New Zealand, the 
victims of thieves last weekend, found themselves among friends after all. 
After learning about the theft of the teen-agers' airline tickets, Sharon 
Pettit of Cypress, the wife of a United Airlines exec, got him to replace all 
the tickets -- free. Passports will be replaced by the New Zealand Embassy -- 
free. . . . "What started as a sad story turned out to really impress our 
guests," says Kara Johan of Orange, from one of the host families. 
</P>
<P>
 TRAVELING REX: One thing Americans and Russians have in common is a 
fascination with dinosaurs. Nearly 10,000 visitors a day have been wandering 
among the 17 robotic, life-size prehistoric replicas in Moscow's Sokolniki 
Park. The animated dinosaurs were created by Dinamation of Irvine, which is 
hitting 100 cities worldwide with such exhibits this year. . . . The Russian 
exhibit runs until Sept. 10. Says Dinamation founder Chris Mays: "We're proud 
to . . . bring smiles to the Russian people." 
</P>
<P>
 CHRISTY'S MAN: This month's Esquire magazine cover shows Christie Brinkley 
topless, but appropriately covered by a copy of Henry Kissinger's latest book, 
"Diplomacy." But is it autographed? . . . You can get the former secretary of 
state to sign one for you next Wednesday. He's kicking off the Distinguished 
Authors series at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace -- and signing some 
books. But library policy: He won't sign unless you buy it there. 
</P>
<P>
 THE ELVIS MARKET: One famous Nixon picture prominently displayed at the 
presidential library shows him posing in the Oval Office with an unusual 
visitor, Elvis Presley. An original of that picture, plus three small gifts the 
President gave Elvis, go on the auction block in Los Angeles on Monday. 
Fine-art auctioneers Butterfield & Butterfield estimate the picture's value at 
a minimum of $6,000. Priciest item: The federal drug agent's badge Nixon gave 
Elvis, valued at a minimum of $10,000.

 Uzbekistan on Wednesday signed a Partnership for Peace accord with the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization, the 22nd country to opt for a military and 
political cooperation agreement with the Western alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement enables the Central Asian nation to develop closer relations 
that may include exchanges of military information and pooling of forces in 
joint exercises or humanitarian operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, presented at a NATO summit in Brussels in January, opens the door

DRIVER IS KILLED BY MOB OF YOUTHS AFTER HITTING GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who got out of his car to check on an 11-year-old girl he had just hit 
was beaten by a mob of teen-agers, robbed and shot to death, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria Williams, who was bruised but not seriously hurt, had darted into the 
path of Charles Bell's car Tuesday evening as she ran to watch a fight brewing 
across the street, the witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police initially suspected that the mob was motivated by revenge, but later 
said the youths were after money, taking advantage of an easy target. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests had been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell, 44, who lived and worked in the area, had been in a grocery store on an 
errand for his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just unbelievable," Bell's mother, Eva Mae Knight, told WTVJ-TV. "When 
he left for the store he said, 'Momma, I'll be right back,' and the next news I 
hear is that my son had been shot." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who was treated at a hospital and released, recalled looking up to 
see Bell and hearing him ask if she was OK. Then she heard gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "That could have really been my dad or my uncle or anybody in my family," the 
girl's mother, Felicia Williams, told the TV station. "I mean, if my brother 
gets out after hitting a kid I wouldn't want anybody to hurt him that way." 
</P>
<P>
 "You could hear his brakes," a witness, Brenda Jones, told the Miami Herald. 
"He tried his best not to hit the child." 
</P>
<P>
 Another witness, Lisa Blatiman, told the paper: "That child got right up. They 
shouldn't have beat the man. It wasn't his fault. They say the man was trying 
to explain what happened. They didn't even want to listen to the man." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell worked at a funeral home, where co-workers described him as loving and 
humorous. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came to us when he was in 12th grade, and he's been here ever since," said 
the Rev. Al Mozell, staff chaplain. "They are still crying around here, that is 
how much we loved him."

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clippers still don't have a coach, but what's the rush? They waited until 
July 21 last year to make their sterling choice of Bob Weiss. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I'm surprised that Shawn Bradley chose a shorter man, such as Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar, to tutor him. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pity those poor NBA players if the league is allowed to keep a salary cap and 
the college draft, and the average salary stays down around $1.38 million. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 The most entertaining All-Star game in years is exhibit A of why I will miss 
baseball, 1994 style, when the players strike. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Note ripped up after Fred McGriff hit his score-tying home run with one out in 
the ninth inning: "Seven consecutive All-Star game wins and four World Series 
championships in the last five years stamp the American as the dominant 
league." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to remember a manager or coach receiving a warmer ovation than the 
one given Jim Leyland at Three Rivers Stadium on Tuesday. . . . It wasn't 
surprising that the son of a former All-Star player got the game-winning hit, 
but most people thought it would be Ken Griffey Jr. or Barry Bonds, not Moises 
Alou. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Chili Davis deserves a contract extension, but it will be an upset if the 
Angels give him one. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A nice touch was Chuck Knoblauch wearing a "Hi Mom. Get Well, Dad" message on 
his batting glove during the AL introductions. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 When Wade Boggs gets called out on strikes twice, the home plate umpire must 
be wrong at least once.And, according to the video replay, Paul Runge was. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 The first athlete featured in a commercial during the All-Star telecast was a 
hockey player, Wayne Gretzky. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bob Costas, Joe Morgan and Bob Uecker of NBC showed that three men in a 
broadcasting booth aren't necessarily one too many. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Morgan was on the mark when he said Rod Carew would have hit .400 against this 
year's pitching. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the game should start an hour earlier. It didn't end until close to 
midnight EDT. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The average home run by Griffey this season travels 409 feet. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 As part of the NFL's 75th anniversary celebration, the Rams will wear replicas 
of their 1951 uniforms at home against San Francisco on Sept. 18 and at Kansas 
City on Sept. 25. Maybe some of the magic of the only L.A. Ram team ever to win 
an NFL championship will rub off. . . . The Raiders will wear replicas of their 
1963 uniforms, which aren't much different from the present ones, at Denver on 
Sept. 18 and at home against San Diego on Sept. 25. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Oldest style will be those of the 1920 Chicago Cardinals, worn by the Arizona 
Cardinals. Newest will be those of the 1977 Tampa Bay Buccaneers. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A group wanting to buy the Rams and keep them in Orange County is talking 
about building a new stadium, but I don't see what is so unsuitable about 
Anaheim Stadium for football. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Where They Are Now? Paul Caligiuri will appear at SoccerFest at the L.A. 
Convention Center 2-4 p.m. today, and Alexi Lalas 8:15-9 p.m. on Saturday. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Veteran sprinter Jeff Williams of Los Angeles scored the biggest victory of 
his career Tuesday when he upset 200-meter world champion Frank Fredericks at 
Stockholm. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if the Idaho Sneakers of World TeamTennis have a shoe contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen of the 17 teams in the expanded International Hockey League will make 
the playoffs next season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks gave up next to nothing, a fourth-round draft choice, to 
obtain defenseman Richard Dirk, who is big -- 6 feet 4 and 2l0 pounds -- and 
aggressive. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 HBO has broken off negotiations for an Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez-Michael 
Carbajal light-flyweight title rubber match. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Greg Louganis will teach a dance movement class in the USC theater department 
next semester. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The most promising 2-year-old colt in the East is DeNiro, named for actor 
Robert DeNiro. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Corey Nakatani will attempt a freeway double Friday night, riding at Hollywood 
Park early in the evening and then in the featured, 11th race at Los Alamitos. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Former UCLA center Richard Petruska is playing for the Knicks' summer league 
team in New York. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If USC defeats New Mexico State in the first round of the NIT preseason 
tournament, it will play the winner of the Kansas State-Alabama game. Kansas 
State will be coached by Tom Asbury, formerly of Pepperdine. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The person perhaps least in need of a nickname was pro wrestler Brutus (the 
Barber) Beefcake. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I'm glad Jimmie Reese was in a baseball uniform the last time I saw him. No 
92-year-old ever looked better dressed.

GOLF NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK; OCSA NEARS DEAL TO BRING SENIOR PGA TOUR TO ORANGE 
COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Andersen believes it has been too long since Orange County last played 
host to a PGA Tour event, and this week he hopes to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen, executive director of the Orange County Sports Assn., says his 
organization is nearing a deal to bring a Senior PGA Tour event to the county 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a spectacular event in the county," Andersen said. "There is such 
a big interest in golf in the county and there has been such a lack of 
tournament golf in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 The last men's PGA Tour event in Orange County, the 1968 Haig Open, was at 
Mesa Verde Country Club in Costa Mesa, and Mesa Verde would be the most likely 
site for a 1995 Senior tournament. Coto de Caza Golf Club also has expressed 
interest, but Andersen said Mesa Verde is the top choice. 
</P>
<P>
 First, however, Andersen must secure a title sponsor for the tournament. 
Friday morning, Andersen and an OCSA group will meet with officials from 
National at the rental car company's office in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCSA, which would manage the tournament, has received a recommendation 
from Senior PGA Tour officials, one of whom twice recently played the Mesa 
Verde course with Andersen. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Crosby, another Senior Tour official, said Tuesday that Orange County is 
considered the favorite, although there are bids from other groups, including 
one in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've kind of had our eye on Orange County, which we view as a distinct 
market from Los Angeles, for a while," Crosby said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County tournament would fill an open week on the Senior Tour 
schedule in the third week of March. It was formerly filled by a tournament in 
Indian Wells, which folded after 1993 because it had no title sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen said he is shooting for a purse of about $1 million, which would put 
the tournament among the highest paying on the tour.  
</P>
<P>
 Mesa Verde played host to six LPGA tour events from 1979 to 1986 and to five 
PGA events from 1959 to 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Schilling, Mesa Verde's head professional, said he has heard that Senior 
players who played Mesa Verde in the '60s would like to come back. 
</P>
<P>
 One who likely would: Bob Dickson, who won the Haig as a rookie in 1968. In 
1994, he's a rookie on the Senior Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen Orange County residents are among the 92-player field for the 95th 
Southern California Golf Assn. amateur championship next week at Hacienda Golf 
Club in La Habra Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament starts at 7 a.m. Friday, with two rounds. After a cut to the 
top 42 and ties, single rounds will be played Saturday and Sunday starting at 
7:30 a.m. Spectators are welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament will offer a rare chance to see Cypress' Tiger Woods compete 
locally. Woods, who graduated from Western High in June and will attend 
Stanford on scholarship, reached the semifinals of the California Amateur 
Championship in June at Pebble Beach, losing to Ed Cuff Jr. of Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuff is also entered in the SCGA amateur, along with Upland's Steve Woods, who 
beat Cuff for the California Amateur title. 
</P>
<P>
 Other local entrants are: Chris Berry (Yorba Linda), Bruce Campbell 
(Placentia), Jeff Goettsche (Anaheim), Terry Heath (Lake Forest), Jeffrey Holt 
(Huntington Beach), Jon Levin (Huntington Beach), Iain MacDonald (Fullerton), 
John McDonald (San Clemente), Brian Rea (Huntington Beach), Kemp Richardson 
(Laguna Niguel), Richard Sims (Placentia), Cary Spadoni (Irvine), Richard Talt 
(Laguna Beach), James Wooley (Placentia).

TENNIS / DANA HADDAD; MALIN CAN TELL PUPILS 'DO AS I DO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tennis coach Gene Malin should change the format of his lessons this week. He 
should abandon the hands-on instruction and simply have his students observe. 
</P>
<P>
 They should be courtside at the Westlake Tennis & Swim Club to watch Malin 
defend his 1993 titles in the U.S. Tennis Assn. National Men's 45 Hard Court 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasions are rare when Malin competes, but when he does he usually gives 
a clinic on how to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Malin, seeded No. 5, defeated No. 9 Cliff Price of Tulsa, Okla., 
7-6, 4-6, 6-3, in the singles final. 
</P>
<P>
 Malin, of Woodland Hills, also captured the doubles championship when he and 
Eric Baer of Thousand Oaks defeated Dick Johnson and Gerry Perry from Missouri, 
6-2, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss competition like crazy," Malin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some might think he is wasting his talent by coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 As a former touring pro who beat John Newcombe and Dick Stockton -- and lost 
to Ilie Nastase and Stan Smith in close matches -- Malin would figure to be one 
of the nation's best 45-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, his serve was clocked at 128 miles per hour. He was once ranked No. 
76 in the world and he had success in doubles when he teamed with John Lloyd 
and Vince Van Patten. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this level, there's nobody who's going to blow me off the court," Malin 
said of his amateur competition. "I can drill for a week and I'm in shape." 
</P>
<P>
 But he doesn't play often because coaching pays the bills. Senior age-group 
tournaments do not. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Malin is a traveling tutor who teaches so that others might 
someday find a pot of gold on tour. 
</P>
<P>
 His students include Rita Maria Pichardo, the No. 1 women's player from Cuba 
who defected last October, and Prakash Amritraj, son of Vijay Amritraj -- a 
prominent player on the world scene in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 One would expect Amritraj to coach his son, but, evidentially, he has found a 
better man. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vijay liked my philosophy and he liked my drills," Malin said. "He thinks I'm 
one of the best coaches around." 
</P>
<P>
 And Malin is still one of the best players in his age group. He's seeded No. 2 
in the 64-player draw at the national tournament, despite being the defending 
champion. He lost only one set in five matches last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Cheney of Chandler, Ariz. earned the No. 1 seeding because he is, at No. 
2, the highest nationally ranked player in the tournament. No. 1-ranked Robin 
Ray of Newport Beach didn't enter. Malin is not ranked by the USTA because he 
doesn't play enough. 
</P>
<P>
 But Malin is picking up where he left off. He defeated Chuck White of Moss 
Beach, 6-1, 6-2, in the opening round and beat Michael Walters of Anaheim, 6-3, 
6-4, in Wednesday's second round. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Large local contingent: One-fourth the draw at the national 45s event are 
players from this area. Of the 16 who entered, eight advanced past the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Malin, Ray Kwong (Canoga Park), Tom Wire (Westlake Village), Art 
Santilli (Camarillo), Craig Fugle (Ojai), Jim Robinson (Simi Valley), Peter 
Austin (Studio City) and Barry Savin (Camarillo) were winners. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zone team advances: The Southern California team led by Coach Wayne Bryan and 
twin sons Mike and Bob Bryan of Camarillo on Wednesday advanced to the 
semifinals of the USTA Boys' and Girls' 16 Intersectional Team Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Bryan defeated Ken Hutz, 6-1, 6-4, and Bob Bryan defeated Mike Guillford, 
6-0, 6-1, in Southern California's 6-3 victory over Middle States at Piedmont 
Oaks Tennis Club in Shreveport, La. 
</P>
<P>
 In doubles, Bob Bryan and Kevin Kim beat Hutz and Ted Reuger, 6-1, 6-2. In 
mixed doubles, Guillford and Holly Parkinson beat Mike Bryan and Faye DeVera, 
3-6, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California finished 3-0 in pool play with earlier victories against 
Pacific Northwest (7-2) and Hawaii (9-0). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opportunity knocks: The Conejo Recreation and Park District is accepting 
resumes for a tennis pro position at Triunfo Park in Westlake Village. The 
district hires tennis pros as independent contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants, who must have previous teaching experience and membership in the 
U.S. Professional Tennis Assn. or the U.S. Professional Tennis Registry, are 
encouraged to submit proposals by July 31.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; DELAHOUSSAYE PLANS TO RETURN THIS MEETING

 Eddie Delahoussaye, who underwent surgery Monday, hopes to be riding again by 
the final weekend of the Hollywood Park meeting, which ends July 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Plagued by sinusitis for several months, Delahoussaye underwent a sinusotomy, 
a cleaning of the nasal passages, and a septoplasty, which corrected a deviated 
septum. Glenn Weissmann performed the procedures in his San Gabriel clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything went well," said Delahoussaye's wife, Juanita. "They also found 
(and removed) a cyst in his left sinus cavity that they didn't know existed." 
</P>
<P>
 Delahoussaye rode three winners last weekend.

 Jockey Randy Romero, 36, who has battled injuries for much of his career, has 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
 A winner of 3,823 races and the regular rider of champions Personal Ensign and 
Go For Wand, Romero has been recuperating from knuckle and knee injuries 
suffered earlier this year at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, Romero was burned over 65% of his body in a jockeys' room accident at 
Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Ark., and missed about four months of riding. 
</P>
<P>
 He suffered a broken collarbone and several broken ribs when Go For Wand broke 
down while battling Bayakoa in the 1990 Breeders' Cup Distaff at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Best Pal, who hasn't raced since finishing seventh in the San Antonio Handicap 
on Feb. 13, worked a mile in 1:37 3/5 Wednesday morning preparing for his 
comeback in the San Diego Handicap on July 30 at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's doing real well," said new trainer Richard Mandella. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal's former trainer, Gary Jones, parted company with John Mabee's Golden 
Eagle Farm earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bertrando, who hasn't raced since finishing second in the Breeders' Cup 
Classic last Nov. 6, may also return in the San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The scopolamine hearings for seven trainers, six of whom work with 
thoroughbreds, have been continued once again. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Calabria, an attorney who represents four of the trainers -- Ron McAnally, 
Mandella, Mark Hennig and Willard Proctor -- requested the latest continuance, 
asking for more time to study lab results. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearings will now begin July 31 and continue through Aug. 8 before the Del 
Mar board of stewards. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainers Bill Shoemaker and Lewis Cenicola and harness trainer Jim Grundy also 
had horses that tested positive earlier this year for the prohibited drug. The 
trainers contend their horses tested positive after eating hay or straw which 
had been contaminated.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cool Air, who beat males in her last start, will try to knock off the boys 
again in Friday night's $155,600 Hollywood Park Budweiser Breeders' Cup at 5 
1/2 furlongs on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 A winner of five of six since coming to trainer Gary Jones late last year, 
Cool Air is unbeaten in two tries at the distance at Hollywood Park and both of 
them were under the lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Antley will ride the 4-year-old Air Forbes Won filly, who has 11 
victories in 25 races. She will carry top weight of 120 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 From the rail out, the rest of the field includes Moscow Changes, El 
Trenzador, Bahatur, Bon Point, Chicmond, The Berkeley Man, Foreign Merger, 
D'Hallevant and Porto Varas. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, the field has nine victories in 23 starts on the Hollywood Park 
turf.

POPBEAT: INTRODUCING: THE MIGHTY POWER ARRANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's instrumental prowess aplenty on display in recent releases by Dick 
Dale and Dan Crary, who may be the best guitar players ever associated with the 
Orange County pop scene. Also reviewed is the rough but ready country-rock 
debut by the band Diamondback. Ratings range from * (poor) to **** (excellent). 
Three stars denote a solid recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 ** 1/2 , Dick Dale, "Unknown Territory", HighTone The past year was a glorious 
one for Dick Dale. The surf-guitar patriarch finally went nationwide with the 
rambunctious "Tribal Thunder," his first album of new material in almost 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 At last he hit the road for extensive touring -- something he had neglected to 
pursue when surf-rock was at its early-'60s peak. Far-flung audiences were 
treated to the Stratocaster barrages that had been knocking Dale's Southern 
California fans silly for years. 
</P>
<P>
 With upbeat reviews and eager fan response, he became rock 'n' roll's comeback 
player of the year for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For an encore, Dale returns with the same studio crew that backed him on 
"Tribal Thunder." Producer Scott Mathews and Tubes alumnus Prairie Prince renew 
that album's well-coordinated double-drum barrage, and Dale's longtime sideman, 
Ron Eglit, is on bass. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Dale, another turn of the calendar hasn't slowed the pick-melting 
frenzy of his attack or chipped away at an enthusiasm for rocking that few 
musicians of any age can match. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he has re-established himself, Dale's challenge is to find inventive, 
fresh-sounding backdrops for a style that is founded on very simple elements. 
He plays primarily instrumental rock built on basic riffs and chord 
progressions, coloring them with blazing-fast picking and a distinctive array 
of signature skids, screeches and splashing reverb effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of "Unknown Territory" succeed in deploying those familiar elements in 
new, surprising surroundings. At times, though, for all the hot playing Dale 
and his band muster, it sounds as if they are tracing territory already 
well-charted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scalped," "Terra Dicktyl" and "The Beast" are all racing, pummeling 
variations on Dale's beefed-up modern take on old-line surf-rock. The visceral 
impact and over-the-top energy of these aural car chases make Dale, at 57, as 
effective a purveyor of adrenalin-rock as any of the young headbanger bands on 
the circuit. Still, there's not much to differentiate one of these sizzling 
tracks from the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale and company know that sameness is a pitfall of instrumental rock, and 
they take pains to mix things up. Three songs offer South-of-the-border hues, 
but they don't lead to anything memorable -- except for the drip-drop textures 
of the percussion track on the sentimental ballad "Maria Elena." The liquid 
drum sounds wryly echo the puddle-splattering sonics of Dale's reverb guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 On the song "Unknown Territory," Dale strives for epic scale and high-plains 
drama but winds up with the album's weakest cut. Like Coronado's search for El 
Dorado, the lost city of gold, this nearly eight-minute excursion is a long, 
meandering trek through arid regions, without any payoff at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 The album's prime stuff is defined less by speed than by its sexy swagger. "F 
Groove" offers slow, heavy rock that is truly low-down and mean. The beat 
pounds hard, yet is slippery and sly. Guest harmonica player Huey Lewis 
challenges Dale with raunchy, distorted blues licks, and the guitarist comes 
through with zooming runs that strain to escape the confines of the song's 
deliberate tempo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take It or Leave It," with its Booker T & the MG's-style R&B groove, 
double-tracked guitar dueling, and (slightly overlong) percussion break, is 
another song that places Dale against a more scenic musical backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale's take on "Hava Nagila" is the album's best surprise. The hokey old bar 
mitzvah tune is reinvigorated and transformed into an erotic, high-speed belly 
dance. Acoustic guitar flashes, clicking castanets and rattling tambourines 
contribute to the most ambitious rhythmic construct on the record. Dale takes 
full advantage, mixing his strokes between dervish-like treble runs and 
hurtling low-note passages. 
</P>
<P>
 Instrumental rock is Dale's forte, but he sings effectively on two sallies 
into vocal music. He goes for humor on "California Sun" with manic yowling, 
then bows to Johnny Cash's example and handles "Ring of Fire" with understated 
authority. This nugget provides a fine basis for a kinetic mating of surf-rock 
with hillbilly twanging and leaves one eager for Dale's take on "Mystery 
Train." 
</P>
<P>
 Raw power may be the essence of Dale's style, but the mixed results on 
"Unknown Territory" point to how important it is to channel that power 
imaginatively. 
</P>
<P>
 *** Dan Crary, "Jammed If I Do", Sugar Hill For a quarterback, it's fourth and 
goal and no time left on the clock. For a stage actor, it's playing King Lear. 
For a folk guitarist, the ultimate challenge may be going one-on-one in a duet 
with Doc Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Crary accepts that challenge on the seventh solo album of his career, with 
results that are musically rewarding, but also instructive about the approach 
that has won the Fullerton-based Crary plaudits as a leading player in the 
world of traditional folk and bluegrass music. 
</P>
<P>
 He teams with Watson, the definitive acoustic player from North Carolina, on 
"Whistlin' Rufus," a jaunty, fast-flowing song on an all-instrumental album 
weighted toward light moods and lightning musicianship. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson's playing is fleet but unhurried, each note given space, definition and 
a firm voicing, no matter how fast it registers. Set against such technique, 
almost anything will be open to criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 But the undaunted Crary lets fly with what he has -- and we do mean fly. His 
light, coursing style calls to mind the flickering of hummingbird wings or the 
glistening flow of a fast-moving stream (the blurred double-image of a 
pick-wielding Crary on the CD cover is an apt visual metaphor for his musical 
style). 
</P>
<P>
 Next to Watson's unerring balance, Crary does sound a bit hurried for an 
instant or two during "Whistlin' Rufus." But there isn't much else to quibble 
with over the course of an album that includes three other duets with A-list 
players (Tony Rice, Norman Blake and Beppe Gambetta), many joyful picking fests 
featuring members of Crary's band, California, and an amazing solo suite of 
traditional Irish tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional bluegrass is often defined by speed and headlong drive, but Crary, 
for all his mastery of speed, is more interested in dancing nimbly than plowing 
forward in linear fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 The band pieces are all larks, as the players get caught up in the gaiety of 
festive dance music. Fiddler Byron Berline, mandolin player John Moore and John 
Hickman or Dennis Caplinger on banjo come off as the merriest band this side of 
Sherwood Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The middle section of "Twin Reel" is particularly delightful, as Crary, Moore 
and Caplinger tumble through intricate variations climaxing in a powerful, 
cresting swell. It's all a far cry from Crary's last solo album, 
"Thunderation!" which went for darker hues and progressive-New Agey stylings. 
</P>
<P>
 Crary's duet with Rice on "Cattle in the Cane" provides one restless, 
unsettled interlude (Rice's woody tone contrasts with Crary's almost metallic, 
ringing sound). 
</P>
<P>
 Joined by Gambetta, the Italian player whose touch is also quite light, Crary 
adjusts on "Foggy Mountain Special" by putting some extra sting and bluesy 
swing into his own playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Irish Tune Suite" probes ghostly mysteries and heights of Celtic lyricism, 
then hurtles down the home stretch. Everything else is merriment in which the 
uncommon care and craft exerted by expert players yields springy, carefree 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, "Jammed If I Do" should bring good cheer to almost anyone who 
hears it, except perhaps for those few serious guitar players who forget to set 
aside their competitive instincts and find themselves wondering how they'd fare 
going one on one with Dan Crary. 
</P>
<P>
 *** Diamondback, "Ragin' Wind" Deadeye Records  
</P>
<P>
 It's usually a good sign when country musicians make albums that mainstream 
country radio will have absolutely no use for. That honorable fate is likely to 
befall Diamondback's debut album. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than polish its sound for the programming chiefs, the Lake Forest band, 
formerly known as the Honky Tonk Hellcats, has left all the rude, sweaty and 
gritty substance in. At the same time, the band has enough taste to know when 
to pull back the reins to avoid mindless country-boogie. 
</P>
<P>
 Raunchy, barking guitars in the Lynyrd Skynyrd tradition abound, but they 
often coexist with sweetly sawing fiddles that keep the band well-balanced 
between country and rock. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when most country bands are doing their best to get that polished 
early-Eagles formula, Diamondback's four members favor the more exciting, if 
less commercially successful, country-rock sound established before the Eagles 
by the high-kicking early Poco. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when too many country-rock albums feature vocals run through a 
studio blender that makes everything come out sounding unruffled, exact and 
lifeless, Diamondback's primary singer and songwriter, Frankie Lee Jenkins, has 
all the rough-edged personality of a likable character actor. 
</P>
<P>
 This transplanted Arkansan's scratchy, stringy, high-pitched voice is hardly a 
thing of beauty, but it's believable. The other lead singer, George Brown, has 
a fuller, smoother tone. 
</P>
<P>
 As a songwriter, Jenkins isn't a threat to Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle or 
Dwight Yoakam. But even when they aren't fully realized, Diamondback's songs 
sound like the statements of actual people relating stories drawn from life. 
</P>
<P>
 It helps that they stick to what they know: Five of the eight original songs 
have musicians as the protagonists. "King Cotton," a sprightly traditional 
country song, and the hard-charging "Honky Tonk Trail" are celebrations of 
music-making and its psychic rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Diamondback weighs the consequences of the free-booting life, 
especially the narrowed chances of a stable, satisfying romantic connection. 
Even when Diamondback goes for a big statement on "Ragin' Wind," a pro forma 
anthem-lament for the loss of the good old days of simple, small-town living, 
it carries a spirited kick that makes you think they just might churn up an 
Oz-like tornado to carry them back to the mythical past they pine for. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamondback's raw-and-juicy approach (augmented at times by guest players, 
including Danny Federici, the keyboardist of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band) 
is just right for its swaggering bar-life celebrations and reprobates' 
confessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially fine is their insouciant, rocked-up take on the Roger Miller 
chestnut, "Dang Me." Finally, though, Jenkins gives love its due on the wistful 
ballad "Loretta," in which a regretful, worn-out guitar-player begs for one 
last chance at the settled life. 
</P>
<P>
 With its echoes of Levon Helm fronting The Band, it's the album's most 
affecting song. It's nice to know that even a bunch of rough-riders like these 
can show a winning tender streak.

 LOOSE CANNON: Insiders at the Health and Human Services Department say 
Secretary Donna Shalala and Assistant Secretary for Health Philip R. Lee are 
growing more frustrated with their inability to rein in Dr. Joycelyn Elders. 
The outspoken surgeon general most recently caused an uproar with a speech in 
which she attacked the "un-Christian religious right" for opposing education in 
such areas as sex and AIDS. "We've got to be strong to take on those people who 
are selling our children out in the name of religion," she said. . . . In 
response, 87 House Republicans wrote to President Clinton seeking Elders' 
resignation. Sources at HHS say Elders' superiors fear that she is eroding her 
effectiveness through self-inflicted wounds, but they cannot persuade her to 
temper her remarks because she believes that she reports only to Clinton. "They 
say the surgeon general has a bully pulpit," she said recently. "Well, I don't 
mind using this bully pulpit."

 ISLAND HOPPING: The Clintons have yet to choose a destination for their 
planned time off in August. But don't tell that to the locals on Martha's 
Vineyard, the teeny, tony island off Cape Cod where the Clintons went last 
August, staying at a friend's vacation home because they have no getaway of 
their own. Saturday's edition of the Vineyard Gazette newspaper featured a 
front-page advertisement that was either a divine scoop or wishful thinking: 
"The 2nd Coming?! Accommodations Sought for Presidential Entourage. Sandcastle 
Realty (508) 627-5665."

 ABCs of A to Z: House backers of the so-called A to Z spending-cuts plan 
appear to have lost momentum during the Fourth of July recess, failing to gain 
even one of the 14 additional signatures they need for a petition that would 
force a marathon 56-hour budget-cutting session this year. The plan is dubbed A 
to Z because it promises to open the entire alphabet soup of the federal budget 
to cuts by a simple House majority, bypassing the committee system that A to Z 
advocates contend is used by House leaders to prevent cuts and preserve pet 
projects. . . . House Democratic leaders, who charge that A to Z would produce 
little but a legislative circus, seem to have succeeded in swaying the 
undecided by promising them a chance to cut mandatory benefit programs in 
August and September, as well as to consider budget process reforms starting 
this week. Even if A to Z advocates achieve their goal of acquiring 218 
signatures, it may come to nothing. The Senate is not likely to take up such a 
bill so late in the session, which means it's as simple as ABC that the A to Z 
plan would die with the adjournment of the 103rd Congress.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / SEMIFINALS; FAN-TASTIC SEMIFINALS; SWEDISH FANS CRY AMID 
SEA OF HAPPY BRAZILIANS

 Five minutes after the game ended, the Brazilians were laughing and cheering 
and doing the samba in the parking lot outside the 14 Below bar in Santa 
Monica. And Osa Bjurestam was standing there with tears running down the blue 
and yellow Swedish flag painted on her right cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I'm sad," said Bjurestam, late of Stockholm, currently of Century 
City, who with a couple of Swedish friends had chosen to watch the 
Sweden-Brazil World Cup semifinal game in, of all places, a bar packed with 
Brazilian fans. She tried to say more, but couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't really need to. The tears said it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Bjurestam, 28, and her friends represented the sole Swedish contingent in the 
14 Below, a tiny island of Swedishness amid a sea of Brazilian yellow and 
green. They had gone to the bar, which is co-owned by a Brazilian, to watch the 
game because it's their usual watering hole, and because they like the 
passionate way Brazilians watch soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I respect the Brazilians a lot," said Bjurestam, an interior design student. 
"They are like a living legend. And we (the Swedes and Brazilians) all get 
along very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, according to Elisabeth Kihlberg, press officer for the Swedish 
Consulate in Los Angeles, there weren't really any organized plans among the 
estimated 25,000 Swedes in the Los Angeles area to do anything special, except 
go to the game at the Rose Bowl or watch it on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "Swedish people by tradition are more reserved" than some other soccer fans, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 So for two hours Bjurestam and her friends stood together in the packed, 
sweltering 14 Below bar, bombarded by the relentless beat of samba drums. 
</P>
<P>
 Every now and then the dozen or so Sweden supporters -- among them a German, a 
Swiss and an Austrian -- tried to respond with chants of "Sweden! Sweden! 
Sweden!" But they were good-naturedly drowned out by the Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Swedish hopes were high at the beginning. "I think we have a very good 
chance," said Eva Turesson, 31, a Swedish native currently living in Manhattan 
Beach. "They've played pretty well. I'm going to be very disappointed if they 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Swedes lost. When Brazil scored the game's lone goal in the second 
half, the bar erupted in shouts of joy -- except for the Swedes, who looked 
sadder than an Ingmar Bergman movie. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, they tried to put the best face on it. They pointed out that 
Sweden had gotten farther along in the World Cup than anyone really had 
expected. They also pointed out that Sweden's Queen Silvia is half-Brazilian on 
her mother's side, so a victory for Brazil was sort of a quasi-victory for 
Sweden as well.

 The Burgos sisters have transplanted a little bit of Rio to Venice Boulevard, 
and their compatriots have embraced their Zabumba restaurant in West Los 
Angeles as "the Brazilian party place in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 "Carnival is once a year in Brazil," said Monica Burgos. "Here, it's every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Five months ago, Monica, 26, and her sisters Carla, 30, and Jeane, 28, took 
over what was then a moribund Zabumba, turning it into a restaurant so popular 
that fire marshals ordered it closed during Brazil's World Cup victory over 
Russia after the crowd swelled seriously beyond capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 For Brazil's match with Sweden at the Rose Bowl on Wednesday, the crowd 
returned -- confident and ready to party -- but only 100 could get inside. No 
matter, at least 100 more partied outside, where police had cordoned off the 
area with yellow crime-scene tape. 
</P>
<P>
 More than an hour before game time, the music and its infectious beat already 
had begun with the crowd singing, Ole, ole, ole, ole. Brasil. Brasil.  
</P>
<P>
 One woman brought the crowd to its feet as she moved through a samba warm-up. 
A friend of hers smiled and observed: "In Rio she would be topless, but that 
would be a little too much here." 
</P>
<P>
 Joked another Brazilian: "There is no word for inhibition in Brazilian 
Portuguese." 
</P>
<P>
 Eli Pereira arrived at Zabumba laden with instruments. The music and 
instruments are absolutely necessary because "Brazil's soccer team attacks in 
samba rhythm," said Pereira, who publishes an investment newsletter and heads a 
prize-winning samba school in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 As the game began, Zabumba was well into its rhythm, with conga drums, 
maracas, whistles and cowbells keeping the beat. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant was a sea of green and yellow, not the least of which were the 
Brazilian flags and messages that Carla Burgos had painted on customers. Her 
sister Monica sported the name of the restaurant on her exposed midriff and 
"Brasil" on her back. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing the game announcers on Spanish-language television was impossible over 
the noise, and the crowd broke into several premature explosive celebrations 
when they mistakenly thought Brazil had scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweden is playing Russian roulette," Pereira said, "and the loaded chamber is 
next." 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes dodged several bullets before Brazil finally scored the match's 
only goal in the second half and sparked a celebration at Zabumba that left 
passersby stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 As the game wound down to its final minutes, Brazilian fans began singing the 
traditional song with which they close carnival -- a tune with the same melody 
as the Mexican folk song "Cielito Lindo." 
</P>
<P>
 The eruption when the game ended showed that everything before had been merely 
a prelude. Dancers wrapped themselves in Brazilian flags and poured out to 
Venice Boulevard, where passing motorists honked their horns in celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup has brought a stronger identity to the estimated 20,000 
Brazilians in Southern California, said Rodney Mello, editor and publisher of 
News from Brazil, a monthly magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen so many Brazilians in the 14 years I've been here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as the Burgos sisters are concerned, much more is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sunday's final with Italy, they've won city permission to close off a side 
street. Win or lose, the entire neighborhood will get a chance to see how the 
Brazilians party.

<P>
 At 1:26 p.m. Wednesday, a joyous roar erupted in the San Remo restaurant and 
ascended toward the marble-blue heavens of the San Fernando Valley -- or "Il 
Vallone," as it is known to some of its Italian immigrant residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Evocative of Roman legions clashing in battle, of thunderous operatic arias, 
it was the same kind of sound that fills Italian cities during triumphant 
moments of soccer games there. 
</P>
<P>
 Although business proceeded on a nondescript stretch of Victory Boulevard 
outside, the crowd inside the restaurant was transfixed by an Italian-language 
satellite transmission of the World Cup semifinal match between Italy and 
Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Baggio, the ponytailed, sleepy-eyed national hero, had just scored a 
goal to give Italy the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdo Venneri, who moments earlier had sprinkled the table and several fans 
with salt for good luck, shouted in Italian: "He's a phenomenon! He's a 
phenomenon! Is he strong or is he strong, that son-of-a-gun! He's a 
phenomenon!" 
</P>
<P>
 For Venneri and the other Italians and Italian Americans, San Remo provides a 
bastion for an ethnic group dispersed by time, prosperity and suburban sprawl. 
Although several hundred thousand people of Italian descent live in Southern 
California, Los Angeles has not preserved a Little Italy like those of New York 
or Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 But scattered outposts endure: an Italian church and cultural center in 
Chinatown, an Italian American club in San Pedro. Villa Scalabrini, a 
retirement home for immigrants, also houses Fra Noi, a bilingual newspaper for 
the Italians of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Remo restaurant brings together a group of immigrants who own 
construction-related businesses specializing in marble. They eat long lunches, 
drink, talk, play cards and indulge a fierce obsession with soccer. They show 
up on Sundays at 5 a.m. to watch live games from Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is like a club," said John Pace, 56. "You feel at home here. You eat as if 
you were in the south of Italy. You know everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Pace, a marble importer and distributor who emigrated in 1962, is a regular 
among regulars. Like the genial owners, Mario and Antonio Di Paola, he hails 
from the Potenza region. On Wednesday, Pace and his friends watched the World 
Cup at a well-appointed marble table he had made years ago for daily feasts at 
San Remo.  
</P>
<P>
 With a satellite hookup, the restaurant shows World Cup broadcasts from an 
Italian network -- one example of how distances have shortened for immigrants 
in the late 20th Century. When 11-year-old Frank Di Paola asked his uncle, 
Mario, Wednesday if they were going to watch ESPN, his father said, "Forget it. 
We're watching it in Italian." 
</P>
<P>
 Italian fans tend to be wound up in the best of times. So Italy's string of 
come-from-behind victories in the World Cup has been particularly excruciating, 
said Tony Di Mambro, a marble importer who lives in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always suffer," said Di Mambro, sunglasses propped on his head. "Always." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Fernando Mastrocinque offered an eloquent example. Resembling a coach 
in his blue jersey and shorts, he stalked back and forth below the television, 
his face and gestures a symphony of anguish, relief, consternation and humor. 
Others grimaced through cigarette and espresso fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 After Baggio's second goal, ecstasy gave way to epiphany. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the Bulgarians closed the first half with a successful penalty kick, 
making the score 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we go again," muttered Mastrocinque. "I need something for my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 The second half settled into a test of endurance. As it became clear that 
Italy would survive, as the final seconds ticked off, Italian flags went up and 
bottles clanked. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was over: Italy would face destiny -- and, as it turned out later, 
Brazil -- in the World Cup final at the Rose Bowl. The warriors of San Remo 
were already girding for the ultimate combat. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Sunday," said Mastrocinque, clenching a fist, "Pasadena."

member of the City Council's Public Safety Committee is expected to introduce a 
motion Friday to launch a multimillion-dollar retrofitting of the nation's 
second-busiest police department. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD insiders have long maintained that the department's technological 
inadequacies are nearly as crippling to police services as the shortage of 
officers. But in recent years, modernization has largely been overlooked as 
political leaders have focused on finding money to expand the department -- 
part of Mayor Richard Riordan's pledge to add 3,000 police officers to the 
force during his four-year term of office. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's LAPD, many detectives spend more than half their time filling out 
paperwork, often by hand. Suspects can escape detection merely because they 
happen to be caught in a police division that does not have access to their 
files or fingerprint records. Patrol officers often lose valuable time because 
they have to fill out paperwork to check outequipment. Department managers, 
including Police Chief Willie L. Williams, cannot even tell instantly how many 
officers are on duty at any given time because no central computer links the 
LAPD's 18 geographic divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 A motion drafted by Councilwoman Laura Chick, a member of the Public Safety 
Committee, cites some of those shortcomings and seeks to direct political 
attention to the problems created by the LAPD's lack of technology. Her 
proposal has the backing of Police Department officials, who echo the need to 
modernize the LAPD's aging equipment -- both for efficiency and for department 
morale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's absolutely critical for us to do this," said Bill Russell, the 
LAPD's director of support services. "Over the past 10 years, we've fallen 
further and further behind in equipment and technology." 
</P>
<P>
 Chick agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's all this talk about the information superhighway," she said. "We 
haven't gotten the LAPD out of the horse-and-buggy." 
</P>
<P>
 Common office items such as personal computers are a relative rarity at the 
LAPD. Many of its computers were donated by private companies, and this has led 
to incompatibility between the computers that police officers use. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of the technology needed by the department is standard equipment in 
today's business office," Chick's motion states. "If our patrol officers had 
access to computers for report writing, officer hours could be reprogrammed 
from behind a desk to in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Chick's motion asks the Police Department to prepare a modernization report 
and proposes convening a special summit of Police Department leaders, 
technology experts and other law enforcement bosses to sketch a plan for the 
LAPD's modernization. Suggestions would be solicited from the various experts, 
and "these suggestions, if relevant, should be integrated into the overall 
report on modernization of LAPD," Chick's motion states. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the motion does not spell out how to pay for any of the technology 
advances, Chick said federal grant money might fund part of the plan, while 
savings from making police officers more efficient will help make other 
improvements more affordable. In addition, she said, officials may need to 
consider a bond measure to raise funds for modernization. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of any modernization would depend on what officials proposed to buy, 
but Chick and department officials estimate that a complete computerization of 
the LAPD would cost about $100 million. Russell added, however, that $15 
million to $20 million would make a significant impact on immediate needs and 
lay the groundwork for further improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 In her motion, Chick asks the LAPD and the city administrative office to 
develop timetables and cost estimates for implementing various proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the simple business systems that any large corporation takes 
for granted," Russell said. "We have to change the way we do business."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / SEMIFINALS; FAN-TASTIC SEMIFINALS; JUST BEING THERE WAS 
ENOUGH FOR BULGARIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was an improbable situation from the start, and Petko Kadiev knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 Packed into a small conference room at the plush Bulgarian Consulate, opened 
just months ago in a high-rise office building overlooking the ocean in Santa 
Monica, Kadiev and about 20 other fans sat stone-faced, watching on television 
as their country's dream came to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 Quietly, they munched on fried shrimp and drank white wine, their Bulgarian 
flags left rolled up on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Their World Cup team had lost to Italy, 2-1. They were not surprised by the 
result, although they had hoped for a victory that would have given them a shot 
at the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this year, the tiny Eastern European country had not even won a World 
Cup game in five appearances. Yet there the team was Wednesday, almost 
miraculously, playing in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who ever thought we would make it this far?" said Kadiev, who moved to Los 
Angeles from Bulgaria in 1959. "I'm not disappointed with the loss. . . . They 
have already achieved the unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria plays Sweden on Saturday for third place. Regardless of the county's 
final ranking in the World Cup, the games have brought together Los Angeles' 
Bulgarian community, including many who fled their homeland over the past 50 
years to escape Soviet rule. 
</P>
<P>
 With a lifetime World Cup record of no wins, six ties and 10 losses, just 
making it to the tournament this year was an accomplishment for the country of 
only 9 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a miracle something like this would happen," said Kadiev, a movie 
production artist who works in Hollywood. "I am proud." 
</P>
<P>
 The consulate quickly organized a party and invited some of the most prominent 
members of Los Angeles' Bulgarian community, among them bankers, artists and 
lawyers. They showed up in business attire on Wednesday, with small Bulgarian 
flags pinned to their lapels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just to make it into the best four teams in the world is enough," said 
Bodigar Avramor, the conductor of the Beverly Hills Orchestra and one of the 
fans who attended the consulate party. 
</P>
<P>
 It finally gives the country located between Romania and Turkey along the 
Black Sea, the recognition it deserves, said Avramor's wife, Ilka. And it gives 
hope to the Bulgarian people, who still live in bitter poverty despite the end 
of Moscow's domination, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The country needs joy and happiness," Ilka Avramor said. "This provides it." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mark Marinoff, a Los Angeles financial consultant who fled Bulgaria in 
1969, said he was disappointed that the team was out of contention for the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been a history-making opportunity," Marinoff said. But he 
added: "I'm pleased with the fact they have made it this far."

MAN FOUND GUILTY AFTER VICTIM RECANTS; COURTS: WOMAN DENIED DURING THE TRIAL 
THAT HER BOYFRIEND HAD BEATEN HER. BUT THE JURY WAS PERSUADED BY 911 TAPE UNDER 
A NEW POLICY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A North Hollywood man has been convicted of beating his girlfriend after 
prosecutors used the tape recording of her 911 call to help persuade a jury to 
ignore her denials during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 After jurors heard the 911 tape, Koeppel Hall, 25, an unemployed laborer, was 
convicted of misdemeanor battery. He was sentenced Tuesday to the maximum of 
one year in jail by a Van Nuys Municipal Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The case points up the vigorous approach that prosecutors can pursue in 
domestic violence cases: It doesn't matter if the victim recants a story, or 
even if the victim refuses to press charges. Prosecutors can still press ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our policy is to prosecute these cases to the utmost," regardless of whether 
the victim is cooperative, said Deputy City Atty. George A. Schell, who 
prosecuted Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall was found guilty of slapping, scratching and beating his girlfriend, now 
22, on April 23. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. James Hahn said Wednesday that he instituted the policy because 
prosecutors routinely encounter victims who change their stories when the time 
comes to go to court, often because of pressure from a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy, he said, means that the victim, typically a wife or girlfriend, 
does not have the final say on whether to drop charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Schell said, the policy puts the prosecutor in the uncomfortable 
role of discounting the victim's courtroom testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Hahn said, "This way, we're able to demonstrate to the jury when she was 
telling the truth. Was it the night of the offense, when she called 911? Or is 
it in court, where he's looking at her directly across from the counsel table, 
and she's saying what he wants to hear?" 
</P>
<P>
 Just after midnight April 23, Hall -- whose nickname, according to court 
files, is "Little Insane" -- became angry, the woman told Los Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, who was released from state prison in November, 1992, after serving 
about five years for manslaughter, slapped her on the face and neck, the woman 
told police. He pulled her hair and, she said, pushed her so hard that she hit 
her back on a bed frame. She said she fled their apartment and dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
 During the call, the woman cried frequently. She pleaded for paramedics and 
between sobs said: "My boyfriend of mine just jumped on me. My back is bruised 
bad. My face is bruised." Minutes later, officers spotted Hall at a convenience 
store at Vineland Avenue and Victory Boulevard and arrested him. Officers noted 
long scratches on the woman's neck and back. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, the woman's story had changed. She told a Los Angeles police 
officer following up the arrest that there had been no attack. She sometimes 
had scary "flashbacks," she said then, and she had gotten scratched when Hall 
had tried to calm her. 
</P>
<P>
 When she came to court, she and Hall were seen hugging and kissing in the 
hallway.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: AZUSA; BOY TURNED IN BY 
MOTHER TO STAND TRIAL FOR MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-year-old Azusa boy who was turned in to police by his mother was bound 
over for trial Tuesday in the Feb. 5 slaying of a convenience store clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Nabors, who was previously found fit to be tried as an adult, faces 
murder charges in the shooting death of Raj Kumar Sharma, 40, of Covina.Sharma 
died after robbers took $72 in cash, shot him five times and fled the 
convenience store where he was working on Arrow Highway in Azusa. Nabors' 
arraignment in Pomona Superior Court is scheduled July 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Nabors' younger brother, a 15-year-old, was convicted in Pomona 
Juvenile Court of murder in the shooting. He was ordered held by the California 
Youth Authority until age 25, the maximum juvenile penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys were arrested after their mother, Marilyn Ross, turned them in, 
saying her elder son had confessed. The mother is in hiding from her sons, 
whose gang friends have threatened to keep her from testifying.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; TOW-TRUCK 
DRIVER'S MURDER CONVICTION IN CRASH UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appeals court has upheld the murder conviction of the driver of a 
"bandit" tow truck, who sped to the scene of a collision he had heard about on 
police radio and slammed into a car, killing a child. 
</P>
<P>
 There was evidence to support the jury's conclusion that Heriberto Contreras 
showed a "conscious disregard for life" when he raced another trucker to a Los 
Angeles intersection, apparently aware that his brakes were bad, said the 2nd 
District Court of Appeal.The 3-0 ruling was issued late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The court said Contreras had numerous convictions for traffic violations and 
one previous accident, and was driving with a suspended license at the time of 
the fatal crash in February, 1991. He was sentenced to 15 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is one of a few in which a driver has been convicted of murder, 
rather than manslaughter, for an unintentional killing; the other cases have 
generally involved drunken drivers, who were found by a jury to be aware of the 
risk when they took the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors declined comment. Contreras' lawyer, Wesley Van Winkle, said he 
would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence was 100% clear that he had slammed on his brakes far ahead of 
the intersection, they had not held, and he tried to swerve," Van Winkle said. 
"Very clearly he was doing his best to avoid the accident."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: INGLEWOOD; L.A. SUES 
INGLEWOOD, FIRM OVER OIL DRILLING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles has filed suit against Inglewood and an oil drilling 
company over a proposed drilling project at the Inglewood Park Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that Inglewood violated the California Environmental Quality 
Act by granting Vortex Energy and Minerals Ltd. a permit to drill for oil on 
what is now empty land without completing an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose district borders the Inglewood 
site, said she is concerned about traffic the project will create, and other 
impacts such as ground water contamination and possible earthquakes. The 
drilling site is next to an offshoot of the Newport -- Inglewood fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood officials acknowledge that they have not done a full environmental 
report, but say they are not violating the law because all relevant impacts 
have been addressed.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 4 INDICTED 
IN ALLEGED BRIBERY OF INS AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four people were indicted by a federal grand jury Wednesday on charges of 
conspiring to bribe an Immigration and Naturalization Service agent to gain 
favors on a variety of immigration matters involving associates and employees 
of a Carson-area shipping warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-count indictment, unsealed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, 
alleges that the agent was asked to arrest immigrants who filed workers' 
compensation claims against the warehouse and to give visas to two Vietnamese 
nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 Named as defendants were an Orange County couple, Steve Moallem, 47, and his 
wife, Gayle Mullen, 34, who own Nationwide Distribution Services, a warehouse 
in Rancho Dominguez where the U.S. Customs Service conducts examinations of 
cargo containers imported into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Moallem denied the charges Wednesday and accused federal 
agents of entrapping his client. 
</P>
<P>
 Also named as defendants were Laguna Beach resident Naftali Grossman, 32, 
identified by prosecutors as a British citizen who is Moallem's cousin, and 
Armando Lising, 41, who lives in Paramount but is a citizen of the Philippines. 
Federal officials said Lising was the warehouse office manager.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY TO 
PAY $2.1 MILLION TO OWNERS OF IMPERILED HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council approved $2.1 million in payouts this week for 
two Pacific Palisades families who stand to lose their hillside homes in a 
landslide because of poorly engineered roads below.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, the city has paid out $5.5 million to settle five lawsuits over the 
construction of streets that weakened the hillsides in the Castellermare Mesa 
and Porto Marina neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Leslie Penchuk said he is negotiating settlements in nine 
other lawsuits. Two other property owners also might file suit. "I hope it will 
be resolved fairly soon," Penchuk said.  
</P>
<P>
 The settlement provides $1.25 million for Howard and Kay Smith and $850,000 
for Gerald, Doreen and Harvey Rochman. In exchange, the Smiths and Rochmans 
will turn their properties over to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a Superior Court jury found the city and Caltrans liable for the 
problems created when Pacific Coast Highway and some streets were built. The 
city approved construction in 1926.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; CITY 
OFFICIALS, FESTIVAL VENDORS DISCUSS SETTLEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acknowledging that attendance has been dismally low at the city's homespun 
soccer festival, Pasadena officials met individually with festival vendors 
Wednesday to talk about possible monetary settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the meetings, city officials said they are not prepared to pay 
anywhere near the money that the 20 or so vendors were asking -- $20,000 to 
$80,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 The sums the city might be willing to pay will be "pretty low and lower than 
some individuals want," said Bob Hays, a deputy city attorney. He said the city 
will respond to the requests Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena created its own festival, called Soccer Carnaval, after World Cup USA 
'94 placed its coveted Soccerfest in Los Angeles. Carnaval, a joint venture 
with Pasadena Productions Inc. at Brookside Park near the Rose Bowl, got no 
corporate sponsors and World Cup forbade it to open on game days. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors paid up to $7,000 for booths, but say their losses are much higher 
because they paid for stock and labor, expecting the event to be open on game 
days.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE DOUBLES DAMAGE 
AWARD TO FIRED WHISTLE-BLOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL GOTTESMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge on Wednesday doubled a $492,000 judgment awarded last month to a 
whistle-blower who was fired by the Los Angeles County Office of Education 
after he revealed that falsified data was used to justify the purchase of a 
multimillion-dollar computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwalk Superior Court Judge Daniel Solis Pratt said he was compelled by law 
to increase the award to Allen M. Weil, although he said he believed that the 
former computer analyst had already been sufficiently compensated. 
</P>
<P>
 In granting Weil $984,000, Pratt called the law a "notice to agencies that if 
you (fire a whistle-blower), you are going to be punished. It is mandatory." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the state's false claim act, a whistle-blower who has suffered a loss of 
income as a result of his actions is entitled to double the amount awarded for 
lost wages. The statute was enacted in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the $492,000 awarded by a jury to Weil for lost wages at last 
month's hearing, he also received $250,000 for emotional damages. 
</P>
<P>
 During the two-week trial in June, Weil's attorneys argued that county 
officials asked the analyst to provide false information to the school board, 
showing that a new computer was needed. When Weil refused, the administrators 
prepared the materials with the assistance of a computer salesman from Bull HN 
Information Systems, according to court documents. The school board eventually 
approved the purchase of an $8.6-million computer system from the company. The 
system processes payrolls for most public school districts in the county.  
</P>
<P>
 The jury concluded that the county education office and three top 
administrators harassed Weil and unfairly discriminated against him until he 
was laid off in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the county, however, said Weil was laid off because of budget 
cuts. Weil could have applied for another available position, they said, and 
probably would have been hired. Weil was characterized at the trial as a 
vindictive malcontent. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Weil, 63, said he was pleased with the judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't go through all of this for the money," he said. "I did it because I 
am a conscientious employee and taxpayer who wants to make sure our tax money 
is spent properly." 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt delayed a decision on whether the education office should pay Weil's 
attorney's fees. Attorneys for the county have said they plan to appeal. JILL

 A suspected child molester was arrested Wednesday night after a 1 1/2-hour car 
chase that started near Downtown Los Angeles and ended on a freeway near 
Diamond Bar, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pursuit began about 7:45 p.m., when police spotted a vehicle believed to 
be connected to a child molestation, said LAPD Officer Don Cox.. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox said police first ordered the gray Mazda pickup truck to pull over near 
Sunset Boulevard and Parkview Street.When the driver refused, a chase ensued, 
as the pickup -- staying well within the speed limit -- led half a dozen squad 
cars from the northbound Glendale Freeway to the southbound Orange Freeway, 
traveling on the Ventura, Foothill and Golden State freeways.  
</P>
<P>
 About 9 p.m., the truck stopped on the southbound Orange Freeway. Surrounded 
by squad cars, the suspect surrendered without incident.

$1 MILLION WORTH OF ART STOLEN IN 1989 IS RECOVERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 More than $1 million worth of stolen art and antiques -- ranging from an 
18th-Century harpsichord to paintings by Chagall and Matisse -- were returned 
to Los Angeles police on Wednesday, five years after they disappeared from a La 
Cienega Boulevard gallery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Detective Barbara Bella said the items had been missing since 1989, when 
Richard Eszterhazy -- owner of the Richard Eszterhazy Galleries -- closed up 
shop for a three-week vacation and never returned.Police discovered that the 
cultured Englishman had absconded with more than 1,000 items that had been left 
by clients for future auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Eszterhazy, the detective said, has eluded capture since then, despite the 
issuance last year of an international grand theft warrant for his arrest. The 
artworks, she said, were later traced to Eszterhazy's wife's hometown of 
Cologne, Germany, and eventually turned up in warehouses in Dusseldorf and 
Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
 Bella said the items included works by such masters as Chagall, Matisse and 
Klee, but the majority of the pieces were lesser works of the sort described by 
Edward Goldfield, a Melrose Avenue gallery owner who was one of Eszterhazy's 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldfield said he had given Eszterhazy some "secondary things, things I wasn't 
anxious to hang at an exhibit," after another art dealer had recommended him. 
When Eszterhazy's gallery closed, Goldfield said, he was told that the dealer 
was planning to reopen in larger quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he just took off," Goldfield said. Eventually, he said, he called the 
police, reporting the theft of between $35,000 and $50,000 worth of paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldfield said Wednesday he is glad about the recovery of the art but is not 
sure what he will do with it now that it is safe again. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't be things I'll offer to customers," he said.

CITY'S 911 SYSTEM TO BE IMPROVED; EMERGENCIES: ENGINEERING FIRM WILL MAKE 
REPAIRS SO A CATASTROPHE WILL NOT KNOCK OUT THE ENTIRE NETWORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday agreed to hire an engineering firm 
to make repairs that are supposed to prevent the 911 emergency telephone system 
from failing in a catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous vote came after at least five years of reports of potential 
problems and several near-failures of the system, according to city reports. 
The engineering firm that will make the repairs reported last year that the 911 
system's ability to survive failures and to operate under emergency conditions 
was "virtually nonexistent." 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency phone system narrowly survived the Jan. 17 earthquake. But in 
March, a fire at a Pacific Bell switching station in Downtown Los Angeles 
disrupted phone service for nearly 12 hours and threw the 911 service into 
disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 That incident prompted city Controller Rick Tuttle to call for a review of 
both the city and phone company preparations for maintaining the emergency 
phone network during a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's voters agreed in 1992 to raise property taxes to repay a 
$235-million bond issue to refurbish the 911 system. That proposal calls for 
two new dispatching centers, either of which is supposed to be able to manage 
the city's emergency calls if the other fails. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters were told the repairs were urgent, with the 1992 riots cited as an 
example of how the 911 lines could be overwhelmed. But planning for the 
improvements is still going on and may take seven years or more, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle has said that is too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just outrageous to have a mind-set that is talking about seven to 10 
years to complete that system," Tuttle said. "We think that is unacceptably 
long and breaks faith with the voters." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Tuttle has pushed for the interim repairs so that isolated 
failures cannot bring down the entire 911 system. Most of that work will be 
centered at the city's Emergency Operations Center in the basement of City Hall 
East. That facility's electronics were threatened with collapse because of a 
water leak after the January earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell is also working with the city to create a backup center for 
dispatching calls to the Emergency Operations Center, to prevent failures like 
the one after the March fire.

HANGING WITH THE BIG BOYS; POLITICS: FRESHMAN REPRESENTATIVE MAJORIE 
MARGOLIES-MEZVINSKY PLAYS ROUGH WHEN SHE HAS TO IN A TOUGH DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SLAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky arrived at her office for an interview 
carrying a carton of eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Apologizing for being late, she explained that she had stopped by a 
congressional "omelet do" in hopes of getting a fast lunch, but the cooking had 
just ended. "So they gave me a dozen eggs instead." 
</P>
<P>
 As the freshman Democrat who cast the vote that saved the first Clinton 
budget, Margolies-Mezvinsky is not about to refuse a contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected in 1992 by a scant 1,300 votes in a wealthy suburban Philadelphia 
district that is 2-to-1 registered Republican, she is running hard to persuade 
constituents that, despite breaking her promise not to increase taxes when she 
voted for that budget, she deserves a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will always, always have a very, very tough district," she said during the 
interview, conducted literally on the run as she sprinted between her office 
and the House floor. "There are certain people who will never vote for me, and 
the budget vote gave them a real platform." 
</P>
<P>
 Media-savvy from a prior career as a television reporter, Margolies-Mezvinsky 
has crafted a platform of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Aided by a former Washington Post researcher, Barbara Feinman, she has written 
a book about her experiences and those of 23 other women first sent to the 
House of Representatives in 1992, the so-called Year of the Woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, "A Woman's Place: The Freshmen Women Who Changed the Face of 
Congress" (Crown, 1994) is full of anecdotes about chauvinist slings and arrows 
in an institution that, despite a rise in female representation from 29 to 48, 
is still 90% male. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, while congressmen invariably refer to each other as "my 
distinguished colleague" from such and such a state, they often call women 
members by their first names, she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rep. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) publicly called Margolies-Mezvinsky "that 
three M girl," she was irked not so much by the shorthand for her 
tongue-twisting moniker -- her own campaign T-shirts say "MMM" -- as by the 
noun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Referring to me at age 51 as a 'girl' is inaccurate, demeaning and 
pathetically behind the times," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The slight pales next to one experienced by another freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 During a debate over the Hyde amendment restricting the use of federal funds 
for abortions, veteran Rep. David Obey (D-Wis.) told Rep. Corinne Brown 
(D-Fla.) to "shut up" when she objected to his request to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hyde amendment easily passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting here is only half the magic act; the task at hand is to carve out our 
own place," Margolies-Mezvinsky wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, her task is to remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling her climactic Aug. 5 action, she wrote: "I knew at the time that 
changing my vote at the 11th hour may have been tantamount to political 
suicide. . . . (But) the vote would resolve itself into one simple question: 
Was my political future more important than the agenda that the President had 
laid out for America?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Political opponents, not surprisingly, view her choice in less heroic terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want someone who's gonna lie to you, reelect Marjorie," said Frank 
Bartle, GOP chairman of Pennsylvania's Montgomery County, most of which is 
within Margolies-Mezvinsky's 13th Congressional District along the famed 
Philadelphia Main Line. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which before her election had not sent a Democrat to Congress 
since 1916, is one of only three in the nation where more people had their 
taxes raised by the Clinton budget than had them cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "She went from having no record to having the worst record you could possibly 
have in this district," Bartle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Margolies-Mezvinsky's extreme political vulnerability may actually 
prove to be her salvation. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeling both grateful and guilty about putting a freshman Democrat from a 
historically Republican district in such a predicament, her supporters have 
been pulling out their checkbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Federal Election Commission, Margolies-Mezvinsky led the 110 
House freshmen in contributions last year, both from individuals and political 
action committees, and ranked seventh in fund raising for all House members, 
just behind Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to $520,000 raised in 1993, she has attracted $154,000 in the 
first quarter of this year, said her campaign manager, Amy Walter. Half of that 
money also came from PACs, Walter said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, Margolies-Mezvinsky defended accepting PAC money despite 
running as a "reform candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was one of 11 Democrats who voted to eliminate PACs, but I have a very 
difficult district. I have to be very aggressive with fund-raising and will be 
within the rules," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter said contributions came from labor unions, insurance companies, 
pharmaceutical firms and feminist organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter are among her staunchest supporters, not surprising given her 
backing of abortion rights and greater funding for women's health. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wrote her a $2,500 check," said Peg Yorkin, the Los Angeles activist 
who chairs the Feminist Majority and who was encountered in a House anteroom as 
the congresswoman ran in to vote. "I think hers is a very key race." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since her fateful budget ballot, Margolies-Mezvinsky has joked that "God 
protects people who vote at 218," the tiebreaking number in the 435-member 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular day in May, the fates certainly seem to be conspiring in 
her favor: A divisive Republican Party primary in her district has just been 
won by the man she defeated in 1992 -- Montgomery County Commissioner Jon D. 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Margolies-Mezvinsky insisted that she was "not taking anything for 
granted," political observers said she would have had a far tougher time 
against Ellen Harley, a moderate, pro-choice Republican, who came in second in 
the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 A perennial candidate for office, Fox is "not particularly dynamic," a 
Pennsylvania state official said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is one comment that would be hard to make about Margolies-Mezvinsky. 
Indeed, she seems constitutionally unable to do fewer than three things at 
once. 
</P>
<P>
 As a youngster growing up in Philadelphia, she was a star athlete, head 
cheerleader and honor student who "never sat at her desk to do her homework," 
her mother, Mildred Margolies, said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, at age 28, she was so moved by a story she covered about Korean 
orphans that she became the first single woman in America to adopt a foreign 
child. Four years later, she adopted another girl, from Vietnam.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, she married former Iowa Rep. Edward Mezvinsky, who had four children 
from a previous marriage. The Mezvinskys had two sons together and are legal 
guardians for three Vietnamese boys, for a grand total of 11 kids -- five of 
whom still live at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolies-Mezvinsky, who commutes back to Philadelphia on weekends, 
acknowledged that the pace of life for herself and many other members of 
Congress is crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 She recounted that after the usual 18-hour day, she literally ran into a 
plate-glass door when she went back to a reception to retrieve her purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolies-Mezvinsky downplayed the incident, but Nancy Chasen, her best friend 
of 20 years and host while in Washington, remembered it graphically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was standing there and watched her walk into that door. I've never seen so 
much blood in my life. There were buckets of it. But Margie in typical fashion 
said, 'I'll drive to the hospital.' 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a quality she gets from her (late) dad of always saying, 'It's no 
problem. I'm bleeding to death but don't let me bother you.' 
</P>
<P>
 "She has really remarkable energy," Chasen continued. "The key to her 
personality is that she doesn't get dragged down by irrelevant activities like 
whether the shirts are folded in the drawer. She often says, 'If it doesn't 
matter in 100 years, it doesn't matter.' If you apply that rule, you have a lot 
left to apply to other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Chasen said her friend had "really matured" in her job this year after 
climbing the typical freshman's "steep learning curve." 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from her headline-grabbing budget vote, a Hill staffer said 
Margolies-Mezvinsky had not been "tremendously active on the floor" of the 
House. "She doesn't speak a lot. She tends not to be the first one out to 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's more show pony than workhorse," a former congressional staffer said. 
"But then I can't say there are 434 great congressmen and then there's 
Marjorie. She's probably in the top 50%." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another staffer attributed some criticism to envy at Margolies-Mezvinsky's 
ability to attract publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has been a TV persona and knows how to phrase things quickly and in a way 
people can understand," said Steven Goldstein, a lawyer on the House 
subcommittee on criminal justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolies-Mezvinsky worked hard on the recently passed bill banning 
intimidation of women seeking access to abortion clinics and "gave some of the 
most impassioned speeches," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm wild about her. A lot of people around Capitol Hill are pulling for her 
to win and would be heartbroken if she loses." 
</P>
<P>
 That group appeared to include a woman attendant at the House ladies' lounge, 
who said as the congresswoman walked in: "I'm so happy about your primary." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing still for a moment in the lounge, Margolies-Mezvinsky wryly pointed 
to a plaque on the wall noting that the room -- chosen for the women by the 
House male leadership -- was the one in which former President John Quincy 
Adams died. 
</P>
<P>
 "He died on this couch," she said as she sat briefly on the peach satin settee 
to be photographed. "At least it's been re-covered." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides so-called women's issues, Margolies-Mezvinsky said she was working to 
help produce a rational compromise on health care and has introduced bills to 
link cost-of-living increases for Social Security to one's means and to raise 
the retirement age to 70 by the year 2012. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the voters decide to end her congressional career just as she's getting 
the hang of it? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have another life," she said. "I've never had problems figuring out what I 
was going to do. Win or lose, I've won. It's been an extraordinary experience." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the eggs, she took them home on the train to Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the unflappable Margolies-Mezvinsky, "they arrived uncrushed," she said.

ART BUCHWALD: JUST PUT MICKEY AND MINNIE IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By ART BUCHWALD

<TEXT>
<P>
 The second battle of Manassas is now being waged between Walt Disney and Civil 
War buffs of Virginia. The Disney corporation wants to build a giant theme park 
devoted to American history. The historians want the Disney people to take 
their Mickey Mouse idea somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 If, for some reason, Disney can't get permission to build its park on hallowed 
Manassas ground, Joe Skalet has a suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company should move the park to Washington, D.C., which has been called 
Disney World North for some time now," he told me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Opening in Washington instead of Manassas would save the Disney company 
millions of dollars because all the fantasy is already there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Capitol could be renamed 'The Magic Mountain.' There could be a magic 
show in which billions of dollars would disappear before the public's eyes. 
Elected officials could moonlight as clowns, and lobbyists, dressed as pirates, 
would sink legislation not to their liking. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dome of the Capitol would feature a 'Slide for Life' and you would go 
down in a pork barrel until you reached the bottom, where you could swim in a 
shark pool filled with Washington lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Who would you put in the White House?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mickey and Minnie. Everyone who worked there would be required to wear mouse 
ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every hour Mickey and Minnie would come out and have their pictures taken. 
Donald Duck would be their spokesperson and he'd explain what they really meant 
to say." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such an opportunity for kids to learn about our history," I told Joe. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the main attractions of the park would take place when it gets dark. 
Disney engineers have already figured out a way to put rockets on the 
Washington Monument, and every 15 minutes they could make it roar into space. 
</P>
<P>
 "This attraction, by the way, would be free and included in the price of a 
ticket," Joe explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "There would be something for everybody. We are hoping to sign up Ollie North 
to sit in a swing where people could throw softballs at him, and if they hit 
him, he would fall into a large tank of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another attraction would be a giant wheel with 20 numbers on it. For $1, 
visitors would bet on a number and, if they won, they could take home a stuffed 
toy in the likeness of a Supreme Court justice." 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you consider having Beauty and the Beast?" I asked Joe. 
</P>
<P>
 He replied: "I hope so. We could get Packwood to play the Beast." 
</P>
<P>
 "Who would play Beauty?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody on the Hill he chooses." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe told me that he didn't think Disney would have any problem getting the 
park off the ground. "We would run a clean place where even Snow White and the 
Seven Dwarfs would feel right at home."

 To cure a bout of the "mean reds," Holly Golightly, the heroine of "Breakfast 
at Tiffany's," would dash off to her sanctuary from the ugly world: Tiffany & 
Co.'s Fifth Avenue store. Fortunately, we don't have to leave home to thwart 
today's mean reds thanks to the Tiffany Spa Collection. The premiere line 
features five botanically based treatments, including Purifying Body Soap 
($15), Smoothing Body Scrub ($30), Hydrating Body Milk ($40), Refreshing Body 
Mist and Conditioning Shampoo (each $25). "Life is so stressful today," notes 
Jo Ellen Qualls of the South Coast Plaza store. "Not all of us can start the 
day at the spa. But we still need those moments of pampering." That intention 
appeals not only to women, she adds, but men, who are buying products for 
themselves. The Cash Register Roars

 It's a jungle over at Disney licensing headquarters in Burbank as folks there 
scramble to fill orders on "Lion King" everything. "Retailers are calling us, 
and we can't get reorders out fast enough," says Doug Mangino, vice president 
of apparel there. Disney Stores report they've blown out the limited edition 
watches ($75), while stores from Sears to Robinsons-May are doing steady 
business with Tees (about $7 to $14). Surprises: healthy sales of boys' shorts 
sets. "The lack of a female heroine in 'The Lion King' has meant fans are split 
evenly between boys and girls," Mangino says. Other top sellers include women's 
bike shorts and leggings (about $13 to $18) and kids' canvas shoes (about $11 
to $13) and sandals (about $7). In Stitches

 You can hear Malia Mills' smile over the phone. She probably couldn't fake a 
frown if she tried. And why not? This Manhattan-based designer has plenty to 
smile about with the mass exposure she's been getting for her swimsuits. 
Started in late 1992 with an 800 number, demand finally forced her to quit her 
waitressing job in May and take on two partners to help with the load. It's a 
funny twist considering a Mills suit has appeared almost every month in just 
about every rag mag, from Harper's Bazaar to Allure, since last summer. Add the 
cover of Sports Illustrated 1994 Swimsuit Desk Calendar to the list. The secret 
of her success lies in the fit, the result of multiple seams and one-way 
stretch fabrics (such as the kind girdles are made of), many that are 
unconventional for swimwear. "My suits are really about promoting the fact that 
women are curvaceous," she says. Mills also wanted to bring suits to a "fashion 
level." So it's not unusual to find a terry flared skirt, a cotton Lycra 
long-sleeved top with a zipper-front or a corset made of acetate, rubber and 
rayon. Sleeved or skirted suits, she says, are a "new kind of sexiness." 
Sweaters to swim in are next on the drawing board. The suits are sold as 
separates (to personalize styles and sizes) from $48 to $90 a piece. ROSE

BEHIND THE SCENES: DARING DISPLAY OF DISCO PLUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 About 500 HYTs (that's hip, young things) came down with a serious case of 
Saturday Night Fever -- on a Wednesday -- at the Second Annual Disco Skate 
Party at Side by Side roller and ice rink in Huntington Beach. The symptoms: 
fabulous '70s garb not seen since NYC's original Studio 54 . . . or, at least 
not since the weekend before at Club 1970s in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The bug responsible for this fever was a superfly named Beej and his 
accomplice, Gary Blitz, editor of Clublife magazine. The duo promotes the 
county's longest running disco night every Thursday at Club 5902 in Huntington 
Beach, known as Disco 2000. Beej appeared decked out in a lemon yellow and 
leopard trim ensemble that any evil dude from a Shaft flick would have envied. 
His platforms elevated him by almost eight inches; the purple feathers sticking 
out of his massive hat added another foot. 
</P>
<P>
 No other countywide nightclub event -- at least not in recent history -- has 
dragged out such a bunch of crazily clad patrons. Allowing those 18 and older 
could have been one reason: Most of the glam divas looked well below age 21. 
The Beej and Blitz promotion team also weighs heavily among the "club kids" 
(those who have built reputations for their wild attire), who live here but 
spend their nocturnal lives being fabulous in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Deejay Sean Perry looked like Pippi Longstocking, and Disco 2000's go-go 
dancers went for a "Charlie's Angels in Space" look, complete with flashing toy 
ray guns, skates covered in glitter and plenty of silver touches. Indeed, 
silver was everywhere at the soiree, in addition to shiny black vinyl -- both 
important fashion elements for '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Other frequently seen touches were Afro wigs, hot pants, kiddie barrettes, 
plastic gold jewelry, leg warmers and signs of Hollywood Barbie (Tees and 
real-life interpretations). Best accouterment of the night: the faux, thick, 
curly, black chest hair peeking from the silky shirts of Orange residents Jason 
Johnston and Jeffrey Thomas, both 18. It takes an hour to glue on, it itches at 
the end of the night, but, hey, it's a hit with the disco bunnies, noted 
Johnston. ROSE APODACA JONES

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: FOR FAYE, THERE'S ALWAYS SHOPPING

 What has Faye Dunaway been up to since her unceremonious dumping last month by 
boy composer Andrew Lloyd Webber? She's spent at least one afternoon shopping. 
The diva par excellence turned up at the Elizabeth Lucas Collection -- a Santa 
Monica vintage clothing store -- the other day and proceeded to scoop up 
several items for herself. She also picked up a shirt to give Johnny Depp, with 
whom she just made a film. "It was the best shirt in the store," said Lucas of 
the rare large, flecked two-tone gabardine style that once hung in her 
ex-husband's closet. Dunaway went for a double-breasted, cream-colored Palm 
Beach dinner jacket, a fedora, a gray and white checked gabardine shirt and 
Mexican huaraches. "She looked," Lucas said, "fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
 Color Him Curious: "So that's why Geena Davis looked so bad as a blonde, " Mr. 
Inside Out announced triumphantly. "It didn't go with her skin tone." 
</P>
<P>
 He'd been flipping through our copy of Time-Warner's new Makeover magazine and 
was mesmerized by a critique of famous brunettes gone blond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Madonna makes a terrific blonde," he informed us. We thought we spied him 
peering at our neglected mop. A little knowledge is a terrible thing, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 Makeover, on the stands this week, is filled with before and after pictures of 
celebrities and ordinary people who yearn to look extraordinary. Wonder how Mr. 
Inside Out would look with a few highlights? 
</P>
<P>
 Pushy, Pushy: Why spend a mint on a Wonderbra when $8 will buy a set of pushup 
pads from Frederick's of Hollywood. Flat-chested women can try out the cleavage 
-- see if it is all it's cracked up to be. We think pushup bras are about as 
attractive as a king-sized pillow stuffed into a standard-sized case. But, as 
usual, we seem to be out of sync with our fellow female shoppers. Sooooo, ever 
mindful of our duty, we offer a further bit of advice for looking as bosomy on 
the beach as you might at a dinner party: Frederick's summer catalogue sells 
bathing-suit-compatible pads. These ingenious devices stay put with Velcro. 
More important, though, they're made of a water-repellent fabric. 
Undergarment-cum-flotation device. 
</P>
<P>
 Invasion of the Pseudo-European Nerds: That's the only possible explanation 
for all the sandals we've seen on the streets lately, coupled with the white 
sweat socks. The final delicious touch? They're rolled down, doughnutlike, at 
the ankle. Whether they know it or not, these guys may well be in the fashion 
vanguard. At the recent menswear shows in Milan, English designer Katherine 
Hamnett dressed all her models in white socks and sandals. But to be "funky and 
cool and twist things up a bit," Hamnett's models had toenails polished black 
underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 La Dolce Vida: It was a Fellini-esque spectacle of high fashion and high camp. 
Top models cautiously teetered down Rome's Spanish Steps Tuesday while 
over-the-hill pop stars lip-synced the lyrics to decades-old hits. All for the 
benefit of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's private television channels. 
Claudia Schiffer made it down all 137 slippery marble steps in Valentino's snug 
black evening gown and spike heels, which is, of course, what makes her a 
supermodel. The three-hour show, which included designs by Missoni, Lancetti, 
Byblos and Max Mara, was broadcast live to 13 countries. "There are billions of 
people out there watching us," said Gerry Scotti, who co-hosted the show. "My 
legs are trembling with excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 From the Mouths of Models: "Just because you're wearing lipstick, doesn't mean 
he has to." (Cindy Crawford in a radio spot for Revlon's "revolutionary" new 
non-transferable lipstick. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I got these arms compliments of my personal trainer, Sylvester Stallone. He's 
given me back my body -- and made it better." New, more muscular mother of 
Sly's baby, Janice Dickinson, in W. 
</P>
<P>
 Around Town: Time to start scouring the local thrift stores for fall's most 
coveted texture -- mohair. We spotted a hairy knit mini-dress for $5 at the 
West L.A. Goodwill store. . . . Instante, Gianni Versace's secondary line, and 
Versace Jeans Couture will open for business at Two Rodeo Drive just in time 
for Christmas. . . . Betsey Johnson, Todd Oldham and other youthful designers 
will re-imagine the Playboy bunny costume for the '90s (our mind reels) at an 
AIDS fund-raiser at the Playboy mansion in September.

FASHION / SCREEN STYLE: TRUE ACTION-PACKED FASHION STUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Movie: "True Lies." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Helen Tasker (Jamie Lee Curtis, pictured) thinks her husband, Harry 
(Arnold Schwarzenegger), is a computer salesman but soon gets wind of his real 
work as a spy who battles nuclear weapon-wielding foes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Marlene Stewart, whose credits include the movies 
"Terminator 2: Judgment Day," "Falling Down," "The Doors" and "JFK" as well as 
11 Madonna videos, including "Vogue," "Express Yourself" and "Like a Prayer." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Of the movie's presumed $100-million to $120-million budget, figure 
a couple grand goes for costumes. OK, maybe a couple hundred grand. But except 
for the opening and closing scenes -- odes to James Bond, with Harry posing as 
an international gadabout wearing a swell tuxedo -- we're talking C & R 
Clothiers for him and Talbot's for her. (The clothing budget does take a hit 
when Helen opts midway through the film for $450 Manolo Blahnik pumps.) 
</P>
<P>
 Hit: This is an action picture, with some noteworthy fashion stunts. Harry 
literally steps out of an underwater "dry suit" fully dressed in a tuxedo. To 
rapidly improve her sex appeal, Helen rips the matronly ruffles off a cocktail 
dress and uncovers a provocative, barely there black tube. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hunk Factor: Consider what action heroes of the moment are wearing. Jack 
Traven (Keanu Reeves) of "Speed" does his duty in a T-shirt and utility pants. 
Jimmy Dove (Jeff Bridges) of "Blown Away" wears bomb-squad gear. And there's 
Harry in a suit. Thankfully, he removes the tie and the jacket. By denouement, 
the shirt is reduced to a bunch of muscle-baring shreds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jiggle Factor: While Helen also becomes an action hero, she is no less 
decorative for it. Indeed, her tube dress starts mid-breast and stops a few 
inches below the butt. In a real moment of panic, however, she does kick off 
her black spike-heel pumps. "It's the antithesis of what she should be 
wearing," Stewart acknowledges. "But they wanted a little sexy dress." 
</P>
<P>
 Her Trivia: The little black dress was actually three dresses -- a perfectly 
fitted one for close-ups, a stretch velvet version that would accommodate body 
pads, a stunt harness and large movements for action scenes, and a slightly 
oversize version that would easily drop to the ground for Helen's striptease. 
</P>
<P>
 His Trivia: Schwarzenegger's large body and small waist meant his wardrobe had 
to be entirely custom-made, including neckties. "You can't put anything 
off-the-rack on him except a knit polo shirt," Stewart said. That meant that 
his average, working-man suits, which were meant to look cheap, cost from $700 
to $1,200 each. BETTY GOODWIN

FAUX PAS REPORT: BEEPER BLUNDERS; TAKE A PAGE FROM THE DISCREET WHEN WEARING A 
PAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a guy wears a pager, he usually clips it to his belt. It's not pretty, 
but where else is he going to put it? Unfortunately, many women have also taken 
to this trend of wearing a pager on a belt or sticking it out of a pocket, 
which doesn't lend much to a special outfit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best place for it is on your purse strap," says Stephanie Grani of 
Stephania in San Juan Capistrano. "Keeping a beeper on your belt brings too 
much attention to it." 
</P>
<P>
 If you've got it on a purse strap, don't clip it just anywhere. Move it down 
closer to the body of the purse to keep it discreet. And don't be tempted to 
stick it in a blouse or slacks pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Worn wallets: There are a lot of guys out there with all the right clothes. 
They look great all the time, except when they have to pay for something. Out 
comes a beat-up, faded and torn wallet that looks like it was a gift he 
received when he got his first job at Burger King. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the best wallet only lasts a year or two, especially if it's in your 
back pocket all the time," says fashion designer Brian Mayne of Mission Viejo. 
"If yours has become ratty, make sure you hide it well." 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, the softer the leather the longer it will wear, because the wallet 
will conform to the body's shape and won't be unusually stretched. The square 
"hipster"-style wallet is still popular, but most guys prefer the smaller 
version that fits easily into jeans pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the boot: It's a rule as old as wind-up timepieces and almost as 
outdated: Save your boots for fall and winter. In truth, you can wear your 
boots anytime of year, depending on what else you've got on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wear your lighter, summer clothing with boots," says Liz Menzies of Swept 
Away Clothes to Go in Irvine. "You don't want to wear anything heavy or woolen; 
then your boots and the rest of your outfit won't look appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Try something light, a camisole and prairie skirt, to contrast with the boots. 
It's a kind of summer statement that says, "Yes, I know it's not a by-the-book 
style, but it's me."

CELEBRATING THE GOOD OLD DAYS

<P>
 For 20 years, the Corona family has produced onions, corn, eggplant and other 
row crops. People flock to buy their fresh veggies, so the family is even 
forgoing the roadside stand for a "farmer's village." 
</P>
<P>
 But how much longer the 165-acre farm will survive has less to do with sales 
than with development. The Corona Ranch is the last of the row crop farms in 
Temecula, says Rose Corona, who works the farm with parents James and Mary and 
brother Stephen. Subdivisions have been built or are planned on each side. "We 
want to keep agriculture alive," she says, "so we're putting on these history 
events." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second year that the Indian and Pioneer Days -- and other popular, 
history-themed events for spring and fall -- has been held to teach future 
generations about farming. The Indian and Pioneer Days take place Saturday, 10 
a.m.-6 p.m., and Sunday, 10 a.m.-5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment includes tribal, bear and Aztec dancers; demonstrations of 
hide-tanning for tepees (a dozen tepees will be set up); archery and 
arrowhead-making, and other crafts. On the Pioneer side, there will be covered 
wagons, hayrides, wool-spinning, weaving and woodcarving. Barbecue, fry bread 
and refreshments will be offered.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to show that things didn't always happen the way they do in the 
movies," Rose Corona says. "The pioneers couldn't have settled without the 
Indians' help." 
</P>
<P>
 Corona Ranch and Farmers Village, 33320 Highway 79 S., exit Highway 79/Indio, 
Temecula. Admission is $5; children under 12 and seniors, $3. (909) 676-5006.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; LITERARY WINDOW LETS IN FRESH LOOK AT F. SCOTT 
FITZGERALD; F. SCOTT FITZGERALD / A LIFE IN LETTERS EDITED BY MATTHEW J. 
BRUCCOLI , WITH THE HELP OF JUDITH S. BAUGHMAN : SCRIBNER'S $30, 515 PAGES

<P>
 The suitable collective noun -- as in a pride of lions, a school of fish and, 
I suppose, a black hole of solipsists -- would have to be a cloud of 
biographers. When enough of them drift around a large literary figure, the 
figure all but disappears. 
</P>
<P>
 It becomes hard to believe that there ever was a real person named Hemingway, 
so retailed and detailed has he been in the books about him. Faulkner by now is 
only visible in patches. As for our window on F. Scott Fitzgerald, so many 
scholarly and biographical noses have pressed against it that it has filmed 
over. To read his letters, by contrast, is like having the window thrown open. 
His words restore him to view. 
</P>
<P>
 Having published 22 books dealing with Fitzgerald's life and work, Matthew J. 
Bruccoli must hold a window-pressing record. But as editor of, among other 
things, the notebooks and a four-volume set of letters, he has done more than 
anyone to get the window open as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Four-volume letter collections are fine, but for what Samuel Johnson and 
Virginia Woolf called common readers -- whose reading leaves them with a hunger 
for more and whose lives leave them with time for less -- they are virtually a 
wall of silence. This one-volume selection, edited with the assistance of 
Judith S. Baughman, provides a way in.  
</P>
<P>
 What we find is only in a general sense what we expect: the relatively brief 
exhilarations and the long troubles of a man who put his faith in literary 
fortune, found it just long enough to hook it, and watched it tear away in slow 
motion for the rest of a short life that comes to seem interminable. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet under the accepted image of a Fitzgerald brilliant but fatally weak, the 
letters continually show the man's strength. It was not in managing his 
affairs, undone partly by alcoholism and his inability to cope with Zelda's 
madness, and much more gravely by a compulsive extravagance that could only be 
supported by extravagantly rewarded short stories -- the Saturday Evening Post 
paid him today's equivalent of $40,000 apiece -- that he considered hack work. 
</P>
<P>
 The strength, oddly enough, shows in his sense of failure. He knew he had 
sabotaged his brilliance, and perhaps he had. But to know it meant he knew that 
he possessed brilliance. The exhilaration of such knowledge, along with the 
faith and discipline it enjoined, continually light up the words he wrote to 
his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the letters show what a superb critic he could be. When 
such formidable practitioners as Edmund Wilson and H.L. Mencken write of their 
admiration for "Gatsby" and try to pinpoint the source of a slight unease, he 
does it for them: It is the failure to spell out Gatsby's relationship to 
Daisy. (Time, of course, is an even better critic: It has decided that "Gatsby" 
shines by what it withholds.) His page-by-page suggestions for toning down 
excessive bombast in Hemingway's first two novels are those of an inspired 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the letters distill sheer humiliation in their continual pleas for 
advances and more time. With "Tender Is the Night" the stalling went on for six 
years. There is a deeper pain and a hard-won beauty in an extraordinary letter 
to Zelda, written early in her successive breakdowns. The pain is transfigured; 
the shaky man and the prophetic artist come together in a vision that is 
simultaneously harsh, perceptive and profoundly compassionate.  
</P>
<P>
 Other letters show his fear of her power to hurt him. Of a character in her 
novel, "Save Me the Waltz," that was based on himself, he wrote with a 
loftiness that barely masked panic: "Her single intention in this somewhat thin 
portrait is to make me a nonentity." 
</P>
<P>
 His sensitivity about class and his own less-than-patrician Irish lineage 
leads to possibly the oddest comment about James Joyce's "Ulysses" ever made. 
He wishes it had been set in America. "There is something about middle-class 
Ireland that depresses me inordinately -- I mean, gives me a sort of hollow, 
cheerless pain. Half of my ancestors came from such an Irish strata or perhaps 
a lower one. The book makes me feel appallingly naked." 
</P>
<P>
 The collection begins with instructions to his younger sister about social 
success. Instead of asking her dancing partners about their schools or plans, 
she must remark on their long eyelashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end he, bombards his daughter, Scottie, with advice that only seems 
to be entirely different. She must take demanding courses and work hard. But 
she must also make sure to get along with the campus Left -- and this was the 
late 1930s, when Left was fashionable. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it a matter of being as superficial as ever, with only the surfaces 
changed? Or was it, that if, for most artists, the genetic code to the world's 
tragedy is found in the heart, brain or medulla, Fitzgerald found it imprinted 
in the skin?

WITH VARYING TEXTURES, IT'S OK IF EVERYTHING'S ALL WHITE; FABRICS: SHEERS, 
MESHES, POINTELLES AND CROCHETS ARE KEY TO KEEPING SUMMER CLOTHES FROM LOOKING 
LIKE NURSES' UNIFORMS.

 Bored with black, fed up with florals and don't mind mounds of laundry? Make 
room for summer whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Call white the new black, a tan's best friend -- and a color that best 
reflects the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first of all simple colors," according to Leonardo da Vinci. 
</P>
<P>
 Shades range from bright whites to pearlized tones, alabaster to vanilla. 
Besides the ubiquitous white shirts with sweeping tails, tank tops and jeans, 
there are blazers, pleated tennis skirts and skinny slip dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really difficult for me to come up with an item that we did not sell in 
white," says Phillip Monaghan, executive vice president of marketing for 
Express stores in Columbus, Ohio. "Be it a cardigan, T-shirt, skirt or shorts, 
it's in white. And with mules and stacked-heel shoes, white socks are a must." 
</P>
<P>
 What makes white work? Well, summer clothes are a cornucopia of textural 
interest, such as sheers, meshes, pointelles and crochets. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the natural fabrics such as linens and nubby silks," Monaghan says, 
"white is the perfect color to show them off." 
</P>
<P>
 Adrienne Vittadini likes to do the white thing head-to-toe. 
</P>
<P>
 "White is a color that illuminates and shows texture very well," the designer 
says, "especially on piques and cords. That's because it's the purest form of 
color, very fresh and clean." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Vittadini's white-hot items with surface interest for summer are a 
hand-knit sweater dress, rag-stitch tank top, linen skirts and trousers and a 
linen Mandarin collar jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real look right now if you're going to wear white is top to bottom," 
designer Randy Kemper says. "Put on an easy shirt in white over white trousers. 
I live in white jeans all summer." 
</P>
<P>
 White works because it's the ideal clean slate. "White clothes," he says, "are 
just like an empty canvas." 
</P>
<P>
 He advocates brown accessories and a faux tan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the quintessential summer look," he says, "about as good as you can 
get." 
</P>
<P>
 Designer Tom Platt says he likes white linen for day and white crepe for 
evening with a touch of silver or other subtle accent. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the biggest problems is the danger of winding up with clothes that 
look like a nurse's uniform," he says. "As a designer, my solution is to 
combine a white dress with some silver trim or with a silver chiffon coat or 
shawl. Or we'll line white chiffon with three or four layers of pink organza. 
It creates frothy, light and happy clothing. It's upbeat." 
</P>
<P>
 Benny Lin, fashion director for Macy's East, also endorses white for evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "White is a color whose time has come, whether it's a tuxedo pantsuit or a 
crepe slip dress," Lin says. "It's a color story, a progression from naturals. 
Customers have bought a lot of naturals for spring, and now they're ready for 
white." 
</P>
<P>
 But don't wear it if you don't want to stand out. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the human eye, pure white comes forward and is perceived as a brilliant 
color," says Lee Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute in 
Carlstadt, N.J. "It has a coolness associated with ice and snow and things that 
glisten like stars. It's not a non-presence as far as clothing is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will be noticed."

911 TAPE KEY TO CONVICTION IN BEATING; COURT: BOYFRIEND GETS A ONE-YEAR TERM. 
PROSECUTORS PRESSED ON EVEN THOUGH WOMAN RECANTED HER INITIAL STORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A North Hollywood man has been convicted of beating his girlfriend after 
prosecutors used a recording of her 911 call for help to counter her denials at 
the trial that she had been abused. 
</P>
<P>
 After jurors heard the 911 tape, Koeppel Hall, 25, an unemployed laborer, was 
convicted of battery. He was sentenced Tuesday to the maximum of one year in 
jail by a Van Nuys Municipal Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The case points up the vigorous approach that prosecutors can pursue in 
domestic violence cases: It doesn't matter if the victim recants a story, or 
even if the victim refuses to press charges. Prosecutors press ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our policy is to prosecute these cases to the utmost, regardless of the 
cooperativity or uncooperativity of the victim," said Deputy City Atty. George 
A. Schell, who prosecuted Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall was found guilty of slapping, scratching and beating his girlfriend, now 
22, April 23. City Atty. James Hahn said Wednesday that he instituted the 
policy because prosecutors routinely encounter victims who change their stories 
when the time comes to go to court, often under pressure from an intimidating 
or sweet-talking defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy, he said, means that the victim, typically a wife or girlfriend, 
does not have the final say-so on whether to drop charges. Prosecutors do. 
</P>
<P>
 And if prosecutors take the case to court, he said, the victim's role is 
transformed. She is a witness, albeit an important one, whose prior statements 
to police or to 911 dispatchers can be offered to jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Schell said, the policy puts the prosecutor in the uncomfortable 
role of making the victim's courtroom testimony out to be lies. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Hahn said, "This way, we're able to demonstrate to jury when she was 
telling the truth. Was it the night of the offense, when she called 911? Or is 
it in court, where he's looking at her directly across from counsel table and 
she's saying what he wants to hear?" 
</P>
<P>
 Just after midnight on April 23, Hall -- whose nickname, according to court 
files, is "Little Insane" -- became angry, the woman told Los Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, an ex-convict released from state prison in November, 1992, after doing 
about five years for manslaughter, slapped her on the face and neck, the woman 
told police. He pulled her hair and, she said, he pushed her so hard that she 
hit her back on a bed frame. 
</P>
<P>
 She fled their apartment, ducked under a fence, found a phone at an apartment 
complex down the block and dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
 During the three-minute call, the woman cried frequently. She pleaded for 
paramedics and between sobs, she said: "My boyfriend of mine just jumped on me. 
My back is bruised bad. My face is bruised."  
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, officers spotted Hall at a convenience store at Vineland Avenue 
and Victory Boulevard, and arrested him. Officers noted long scratches on the 
woman's neck and back. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, the woman's story had changed. She told an LAPD officer 
following up the arrest that there had been no attack. She sometimes had scary 
"flashbacks," she said, and she had been scratched when Hall tried to calm her. 
</P>
<P>
 When she came to court, she and Hall were seen hugging and kissing in the 
hallway. They were reportedly so affectionate, Judge Gregg Marcus said, that he 
told them to cool it. 
</P>
<P>
 On the stand, the woman stuck to the "flashbacks" story, Schell said. "But on 
the 911 tape it was apparent that her main emotion was fear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Susan G. Poehls, could not be reached 
Wednesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial took six days. The jury deliberated for two more before finding Hall 
guilty of misdemeanor battery. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus imposed the maximum one-year term on Tuesday. "If it warrants it," he 
said Wednesday in an interview in chambers, "I give it."

2 MEN ARRESTED IN PAIR OF PARK RAPE-ROBBERIES; CRIME: A NEIGHBORHOOD 
SURVEILLANCE TEAM HELPS POLICE STAKE OUT THE CHATSWORTH SITE WHERE ATTACKS 
OCCURRED JULY 1 AND 6. 
</P>

<P>
 With the help of a neighborhood civilian surveillance team, police have 
arrested two men suspected of raping two women and robbing their male 
companions in a remote west San Fernando Valley park that has been the scene of 
at least one similar attack in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 In custody Wednesday were Francisco Javier Ochoa and Jose Abran Umanzor, both 
21-year-old natives of El Salvador who lived in Canoga Park and worked in a 
local carwash. The two men were arrested Saturday night by a task force of 
detectives staking out Chatsworth Park North with the help of several members 
of a local crime-fighting group known as the Devonshire Area Volunteer 
Surveillance Team, Los Angeles Police Lt. Kyle Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the victims and male friends who were accompanying them never got a 
close look at their assailants, Ochoa and Umanzor were arrested after spending 
more than an hour loitering and "acting suspiciously" in the park, said 
Detective Sandra Palmer, coordinator of the LAPD's Devonshire Division Major 
Assault Crimes section. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we have an extremely strong case against these individuals," Capt. 
Vance Proctor, commanding officer of Devonshire Division, said at a news 
conference police held at the park Wednesday to announce the arrests.  
</P>
<P>
 Charges of rape, sodomy and robbery were filed against the men late Tuesday, 
and they were being held Wednesday on $500,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks came almost exactly one year after another series of late-night 
armed robberies and rapes in West Valley parks prompted police to warn 
residents to avoid some of their local recreation areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the current cases, police put more than a dozen undercover officers in 
Chatsworth Park North on the night after the second rape July 6, some of them 
posing as couples. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested the two men as civilian volunteers stood lookout with police 
radios, and recovered a plastic gun and two knives believed to have been used 
in the attacks, according to Palmer and other detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The secret is we have citizens who really care about their community, and 
officers who really want to work with us," said volunteer Michele Doubet, who 
said she and about 40 other volunteers have helped police arrest dozens of 
suspects on a variety of charges in the past two years. "We have formed a very 
successful partnership." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of striking similarities to cases last summer, authorities at first 
were suspicious that the attacks were the work of members of the same organized 
gang, but later discounted that theory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first attack, at 9 p.m. on July 1, two men snuck up on a 22-year-old 
female and her 23-year-old male companion while they were sitting on swings in 
the park's playground area, according to police. The female victim was dragged 
into some bushes at gunpoint by one of the suspects and sexually assaulted 
while the other suspect tied up the male victim and robbed him at knifepoint, 
police said. The suspects then switched places and the second man sexually 
assaulted the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 6, a second, nearly identical attack occurred nearby just before 10 
p.m. Police said the same two suspects were responsible, based on 
circumstantial evidence. By the next night, officers were out in force in the 
park and arrested the two suspects the night of July 9 after they allegedly 
approached another couple, who fled and alerted plainclothes officers to watch 
out for men hiding in the bushes, Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two suspects were arrested an hour later when police blinded them with 
high-powered flashlights and grabbed their weapons. Although the gun they 
recovered was plastic, authorities said it was the same one used to scare the 
victims in the two earlier cases. "The victims believed that the gun was real," 
said Detective Debra Kirk, one of the undercover officers who arrested the 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, West Valley residents were warned to stay away from parks after 
several women were raped, some while male companions were tied up and robbed 
nearby. Four transients were arrested and pleaded guilty to various charges 
three months ago, leading to a 45-year prison sentence for the alleged 
ringleader. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one robbery occurred in Chatsworth Park North, when two women were 
robbed by two men but fended off sexual assaults by screaming. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (cases) are remarkably similar, but we haven't established a relation 
between the cases or the suspects . . . " Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like they are in the same gang or anything. We don't have anything 
to indicate they are even in a gang. But it got our attention right away. 
Because of last year, we recognized that we could have a problem."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: NEW MAGNET SCHOOLS PREPARE FOR STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There is nothing lazy about the days of summer for the San Fernando Valley's 
newest magnet schools. 
</P>
<P>
 With less than two months until their doors open, administrators at many of 
the 10 magnets are scrambling to recruit students, hire teachers and rearrange 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 From Canoga Park to Sylmar, teachers and coordinators are working overtime to 
pin down curriculum plans, install computer systems and set up offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had some 50- and 60-hour weeks already," said Steve Pietrolungo, 
coordinator of Canoga Park High School's environmental and agricultural 
sciences magnet, "but we knew we had our work cut out for us." 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the Los Angeles school board approved redirection of student 
integration funds, giving the hurry-up and go-ahead to 24 new magnet schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval came too late for the new schools to be included on districtwide 
magnet brochures. To make up for the loss of potential advertising, some 
coordinators are recruiting students from waiting lists of existing magnets and 
sending out their own brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're playing catch-up a little bit," said Richard Battaglia), the 
district's magnet specialist. "It's a Herculean task." 
</P>
<P>
 The May approval created about 13,500 new magnet openings, but there were only 
about 3,000 applications for the new schools by the June deadline, Battaglia 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials say they are not concerned.  
</P>
<P>
 There were about 40,000 applications for existing magnets, leaving many 
schools with waiting lists hundreds of students long. Many students on waiting 
lists will probably agree to switch to the new magnets, Battaglia said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sylmar High School, Debbie Steinert, coordinator of the new 
math-science-technology magnet, said she has only filled about one-third of the 
180 spaces allotted.  
</P>
<P>
 Steinert said the task of finding students took a temporary back seat to 
hiring teachers and purchasing supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not concerned. It's just a matter of getting down to it," Steinert said. 
"But it's a real crunch."  
</P>
<P>
 The new Valley magnet schools are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gledhill Elementary: math-science-technology 
</P>
<P>
 * Haskell Elementary: math-science-technology 
</P>
<P>
 * Holmes Middle School: international humanities 
</P>
<P>
 * Millikan Middle School: performing arts 
</P>
<P>
 * Birmingham High School: journalism technology 
</P>
<P>
 * Canoga Park High School: environmental/agricultural sciences 
</P>
<P>
 * Grant High School: communication technology 
</P>
<P>
 * Polytechnic High School: math-science-technology 
</P>
<P>
 * Reseda High School: environmental/physical sciences 
</P>
<P>
 * Sylmar High School: math-science-technology SUSAN BYRNES

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; RED CROSS OFFERS FREE QUAKE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles chapter of the American Red Cross is offering some free advice 
to remind the public about the upcoming six-month anniversary of the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hardly ever do these for free," said Red Cross spokeswoman Carol Miller 
about the "Earthquake Preparedness Day" planned Saturday at the Red Cross 
Service Center, 14717 Sherman Way, Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Jan. 17 earthquake forced many residents to take earthquakes more 
seriously and requests for preparedness brochures jumped after major 
aftershocks, interest in being prepared for the next disaster can wane, said 
Red Cross officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization hopes Saturday's event will help raise awareness, with three 
presentations of "Living on the Fault Line," a two-hour program that includes 
slides and lectures on how to put together an earthquake preparedness kit, bolt 
photos and pictures to walls and take other steps. The program will be shown at 
9 a.m., noon and at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Before each presentation, there will be a puppet show geared to help small 
children understand more about earthquakes, how to be prepared, what to do and 
how to help them deal with the fear and other emotions from earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be a family day," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, such presentations are given to companies at a charge, but the Red 
Cross wanted to offer one to the public for free to raise awareness because of 
the six-month anniversary of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The presentations also cover what to do when an earthquake hits when you are 
at home, at work or in an automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is part of a three-day quake anniversary observance by the 
Earthquake Response Volunteer Network, a group of 12 local agencies that helps 
earthquake victims and communities get ready for the next quake. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CONEJO VALLEY; COUNCIL APPROVES 220-HOUSE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bucking dire warnings from local, state and federal environmentalists, a 
majority of Thousand Oaks City Council members early Wednesday approved a 
220-house project that will partially block a major wildlife corridor in the 
western Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The luxury houses, to be built in a gated community north of Potrero Road on 
Dos Vientos Ranch, will limit animals roaming through the backcountry to a 
steep, rocky grade instead of a meadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Before approving the project, the council had to vote on a "statement of 
overriding considerations" indicating for the record that they understood the 
"unavoidable adverse" effects on wildlife but deemed the project worthwhile and 
beneficial nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision, on a 3-2 vote, brought sharp criticism from a parade of two 
dozen speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The National Park Service is convinced that the magnitude of environmental 
and ecological destruction is not justified," ranger Tony Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction will cut into only one-third of the 3-mile-wide swath 
recognized as a wildlife movement corridor. But experts said the affected mile 
represents the most convenient path for many animals wandering through Dos 
Vientos to the chaparral-cloaked wilderness beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the basic tenets of the National Park Service is preservation of the 
values and ambience (of the Santa Monica Mountains)," Gross said. "The Dos 
Vientos project, as proposed, is not compatible with those values." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 110 people attending the four-hour hearing, which ended early 
Wednesday morning, saw the project's importance primarily in negative terms. 
They urged the council to consider canceling the contract guaranteeing the 
developers an additional 2,130 houses on the Dos Vientos Ranch in later phases 
of the project, in light of new information about environmental impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Humans as well as animals could suffer when the project is built, as the new 
homes will increase air pollution, noise and traffic, according to a 
city-approved environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 But developers Operating Engineers and another Dos Vientos developer, Courtly 
Homes, said the project will benefit the city and pointed out that they have 
preserved 1,000 acres of the most sensitive land as open space and made other 
concessions to environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers will pay the city a total of $12.6 million for the right to 
build up to 2,350 houses on the ranch, under a contract negotiated with the 
council four years ago. Both developers will also pay substantial fees for 
parks, schools, road work and air quality control. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; GARAGE SALE TO HELP FORM BUSINESS WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of criticizing ill-kept businesses for luring criminals to their 
neighborhoods, a group of Van Nuys residents will each take a little something 
from their own homes to keep crime away from local merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 A garage sale by a coalition of Neighborhood Watch groups called the Guardian 
Eyes of Van Nuys is expected to raise funds to create a new Business Watch in 
the city's leading area for reported rapes.The sale will be held from 8 a.m. to 
6 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at 15242 Covello St., Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale will raise funds for the year-old Neighborhood Watch group and help 
pay start-up costs, including a newsletter, for the Business Watch proposed by 
Leslie Bashaar, a local real estate agent and activist for the Guardian Eyes, 
which represents about 1,200 homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Bashaar said the new Business Watch would be located between Saticoy and 
Raymer streets and Van Nuys and Sepulveda boulevards. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: MISSION HILLS; MAN DENIES GUILT IN POLICE RECORDS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a Mission Hills private investigation firm pleaded not guilty 
Wednesday to charges of receiving confidential information from a Los Angeles 
police officer, a prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Whiteaker of Whiteaker Investigative Services was arraigned in Los 
Angeles Municipal Court on 10 counts of receiving confidential criminal records 
and one count of conspiracy to receive criminal history materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Whiteaker and retired Los Angeles Deputy Police Chief Daniel R. Sullivan are 
accused of receiving confidential information from Walter Ray Bentley Jr., a 
police officer who resigned from the force after being arrested on child 
pornography charges last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing has been set Aug. 10 for Whiteaker, who has filed a motion asking 
the court to order the return of a computer, three guns and about 35 files that 
authorities seized during a search of his office, Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan 
Yokelson said. A pretrial hearing was set for Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Yokelson, who is prosecuting the three men, alleged that Whiteaker was given 
information about a murder witness relocated for protection, and information on 
actor Todd Bridges, who has had run-ins with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan pleaded not guilty last month to the same charges facing Whiteaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentley pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of illegally accessing department 
computers to obtain confidential information. A preliminary hearing for Bentley 
is scheduled for Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers may access the department's computer to retrieve information, but 
they are required to sign a pledge not to misuse their privileges. Computer 
records include information about arrests that never resulted in a charge, and 
therefore are not public information. JULIE TAMAKI

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; ABUSED WOMEN FIND PURPOSE THROUGH POETRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, as she was pushed, shoved and beaten by her husband until bruises 
covered her entire body, Kim Norgaard didn't say a word.  
</P>
<P>
 Even when she was hospitalized with a broken tailbone after being slammed into 
the wooden armrest of a couch, she told doctors she had fallen down. But in the 
year since fleeing to Haven Hills, the San Fernando Valley's only battered 
women's shelter, with her two young children, the 25-year-old has found her 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
 And this week, Norgaard and five survivors of domestic abuse gathered at a 
poetry reading in Van Nuys to encourage other women to find theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives a purpose to what I went through," said Norgaard of Canoga Park 
after reading several poems to about two dozen people at the Valley Hospital 
Medical Center. "It gives me a sense of power and control." 
</P>
<P>
 In recognition of the nationwide focus on domestic abuse and the surge in 
calls to its hot line in the weeks since Nicole Simpson's death, Haven Hills 
held the community forum this week and scheduled another one for early August. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past few weeks, an unbelievable sequence of events has brought 
domestic violence attention and focus," said Betty Fisher, executive director 
of Haven Hills. "It came at a very high price for Nicole Simpson and Ronald 
Goldman. But it has made many women face the reality of what their lives are." 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to the shelter's hot line have nearly doubled in the last month, 
according to Fisher. Many of the calls came on the heels of the television 
airing of 911 tapes of Nicole Simpson reporting domestic abuse.  
</P>
<P>
 "Women identified with those calls and the voice on the tapes," Fisher said. 
"They recognized the feeling, the words, the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, dedicating the evening to the memory of Nicole Simpson, five women 
read from the book, "Finding Our Voices: Speaking Out Against the Violence," a 
compilation of poetry on domestic violence put together by Jae Levine Weiss, 
one of the counselors at Haven Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a way to be vocal, a way to find power," said Weiss, 42, of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss, who was beaten repeatedly during eight years of marriage until she 
finally fled with her 14-year-old son to Haven Hills, has used writing in the 
eight years since her escape as a tool for her own healing as well as to 
encourage other women to articulate their emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the session, Weiss dedicated one of her poems to Nicole Simpson 
and Ronald Goldman. "Let's say a prayer for those of us whose lost lives' 
flames were extinguished by brutality," she read, ". . . and celebrate the 
essence of what they might have been had they survived." 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter will present another community forum at the Valley Hospital 
Medical Center, 14500 Sherman Circle, at 7 p.m. Aug. 4. SUSAN BYRNES

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; POLICE OFFER TO TRADE SEIZED LUXURY CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mercedes and Porsches may be the automobiles that define the lifestyle of the 
California elite, but Glendale police have no use for such cars, which were 
among their trophies for bringing down the San Fernando Valley-based drug 
empire known as the Monkey Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "These vehicles are too exotic for use in our fleet," said Lt. Don MacNeil, 
who oversaw the investigation that brought down the Monkey Boys organization 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale police acquired about half a dozen luxury vehicles from the 
organization early this year, just before the state law that allowed law 
enforcement to seize the assets of drug dealers expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the department is trying to find a car dealer willing to make an exchange 
for automobiles of comparable price that are more suited to police work. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars confiscated include a 1978 Porsche 911, a 1974 Porsche 930, a 1992 
Volkswagen Cabriolet, a 1991 Mercedes 500SL and a Sea-Doo personal water-craft 
(jet ski) with a trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Glendale City Council authorized police to solicit potential 
swaps. Advertisements for bids started this week and a bid opening is scheduled 
for Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monkey Boys, so named by police for the way dealers mimicked each other's 
free-spending ways, was a drug ring that authorities believe reached into 
Europe and Japan. After a two-year investigation, police broke up the ring.  
</P>
<P>
 Five alleged ring leaders are awaiting trial, while three others have pleaded 
guilty to lesser charges. More than 30 Monkey Boys have been convicted or 
charged with crimes related to the drug dealing, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the vehicles seized by police are up for exchange. A white stretch 
limousine and a Nissan Pathfinder both had to be returned to the lien holder. 
Police also chose to put a heavy-duty Chevrolet pickup truck into service as an 
equipment vehicle for the police heliport at Burbank Airport, MacNeil said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickup truck, now painted in police black and white, can sometimes be seen 
on the Golden State Freeway on its route between Glendale and Burbank Airport, 
MacNeil said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Glendale police had an exotic car for exchange was in 1991, when 
more than 1,000 people vied to trade for an $80,000 Ferrari. The automobile was 
eventually traded for five plain-vanilla, mid-sized American cars. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; MAN DIES IN FIRE AT APARTMENT UNIT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An unidentified Mexican national who was staying with a friend died early 
Wednesday when flames that may have been ignited by a smoldering cigarette 
engulfed a second-floor Glendale apartment, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, whose name will not be released until family members are notified, 
was watching television in the living room shortly before 4 a.m. when the fire 
began in the bedroom of the apartment in the 1400 block of East Maple Street, 
said Officer Rodney Brooks of the Glendale Police Department.The victim and his 
friend, who had been asleep, tried twice to douse the flames with buckets of 
water before the friend decided to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Let's get out of here!' a couple of times to the victim," Brooks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend, whose name was not released, escaped from the apartment down a 
back staircase, believing the victim was behind him, Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't realize his friend didn't get out until they found his body inside 
the apartment," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend was treated at a local hospital for a burn to his foot and smoke 
inhalation, Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire caused an estimated $90,000 damage to the apartment and its contents, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 It took nine firefighters about 10 minutes to extinguish the blaze, Brooks 
said. CHIP JOHNSON

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; COUNCIL DECLINES TO OPPOSE PIPELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Burbank City Council has declined to oppose a major pipeline through the 
city, despite a dire warning from the fire chief that the $150-million project 
has the potential to become an "environmental catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
 A resolution opposing the 129-mile Pacific Pipeline was pulled off the consent 
agenda Tuesday, after representatives of the firm proposing the project asked 
for further talks on the topic. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opposition to this still stands," Fire Chief Michael Davis said Wednesday. 
"I will oppose it vigorously." 
</P>
<P>
 The planned underground pipeline would transport crude oil from Santa Barbara 
County and the San Joaquin Valley to refineries in Wilmington and El Segundo, 
passing through cities such as San Fernando, Burbank and Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Pipeline System, Inc., the Burbank-based company handling the project, 
faces mounting concerns from city officials and residents along the proposed 
route. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city officials adopted a resolution last year opposing the plan. 
The Glendale Fire Department is drafting a similar resolution to present soon 
to the Glendale City Council. And in East Los Angeles, residents and activists 
belonging to the Coalition Against the Pipeline have said they would sue to 
stop the project if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the Burbank City Council, Davis warned that the Pacific 
Pipeline has the potential to become an "environmental catastrophe" in the 
event of a rupture during an earthquake, train derailment or other type of 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution presented Tuesday opposes the pipeline unless more safety 
measures are taken. Whether the resolution will be considered again by the 
Burbank City Council won't be determined until at least January, after an 
updated environmental impact report on the project is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got testimony indicating additional information that the proponents could 
provide that could alleviate the fire chief's concerns," Vice Mayor Dave 
Golonski said. "If that's not the case, the council would back the fire chief 
and oppose this project." 
</P>
<P>
 The project's planners say the Pacific Pipeline is the safest and cleanest way 
to transport crude oil. Construction is set to begin late next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a core of people who oppose any new project," said Charles McLean of 
Pacific Pipeline Systems. "Anything to do with crude oil is criticized." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say the underground pipeline -- a portion of which will parallel 
Southern Pacific Railroad's right of way in Burbank -- is full of unforeseen 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "New pipelines have better leak-detection systems, but there's no 100% 
guarantee there will not be an accident or some sort of release," said Linda 
Krop, acting chief counsel for the Environmental Defense Center in Santa 
Barbara. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

WOMAN SEEKS RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST SINGER ROTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest twist to a bizarre, five-year courtroom battle, a Burbank woman 
is seeking a restraining order against rock singer David Lee Roth, alleging 
that he made sexual references to her in the lyrics to his songs. 
</P>
<P>
 The former lead singer of the rock group Van Halen stated that he has never 
met Deborah Ruth Davidsohn and is the victim of an obsessive fan who has 
alternately posed as his fiancee and his agent, ordering thousands of dollars 
in merchandise under his name, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth was unavailable for comment Wednesday. He is scheduled to arrive in 
Denver today and will be on tour for the next two months, a spokesman for the 
entertainer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In her lawsuit, Davidsohn claims to have had a seven-year relationship with 
Roth in which he telephoned her constantly, destroyed belongings such as her 
family photos and made her the subject of one of his songs, "Yankee Rose." 
</P>
<P>
 She described herself as a recovering alcoholic who first met Roth at the age 
of 16. "I have suffered Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and it appears he is 
doing everything in his power to see to it that I don't get well," Davidsohn 
stated in her complaint. "He continues to write sexually harrassing songs about 
me and other women." 
</P>
<P>
 According to court files, Roth's attorney, Richard A. Friedman, has produced 
several letters written by Davidsohn, including an invitation announcing their 
supposed wedding and a sexually explicit missive about Roth. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Roth successfully petitioned for a three-year restraining order 
against Davidsohn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other than the fact that a restraining order was obtained against her in 
1989, which she violated and was subsequently jailed for, we have no further 
comment," Roth's public relations firm, Levine/Schneider, said in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Davidsohn also sought an order against the rock star, but was 
unsuccessful. Her second and current lawsuit against Roth, filed on June 27, is 
scheduled for a hearing Friday in Superior Court in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 In it she asks, in part, that Roth be restrained from releasing songs with 
lyrics about her.

3 CONVICTS IN LYE MURDER CASE TAKE STAND; COURT: AT RETRIAL OF RICARDO H. 
ROBINSON, DEFENDANT QUESTIONS TWO OTHER MEN BROUGHT FROM STATE PRISON TO 
TESTIFY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was an odd setting for a reunion, and there was no love lost among the 
participants, but three men convicted of murder in the fatal 1980 lye attack of 
an aspiring lawyer took turns on the witness stand in a Van Nuys courtroom on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 They wore colored jail jumpsuits of different hues. Defendant Ricardo H. 
Robinson, representing himself, posed questions to the others who had been 
brought from state prison to testify, one to clear him, one to implicate him. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Robinson took the witness stand and denied playing any part in the scheme 
to disfigure law student Patricia Worrell. 
</P>
<P>
 So went another day at the retrial of Robinson, the only member of the alleged 
plot to successfully appeal his 1982 conviction for murdering Worrell, who died 
of her injuries 14 years ago. Robinson confessed, but an appeals court 
overturned his conviction, voided the confession and ordered a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying for the prosecution was former Las Vegas pimp Bobby Ray Savage, who 
recanted all his previous denials, admitted his role in the crime for the first 
time, and also pointed an accusing finger at Robinson. He testified that he saw 
Robinson knock on the door of Worrell's Sylmar home on Aug. 14, 1980, and throw 
lye at her. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell, who was blinded and disfigured by the caustic chemical, died 10 days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing for the defense was the other co-conspirator, Richard Morton Gilman, 
the victim's fellow law student and jilted fiance and the man convicted of 
orchestrating the lye attack. He denied any involvement, and testified he had 
never met Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never hired Bobby Ray Savage to do anything to Patricia Worrell, never," 
Gilman testified.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked by prosecutor Robert L. Cohen if he felt wrongly imprisoned, Gilman said 
again: "After 14 years, I think it is irrelevant at this point. When you're in 
the real world of prison, you accept where you're at." 
</P>
<P>
 While Gilman was not the most enthusiastic defense witness in the courthouse, 
Savage had balked outright at testifying for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had refused to testify Tuesday, he had a change of heart and took 
the witness stand Wednesday morning. He said he felt he had to do the right 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned out to be a star witness for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 When he met Robinson during the summer of 1980, Savage testified, he was a 
pimp and worked part time as a skip tracer for a bail bondsman. One of his 
prostitutes, Kim Bricker, said one of her clients needed somebody to assault a 
woman in Los Angeles. He met Gilman, who offered him $1,500 for the job and 
paid $750 up front. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson had asked him for help getting "an 'in' in Vegas," Savage said. So, 
he offered him the "job" he had agreed to do for Gilman.  
</P>
<P>
 The two men planned the attack, and purchased the lye at a supermarket in Las 
Vegas, mixing the crystals with water in a glass jar. Robinson got a rental car 
and they drove together to Los Angeles, Savage testified. 
</P>
<P>
 It was dark when they arrived at the address in Sylmar that Gilman had given 
them, he testified. According to the plan, Gilman was inside playing cards with 
Worrell. Savage said he turned on the headlights of Worrell's car, as planned, 
while Robinson went to the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rick was knocking at the door and somebody came to the door and I seen him 
toss the stuff," Savage testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who is representing himself, conducted cross-examination that 
resulted in some rather personal exchanges between witness and defense counsel. 
For example: 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson: "Who threw the stuff at Miss Worrell?" 
</P>
<P>
 Savage: "You did . . . . We were both there, Rick, and we both know what 
happened . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson: "Mr. Savage, you set me up to take the fall for this crime, didn't 
you, sir?" 
</P>
<P>
 Savage: "How could I set you up when I'm doing a life sentence?" 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson: "You know you didn't tell me (about the lye attack) until we were in 
the car, on the way back?" 
</P>
<P>
 Savage: "You know that's a lie, Rick . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 As Robinson continued to question Savage, the witness interrupted him, and got 
to the point: "I'm not an angel, Rick. We both know that."

POLICE, SECURITY FIRMS CLASH OVER FALSE ALARMS; CRIME: COUNCIL POSTPONES VOTE 
ON PROPOSAL TO REDUCE RESPONSE TO UNVERIFIED BREAK-IN SIGNALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police and the security alarm industry, longtime partners in the war against 
crime, clashed at a Los Angeles City Council meeting Wednesday during a debate 
over a proposal to reduce false alarm calls to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal by Councilman Marvin Braude, police would not respond to an 
automated alarm call until a break-in is verified by a building occupant or by 
the alarm company, via a security guard or video surveillance cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the alarm industry said the cost of adding such guards and 
cameras to all systems would make them too expensive for many businesses. And 
without alarms, insurance rates would soar, they argued. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't let this ordinance be the proverbial door that hits business on the way 
out," Robert Garrison, a regional manager for an international alarm firm, told 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Los Angeles Police Department supports Braude's proposal, saying that 
95% of the 161,000 alarm calls made last year were false and accounted for 18% 
of all calls for police service.

 "False alarm calls are a major drain on police resources that are already 
limited," said a police commission study submitted to the council. "The alarm 
monitoring companies should be required to provide some confirmation of the 
actual need for police." 
</P>
<P>
 After more than an hour of sometimes heated debate, the council voted to 
postpone a decision on the proposal, pending further study by the council's 
Public Safety Committee. The panel will consider it July 25. 
</P>
<P>
 While both sides agreed that false alarms are a drain on police services, most 
council members said they would not support a measure that allows police to 
ignore those security alarm calls that are not verified. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who was seriously injured by an intruder in her 
Venice home just prior to her 1987 election, said police response to all alarm 
calls is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it ever happens to me again, I want to know that when I hit that button, 
someone hits the road," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick, who first focused attention on the problem of false 
alarms several months ago by proposing stiffer fines for such calls, chastised 
the alarm industry for promising to work with the city to reduce false alarms 
while supporting state legislation that would make it harder for the city to 
collect such fines. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which will be heard by a Senate appropriations committee next month, 
would prohibit the city from charging a fine for a false alarm if police fail 
to answer the call within 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This demonstrates your unique ability to talk out of both sides of your 
mouth," Chick said, looking out at a group of about two dozen industry 
representatives in the council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Detective Jack Hosford told the council that the bill works on the same 
premise as the guarantee delivery policy of some pizza businesses: "If we don't 
get to it within 30 minutes, it's free." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the average police response to alarm calls in Los Angeles is 55 
minutes, the law would drastically cut the city's ability to collect false 
alarm fees, which totaled $2.5 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The city currently issues an $80 fine on each false alarm after the fourth 
such call within a 12-month period, regardless of how long it takes police to 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Police spent $8.5 million last year in service hours responding to 161,000 
security alarm calls, the report said. During the same period, the city 
collected about $5.7 million in revenues from alarm system permits and false 
alarms fines, leaving a deficit of $2.8 million, according to the police 
report.

TV HOST'S CONDITION UPGRADED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Television game show host Ray Combs was able to move his toes and flex his 
hands Wednesday, two days after he was temporarily paralyzed in a traffic 
collision on the Ventura Freeway, his agent reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Combs, 38, host of "The New Family Feud" for six years, suffered a swollen 
spinal disk in the accident, which doctors believed caused the paralysis, said 
Irv Schwartz, Comb's agent. 
</P>
<P>
 His condition was upgraded from serious to fair at St. Joseph's Medical Center 
in Burbank, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Combs was expected to be transferred from the intensive care ward to a 
rehabilitation unit to begin physical therapy, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ray is doing much better today," Schwartz said in a prepared statement issued 
Wednesday. "The hospital physicians have said that the prognosis is very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Combs was driving west on the Ventura Freeway Monday afternoon when his car 
was sideswiped by a speeding vehicle, and then rear-ended by another vehicle, 
his agent said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Mayfield, a motorcycle officer with the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Valley Traffic Division, said he administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to 
revive Combs at the scene of the accident.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COUNCIL MAY SUE OVER SHOPPING CENTER; SANTA 
CLARITA: COUNTY APPROVAL OF THE HUGE PROJECT HAS UPSET CITY OFFICIALS, WHO SAY 
IT WILL HURT LOCAL MERCHANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council may sue Los Angeles County supervisors for approving a 
mammoth shopping center just outside city limits, fearing it will harm small 
businesses, adversely impact city services and divert sales tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted 5 to 0 Tuesday night for the city attorney and staff 
members to review the county Board of Supervisors' July 7 approval of the 
Valencia Marketplace. The council is concerned the county hasn't enforced the 
Development Monitoring System that is supposed to help public services keep up 
with new construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to take this to court and say we need more out of this development," 
said Councilwoman Jan Heidt. "Are we going to stand up for small businesses 
that made this city?" 
</P>
<P>
 Planned by the Brentwood-based Riley/Pearlman/Mitchell Co., Valencia 
Marketplace will be west of the Golden State Freeway, between McBean Parkway 
and Pico Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called "power center" includes 830,000 square feet of retail space, 
with large discount stores and about 35 smaller retail shops and restaurants. 
It will be the largest shopping mall in the Santa Clarita Valley and is 
expected to generate up to $3 million annually in sales tax and property tax 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidt, who owns a small bookstore in Santa Clarita's Newhall community, had 
sharp words about the center and what she characterized as a lack of support 
for local merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small businesses don't have any other rabbits to pull out of their hat (to 
survive)," she said. "How much can 150,000 people buy? And how much sales tax 
will this drain from the city?" 
</P>
<P>
 Heidt's concerns were echoed by the handful of residents who addressed the 
council Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no doubt a revenue bomb, ticking since the city was planned," said 
Allan Cameron, a local activist. "If you were to spend $1 million litigating 
this project, you would make it up in four months. That is how important this 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 "To stand by and let this Valencia Marketplace be built is almost economic 
suicide," said resident John Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita's review will focus on the Development Monitoring System, a 
mechanism the county uses to make sure roads, schools and other public services 
keep up with development in high-growth areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the DMS should require the Valencia Marketplace to better offset 
its impact on traffic and law enforcement. Santa Clarita unsuccessfully asked 
the county for 80% of the shopping center's tax revenue to pay for 
infrastructure improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidt called for immediate legal action, but other council members wanted 
first to check the center's projected impact on the community and whether it 
violates the DMS. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fine to say 'The community is going to die' and 'This is going to mean 
the degradation of the community.' We have to be smart enough to evaluate . . . 
what that loss is going to be," said Councilman Clyde Smyth. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy, who is also a field deputy to Supervisor Michael 
Antonovich, said a large shopping center will provide jobs and bring customers 
into Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is going to be spillover," Darcy said. "They are going to eat here and 
buy their gas here." 
</P>
<P>
 "And rob and steal, too," Heidt responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Smyth also called for Santa Clarita's business groups to take a stand on the 
issue, asking why the chambers of commerce haven't announced their positions on 
the shopping center.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HELP SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY BODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County coroner's office is looking for help from the public to 
identify the body of a woman with two tattoos found last month in a field 
between Sierra Highway and 10th Street East, south of Avenue R, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her body was discovered June 22 by a young boy riding his bicycle, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since then, she has simply been known as Jane Doe No. 30," said Scott 
Carrier, a coroner's office spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical examiners believe the woman stood about 5 feet tall, weighed about 95 
pounds and had brown hair and brown eyes. She had two tattoos -- one of a rose 
or bunch of roses about 1 1/2 inches in length on the inside of the left ankle, 
the other of a peacock with a vulture-like head and flowing tail feathers just 
above her right shoulder blade, Carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 When she died, the woman was wearing black underwear, a multicolored halter 
top, blue jeans and tan and gold sandals that laced around her ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office has been unable to identify the woman because the body 
was decomposed, Carrier said. The cause of death has not been undetermined.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN STEALS $5,000 FROM AREA BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man stole about $5,000 from a bank Wednesday afternoon after showing the 
butt of a handgun to a bank teller, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery occurred at about 3:10 p.m. at the Wells Fargo Bank at 19310 
Soledad Canyon Road, said Sgt. Richard Lichten of the Santa Clarita Valley 
Sheriff's Station.He said the suspect remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
 The man walked into the bank, held up a white bag and demanded cash from a 
teller, according to a sheriff's report. He then displayed what appeared to be 
a blue steel handgun of unknown caliber in his waistband. 
</P>
<P>
 He drove away from the bank in a black Volkswagen Jetta and was last seen 
driving south over the Whites Canyon Road bridge behind the bank, Lichten said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect may be the same man who committed a similar robbery at the bank 
about a month ago, according to sheriff's officials. But they emphasized that 
further investigation is needed.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY TO HIRE 15 DISPLACED WORKERS FOR QUAKE 
REPAIR; LABOR: THE YOUNG ADULTS WILL BE PROVIDED THROUGH THE CCC FOR THE 
SIX-MONTH SANTA CLARITA PROGRAM, WHICH STARTS IN SEPTEMBER.

<P>
 Young adults displaced from jobs because of the Northridge earthquake will get 
a chance to work on local rebuilding projects while saving the city money, 
thanks to an emergency federal grant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita City Council unanimously voted Tuesday night to hire 15 
people through the California Conservation Corps to pick up debris and perform 
other repair work, said John Danielson, parks and recreation superintendent for 
the city. The CCC has about 85 people performing similar work in the San 
Fernando Valley, using a $2.2-million grant to fund the Northridge Earthquake 
Recovery Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said a crew from the San Fernando Valley has been doing some repairs 
here since last month. But Danielson said the city plans to hire local 
residents for its six-month program, which begins in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our long-term hope is to have a permanent CCC office, with a strong emphasis 
on job skills," he added. "The city feels very strongly that once they have 
finished their six-month cycle knowing not just how to push a broom, but (they) 
have another skill, such as recycling or building a wall." 
</P>
<P>
 The full-time workers will receive $7 an hour, compared to $4.25 an hour 
normally paid to CCC recruits, Danielson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervised crew will help remove tons of debris on streets and yards that 
could clog storm drains if left until winter storms wash it away, he said. 
Damaged sidewalks and curbs also need repair, and massive piles of concrete 
from wrecked roads and bridges need to be sorted into recyclable and disposable 
piles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A permanent CCC office would assign eligible workers hired by government 
agencies or private companies to various general labor tasks, Danielson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruits will be provided through the CCC, which obtains its information 
through the federal Employment and Development Department, said Juan Salazar, 
program administrator for the earthquake recovery program. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers must be between 18 and 26 years old and cannot be on probation or 
parole, Salazar said. He said applicants must have been unemployed for 15 of 
the past 26 weeks, or permanently displaced because of circumstances such as 
factory closure.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 200TH TOXIC WASTE TANK IS UNEARTHED AT BASE; 
ENVIRONMENT: MOST OF THE 512 RECEPTACLES AT EDWARDS DATE FROM WWII. MILITARY IS 
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.

 The 200th underground storage tank was removed from the ground here Wednesday 
as part of a program to eliminate the potentially hazardous tanks, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are through the hardest part," said Don Cowen, project manager for the 
Underground Storage Tanks program. "We have got the dirtiest tanks out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force is two years ahead of schedule in complying with state safety 
regulations requiring the removal of abandoned tanks and the replacement of 
underground tanks still in use with new double-layered tanks, Cowen said. The 
deadline for compliance is December, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no known blueprints locating the 512 tanks -- most of which were put 
there during World War II -- so officials used infrared scanners, radar 
detection and information from longtime military personnel to search out the 
tanks, Cowen said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the tank removal program has cost $3.1 million. The remaining cleanup 
will cost another $2.9 million, Cowen said.  
</P>
<P>
 At the base, workers in orange jumpsuits carefully measured the oxygen levels 
within the tank to ensure that there were no vapors that could cause an 
explosion before lifting the 12,000-gallon diesel fuel tank out of the ground 
with a crane. 
</P>
<P>
 "These can be very explosive things, if not handled right," Cowen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has had a perfect safety record thus far, Cowen said. Officials 
began removing the oldest tanks and those with possible contamination first. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes three days to remove one tank, Cowen said. Before each tank is 
removed, any remaining contents are extracted and the inside of the tank is 
triple rinsed with a special formula, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tank is then inspected for possible corrosion from the acid, solvents or 
gasoline it contained. If holes are found in the tank, the ground is evaluated 
for possible contamination and cleaned up. If no holes or contamination are 
found, the tank is loaded onto a truck and recycled or buried at a landfill, 
Cowen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 200th tank was installed in 1958 and was used to fuel trackers and 
trailers on the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowen said most tanks have a life span of 25 years and "the age of most of the 
tanks is the prime reason why we are moving so rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
 Cowen said Edwards has the largest inventory of tanks in the Air Force. The 
first tank was pulled from the ground in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most do not contaminate the ground, several underground tanks which 
contained heavy crude oil in the South Base of Edwards leaked the hazardous 
material at least 50 feet into the ground. Environmental officials said the 
hard clay ground kept the contaminants from seeping into the ground water 400 
feet underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulatory agencies such as the state Environmental Protection Agency have 
worked in conjunction with the Air Force, overseeing the cleanup of the 
underground tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force expects to keep at least 10 underground tanks in operation on 
the base.

SANDBAGGERS; ENDLESS SUMMERS, TIMELESS STYLES. IT'S BACK TO THE BEACH FOR THE 
FRANKIES AND ANNETTES OF THE '90S AS SURF GEAR GETS A RETRO REVIVAL IN BRIGHT 
COLORS AND TRIM FITS. 
</P>

<P>
 Maybe it's the weather. Maybe it's the recent release of "The Endless Summer 
II," the sequel to the classic 1964 surfing flick. Maybe it's the huge surfing 
contest soon to get underway in Huntington Beach. Whatever the reason, being a 
surfer in Southern California is cool again. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, surfing itself never went out of style. From a fashion standpoint, 
however, the grunge/street/skate crowd pulled attention away from the beach and 
left surfers in its wake. The baggy, dark clothing that's become the uniform of 
kids everywhere came primarily from the streets and the sidewalks, not the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 There are signs that surfing is again making waves in the beach 
lifestyle/fashion category. The renewed excitement surrounding surfing can be 
felt at Orange County's beach-oriented clothing companies such as Counter 
Culture, Billabong and Quiksilver. All have introduced this summer board shorts 
that have a nostalgic look. It's as if surfers are returning to their '60s 
heyday, to the glory of that original "Endless Summer." 
</P>
<P>
 "Surfing's rediscovering itself with 'Endless Summer II,' " says Eric Diamond, 
board short designer for Quiksilver in Costa Mesa. "It's going through a 
resurgence. We went through the street/skate thing. That pulled the emphasis 
away from just going surfing for the fun of it." 
</P>
<P>
 As a way to reclaim surfing's past, designers are reviving "really old looks," 
Diamond says. To this group, "old" means from about 1962 to the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Trunks with retro double stripes and '60s color combinations like brown with 
baby blue and murky green with orange are back. After several summers of dark 
solid board shorts, brighter colors and prints are returning. Funky Don Ho 
Hawaiian and tropical prints are being revived after a long hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the (board short) designers are drawing from their roots, from the 
older looks of the '60s and the original watermen," says Mike Schillmoeller, 
co-owner of Counter Culture in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Counter Culture's summer collection of board shorts draws heavily from the 
past. There are nylon satin board shorts with retro double stripes down the 
sides in combinations of teal and silver, black and green and dark blue and 
burgundy, as well as vintage tropical print board shorts in black and 
turquoise, black and khaki or olive and black nylon. The board shorts range 
from $37 to $39 at Huntington Surf and Sport in Huntington Beach, Newport Surf 
& Sport in Newport Beach and other specialty shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Stripes, bolder silk-screen logos and multistitching of seams and waistbands 
in contrasting thread all signal that surfers are moving away from the somber 
suits of summers past, according to Lian Murray, head of merchandising and 
design for Billabong in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are tired of dark, dreary things. In the past few years (trunks) have 
been very dark, subtle, low-key," Murray says. "Now we're going forward with a 
lot of brighter colors, especially in accents." 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of the extra detailing: Billabong's turquoise board short with white 
triple top stitching (about $34), or the '60s-inspired brown trunks with a sky 
blue double stripe around the waist ($40), both at Huntington Surf and Sport. 
Bright orange triple top stitching also lightens up a pair of Billabong board 
shorts in a psychedelic floral print of earthy hues ($37) at Newport Surf & 
Sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The retro-looking board shorts aren't exact copies of the originals; they're 
longer and slightly roomier than the '60s versions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very Frankie and Annette but in a new '90s body," Murray says. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray gets her ideas for board shorts by "going down to the beach, watching 
movies, hanging out and listening to music." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just like surfers," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 At Counter Culture, it's not uncommon to see wet suits drying out in front of 
the company's headquarters. Schillmoeller and his fellow workers surf every 
morning "if there's any sign of waves." 
</P>
<P>
 Since starting up in a garage in May 1991, Schillmoeller and his partner Pat 
Fraley have turned Counter Culture into a beach lifestyle manufacturer with 300 
retailers that carry the line nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillmoeller expects business to get better and better, thanks to several 
factors focusing more attention on surfing. The 13th annual OP Pro July 26-31 
and U.S. Open of Surfing Aug. 2-7 that take place on the south side of the 
Huntington Beach pier will attract a lot of attention to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be the biggest surfing contest in the world," Schillmoeller says. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest, along with the economy, the weather and "Endless Summer II" have 
all conspired to promote "the Southern California dream lifestyle," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't enjoy this lifestyle, where's the fun?" he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Quiksilver's Diamond also lives the lifestyle, surfing every morning and 
traveling to Hawaii and Australia. That's how he knows what surfers want to 
wear in the water: 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting back to true function. For a while things were too oversized," 
Diamond says. "You don't need a huge trunk to surf in. Once it gets down around 
the knees you're just dragging a lot of water around." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Quiksilver's offerings for summer '94 at Huntington Surf and Sport: a 
brown and chartreuse board short with an asymmetrical black and white double 
stripe across the front ($42), or a brown trunk with gold crisscross stripes 
down the sides ($42), also available in navy and burgundy stripes and black 
with green stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pure surf," Diamond says.

BORN TO BE WILD . . .; . . . OR DRESS THAT WAY; O.C. HARLEY-DAVIDSON RIDES 
CREST OF BIKER MANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 R ay Malzo bought Orange County Harley-Davidson in Santa Ana five years ago 
because he thought it could be lucrative. Not long after, the urban biker fad 
took off, and Malzo found himself in Hog heaven.  
</P>
<P>
 Not only have yuppies discovered motorcycles in the past half decade; 
Harley-Davidson has aggressively grabbed a share of the "motor clothes" market. 
The trend worked well for Malzo -- he claims logo-ed clothing and accessories 
account for $1 million of his $8-million-a-year business.  
</P>
<P>
 "People want the motorcycle look even if they don't want or can't afford to 
ride," Malzo says.  
</P>
<P>
 People who buy Harleys are also buying a lifestyle that includes clothing and 
the chance to meet a diverse group of people. With a Harley, you don't ride 
alone; you're constantly meeting people from all walks of life. You see a guy 
at Cook's Corner in Trabuco Canyon, and you don't know if he's a CEO or a 
plumber. That's the release for the people who ride; they get to take a break 
from their real life. 
</P>
<P>
 The mystique of Harley-Davidson is you don't know if a guy wearing leather 
chaps is a cyclist or someone just dressing the part.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Harley saw there was a niche to be filled with motor clothes that 
offered protection and fashion. Now there's everything from gauntlet gloves to 
designer helmets painted to match the motorcycle's paint scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 24 different styles of jackets for men and women, everything from 
the traditional James Dean-type motorcycle jackets to the tapered French motif 
with braided epaulets and shoulder pads.  
</P>
<P>
 Intersport Fashions West in Orange designs a lot of the Harley-Davidson 
jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 All are made of durable riding leather. You can buy a leather jacket at 
Nordstrom for the same price -- $200 to $500 -- but it may be made of lambskin, 
and, if you have an accident, you'll get road rash; the leather gets peeled 
back or scraped or scarred. Harley-Davidson leather becomes a protectant. 
</P>
<P>
 Zippers on the jacket's sleeves, pockets and the back are fashionable and 
functional. They look good and they keep things in your pocket from falling out 
from the vibrations of the motorcycle and wind. Zipped-up zippers on sleeves 
keep the wind out when it's cold and serve as vents when opened on a warm day. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the apparel has a logo, either the original one with a bar and shield 
that says "Motor" on the top and "Cycle" on the bottom and "Harley-Davidson" in 
the middle, or the classic one with the American eagle on it, which I think 
stands for "freedom." The logo is stamped subtly on buttons or zippers, 
embroidered on the back or filled with silicon as if embossed. Doc Harley 
construction boots have the logo at the ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 We sell 300 to 400 T-shirts a week. Tourists want to buy a T-shirt from every 
Harley outlet, just like they do for the Hard Rock Cafe shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter of our business is women's motorcycles and clothes. Women don't fear 
entering a dealership anymore because our shop looks like Nordstrom, not a 
greasy hole in the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Clothing for women covers both bases: It's functional and sexy. It comes in 
leather and Lycra; the leather protects and the Lyra fits tight around the 
back. Most are black, but they've also expanded into browns and an orange/black 
combination. Black clothes are the sexiest.  
</P>
<P>
 Some pants unzip at the knees and become shorts to be worn with a matching 
vest and jacket, and there is a see-through bodysuit that has silhouettes of 
motorcycles on sheer fabric. Women wear it with a black bra underneath and 
shorts or jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Men buy the clothes as gifts for their wives and girlfriends, and they love 
it. After getting over being initially afraid to ride on the back of a 
motorcycle, ladies prefer to have their own motorcycles because they'd rather 
be in control. 
</P>
<P>
 The men who ride are different than they were in the '50s and '60s. They're 
more upscale, probably because the motorcycles are pricey -- a basic one 
averages $15,000 -- and there's limited production -- there will only be 90,000 
Harleys made next year worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been an enthusiast since my 20s, and when I ride I wear mostly Biker 
Blues, denim jeans with a functional boot cut and relaxed fit that gives me 
more room in the rise so when I'm straddling the motorcycle I don't feel 
cramped.

SEARCH ABANDONED FOR OTHER VICTIMS OF SUNKEN BOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coast Guard investigators said Wednesday that a third man was believed to be 
aboard a commercial fishing boat that apparently sank in a busy shipping lane 
10 miles off Newport Beach, killing two others. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescuers gave up a daylong hunt for the boat and any other victims Tuesday 
night after recovering two bodies amid a trail of debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities on Wednesday identified one of the men as Nhieu Van Nguyen, 52, a 
licensed commercial fisherman from San Gabriel. Relatives of the other victim, 
identified earlier as Khanh Nguyen, 50, of Alhambra, told investigators that he 
had left home on a fishing outing late Monday night with a friend they did not 
identify. The two victims were not related. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard Petty Officer James Bride said the missing man, identified as Cong 
Minh Ta, 54, of San Gabriel, was the owner of the vessel that apparently sank, 
a 45-foot commercial fishing boat named Tammy that was based at Fish Harbor on 
Terminal Island.  
</P>
<P>
 Some who took part in the search said the busy harbor is home to a large 
number of fishing boats that have little navigational equipment and are poorly 
lighted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us who work the area said it's probably a Fish Harbor boat," said 
Lt. John Lorentzen, who commands a Los Angeles County lifeguard boat used in 
the search. 
</P>
<P>
 Bride said Ta's son contacted the Coast Guard on Wednesday morning to report 
that his father had not returned from his fishing trip. Investigators called 
Ta's fish buyer, confirming the boat had not arrived and that at least one of 
the men whose bodies were found had been aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The fish buyer, Hoang Ha of Monterey Park, said Wednesday night that he had 
warned Nhieu Nguyen against letting the boat travel into an area heavily 
traveled by tankers and freight ships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him to be careful so many years ago," Ha said. "But, he said that the 
ships could see him. He said every big ship has a radar. I told him, 'You've 
got to move from that area. It's too dangerous.' He didn't believe me." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials were still trying to determine what happened to the boat, which 
apparently sank without issuing a distress signal in the hazardous area. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman who answered the telephone at the San Gabriel home of Nhieu Nguyen's 
brother declined to comment Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard searchers recovered the two bodies early Tuesday morning after a 
private boater spotted one of them while traveling from Newport Beach to Santa 
Catalina Island. Searchers then hunted vainly over 450 square miles for the 
victims' boat, finding only clothing, ice chests, a bait container and other 
gear from a fishing vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 The search ended because of darkness Tuesday and Coast Guard officials, who 
did not know at the time if others were aboard, decided it was pointless to 
resume looking Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We searched as much as we can," said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Brandy 
Ian. "We saturated that area with our resources." 
</P>
<P>
 An official with the state Department of Fish and Game said that Nhieu Nguyen 
held a boat skipper's license and a separate permit to fish with gill nets, 
which are stretched in the water over hundreds of feet and snare fish by the 
gills as they swim through. 
</P>
<P>
 Department spokesman Patrick Moore said the records indicated that Nguyen held 
the licenses at least the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Records showed Khanh Nguyen once held a commercial fishing license but it 
expired in 1987, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard officials and others who sail the waters where the bodies were 
recovered said it is a hazardous area because it is so heavily traveled by 
heavy ships, prompting speculation that the boat the victims were on might have 
been involved in a collision. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of death was not known Wednesday. The bodies, taken to shore at 
Terminal Island in Los Angeles Harbor and then to the Los Angeles County 
coroner's office, were expected to be examined today, a coroner's spokesman 
said.

THREE INDICTED ON CHARGES THEY ATTEMPTED TO BRIBE INS AGENT; IMMIGRATION: 
FEDERAL GRAND JURY SAYS THEY WANTED PEOPLE WHO FILED WORKERS' COMP CLAIMS 
ARRESTED AND SOUGHT ILLEGAL VISAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three Orange County residents were indicted by a federal grand jury Wednesday 
on charges of conspiring to bribe an immigration agent to gain favors on a 
variety of immigration matters involving associates and employees of a 
Carson-area shipping warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-count indictment, unsealed in U.S. District Court here, alleges that 
the agent was, among other things, asked to arrest immigrants who filed 
workers' compensation claims against the warehouse and to give visas to two 
Vietnamese nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 Named as defendants were Steve Moallem, 47, and his wife, Gayle Mullen, 34, 
who own Nationwide Distribution Services, a warehouse in Rancho Dominguez where 
the U.S. Customs Service conducts examinations of cargo containers imported 
into the United States. Federal officials said that Mullen also owns XYZ Co., a 
garment business based at the warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Moallem vigorously denied the charges Wednesday, and accused 
federal agents of entrapping his client. 
</P>
<P>
 Also named as defendants were Laguna Beach resident Naftali Grossman, 32, 
identified by federal prosecutors as Moallem's cousin and a British citizen, 
and Armando Lising, 41, who lives in Paramount but is a citizen of the 
Philippines. Federal officials said Lising was the warehouse office manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullen, Grossman and Lising could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictment, Moallem and the other suspects offered or paid 
Immigration and Naturalization Service Special Agent Jess Avestro about $10,000 
in bribes. Avestro, who reported the bribe offers to the FBI, was allegedly 
asked to overlook the employment of undocumented immigrant workers by Moallem's 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment also alleged that Avestro was asked to arrest undocumented 
workers who filed workers' compensation claims against the company. In 
addition, the INS agent was allegedly asked to illegally obtain a resident 
alien card and work permit for Lising and fraudulent travel documents for 
Vietnamese nationals who are business associates of Moallem. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills attorney Paul Caruso, who represents Moallem, said his client 
already faces another indictment unsealed in Los Angeles last week. In that 
case, Moallem is charged with five additional counts of bribing Avestro. 
</P>
<P>
 Caruso said Moallem is currently free on bond in last week's indictment and 
denied that his client bribed Avestro. 
</P>
<P>
 "We deny the charges," Caruso said. "We intend to show that Avestro was dirty 
from the word go. He solicited the bribes. I think we have a very sound 
entrapment defense for all the charges." 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against Moallem and Mullen also allege that they asked the INS 
agent to assist Moallem in obtaining a phony passport showing his place of 
birth to be New York City, rather than Iraq. According to the indictment, 
Moallem later paid Avestro $500 to obtain an altered passport. He is charged 
with making a false statement in a passport application. 
</P>
<P>
 The four suspects are facing 12 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each 
bribery count and five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each conspiracy 
count. Moallem also faces five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted 
on the false passport application charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The four will be arraigned in federal court in Los Angeles on July 25.

PACT TO DEFEND INDIGENT TO BE SPLIT 3 WAYS; COURTS: ATTORNEY WILLIAM W. STEWART 
WILL RETAIN A SHARE IN AN APPARENT COMPROMISE REACHED BY A PANEL OF MUNICIPAL 
JUDGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an apparent compromise, a panel of judges agreed Wednesday that attorney 
William W. Stewart should retain a financial interest in a lucrative county 
contract to defend poor people accused of crimes -- but should share the 
caseload with two other law firms.  
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, who has been the subject of criticism in recent weeks on his handling 
of the nearly $1-million-a-year contract, would share in rotating court 
assignments as part of a "pilot project" presented by Presiding Judge Gregory 
H. Lewis of the Central District of Orange County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 If the proposal is approved by Stewart, who has a year remaining on the 
existing contract, it could result in a significant financial loss for him if 
case assignments are rotated equally among the three firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Details about how the reorganization would operate were not immediately 
available, but ultimate approval must be given by the County Board of 
Supervisors. A separate review of the Stewart contract is underway in the 
county administrative office. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart and Lewis could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana defense attorney has held firm control of the pact for 15 years, 
but he has come under fire in recent weeks for subletting hundreds of indigent 
cases to outside attorneys while retaining a share of the profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Central Court District judges have also expressed concern that court 
hearings were being delayed because contract attorneys were not always 
available to cover such a large caseload. Last year, Stewart's firm handled 
more than 1,200 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent interviews, Stewart vowed to maintain his interest in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief written statement Wednesday night, Lewis said that Stewart's 
performance was reviewed by judges of the Central Court District, who found 
there were "no grounds for concern on the part of the court or the public." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also said that Stewart has a "history of support" from the courts 
where his firm has been involved in contract cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis has been a staunch supporter of Stewart even as harsh criticisms have 
been leveled by colleagues, Municipal Court Judges Margaret R. Anderson and 
Pamela L. Iles. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson and Iles are members of a county advisory committee that oversees 
indigent defense policy. The judges have indicated their displeasure with 
Stewart for virtually abandoning his role in the courtroom so that he could 
tend to other business interests in Las Vegas and the countries of Colombia and 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, who at one point called the two judges "idiots" in reference to their 
comments, has repeatedly defended his handling of the contract, saying his firm 
has provided "excellent" legal services to hundreds of indigent clients. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent interviews, Stewart said the criticisms have come from "small people 
who like to talk trash about other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Although details of the reorganization were not immediately available, Stewart 
could see his profits slip by up to two-thirds if indigent assignments are 
rotated equally among two other law firms who now serve as back-ups. Last year 
the county paid his firm more than $700,000, and in previous years those 
payments have approached $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's office generally provides legal services to indigent 
clients but must defer to private firms under contract to the county when 
conflicts arise in cases where there are multiple defendants. In Santa Ana, 
Stewart's firm has the contract for referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 The backup defense firms of Patrick McNeal and Laz & Hall have handled only 
those Central District Court cases in which Stewart's firm has disqualified 
itself because of various conflicts of interest. Under the reorganization plan 
those firms would share the contract with Stewart on a rotating basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Slater, Orange County Superior Court executive officer, said Wednesday 
that he was unfamiliar with the judges' reorganization plan, but expressed 
concern about whether the backup firms would be able to handle the increased 
caseload. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not so sure what is accomplished by that," Slater said.

A HOT CASE OF SOCCER FEVER; FANS OF ITALY, BRAZIL REJOICE IN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL and JAIME ABDO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<P>
 The diagnosis was soccer fever, judging by the peculiar symptoms scattered 
around Orange County Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Frantic people stood on bar tops. They sang, chanted and shouted. They threw 
napkins and bread sticks and romped around restaurants waving flags of many 
colors. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, after Italy had defeated Bulgaria and Brazil had beaten 
Sweden, the stage was set for Sunday's World Cup final at Pasadena's Rose Bowl 
-- and another bout with the dizzying delirium. Blood pressure is likely to 
remain high until then. 
</P>
<P>
 "I waited four years for this," said an ecstatic Marcello Apollonio, the head 
chef of Il Fornaio restaurant in Irvine, after the Italian team has ousted 
Bulgaria, 2-1. He took a break from dancing with his sous-chef and his general 
manager to make a prediction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very confident," said Apollonio, 35, a native of Italy who lives in 
Irvine. "All the other games, we were not really there yet. But if we play like 
we did today, in the first half when we ran the entire half, we will win." 
</P>
<P>
 By early afternoon, about 250 people had piled into Legends Sports Bar in 
Costa Mesa to watch both games on the bar's 22 televisions.  
</P>
<P>
 "They all arrived at once," said Boomer Felton, Legends' 19-year-old host. "I 
mean, we expected crowds for the games, but this place was packed." 
</P>
<P>
 At Yolie's Brazilian Steakhouse in Irvine, a smaller but energetic group 
crowded around the bar, pounded the bar top like a samba drum and cheered the 
Brazilian team past Sweden, 1-0. Claudio Carvalho, 36, an exercise therapist 
from Rio de Janeiro, was just as confident as the Italian faithful that his 
team would return home with the cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll win Sunday," Carvalho promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Americans seemed bitten by the World Cup bug. Michelle Lanz, a 
22-year-old USC student, altered her work schedule to tag along to Legends with 
a group of friends from Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a different perspective," she said, gazing around at the feverish 
crowd. "You get more into the game when you are in a place like this with your 
friends. It adds a heightened level of excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 At Legends, Brazil seemed to be the favorite.  
</P>
<P>
 "Brazil! Brazil! Brazil!" went the chant carried by a gathering of native 
Brazilians in soccer jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of about 60 screaming fans greeted the Brazilian team when they 
arrived at the Fullerton Marriott hotel at nightfall. The fans, who were 
cordoned off from the hotel, were still wearing the green and yellow Brazilian 
jerseys and some had their faces painted. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we want is the World Cup," said a bubbling Patricia Tatagiba, 19, of 
Huntington Beach. "They are going to win the cup because they are the best. 
They are going to go all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Liliana Aquayo, 24, and Edwin Salas, 30, both students at Cal State Fullerton, 
said they came just to see soccer fever in action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to take part in all the excitement with everyone screaming," Aquayo 
said. "We just wanted to see it." At Il Fornaio, the chant was, "I-tal-ia! 
I-tal-ia!" The restaurant's general manager, Mario Bernardo, pulled down his 
Italian flag from above the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time Italy won the World Cup, in Spain in 1982, I was there and wore 
this around my neck," said Bernardo, 33, a Newport Beach resident. "I will wear 
it again Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians will rest their hopes on Roberto Baggio, the pony-tailed, 
sleepy-eyed national hero who suffers from tendinitis but scored both his 
team's goals against Bulgaria. He will not be hurting Sunday and will bring the 
cup back to Italy, said Giuseppe Naccarelli, 27, Il Fornaio's sous-chef. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last few years, he is the best player in the world. . . . Bravo, bravo!" 
Naccarelli said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; SHE TURNED GRIEF INTO A MOTIVATOR 
</P>

<P>
 Flora Valdez's comfortable life was shattered in 1991, a few weeks before her 
sophomore year of high school, when her mother and stepfather were gunned down 
outside an apartment building in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, who until then had been the object of doting parents who plied 
her with plenty of clothes, pocket money and other amenities, suddenly found 
herself penniless and without a home. She and two older sisters -- Veronica, 19 
at the time, and Rozio, 18 -- were evicted from their Buena Park apartment and 
had to split up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to have everything I wanted," she said. "Then one day I woke up and my 
parents were gone and I'm Cinderella mopping floors at Kentucky Fried Chicken." 
</P>
<P>
 But she persevered. Valdez went to live with friends in Cerritos, took a 
full-time job and continued to attend school. She graduated recently from Tracy 
High School, a continuation school in Cerritos, with an A average. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez, 18, is the first in her family to earn a high school degree, and 
credits her late mother, Altagracia Felix, with providing the inspiration to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to cry night and day, asking myself, 'Why did they die? Why do I have 
to stay up late mopping floors, get up early to go to school, iron my own 
clothes?' And then I remembered what my mom always told us: 'Go to school and 
learn.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I never understood why until the day they died," Valdez said. "Then I 
realized education was the key, the only way to get out of mopping floors and 
cleaning for other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Felix, 38, and her husband, Javier Contreras, 46, were shot at close range on 
Aug. 25, 1991, by a man with an assault rifle as they dropped off a friend at 
an apartment. Two men, Francisco Soria Patino and Juan Soria Lopez, have been 
charged with murder, but they apparently fled to Mexico, said Buena Park Police 
Lt. Mike Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras, a chef, previously had been convicted of selling drugs to 
undercover police officers and had spent some time in jail. But the slayings 
most likely were motivated by jealousy, Schwartz said. Felix earlier had 
reportedly spurned the advances of one of the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 After her parents were slain, Valdez dropped out of school for three months. 
Most of her time was consumed with funeral arrangements, the police 
investigation and the constant search for money. Valdez and her sisters had to 
borrow money to bury their parents in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez became so distraught at one point that she was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only had one thing on my mind: that they were gone, gone forever," she 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 She says that Schwartz, the Buena Park officer, is one of the people who 
encouraged her to continue with school. Schwartz first met Valdez when he told 
her of her parents' deaths. He kept in touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept telling her, 'I realize it's hard, but focus on school. Get your 
education and get beyond this.' I'm real proud of her," said Schwartz, who 
attended Valdez's graduation. "It's easy to help her. She's a sweet kid." 
</P>
<P>
 At her graduation, Valdez received several awards, including a savings bond 
from the local Optimist Club and a $250 scholarship from the Buena Park Police 
Department. Since then, she has moved into an apartment in Fullerton with her 
sister, Rozio, now 21, who is married and has a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez, who has been working at a Pep Boys auto parts store in Anaheim the 
past two years, is considering a career in medicine, aviation or teaching, she 
said. She plans to join the Air Force or attend community college in the fall.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm gonna make it," she said. 'You only have one chance at life." SUSAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; ONE-YEAR CONTRACT IMPOSED ON POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly 10 months of failed negotiations, the City Council has voted to 
impose a new one-year contract on its 154-member police union, a decision that 
prompted officials of the Police Officers Assn. to consider a legal challenge 
of the new pact. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3-2 Tuesday to impose the contract on the police officers, 
who have been working without a pact since December. Much of the new deal is 
retroactive to Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Tony Lam and Craig Schweisinger voted against the proposal, 
saying that negotiations, which broke off last month after city officials 
declared an impasse, should have been reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Charmayne S. Bohman, who was endorsed by the police officers 
union when she ran in 1992 and again during the June recall election, said that 
"if there was another way to do it, and remain fiscally responsible, I would 
have done it." Bohman voted with Mayor Charles V. Smith and Councilman Frank 
Fry to approve the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract guarantees that salaries of city police officers will be the 
sixth-highest in Orange County. It calls for a minimum pay raise of 3 1/2%, a 
figure that could rise to as high as 6% if other cities increase the salaries 
of their officers. The pay hike will be effective in January, although most of 
the other benefits have already begun. 
</P>
<P>
 City police officers, who earn between $3,000 and $4,000 a month, are 
currently ranked about 14th in the county, union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A union official said the Police Officers Assn. is "laying the basis for legal 
opposition" to parts of the contract or the process itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has never before imposed a contract on any employee group. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Selinske, three-time union president and current treasurer, said that 
union officials believe the city did not negotiate in good faith because it 
presented a "best and final offer" that contained fewer benefits than previous 
proposals the union had rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Brackett, the union president, said that although the court challenge will 
be seriously considered, union members may also decide to accept the one-year 
contract and seek contract negotiations again in January. 
</P>
<P>
 City and union negotiators deadlocked on medical benefits, overtime pay and 
cash-outs for unused sick leave.  
</P>
<P>
 Some union members said they were expecting more consideration from council 
members, whom they supported in the 1992 November election and a June 7 recall 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I and several other employees observed this as a slap in the face," Police 
Lt. Charles M. Schliskey said in a letter to the council. "We were not looking 
for any pay-back," but for the council to reopen negotiations. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; BIAS PROBE PLANNED IN JIMMY PETERS CASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Education has agreed to investigate allegations of 
discrimination against the Ocean View School District made by the father of a 
6-year-old student at the center of a bitter legal and educational dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Derring, branch chief in the complaints division of the Education 
Department's civil rights office, said Tuesday that officials have decided to 
investigate the allegations.But he declined to discuss them. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Peters filed the civil rights complaint June 22 on behalf of his son, 
Jimmy, alleging harassment by school officials, who on May 25 filed a locally 
unprecedented lawsuit to remove the child from his mainstream classroom at 
Circle View Elementary School. In the suit, the district contended that alleged 
violent outbursts by the boy posed a safety risk to other children and staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 But a federal judge ordered the school district June 8 to take Jimmy back into 
his kindergarten class, saying the district had failed to prove the child was a 
danger to himself or his classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters, who has denied allegations that his son is violent, said Tuesday he 
believes the Education Department's quick response to his complaint proves his 
allegations have merit. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. James Tarwater, who said he has not seen the complaint, declined to 
comment.JAIME ABDO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; $200,000 DAMAGE IN MEDICAL CENTER FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials on Wednesday investigated the cause of a fire that broke out late 
Tuesday in a doctor's vacant office on the fourth floor of the Huntington Beach 
Medical Towers. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured or evacuated from the fire, which city firefighters put out 
in 25 minutes.Investigators estimated that smoke and water caused $200,000 
damage to the four-story building, owned by the Huntington Beach Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Inspector Donald Boland said investigators did not yet know the cause of 
the fire, discovered about 11:25 p.m. after an alarm alerted security guards. 
The building's sprinkler system poured water over the flames and caused most of 
the water damage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Occupants salvaged equipment and paperwork Wednesday, and a medical laboratory 
had to shut waterlogged sections. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had quite a bit of water damage so we had to close the laboratory down," 
said Claire Vliss, office manager at Medical Center Laboratory on the third 
floor. She said the laboratory was open to draw blood from patients, but not to 
test it. KEN ELLINGWOOD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY PLANS TOUGHER STREET VENDING RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mobile vendors may eventually face stiffer regulations when they peddle their 
goods on city streets under a plan approved by the City Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The council Monday directed staff to revise city codes by adding restrictions 
on food sales from trucks in residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning director Howard Zelefsky said a revised ordinance will likely be 
brought before the council in December or January. 
</P>
<P>
 Melanie Fallon, director of community development, said the issue of mobile 
vending in some neighborhoods is not new to the city, but added that the 
activity has increased in recent years.  
</P>
<P>
 Vendors have been selling fresh vegetables, fruits and other goods in the 
predominantly Latino neighborhood known as Oakview, between Slater and Warner 
avenues near Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, vendors have expanded into neighborhoods north of Warner Avenue, as 
well as the area known as Utica-Florida west of Beach Boulevard, said Mike 
Adams, director of special projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Fallon said that some residents enjoy the convenience of this type of 
shopping. But she said some property owners and residents believe that the 
increased number of vendors has had negative effects on their quality of life 
and property values. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis Shaver, who owns property in the Oakview neighborhood, contended that he 
has had difficulty renting his duplex because of the vendors' presence. Shaver 
also said vendors often conduct business in one location longer than the 30 
minutes allowed under current city codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have an obligation to be mobile vendors, but they have become stationary 
vendors," Shaver said. "The point is that we have come up with these rules and 
regulations for the safety and welfare of others, but they have been ignored." 
</P>
<P>
 Fallon said city staff has identified a number of ways to further regulate 
vendors, including limiting the hours of operation to 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily. 
Vending is currently allowed from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Other suggested revisions include prohibiting the delivery of goods to vendors 
in residential neighborhoods, limiting the number of vendors in each 
neighborhood, limiting areas where mobile food selling is allowed, and 
requiring an annual review of each permit by the zoning administrator before a 
business license is issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ralph Bauer expressed concern about the cost of the proposed 
regulations and the time it will take the city to enforce them. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; CITY DELAYS VOTE ON SMOKING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has postponed a vote on a proposed anti-smoking ordinance, 
deciding instead to wait for the outcome of an Assembly bill that would ban 
smoking in restaurants and virtually all enclosed places of employment in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, passed by the state Legislature last week, is awaiting Gov. Pete 
Wilson's signature. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wilson signs the bill, it "would accomplish what we envisioned the 
ordinance would do," and makes the proposed ordinance unnecessary, City Manager 
Robert C. Dunek said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed city ordinance would allow smoking and use of tobacco products 
only in Rooms A and B at the Community Center on Oak Street during parties, 
bingo games, dance classes and other activities. The council made its decision 
to postpone a vote at its meeting on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunek said the Assembly bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman 
(D-Brentwood), allows smoking in parts of hotel lobbies and bars and in banquet 
and meeting rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wilson does not sign the bill, the council will likely pass the proposed 
city ordinance on July 25, Dunek said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance prohibits smoking in offices, rooms, chambers, dining areas, 
hallways and meeting places of buildings, and vehicles that the city owns or 
leases. Smoking in private offices, which was allowed in the past, also would 
no longer be permitted under the ordinance.BERT ELJERA

 Foothill High School will have two new assistant principals when the 1994-95 
school year begins in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the school are Brooke Harms-Vogelgesang, an assistant principal at 
Tustin High School for the last two years, and Anthony Kuns, an administrator 
from Chino Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 They will replace Dawn Clemens, who is moving out of the district, and Charles 
Milligan, newly appointed principal of Spring View Middle School in Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointments were part of a series of administrative changes approved last 
month by Tustin Unified School District trustees for the district's middle and 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Maura Mattson will take over Harms-Vogelgesang's job at Tustin High School, 
which also has a new principal, Bob Boies, former principal at Columbus Tustin 
Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbus Tustin Middle School, which moved to Browning Avenue while the Beneta 
Way site was renovated, will return to its original site in September under a 
new principal, Adele Casso Heuer, a former administrator in the ABC Unified 
School District in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Heuer will have Pat James as assistant principal. James has been principal at

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; CITY IS REVISING ANTI-BLIGHT LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city is revising a proposed ordinance that would prohibit people from, 
among other things, drying laundry on clotheslines on front and side yards 
visible from streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is in response to opposition from residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioners unanimously approved the ordinance two months ago. The 
City Council gave it preliminary approval earlier this month and was expected 
to formally adopt it Tuesday. But after residents called it unfair to 
low-income people, council members decided to postpone such action until a 
revised ordinance could be drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really spooking a lot of people," resident Craig Bird said about the 
ordinance. "A number of La Habra residents do not have the extra money to go to 
the Laundromat or buy a washer and dryer. . . . Although we are sure that the 
intentions of the proposed anti-blight ordinance are well-founded, many 
residents could take offense to and feel discriminated against by it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bird handed the council a petition signed by 90 residents who oppose the 
ordinance and said more petitions with more signatures were circulating. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the ordinance was designed to keep residential and 
commercial areas safe and clean. 
</P>
<P>
 "This clothesline thing has been blown way out of proportion," Councilman 
William D. Mahoney said. "We will solve that problem." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials will meet with the Apartment Assn. of Orange County and 
residents to address the concerns raised about the ordinance. Then, on Aug. 18, 
the council will consider adopting the proposed revised law. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would prohibit storage of vehicles or any household goods, 
including furniture, fixtures and appliances on yards. In addition, home and 
business owners would be required to keep weeds and lawns under six inches and 
make sure mailboxes, pools and ponds are kept in good shape. Also, trash 
containers stored on front or side yards or parking areas visible from public 
streets, on days trash is not picked up, would be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Rush, a Grace Avenue resident who has announced she will be running 
for the City Council because she wants to wipe out blight in La Habra, attacked 
the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush and a few other residents over the years have demanded that the city 
create a law that will fight blight. She said she never asked the city to 
outlaw clotheslines. Instead, Rush said she would be satisfied if the city 
adopted an ordinance prohibiting people from drying laundry on fences, bushes, 
balconies and trees. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; EX-RAM'S UNCLE IS INDICTED IN DRUG CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The uncle of former Los Angeles Rams cornerback Darryl Henley has been 
indicted by a federal grand jury for his role in a conspiracy to distribute 
cocaine from Henley's Brea home to drop-off points in Georgia and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment of Rex Henley, 30, who waived extradition from Texas and 
appeared in U. S. District Court in Santa Ana Wednesday for a detention 
hearing, brings to six the number of defendants charged with conspiring to 
operate an illicit drug network that involved cross-country cocaine shipments. 
</P>
<P>
 Three defendants, including one of those charged in the trafficking 
conspiracy, have also been charged with threatening Darryl Henley's life in an 
attempt to extort $360,000 they say Henley owed them for a cocaine delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 All eight are scheduled to face trial together beginning next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment alleges that Rex Henley helped package the cocaine in suitcases 
at his nephew's Brea home, and gave the drugs to former Rams cheerleader Tracy 
Ann Donaho, who in turn would transport them to Atlanta and Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 Donaho has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to smuggle cocaine and is said to be 
cooperating with prosecutors in their case against the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Deirdre Z. Eliot said Rex Henley has just been indicted 
because law enforcement officers have only recently developed new evidence 
linking him to the crimes. The indictment was handed down June 23. 
</P>
<P>
 At his detention hearing Wednesday, Rex Henley was not remanded to custody, 
but was ordered to post a $500,000 appearance bond.MARK PLATTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY GIVES CASTLE JOB COMPLETION DEADLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has declared a castle-style home in the Ranch village a 
public nuisance and threatened to order it demolished if the owners don't 
finish their long-running remodeling project within four months. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision caps more than a decade of debate and litigation over the Kron 
Street home, which has been under construction for more than 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 During this time, the Ganish family has continued to live in the house even 
though it lacks drywall, windows, ceiling covers, plumbing and proper 
electrical wiring. 
</P>
<P>
 A city report presented at Tuesday's council meeting labeled the home an 
uninhabitable fire hazard. Electric conduit is exposed throughout the house, 
and makeshift lights have been improperly wired, the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
 City building inspectors and county fire officials said the unsafe wiring 
could ignite the mounds of construction debris stored both inside the home and 
in the back yard, and cause a blaze that could easily spread to neighboring 
houses with wood roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's three-hour public hearing on the issue was punctuated by procedural 
disputes between City Atty. Joel D. Kuperberg and Robert Sainburg, the attorney 
for Fern and Victor Ganish. It also included a tearful plea to the council by 
the Ganishes' 18-year-old son, Gilad. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may feel like, 'Let's tear down this house.' The next day, it will be 
over for you," Gilad Ganish told the council. "You will still have a home to go 
home to." 
</P>
<P>
 Ganish repeated the family's claim that the city has harassed them and "made 
us out to be bad people." He said the remodeling dispute has made his family 
outcasts in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Sainburg said the Ganishes are willing to discuss what specific modifications 
to the house the city requires. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that the wrecking ball solution is not the right solution 
here," Sainburg said. "All Mr. and Mrs. Ganish want to understand is what the 
problem is." 
</P>
<P>
 But council members said that the Ganishes are well aware of the city's 
concerns and have ignored previous orders to bring the home up to code.

<P>
 Council members said they were convinced that the house was a nuisance in part 
by pictures taken of the interior by building inspectors. The pictures 
indicated that some rooms in the two-story home consist mainly of wood-framed 
walls and ceilings. Pictures also showed that staircases are incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said it would cost more than $200,000 to complete the 
remodeling project, which would require moving a small portion of the home's 
foundation off a public easement. 
</P>
<P>
 The council gave the Ganishes 120 days rather than the usual 60 days to abate 
the nuisance before demolition proceedings begin.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; SPLIT COUNCIL ELECTS CURRERI MAYOR AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Breaking a deadlock, the City Council has chosen Judy Curreri to serve a 
another one-year term as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 The seat has traditionally gone to the city's mayor pro tem, but the council 
voted 4 to 1 for Curreri on Tuesday night after having deadlocked 2 to 2 in an 
attempt to choose a new mayor last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The impasse was caused because the June election changed the five-member 
council's composition, bringing in two new members while another was reelected 
to a second term. The deadlock occurred while Curreri was in Europe and unable 
to cast a tie-breaking vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Curreri said Wednesday that she didn't expect to be named mayor again, and 
called on her colleagues to set aside emotions generated during a close June 7 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The only vote against Curreri on Tuesday came from newly elected Councilwoman 
Toni Gallagher, who criticized Curreri's past votes on land development. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher, the top vote-getter in the election, on Wednesday questioned why 
Curreri was named mayor once more, and not William L. Ossenmacher, who was 
mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that William Ossenmacher was blocked from being mayor because he has a 
history of representing the citizens of Dana Point rather than the developer 
special interests," Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council named second-term Councilwoman Karen Lloreda as mayor pro tem by a 
3-2 vote. Gallagher and Ossenmacher voted no. Newly elected Councilman Harold 
R. Kaufman cast votes for both Curreri and Lloreda. 
</P>
<P>
 Ossenmacher said he was not disappointed that he is not Dana Point's mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Curreri was Dana Point's first mayor in 1989.JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BID TO BUY TROUBLED UTILITY TO BE STUDIED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The agency that oversees takeovers and consolidations of special districts has 
authorized an $87,360 study of a private bid to acquire the Santa Margarita 
Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Local Agency Formation Commission executed a contract with Muni 
Finance Services, a government finance firm based in Temecula, to analyze a 
proposal by the California-American Water Co. to buy the district in South 
Orange County for more than $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the company announced that it wanted to purchase the troubled district 
-- whose top two longtime managers were convicted on criminal 
conflict-of-interest charges last month -- and assume all of its estimated $370 
million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 California-American, a Chula Vista subsidiary of New Jersey-based American 
Water Works Co., will pay for the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara F. Anderson, the commission's executive officer, said the study will take 
four to six months and will be followed by a staff recommendation on the 
proposed purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's Public Utilities Commission, which regulates private utilities, 
will also conduct public hearings on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The dissolution of the district was considered by the commission after 5% of 
the district's 39,270 registered voters petitioned for the action in June. 
</P>
<P>
 In a staff report, LAFCO administrators said the application was "the first of 
its kind in the state of California, because it calls for privatization of a 
public agency." MARK PLATTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; SEIZED ANIMALS TO BE PUT UP FOR ADOPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 County Animal Control officials are expected to move quickly to find homes for 
some of the 32 dogs and cats found in filthy conditions in a three-bedroom 
condominium in Aliso Viejo last month. 
</P>
<P>
 As a pretrial hearing for owner Luella Kretchman, 48, was delayed in South 
County Municipal Court on Wednesday, Judge Blair T. Barnette said he would sign 
an order allowing the county to make the animals available for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities who removed the cats and dogs from the condominium she rents found 
six dead animals. Thirteen others were in such poor condition that they were 
euthanized at the county shelter in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the remaining 32 animals found in her home, Kretchman will be allowed to 
keep no more than three dogs and three cats, unless she gets a special permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Kretchman, who is charged with misdemeanor cruelty to animals, is free on 
$10,000 bail. If convicted, she faces a six-month jail sentence and a $1,000 
fine. Her hearing date was moved to July 27. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 28, sheriff's deputies responded to reports from residents in a 
condominium complex in the 23000 block of El Reposa that a strong foul smell 
was emanating from Kretchman's home. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the deputies' report, the modest three-bedroom residence was 
crowded with living and dead animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Kretchman on Wednesday called the charge against her "overblown" and said she 
was worried about her animals at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did manage to talk to the (county) veterinarian, and he said one of my dogs 
and some of the cats weren't eating," she said. "I'm afraid they're depressed 
sitting in that sterile environment. They're used to a lot of hugging and 
cuddling." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter officials said they have received many phone calls from people 
interested in adopting the animals. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; OCC STUDENTS TO SAIL TO NEW ZEALAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every year the students from Orange Coast College's Sailing Center take the 
school's floating classroom, a 65-foot sloop named "Alaska Eagle," a little 
farther. First they took it to Hawaii and back. Then to Tahiti and back. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the students -- along with a skipper, a first mate and a cook -- 
will sail the Eagle all the way to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 The launch is planned Saturday, when the crew of two teachers and nine 
students will set off for Maui, the first stop on a 20,000-mile trip that will 
last until next July and includes a four-month layover in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great adventure," Eagle skipper Brad Avery said as he rushed about the 
boat Wednesday morning making last-minute preparations. "By the end of this 
trip the students are running the boat by themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Students will operate the boat in groups of 10 for several weeks at a time. 
When the journey ends, about 130 students -- including engineers, 
veterinarians, psychologists and lawyers -- will have taken part. 
</P>
<P>
 They usually return from their time on the high seas with new respect for 
their own grace under pressure and for the beauty of the ocean, Avery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailing student Tom Devlin, 36, said he looks forward to experiencing natural 
wonders he has no opportunity to see during days spent working as a software 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just hoping to see the 'green flash,' " said Devlin, who will be a crew 
member on the 19-day leg from Tahiti to Pago Pago. "The story is that when the 
sun sets over water and under a cloudless sky, the final glimpse of the sun as 
it goes over the horizon is a green flash. I haven't seen it yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the students will be on vacation time from work, the trip 
isn't about getting a tan or relaxing and enjoying a good novel, Avery said. 
This is a working vacation, with bunks to clean, sails to change and navigation 
skills to acquire. 
</P>
<P>
 Each participant pays $125 a day, which covers meals, a bunk and sailing 
instruction. Most students stay on the boat for one leg, which ranges from 13 
to 25 days. Then a new crew of 10 students takes over the operation. They pay 
their own ways to the South Pacific ports where they join the crew. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,000 people each year take classes at the college's sailing center, 
which opened in 1955. Some come from as far away as Canada, Montana and Arizona 
to sail the Pacific on the Eagle, which was donated to the college in 1982.LYNN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; NUDE MAN ARRESTED AFTER TRAFFIC CRASH

<P>
 A nude, 23-year-old man was arrested here Wednesday after crashing his pickup 
truck into two vehicles, then ricocheting off three others, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Harvey Kile of Seal Beach was taken into custody about 10:10 a.m. in a 
hilly area in the 20200 block of Laguna Canyon Road after running from his 
wrecked 1988 Chevrolet pickup truck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kile was taken to Saddleback Memorial Medical Center, then transported to the 
Orange County Jail, where he was being held on suspicion of driving under the 
influence, reckless driving, hit-and-run driving and driving on a suspended 
license, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A California Highway Patrol officer noticed Kile's truck traveling erratically 
northbound on El Toro Road near Moulton Parkway, according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer turned on his overhead lights and gave chase, but broke off when 
the truck speeded up and the officer believed it was too dangerous to continue, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the CHP officer was sending in a report over his radio, he reached the 
accident scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Kile's truck hit two vehicles as he drove in the oncoming southbound lane of 
Laguna Canyon Road, then struck three more vehicles waiting at a traffic 
signal, police said. When arrested, Kile was hiding face down amid weeds and 
rocks, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Ray Lardie said there were no serious injuries. Police had no 
explanation why Kile was naked. JEFF BEAN

KIN OF HIKING FATALITY AWARDED $700,000; COURTS: JUDGE ALSO ORDERS $1 MILLION 
TOTAL TO BE PAID TO THREE OTHER VICTIMS OF LIGHTNING THAT STRUCK A METAL-ROOFED 
HUT ATOP MT. WHITNEY. HE SCORES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR DISREGARDING HIKER 
SAFETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge has ordered the federal government to pay $700,000 to the family of a 
Huntington Beach hiker who died during a lightning storm at the summit of Mt. 
Whitney in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew E. Nordbrock, who was 26, was one of 13 hikers who had sought shelter 
from the downpour by ducking inside of an old stone hut at the summit of the 
mountain. The hut's corrugated-metal roof acted as a lightning rod and 
Nordbrock was electrocuted. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge William J. Rea also awarded a total of $1 million in 
damages to three surviving hikers who suffered injuries from the lightning 
bolt, which left everyone in the hut with first- and second-degree burns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have fought for several years to prove that the government was guilty of 
willful misconduct," attorney Larry R. Feldman said Wednesday. "It is almost 
impossible to believe that the government could have a hut with a metal tin 
roof and a metal stovepipe on the highest mountain in the continental United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a trap to these hikers who were all very reasonable and intelligent 
people and thought they would be safe inside," added Feldman, who represented 
Nordbrock's family and the three others. 
</P>
<P>
 In a scathing opinion handed down on July 7, Rea wrote that the government had 
displayed "wanton and reckless disregard" for hikers, some of whom had been 
injured in the hut during storms in 1985, 1987, 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite repeated incidents and despite the knowledge that a dangerous and 
potentially life-threatening condition existed, (the government) failed to 
erect any signs or other warnings concerning the hut and its dangers during the 
five years preceding this accident," the judge wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The hut, known as the Smithsonian Hut, was built in 1909 by the Smithsonian 
Institution to shelter scientists conducting astronomical research at the 
summit. Hikers have used the hut since the completion of modern trails to the 
top of Mt. Whitney in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 The hut, constructed of granite blocks, has a metal stovepipe that attaches to 
the side of the building and leads into the interior. The stovepipe extends 
about five feet above the roof. There was no lightning protection system in 
place, court records state. 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon on July 14, 1990, Nordbrock and three friends had reached 
the top of the mountain when an electrically charged storm suddenly rolled in. 
The group made a run for the hut, where nine other hikers already had sought 
refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a minute later, lightning struck the hut, and a surging electrical 
charge threw Nordbrock several feet. He was removed from the mountain by 
helicopter and died a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they needed to do was spend $50 and put a sign out there which warns 
hikers to avoid the hut in the event of rain," Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A warning sign was erected on July 15, 1990, the day after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also awarded $400,000 to James MacLeod; $300,000 to Glen MacLeod, 
and $300,000 to Calif Tervo. All three suffered serious injuries in the hut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all of my clients were very traumatically and emotionally injured as 
a result of this event," Feldman said. "They will be very happy if the 
government does not let this happen to anyone else under similar 
circumstances."

RAMS INVESTMENT GROUP SUES CITY OVER STADIUM PARKING LOT RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the continuing fight over the rights to the Anaheim Stadium parking lot, an 
investment group including the Los Angeles Rams on Wednesday sued the city of 
Anaheim, claiming it was never allowed to develop the lot as promised. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, called Anaheim Stadium Associates, claims in the lawsuit filed 
Wednesday in Orange County Superior Court that the city has prevented it from 
building a high-rise office project on the lot.That denial breached the 
contract the Rams and their associates have with the city, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also asks the court to prevent the city from terminating the parking 
lot lease with the Rams and Anaheim Stadium Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's lawsuit is the latest salvo in a costly, decade-old battle over 
the lucrative rights to the lot among the Rams, the California Angels and their 
host city, Anaheim. The suit refers to the original contract that brought the 
Rams to Anaheim in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the enticement to bring the Rams to Anaheim, the city offered the 
team and Anaheim Stadium Associates the right to develop a portion of the 
parking lot. Just before ground was broken, however, the project was tied up in 
lawsuits among the three parties. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana ruled that the Rams 
could develop an office complex on the lot near Orangewood Avenue but 
eliminated another Rams project on the lot near State College Boulevard.

WILSON PLAYS TO RECEPTIVE CROWD ON CAMPAIGN STOP; POLITICS: THE GOVERNOR TALKS 
ABOUT CRIME AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY BUT STAYS AWAY FROM ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IN 
SPEECH TO ASIAN-AMERICAN LEADERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA TROUNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Treading a path certain to become even more worn as the November election 
approaches, Gov. Pete Wilson brought two of his three main campaign themes to 
Orange County Wednesday, speaking to an appreciative audience of Asian-American 
community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor, honored by the group for what several speakers called an 
unprecedented level of support for Asian Americans, touched on the issues of 
crime and economic recovery during brief remarks here. But he skirted an issue 
that has proven more sensitive among many immigrant groups -- his tough stance 
on illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson urged his audience of about 150 community leaders from across Southern 
California to voice their support for passage of the so-called "one-strike" 
legislation that would give first-time child molesters and some rapists 
sentences of 25 years to life. The bill, carried by state Sen. Marian Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach), was passed by the Senate two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to the question of the state's still limping economy, Wilson said 
California "stands poised on the threshold of a recovery that will turn the 
world on its ear" and will be aided by its many cultural ties to the Pacific 
Rim nations in its effort to expand trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor also praised Asian Americans for their entrepreneurial spirit and 
what he called a "strong tradition of individual and family responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson, who has seized recently on the increasingly open hostility many 
Californians feel toward illegal immigrants, did not mention his efforts in 
that arena. The governor has proposed a constitutional amendment to deny 
automatic citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants. He also has sued 
the federal government to recoup the money the state spends on health care and 
the incarceration of illegal immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 In response to reporters' questions later, Wilson said that many Asian 
Americans have expressed support for his position.  
</P>
<P>
 "Those who have played by the rules and gone through the process of becoming 
naturalized citizens . . . gone through the process of satisfying all the 
requirements, a great many of them not only express support for what we're 
doing but have some of their own concerns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And one member of his audience, Matthew Fong, the Republican candidate for 
state treasurer and a member of the State Board of Equalization, said the 
initial criticism of Wilson on the issue, including from some Asian-American 
groups, had been misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were fears from some that he was talking about broadening the scope of 
the question of illegal immigrants to include all immigrants," Fong said, 
adding that most of those concerns have since been assuaged.

WHISTLE-BLOWER SUES SANITATION DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A government whistle-blower sued the Orange County Sanitation Districts and 
several top executives Wednesday, accusing them of engaging in retaliatory 
discipline and defamation. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Sangermano, the sanitation agency's laboratory manager, charged that 
officials have repeatedly refused to allow him to return from a medical leave, 
even though his personal doctor has cleared him of any medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 When he tried to return in May, sanitation agency officials locked him out of 
his laboratory, Sangermano claimed in the lawsuit filed in Orange County 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that Sangermano's work troubles began in May when he decided 
to help state authorities and local prosecutors in an investigation of possible 
improprieties by the agency in connection with a fire earlier. The fire killed 
two workers at the sanitation agency's Huntington Beach sewage-treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office has since confirmed that it is considering 
possible criminal charges.

MARIACHI PERFORMANCES.

 In a deal that signals "a new era of cooperation" between the Orange County 
Philharmonic Society and the Orange County Performing Arts Center, the 
organizations will jointly sponsor two events next season at the Costa Mesa 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The society and the center will present Teatro de Danza Espanola, the Spanish 
flamenco dance company, on Oct. 6, and Fiesta Navidad, a holiday mariachi 
celebration, on Dec. 11. The flamenco troupe had already been announced as part 
of the Philharmonic Society's 1994-95 "International Festival Series." The 
society had announced Fiesta Navidad separately for an unspecified date in 
December at UC Irvine's Bren Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the agreement, the center will provide "significant technical and 
publicity support." The Philharmonic Society will assume financial 
responsibility and receive all earned revenues from the events. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a win-win situation," center executive director Tom Tomlinson said 
Wednesday. Tomlinson said the deal will put an end to previous conflicts over 
the society's presentations of non-classical music events at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt, as opposed to situations in the past where there has been some 
acrimony about those presentations, it would be better for us to get together 
to decide which are appropriate for the building and the community. . . . 
Presenting them jointly, we alleviate those conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there was bitter public debate last year when the center's 
then-president Thomas R. Kendrick opposed the society's offering of ethnic 
programming at the facility. The center board finally overrode Kendrick's 
opposition but limited scheduling of such events specifically to the 1993-94 
season. The collaboration signals an easing of tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has more to do with how we book in the future," Dean Corey, executive 
director of the Philharmonic Society, said Wednesday. "It will very much 
enhance our ability to expand our horizons, both in bringing in some events new 
to audiences in Orange County and as well as revenues that can help us fund our 
traditional presentations. It worked out real well." 
</P>
<P>
 "Should we desire," he added, "we have the access to a lot of the center's 
marketing and promotional resources. They make more money if we sell more 
tickets," he said, because the center's rental fees are tied to attendance. "So 
it's a very nice arrangement." 
</P>
<P>
 Corey said he had "no reservations" about the joint presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the move from the Bren Center, Corey said Fiesta Navidad had been 
originally scheduled there because "we weren't sure if the center would be 
available" during that month. "The Bren was available. But the concept of the 
show is a little different that what we first thought. The proscenium stage (at 
the center) will be better suited" to the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlinson said that collaborating with the society was "an easy decision" to 
make and one that had the full support of the center's board. "We're very 
pleased with the outcome." 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't abandoning our ability or responsibility or desire to be an 
independent presenter," he added. "We acknowledge that there is a symbiotic 
relationship between us and the (regional performing and presenting groups). 
Our joint and mutual health is somewhat dependent on each other, so to that 
extent, if we can find ways to work together, then we will." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that "over the next few months, you will see additional 
collaborations" with Opera Pacific and the Pacific Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Other events on the Philharmonic Society's "International Festival Series" 
include the Vienna Choir Boys (at the center on Oct. 21), Le Ballet National du 
Senegal (at the Irvine Barclay Theatre on March 9 and 10) and Johan de Meij's 
"The Lord of the Rings" played by the California Wind Orchestra under David 
Warble's direction, with narration by actor George Takei (at the center on 
April 30). Information: (714) 553-2422.

ACTOR, AUDIENCE IN TRIAL BY 'FIRE'; STAGE: THE DIRECTOR FEARS HIS WORK AT THE 
TRIBUNE THEATRE MIGHT BE TOO CHALLENGING TO BE UNDERSTOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Michael Mollo knows that "Fire Under Water (Prometheus Drowned)" is sure to be 
difficult for anyone who sees it. It's difficult for him; it's difficult for 
his actors, and it's difficult for those who have watched the play take shape 
in rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very demanding piece because it's stylistic, and it inverts reality 
. . . it just might be too challenging for Orange County or elsewhere," Mollo 
said resignedly of his new drama, which premieres at the Tribune Theatre on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mollo, a co-founder of the struggling Revolving Door Productions drama 
troupe in Fullerton, hopes the audience will stick with his tale of Joe Noone, 
a messianic skin-diver working through his memories of child abuse and a plan 
to save the world that starts with his own suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Real life mingles with dream sequences, and contemporary dialogue is ladled 
with biblical and literary references in a plot that Mollo said incorporates 
notions of sanity and insanity, New-Age trendiness, the men's movement, the 
myths of Joseph Campbell, a quest for personal and universal spiritualism and a 
down-home love story between Joe and his wife, Sara. 
</P>
<P>
 A farrago of ideas and events, uneasily mixed? 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old writer and director, who recently returned to his longtime 
home of Fullerton after a year in San Francisco, worries the same thing. Still, 
he's confident that the play has worth, especially to anybody who's attracted 
by the experimental. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what's going to save it is that there are a lot of good one-liners 
and bits that are tied to the language, which I think is very poetic," Mollo 
said. "Some of it is even done in iambic pentameter, so if people don't like 
Shakespeare, they'll like this even less. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if they (use 'Fire Under Water') to question their own lives and aren't 
(angered) by the play, I think they may come back again. I'm hoping people who 
are intrigued will see it more than once." 
</P>
<P>
 The drama's basic idea came to Mollo while he and his girlfriend were living 
in a poor section of Daly City on the outskirts of San Francisco. Mollo moved 
to the Bay Area shortly after his play "Visions: Portrait of a Beat Generation" 
was staged by Revolving Door. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece chronicled the life and friends of Jack Kerouac, and Mollo wanted to 
immerse himself in that history, starting with San Francisco's North Shore. The 
experience was gratifying, but Mollo was plagued by thoughts of his own 
childhood, during which he said he was physically abused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to experience the city, and I did, but I also got in touch with some 
personal issues," he said. "I got into my soul and was able to elucidate some 
sensitive issues. This is the result of 13 rewrites." 
</P>
<P>
 Mollo said Joe is an ambiguous, even enigmatic figure. One of the questions an 
audience will have to answer for itself is whether Joe is crazy, especially 
when it comes to his wish to die and be reborn as a modern-day savior. 
</P>
<P>
 The playwright stressed that Joe may seem mentally unstable, but there's a 
method to his madness. "Sometimes he's crazy; sometimes he's lucid, but crazy 
people often have the most profound thoughts. Anyway, Shakespeare used (mad 
characters such as) Ophelia in 'Hamlet' to show truth." 
</P>
<P>
 The drama's avant-garde sway is right for Revolving Door, which Mollo said has 
been committed to staging new, risk-taking plays since opening in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, consisting mostly of Fullerton College graduates like Mollo, became 
the main tenant of the Tribune Theatre earlier this year. The playhouse had 
been the home for the Fullerton-based Teatro Cometa, a Latino company, until 
Revolving Door took over the lease. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Revolving Door's future, Mollo, who remains a member of the troupe's 
board of directors, said it's shaky, mainly because of financial worries. Board 
members have used their own money to pay most of the theater's $650 monthly 
rent because ticket sales have rarely met expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still don't have a budget; this is all being done with two boards and a 
passion," he said. "We get frenetic just getting the rent money, (but) we've 
always had a desperate approach, even when we were staging plays in cafes." 
</P>
<P>
 And if the company doesn't survive? Mollo said it probably will resurface in 
another form. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is definitely a commitment to the art renaissance that is taking place 
in Fullerton," he said. "We are very serious about keeping our craft, of 
getting our expression out there." 
</P>
<P>
 * Michael Mollo's "Fire Under Water (Prometheus Drowned)" opens Friday at 8:30 
p.m. at the Tribune Theatre, 116 1/2 W. Wilshire Ave., Fullerton. It continues 
Fridays and Saturdays at 8:30 p.m. and Sundays at 7 p.m. through July 31. $5. 
(714) 525-3403.

HEY, GARTH, LET YOUR SISTER HAVE A TURN; POP MUSIC: SINGING BACKGROUND VOCALS 
HAS BEEN LIKE HOME TO BETSY SMITTLE, GARTH BROOKS' HALF-SISTER, BUT NOW SHE'S 
GOING SOLO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Just two days after Betsy Smittle picked up a bass for the first time and 
became a member of her brother's backing band, she was playing in front of 
58,000 people at the Texas State Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Things like that happen when your brother is Garth Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 After that introduction to the big time, and a few subsequent years at the 
heart of the Brooks phenomenon, Smittle is pretty relaxed about her new 
challenge -- launching a solo career with a debut album, "Rough Around the 
Edges," that's due in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I have a wonderful job with my brother, and it's just a little 
icing on the cake here," says Smittle, who will be providing the low notes and 
the high vocal harmonies behind Brooks at the Hollywood Bowl tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Garth Brooks, Smittle got her first musical inspiration from her mother 
-- Colleen Carroll, who was a country singer in the '40s and '50s. Now her 
daughter has returned the favor by having her do a duet on "This House," a song 
on the new album. 
</P>
<P>
 Smittle's father is Jim Smittle, who was the fiddle player in Colleen's band. 
After their divorce, Carroll married Raymond Brooks, and eventually Betsy found 
herself the lone girl in a brood of six growing up in Yukon, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Smittle can afford to be casual about the solo move, her step into the 
spotlight is accompanied by a couple of intriguing challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 First: The inevitable skeptics who will say that she'd never have a record 
deal if it weren't for the Brooks connection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew this question was gonna come," says Smittle, 41. "Garth has talked to 
me about this. I'm very proud that I'm Garth's sister, and I think he's proud 
that I'm his sister. And he knows I've been singin' for a long time, and knows 
that it's everybody's dream to do their own album. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are gonna say what they're gonna say, is basically what I'm tryin' to 
get to. They're probably gonna eat me alive. And you get a little callous to 
it, because I know in my heart what I am. They can say anything they want to, 
just leave my family out of it. Garth -- God, they've torn him apart in some of 
these things. They love you for a minute and hate you the next. It's just one 
of those things the world does." 
</P>
<P>
 Issue two: Smittle will be one of the few openly gay women making a bid for 
pop acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that God made us all and he makes no mistakes, and that's 
basically all I have to say on that subject at the moment," says Smittle. 
"There are obstacles everybody has to go over, and my private life will be my 
own, even though I'll probably have people hangin' out of trees with cameras to 
get their little smut in the paper or whatever they have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Frances, the president of NorthSouth Records, the company that will make 
its debut with Smittle's album, doesn't see it as an obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like being Garth's sister -- it's the facts, and there's no wish to deny 
it, and people are proud of what they are," says Frances, who owns the 
Atlantic-distributed NorthSouth with his wife, Pam Lewis -- Brooks' manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to acknowledge and hope that the music carries you," he adds. 
"It's there. If the Advocate calls, we'll do a story with them. But it's not 
the first thing in the marketing plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Smittle started singing folk songs in talent shows when she was in the ninth 
grade, and by the time she finished high school she'd moved from Joan Baez and 
Judy Collins to Janis Joplin. After graduating, she played for three years with 
a female band in Oklahoma City, then moved to Tulsa and gravitated toward the 
blues. 
</P>
<P>
 She backed female country singer Gus Hardin for 10 years, and also played with 
Ronnie Dunn, soon to be a country star as half of Brooks (no relation) & Dunn, 
before Garth got her to swap her guitar for a bass. 
</P>
<P>
 The pop country tone on Smittle's album evokes such performers as Bonnie Raitt 
and Mary-Chapin Carpenter, reflecting a diversity of influences that parallels 
her brother's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have kind of the same thought on music," she says. "He was raised with 
country, and he was raised with KISS, Journey and things like that. . . . I'm 
the same way. I love the sincerity of country music, but I'm more drawn vocally 
toward pop and blues." 
</P>
<P>
 To step out with her own album, Smittle had to overcome her natural tendency 
to stay out of the spotlight -- something that goes all the way back to the 
Brooks family's weekly "fun nights."  
</P>
<P>
 "Garth kind of took that over real fast," she recalls. "We could tell he was 
the performer in the family. . . . Actually I was kind of like a background 
singer back then. I would say that I've been very content with what I do. I 
feel like I'm frosting on other people's cake, when you can turn around and 
have a pretty good background singer and a musician all in one. That's what 
I've been and enjoyed it a lot."

ART; MCLAUGHLIN SHOW AGAIN POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Laguna Art Museum has postponed its eagerly awaited exhibition of seminal 
Southern California modernist painter John McLaughlin, which was scheduled to 
open Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials would confirm only that the show will not open in 1995, 
either. A new date will be announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The McLaughlin retrospective was a pet project of the museum's former 
director, Charles Desmarais. His catalogue was to have been the first major 
book written about the abstract painter, who spent his 30-year career working 
in semi-isolation in Dana Point. Despite many years of poor or nonexistent 
sales, McLaughlin showed a single-minded devotion to his work that set an 
example for Southern California artists of the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the show was postponed once before (it initially was scheduled for 
the museum's 75th anniversary celebration last year), the new postponement may 
signal a much-reduced role for Desmarais, who began working on the ambitious 
project four years ago. In a phone interview this week from his home in Laguna 
Beach, he said the show, as he conceived it, is ready for presentation this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 After Desmarais was fired by the board last spring, the exhibition became a 
bone of contention. While he proposed that he still curate the show and present 
it at the museum, museum officials insisted that the show had become their 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Desmarais said his last contact with the museum was a late April meeting with 
acting director Susan M. Anderson and two trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said Wednesday that she would not comment on Desmarais' remarks or 
provide further details about the exhibition until the formal announcement on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Desmarais said he had offered to limit his involvement with the show to 
writing the main essay in the exhibition catalogue. (Other essays in the 
catalogue are by Anderson and art historian Susan Larsen.) Although the museum 
had offered to pay him for the essay, he said he would forgo any money as long 
as he received credit as the catalogue author. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is, this has been my project, and I conducted all the research and 
am the quote-unquote expert," Desmarais said. "I wanted to be recognized as the 
author of the book. I was given a long letter that proposed my involvement but 
didn't include the central recognition that I thought was necessary. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I was asked to respond (to the letter) in a day, and I did. I said (being 
credited as catalogue author) was my only problem. They said they'd get back to 
me, but no one ever has," Desmarais said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the show already has received enough funding "to do a bang-up 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to two grants from the National Endowment for the Arts for $7,500 
and $50,000, the show received a $10,000 gift from private donors and a $15,000 
pledge from the museum's Exhibitionists council. Other venues on the tour 
schedule (which was to include the Oakland Museum, the Baltimore Museum of Art 
and the Newark Museum in New Jersey) were to provide an additional $15,000, for 
a total of $97,500. 
</P>
<P>
 In place of the McLaughlin show, the museum will substitute a fall exhibition 
of Amish quilts from the collection of Doug Tompkins.

FOSTER LEAVES 'HOT ZONE,' CITES SCRIPT SHORTCOMINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than two weeks before cameras are to roll, Jodie Foster has backed out as 
the female lead in 20th Century Fox's upcoming virus drama "Crisis in the Hot 
Zone." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest crisis on "Hot Zone," which has had a troubled road to the big 
screen, comes at a particularly crucial time since a rival project is gearing 
up for production by producer Arnold Kopelson at Warner Bros.Kopelson's 
"Outbreak," which stars Dustin Hoffman, Morgan Freeman and Rene Russo, is being 
directed by Wolfgang Petersen ("In the Line of Fire"). 
</P>
<P>
 Both films, each budgeted at around $40 million, are about the spread of fatal 
viruses. "Crisis" is scheduled to start production July 25, "Outbreak" on July 
24. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster's publicist, Pat Kingsley, said that the actress "felt the script 
submitted was not ready for approval and she wanted to give them (the studio 
and director Ridley Scott) enough time to find another actor."  
</P>
<P>
 Kingsley confirmed that Foster informed Fox and Scott of her decision 
Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 A Fox official said "the part is being re-cast and we're moving ahead." At 
press time no replacement for Foster had been secured. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources at the studio told The Times that both Foster and co-star Robert 
Redford have had problems with the script since the beginning. Rumors are that 
Redford, whose representatives could not be reached, may also be waffling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Fox insider said that the problem wasn't the story, scripted by Jim Hart and 
Paul Attanasio, but the character development. In the words of one production 
source, "the characters were just too average. There have been several drafts 
and they weren't even close to a final one yet." Rumors also swirled Wednesday 
that Scott himself was patching together parts from separate revisions done by 
each writer.

KLAX'S NO. 1, BUT KROQ'S MAKING WAVES; RADIO: RATINGS SHOW BANDA MUSIC 
ATTRACTED THE MOST LOCAL LISTENERS, BUT ALTERNATIVE ROCK HAD A HUGE DRAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 While the banda sounds of Spanish-language KLAX-FM (97.9) continued to draw 
the most listeners among local radio stations, alternative rock proved to be a 
huge draw for KROQ-FM (106.7), which registered its largest audiences ever, 
according to the quarterly Arbitron ratings survey released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that obviously this kind of music is hotter than it's ever been and 
it's becoming even more broad-based," said Trip Reeb, KROQ-FM general manager. 
"Young people really are more unified than at any time in recent memory in 
their musical tastes and we certainly are a reflection of those tastes." 
</P>
<P>
 With 4.7% of the audience tuning in on average, KROQ's ratings during the past 
three months ranked third locally and were the highest in the station's 15-year 
history. It has risen from a weak-signaled, new-wave oriented station in the 
early '80s to a powerhouse, corporate-owned force in the '90s 
</P>
<P>
 The KROQ morning team of Kevin Ryder and Gene (Bean) Baxter was in ninth 
place, just behind the former top-rated duo of Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps 
on KLOS-FM (95.5), who tied for seventh place with KLVE-FM's (107.5) Pepe 
Barretto. 
</P>
<P>
 Hip-hop station KPWR-FM (105.9) was in second place overall, as it was in the 
last survey, boosting its audience share from 4.7% to 5.1%. Its morning team of 
brothers Erik and Nick Vidal, known as the Baka Boyz, rose dramatically from 
13th to fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
 KLAX-FM's morning team of Juan Carlos Hidalgo and El Peladillo (Jesus Garcia) 
continued to dominate the morning-drive race with 5.6% of the audience, 
followed by KLSX-FM (97.1) syndicated radio personality Howard Stern with 5%. 
Stern had been in first place in the last survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Spanish-station KLVE-FM has been on a dramatic climb from 17th place last fall 
to 11th place in the winter to seventh this spring, with 3.7% of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' only country station, KZLA-FM (93.9), also jumped, from 19th and 
a 2.3% share of the audience to 12th place with a 2.9% share. The station 
refined its format in March, 1993, and is seeing its highest ratings in about 
six years. Radio Ratings

FOX WILL BE NO. 1, MURDOCH TELLS PRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corp., the parent of Fox 
Broadcasting Co., made a surprise appearance Wednesday before a gathering of 
television critics in Los Angeles to proclaim that recent upheavals in 
management and the network's historic raid of 12 major affiliates would help 
Fox become the No. 1 network. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are clearly at a pivotal moment in the evolution of the Fox Co.," Murdoch 
said as he addressed the opening session of the Fox portion of the Television 
Critics Assn. summer press tour at the Universal Hilton, where journalists 
preview new fall shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now have our sights set not only on being the fourth network, but on being 
the leading network in the nation," he said. He touted the acquisition of 
National Football League broadcasts, the success of the Fox Children's Network 
and "the strongest prime-time lineup in Fox's history" as key reasons he felt 
Fox would gain supremacy over ABC, NBC and CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdoch alluded briefly to the departure last week of Lucie Salhany, Fox 
Broadcasting Co. chairwoman, who resigned after repeated clashes with Murdoch 
and Fox Television Chairman and Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey. Salhany 
was said to have been increasingly unhappy under Murdoch's hands-on approach 
and Carey's increasing involvement with her division. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to keep an eye on the future," he said. When asked for details about 
Salhany's resignation, he declined to respond, saying it would be "unfair and 
inappropriate." He said Carey would take over Salhany's responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey told the writers that the purpose behind the restructuring "was to 
position the company to take advantage of our unparalleled strengths in our 
combination of business and assets." 
</P>
<P>
 During the session, Murdoch also took a few shots at CBS, saying the rival 
network "has some real problems on their schedule. Their shows are looking 
pretty tired." He said he felt moving the Fox hit "Melrose Place" from 
Wednesdays at 9 p.m. to Mondays at 8 p.m. this fall would be successful because 
the veteran CBS shows on Monday had lost their strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdoch added that he was as surprised as anyone at the failure of the 
proposed merger between CBS and QVC, which came apart Tuesday after a rival 
bidder offered $2.2 billion for the home shopping network.

LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS BLAST PLAN TO DIVERT FUNDS; BUDGET: THE COUNTY 
SHERIFF AND DISTRICT ATTORNEY TELL SUPERVISORS THAT IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO 
VOTERS TO USE MONEY APPROVED FOR PUBLIC SAFETY IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County's top law enforcement officials, fighting to preserve $24 
million in tax revenue set aside for their use, charged Wednesday that county 
leaders would break faith with the voters if they cut funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public understands that times are tough," Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury 
told the Board of Supervisors at a budget study session. "What they won't 
understand is if you take money designated for public safety and use it 
somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 But county board members say a mounting deficit and the specter of 20% cuts in 
every other government department could force them to draw on some of the 
Proposition 172 money they promised the sheriff and district attorney just 
three months ago. The agencies' funds could be cut by as much as 8%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I support law enforcement," Supervisor Maria VanderKolk began, "but that does 
not mean I'm willing to cut everybody. . . . I cannot look at cutting $15 
million out of all of the general fund departments. I won't shut down the 
libraries. I won't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's contentious meeting underscored a key problem facing the 
supervisors in this summer's budget deliberations. After providing the money in 
March to expand the criminal justice agencies, can they now find a politically 
palatable way to cut those same departments? 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the matter is the fact that voters approved the Proposition 172 
sales tax in November specifically for use in public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a breach of public trust for the supervisors to cut the sheriff 
and other administration of justice budgets after the taxpayers gave the county 
an extra $28 million a year," said Michael Saliba of the Ventura County 
Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury and Sheriff Larry Carpenter quoted the supervisors promising to spend 
every penny of the revenue on public safety. The board pledged $24 million to 
expand the departments of sheriff, prosecutor, public defender and corrections 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 But the supervisors have never committed the remaining $4 million, despite 
bids from the Fire Department and area cities for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the $4 million appears in the sheriff's budget for the fiscal year 
that began July 1. But an equal amount of county funds has been taken out for 
use by other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you'd like a street definition, it's money-laundering," Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, nothing in Proposition 172 forbids counties and cities from using 
the money that way. A state attorney general's opinion affirms that communities 
can use it to replace existing funds, rather than to expand services. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, 172 money was not treated as a clear supplement, because 
counties didn't have the money to do that," said Carolyn McIntyre, legislative 
representative for the California State Assn. of Counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Few communities did what Ventura County has done, which is commit the lion's 
share of the money to expand programs, she said. In fact, state lawmakers have 
submitted legislation aimed at forcing cities and counties to provide more 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter what everybody else is doing," Bradbury said. "Not every 
other county in the state made the kind of commitment that this county did." 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors actively campaigned for the ballot initiative and passed a 
resolution promising to spend the money on public safety. Bradbury said he 
would consider a lawsuit or turn to the public if the pledge is violated. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Susan K. Lacey noted that Bradbury appeared before the supervisors 
without requested estimates of what an 8% cut would do to his department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they need to face reality, and the reality is they cannot exist 
without some of these other departments," she said, expressing exasperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacey said Bradbury is already complaining about the county personnel 
department's slow response to hiring new workers for his staff, but is willing 
to see that agency cut by as much as 20% if it would spare his department. 
</P>
<P>
 But cuts in the personnel department would only make the process slower, Lacey 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said an 8% cut in his department would reduce his budget by $4.7 
million, enough money to pay for 65 patrol deputies. But Carpenter said he 
doesn't expect cuts. Rather, he wanted the $4 million in leftover funds added 
to his budget, and he advocated spending some of the money on cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter also said he was worried that the county would try to save money, $1 
million a month, by delaying the opening of the new Todd Road Jail. The State 
Corrections Board has threatened to hold up money for the last phase of jail 
construction if the county delays the expected opening in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg said that option is being 
considered, but has not been discussed by the board.

MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN COUNSELOR'S RAPE; VIOLENCE: JAMES MARTINEZ APPEARED TO 
HAVE TURNED A CORNER WITH WOMAN'S HELP. WHY HE ATTACKED HER REMAINS A MYSTERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 To the counselor who bought him interview clothes and gave him bus fare, 
19-year-old James Michael Martinez seemed to be turning the corner to a better 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the chronic drug user was earning a paycheck, praise from 
his boss and confidence to work beyond his short-term position at a retail 
warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "To everyone involved, it appeared that he was turning his life around," said 
the 46-year-old woman assigned to work with Martinez through a federally 
subsidized jobs program. 
</P>
<P>
 But on June 6, Martinez shattered his own success story in a fit of violence: 
He raped his jobs counselor at knifepoint, tying her hands together with a 
curling iron cord and muffling her cries with a washcloth. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, he appeared in Superior Court wearing a blue jailhouse uniform, 
the tattoos on his neck partly hidden, and pleaded guilty to rape with the use 
of a knife. He faces up to 13 years in prison and is scheduled to be sentenced 
Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Bryant Villagran said Martinez, who grew up in Ventura, 
wanted to plead guilty to take responsibility for his actions and spare the 
victim the pain of a public trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't want her to go through any more trauma," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Villagran and prosecutor Bob Calvert described the case as unusual due to the 
nature of the mentor relationship between Martinez and the woman, and Martinez' 
progress in the jobs program. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez had a previous criminal record -- convictions for drug and property 
offenses -- but had never been arrested for sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seemed to be making proper life decisions and, all of a sudden, he just 
lost his focus," said Sheriff's Detective Cheryl Bassett, who investigated the 
rape. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack occurred at the woman's home in Camarillo on a day he had asked her 
to drive him to two interviews. On the way to the second appointment, Martinez 
got confused about the directions. The woman offered to stop at her home and 
check the company's address. 
</P>
<P>
 As she dialed directory assistance, he knocked on her door and asked to use 
the bathroom. Because she had known him for several weeks and trusted him, she 
said yes. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few minutes, she heard him leave the bathroom. Then she felt a 
chokehold around her neck and a blade pressed to her face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until he said something, she did not know it was him," Bassett said. "It 
didn't occur to her it was him. She thought there was some kind of person 
hiding in her house." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez then took a cord from the curling iron in her bathroom, tied her 
hands and forced her upstairs, where he raped her, Bassett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very quiet and talked to her in a determined way," the detective said. 
"She had screamed and he told her not to do it again or he would hurt her." 
</P>
<P>
 After the attack, the woman tried to calm Martinez, then she drove him home. 
Hours later, she reported the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending much time trying to find a reason for the attack, the woman 
said she has stopped looking for an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just decided I needed to put more energy into myself and my own recovery, 
and I may never know why. I don't believe he knew why," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After being told of his guilty plea, the woman said she felt relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took responsibility," she said. "And that's what I wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that it's even really sunk in yet," she added. "I still know the 
good side of him. I still believe that he will turn his life around again."

PLANS UNVEILED FOR AQUARIUM IN OXNARD; TOURISM: THE THREE-ACRE FACILITY AT 
CHANNEL ISLANDS HARBOR COULD COST UP TO $60 MILLION AND DRAW 1.5 MILLION 
VISITORS ANNUALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Plans for a major aquarium at Channel Islands Harbor were unveiled Wednesday 
by a group of public officials and private citizens who said they expect it to 
become the largest tourist attraction in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 But backers of the proposal, including Supervisor John K. Flynn and developer 
Martin V. (Bud) Smith, acknowledged that financing for the project -- which 
could cost up to $60 million -- has not been worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 The aquarium would be built on county-owned land at the harbor, and the 
county-operated harbor district will fund the initial studies, Flynn said. In 
addition, he said, the county could help pay for the project by issuing revenue 
bonds, which would be repaid with income from the aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith -- who owns more non-agricultural property than any other landowner in 
the county and is one of its wealthiest residents -- said he would also make a 
significant contribution to the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura officials, who hope to build a marine center at Ventura Harbor, said 
they were shocked by the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing they can keep it so quiet," said Ventura Councilman Gregory L. 
Carson, one of the council's most enthusiastic tourism boosters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carson insisted, however, that the Ventura facility would surpass whatever was 
planned for the harbor at Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel Ventura would be a better location," he said. "It's a beach community, 
and our old-town historic area is right on the waterfront." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the prominent names attached to the Channel Islands project -- 
supporters include Rep. Elton Gallegly and state Sen. Cathie Wright (both 
R-Simi Valley) and the mayors of Oxnard and Port Hueneme -- Carson noted that 
Ventura's center has its own star sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have Cousteau working on the project," he said, referring to Jean-Michel 
Cousteau, son of oceanographer Jacques Cousteau. The younger Cousteau has said 
he may want to get involved in the Ventura center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some pretty good names ourselves working on our project," Carson 
said. "But I guess, in the end, it'll all boil down to dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard aquarium on South Victoria Avenue would be modeled after the 
popular Monterey Bay Aquarium and could attract up to 1.5 million visitors 
annually, according to a preliminary study paid for by Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-acre Channel Islands Harbor Aquarium, as the facility would be 
called, could also create up to 1,000 jobs for Oxnard and Port Hueneme, 
according to the study by the Lyon Group, a Los Angeles-based consulting firm 
that assisted with the Monterey aquarium and the recently completed Oregon 
Coast Aquarium in Newport, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a facility that is family-oriented," Flynn said during a 
news conference by the harbor. "We want to give families the experience of 
knowing what is in the ocean and the opportunity to look at what is in the 
ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Channel Islands Harbor Aquarium would include a main tank housing a 
variety of sea life from the Southern California coast, several smaller tanks, 
classrooms for educational use, an auditorium and gift shops. Excursion boats 
to the Channel Islands and whale-watching trips would also depart from the 
facility, Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 A parking site has not been determined, but aquarium backers hope to build a 
lot on a Navy-owned parcel across Victoria Avenue. Navy officials are reviewing 
the requests, which also include building a pedestrian overpass to the aquarium 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for an aquarium at Channel Islands Harbor, which have been discussed for 
years, began moving rapidly three months ago when Smith contacted Flynn and 
expressed interest in supporting such a project. 
</P>
<P>
 The two flew up to Monterey in Smith's plane a few weeks later, and were 
impressed by the Monterey Bay Aquarium and its economic impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said the project would be the most significant aquarium in the region. 
But several California cities have already begun or are planning such 
facilities -- some larger than the Channel Islands Harbor project. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Oxnard and Ventura, the cities of Long Beach, San Pedro, 
Sacramento and Stockton are planning aquarium projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach plans to have a $110-million facility built by 1997 using revenue 
bonds, Long Beach City Manager James Hankla said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hankla said funding aquariums with revenue bonds is a difficult enterprise 
because many aquariums do not pay for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you aren't absolutely certain that you can guarantee the turnstile 
revenue, it will be a failure," Hankla said of the Channel Islands project. 
"You have to prove to the satisfaction of the bond buyers that you are going to 
have many visitors a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said he plans to discuss the revenue bonds option with the other 
supervisors during budget study sessions this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ventura officials and those supporting the Channel Islands Harbor project 
point to the Monterey Bay Aquarium as the model for their centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The successful, nationally renowned project opened in 1984, funded by a 
single, $55-million grant from the Packard computer family. One of the first of 
its kind in the country, the aquarium drew 2.4-million visitors the first year, 
and now admits about 1.4-million visitors a year, spokesman Ken Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers, though, continue to slip a little, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when an aquarium was a golden goose, but I don't know that 
that's a given anymore," he said. "It's not a guarantee of financial success or 
of an influx of tourism." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Monterey Bay Aquarium in 1992 helped draw tourists who spent $214 
million in Monterey.

POLICE NAME SUSPECT IN SLAYING AT RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Homicide investigators Wednesday released the name and photograph of a 
20-year-old gang member who Oxnard police say shot to death a father of two in 
a restaurant parking lot Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Rivas Balderama, arrested two years ago for allegedly shooting at 
rival gang members, is wanted in the slaying of Roberto Calderon Leyva, 35. 
Leyva was shot outside Toppers Pizza Place as his wife and two small children 
watched, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators Wednesday persuaded Judge Ken W. Riley to sign a warrant for 
Balderama's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 But police refused to discuss the search or any other details of the case 
because the judge ordered that the evidence investigators cited in applying for 
the warrant be sealed. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result of this court order, the Oxnard Police Department will issue no 
further statements at this time," spokesman David Keith said in a news release 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Balderama, who lives in the Lemonwood neighborhood of south Oxnard, is accused 
of shooting Leyva moments after the two men exchanged words inside the 
restaurant. A bullet pierced a major artery in Leyva's stomach and he died 
about 10 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses and police said Balderama became upset when Leyva apparently looked 
at Veronica Balderama, the suspect's 23-year-old sister, who was dining at the 
pizza parlor Sunday with her brother and several friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect and his sister drove away in a charcoal-gray pickup truck that was 
later found on El Dorado Avenue in Lemonwood, the street listed as Balderama's 
address on an arrest report from two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 After a short foot chase Sunday night, Veronica Balderama was arrested on 
suspicion of aiding a fugitive. But her brother has eluded police. 
</P>
<P>
 She was released from custody Monday after promising to appear Friday in 
Ventura County Municipal Court for arraignment, a jail official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Balderama was arrested in August, 1992, on a charge of shooting at an 
occupied vehicle, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Balderama and several friends were standing at San Benito Street and Tulare 
Place in the Lemonwood area on June 7, 1992, when a carload of men from La 
Colonia drove by, court records said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court papers, someone from Balderama's group yelled "Lemonwood" 
and then someone inside the passing car yelled back "Colonia." Balderama then 
shot three times at the vehicle, striking its rear but injuring no one, court 
papers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Balderama pleaded not guilty to three counts of shooting at an occupied 
vehicle. He was bound over for prosecution in Ventura County Superior Court, 
but the case was dismissed in December, 1992, after the victims refused to 
identify Balderama as the shooter, court records said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to transcripts from the 1992 preliminary hearing, Balderama is a 
member of the Lemonwood-area street gang known as "Chiques." The occupants of 
the car were identified as Colonia-area gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, friends and relatives of Leyva continued visitation and memorial 
services at Garcia Mortuary in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope that he gets what he deserves for killing my brother," said 
Esperanza Gonzalez, one of Leyva's seven sisters. "All we want is justice." 
</P>
<P>
 A friend of the family who did not want to be named broke down in tears 
Wednesday outside the mortuary when he was shown a photograph of the suspected 
killer. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Balderama is the son of one of his good friends.

 On Friday, there will be an informal discussion and picnic starting at 6 p.m. 
on the grounds around the observatory on the campus, 7075 Campus Road.At 
sunset, telescopes will be set up to look at Jupiter, a day before the comet is 
expected to strike the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see what the planet's atmosphere looks like before it is hit," said Hal 
Jandorf, an astronomy instructor at Moorpark College. "This will be a sort of 
before-and-after program." 
</P>
<P>
 An unusual stream of 21 comet fragments -- each the size of a mountain -- will 
begin striking Jupiter on Saturday, continuing over the next five days. A 
second program at the observatory scheduled Sunday will look at how the first 
fragments to strike the planet will affect its atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's program will begin at 8 p.m. and last until 10:30 p.m., when Jupiter 
sinks too low on the horizon to see. Jandorf said the program will include a 
discussion about comets that have struck the Earth, such as the comet that some 
scientists believe caused the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a $3 charge for those attending Sunday's program. Observatory 
officials suggest that children under age 6 may be too young for the program.

Astronomical Society's Star Line at 529-7813. SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: POOR TRAINING CITED IN HELICOPTER MISHAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An accident last year that destroyed a $1.1-million sheriff's helicopter was 
caused by crew members who were not properly trained to use a machine that 
drops incendiary balls, federal investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The device, used to set controlled burns, was also not properly installed on 
the Bell 206L-3 helicopter, and the Sheriff's Department failed to maintain 
written standards for operation and maintenance of the equipment, the National 
Transportation Safety Board said in its final report. 
</P>
<P>
 The report does not specifically assign blame for the June 30, 1993, accident 
in Agoura Hills. It states that while the helicopter was sitting on a hilltop, 
crew chief Jeff Lawrence reloaded the incendiary machine so that it would be 
ready for the crew's next round of starting controlled burns. 
</P>
<P>
 But the helicopter was improperly wired so that power to the unit was 
controlled by the pilot, not the crew chief, the report says. Pilot Chris 
Spangenberg then inadvertently activated the machine while the helicopter sat 
idled, federal investigators reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A pellet the size of a Ping-Pong ball filled with chemicals dropped and 
exploded below the helicopter, igniting the grass and destroying the 
helicopter. Crew members were able to escape, but Spangenberg suffered minor 
injuries, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the incident, Spangenberg was suspended with full pay for three 
months, then transferred. He now works at the Ventura County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Spangenberg continued to maintain this week that he did not flip any switch 
that started the fire. Spangenberg said he believes that the machine was 
activated by other causes. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is grateful that the final report points out what he believes are 
shortcomings in the sheriff's air unit, from poor training and coordination to 
improper maintenance of the incendiary device, Spangenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. Dick Purnell, who heads up the air unit, said he has instituted several 
changes aimed at preventing further damage to equipment or personnel. Pilots 
and crew now undergo more rigorous training, and a training manual has been 
developed for those who use the incendiary device, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an unfortunate set of circumstances," Purnell said. "We are trying to 
correct it as best we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bell craft has been replaced by a McDonnell Douglas 530-F, Purnell said.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; 4 HORSES REPORTED TAKEN WITHOUT OK 
</P>

<P>
 Four horses from a defunct Moorpark College equine program that were to be 
sold at public auction have been transported to a private buyer without the 
college's permission, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 That means only 12 horses from an original 40 or more in the program will be 
available for sale when the closed-bid auction stops accepting bids at 5 p.m. 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Moorpark College Vice President Darlene Pacheco, representatives 
from the Foxfield Riding Academy in Thousand Oaks took four horses from the 
college's Rancho Sierra Vista facility in Newbury Park without the college's 
permission over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know where they are, but how they got there, I'm not sure yet," Pacheco 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Ann Postel, owner of the private riding stable, would not discuss the case 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Foxfield had made arrangements months ago with the equine program director to 
buy the horses. But college trustees last month nixed that and other sales 
negotiated by Don Anderson, saying the horses should instead be sold to the 
highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 At a trustees' meeting July 5, college President James Walker said most of the 
horses had been sold in the spring without appraisals or public bidding and 
transported to buyers, although about a dozen had not yet been paid for. At 
that time, only 17 horses remained at the Newbury Park facility. A 30-year-old 
stallion deemed worthless by Anderson has been given to a former student. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson retired June 30 from the college and left the area, Pacheco said. 
Anderson's wife Dee, co-manager of the equine program, remains on the college 
payroll, but has called in sick all week, Pacheco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Karen Boone said she has asked the college district's lawyer to study 
the case and present the governing board a list of legal options. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Erich, a Port Hueneme woman interested in bidding on the horses, said 
she watered and fed the remaining horses at Rancho Sierra Vista on Monday 
because no one was there during her seven hours at the ranch. Pacheco said the 
college has retained a part-time caretaker to feed the animals until they are 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacheco said Wednesday that the college has sent out dozens of applications to 
buyers interested in bidding on the remaining horses. The sealed bids will be 
opened Monday or Tuesday, she said. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; THEY'RE GETTING STARRY-EYED AT 
THEATER CAMP 
</P>

<P>
 Ten-year-old Monica Coles fretted over getting her Mary Poppins British accent 
just right, while 13-year-old Ashley Conway wondered if she's capturing the way 
Lucy Ricardo would wring her hands whenever she was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearing the end of a two-week summer theater youth workshop at Cal Lutheran 
University, both girls were working Wednesday on the final touches of a play 
they created with their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The play involves two devious businessmen, their secretary, a magical machine 
and a cast of famous Hollywood characters who somehow emerge together from the 
machine on the day ofthe Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 With an umbrella as a prop, Coles marched across the stage and stopped to 
stare at 13-year-old Shauna Stueve, who is playing Marilyn Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cover up dear; you're going to catch a chill," Coles-as-Poppins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voice and movement teacher Barbara Wegher-Thompson called a brief halt to the 
rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make sure you articulate," Wegher-Thompson told Monica. "If you do, you're 
going to get a laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 The next time through, Monica assumed the properly haughty British tone, 
looking down her nose at Shauna while snapping out the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The class of 25 students, ranging in age from 9 to 14, has met every morning 
for almost two weeks, spending four-hour sessions learning acting, 
improvisation, voice and movement. On their last day Friday, they will perform 
the plays they created as well as a choreographed musical number. 
</P>
<P>
 During a practice for the musical piece, a song from "Grease," the entire 
class milled happily around the stage, shrieking out, "We go together, like 
shobby, dobby, dobby, do-op, do-op." From center stage, Wegher-Thompson 
directed their movements and somehow managed to create order from the bedlam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it does get noisy," said Ken Gardner, director of the workshop and 
an assistant professor of drama at Cal Lutheran. "They get a little hyper. This 
is a creative outlet for them. I don't know if they have that much in school." 
</P>
<P>
 The theater class is in its ninth year at Cal Lutheran and Gardner, who also 
runs the Young Artists' Ensemble in Thousand Oaks, said the program is a 
popular one, with about half the students returning from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of two classes for beginners ends Friday. A second session begins 
Monday, from 1 to 5 p.m. on the Cal Lutheran campus. Spots are still available 
in that class, but a session for advanced performers, ages 11 to 16, is already 
full. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call Gardner at 493-3375. MARY F. POLS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: 5 INJURED IN 3 TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Five people were injured in three separate traffic accidents in western 
Ventura County on Wednesday as their vehicles careened off winding mountain and 
beachfront highways. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2:30 p.m. on California 150, west of Lake Casitas, a passing motorist 
observed a man who had crawled about 100 feet up an embankment alongside the 
winding highway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol officials said the accident apparently occurred 
about 5 a.m. but was not discovered until the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured driver, whose identity was not released, was transported to Ojai 
Valley Hospital where he was reported in fair condition Wednesday night. He 
suffered numbness in one leg and possible back injuries, a nursing supervisor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on California 150 late Wednesday afternoon, a mother and her two children 
suffered moderate injuries when their car careened off Dennison Grade and 
landed about 15 feet down an embankment, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third accident, a 37-year-old Newbury Park man suffered multiple 
lacerations and a broken leg when his car went over the side of the Pacific 
Coast Highway south of Deer Creek Road and landed in rocks along the shore, the 
CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 The southbound lane of the highway was closed for nearly three hours after the 
4:20 p.m. accident, limiting traffic to one lane along the beach route. TRACY

 Five people were arrested Wednesday morning when Ventura police served a 
search warrant at a house in the Ventura Avenue area, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Narcotics investigators raided a Ramona Street home at 7:10 a.m. and arrested 
the five on a variety of charges, including possession of methamphetamines, 
outstanding warrants and parole violations, Sgt. Bill Bogner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested were David Alan Carey and Brenda Joyce Mankinen on suspicion of 
possession of methamphetamines, Ronald Franklin Clark on suspicion of parole 
violation, and Douglas Manning and Christopher Kevin Williams on outstanding 
warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also recovered what is believed to be stolen automotive repair 
equipment at the house, along with knives. The suspects surrendered peacefully, 
Bogner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the suspects remained in Ventura County Jail late Wednesday pending 
bail. The fifth, believed to have violated parole, is being held without bail, 
Ventura County sheriff's deputies said. J. E. MITCHELL

<P>
 Oxnard police and FBI agents Wednesday arrested a 26-year-old man less than 
four hours after a California Federal Bank branch in south Oxnard was robbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Michael Williamson said John William Putnam entered the bank at 2900 
Saviers Road just before 10 a.m. Wednesday, demanded money and escaped with an 
undisclosed amount of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators identified the suspect and staked out Putnam's Lark Street home 
in Oxnard. He was arrested without incident about 1:30 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Auer of the Ventura office of the FBI said Putnam appears to be the same 
man who robbed the California Federal office July 7. 
</P>
<P>
 No money was recovered at the time of Putnam's arrest, police said. JEFF

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; DART PLAYS KEY ROLE WHEN DISASTERS STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the minutes after the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, members of Camarillo's 
emergency citizens patrol quickly checked the safety of their loved ones and 
homes. Then they sprinted to their mobile command center at the city's Palm 
Drive police station. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 30 minutes later, Disaster Assistance Response Team members had the 
command center's auxiliary electrical generators whirring. Electricity flowed 
to flood lamps that illuminated the darkened police station parking lot, and to 
police and fire radios that crackled with emergency messages. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, more of DART's 18 volunteers arrived and began forming 
survey teams to detect quake damage. Still other squads began relaying messages 
over the command center's radios, helping sheriff's deputies and firefighters 
answer calls for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Camarillo suffered little damage, the quake served as a key test of 
the volunteers' effectiveness, said Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Michael 
Lewis, who works with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a great job out there," Lewis said. "Because of their training, they 
were able to do some things that really assisted us in assisting the public." 
</P>
<P>
 But it does not take a natural disaster to activate the team. During last 
week's three-alarm blaze at a medical building on Las Posas Road and last 
year's wildfires, DART members helped with crowd control and shuttled food and 
water to weary firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 The state-certified disaster workers must undergo 80 hours of training before 
they can be deployed, Lewis said. That training includes cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation, first aid, search-and-rescue techniques, traffic and crowd 
control, casualty management and triage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo DART is the only operating team in the county. Similar teams are 
being formed in Thousand Oaks and Moorpark, according to spokesman Mike Pariso. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by the city of Camarillo, which allocates about $20,000 annually for 
command center operation, uniforms, radios and other expenses, the group 
provided an estimated 1,400 volunteer hours in 1993, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pariso said the Camarillo DART, whose members range in age from 18 to 72, are 
not a group of firefighter and police "wanna-bes." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is definitely a sense of adventure connected to what we do," Pariso 
said. "But I think every one of us joined because we wanted to do something for 
our community." JEFF MITCHELL

<P>
 Three Gas Co. employees were burned Wednesday when the gas line they were 
replacing in a Camarillo residential neighborhood exploded, fire officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Schrader of Newbury Park, and Dan Neubauer and Chris Mallory, both of 
Simi Valley, suffered first- and second-degree burns as a result of the blast, 
which occurred about 3:10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 All three were treated and released from Pleasant Valley Hospital, a nursing 
supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers were connecting a new two-inch-wide plastic gas line near Lucero 
Street in Camarillo when the line exploded, fire and Gas Co. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gas Co. officials said they are investigating what triggered the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The men were working in a three-foot-deep hole in the street and bent over the 
pipe when it blew open, authorities said. All three suffered burns to their 
arms, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the men radioed for help after the explosion, and two Gas Co. crews 
working in the area arrived within minutes to shut off the gas line. 
</P>
<P>
 A concentrated flame from the blast rose about 20 feet in the air, fire 
officials said. The fire charred a neighbor's fence, but caused no other 
damage. Gas service to residents in the area was not affected, authorities 
said. TRACY WILSON

BOY ARRESTED AFTER TEEN-AGE GIRL SLAIN IN THOUSAND OAKS; CRIME: THE 16-YEAR-OLD 
FRIEND IS HELD AFTER JACQUELINE ANN REAY, ALSO 16, IS SHOT IN EYE AT 
POINT-BLANK RANGE.

<P>
 A 16-year-old girl was shot in the eye and killed Wednesday by a teen-age male 
friend in the kitchen of a Thousand Oaks condominium, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they did not know what prompted the boy to shoot Jacqueline Ann 
Reay of Thousand Oaks at point-blank range in the 3 p.m. incident. The girl was 
treated at the scene and transported to Los Robles Regional Medical Center, 
where she was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the boy, who was handcuffed at the scene and later arrested on 
suspicion of murder, insisted that the shooting was an accident. Police said 
the 16-year-old boy's name was not released because he is a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the police came and put him in handcuffs, you could tell he was scared," 
said Mike Lowe, 15, who lives next door to the scene of the shooting. "He kept 
saying to the police, 'It was an accident, I swear.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said Reay was visiting the condominium in the 600 block of Avenida del 
Platino to spend time with two girls she met last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the shooting, Reay, the suspect and two other teen-agers were 
in the condo, police said. According to an acquaintance of the two who asked 
not to be named, the boy pulled out a gun and shot Reay at close range as she 
stood in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies who were in the neighborhood on an unrelated 
drug investigation responded to a 911 call from the condo and found Reay 
gravely injured but still alive, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried to resuscitate her and then transported her to the hospital," 
Sheriff's Sgt. Bruce Hansen said. "She was just barely hanging on." 
</P>
<P>
 Reay died at Los Robles at 3:30 p.m., Deputy Coroner Zelmira Isaac said. An 
autopsy was scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies who arrived on the scene shortly after the shooting to beat her up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Reay and the suspect lived in the Las Casitas neighborhood of 
Thousand Oaks, a group of 540 condominiums where police have regularly 
struggled with crime. But, in the past year, residents and city officials said 
the area was showing strong signs of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, police reported that crime in the seven-block neighborhood had 
dropped 30% from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 For Thousand Oaks, a city of 100,000 that boasts a low crime rate, Hansen said 
this type of shooting is "very uncommon." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some crime here," Hansen said, "but rarely do we see a violent act 
like this one."

COUNCIL OKS PLANS AMID WARNINGS OVER WILDLIFE IMPACT; THOUSAND OAKS: THE 
220-HOUSE DEVELOPMENT WOULD RESTRICT ANIMALS ROAMING IN SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bucking dire warnings from local, state and federal environmentalists, a 
majority of Thousand Oaks council members early Wednesday approved a 220-house 
project that will partially block a major wildlife corridor in the western 
Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The luxury houses, to be built in a gated community north of Potrero Road on 
Dos Vientos Ranch, will limit animals roaming through the backcountry to a 
steep, rocky grade instead of a meadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Before approving the project, council members had to vote on a "statement of 
overriding considerations" indicating for the record that they understood the 
"unavoidable adverse" effects on wildlife but deemed the project worthwhile and 
beneficial nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 That 1 a.m. decision, on a 3-2 vote, with Councilwomen Elois Zeanah and Jaime 
Zukowski dissenting, brought sharp criticism from a parade of two dozen 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The National Park Service is convinced that the magnitude of environmental 
and ecological destruction is not justified," Ranger Tony Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction will cut into only one-third of the three-mile-wide swath 
recognized as a wildlife movement corridor. But experts said the doomed mile 
represents the most convenient path for many animals wandering through Dos 
Vientos to the chaparral-cloaked wilderness beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the basic tenets of the National Park Service is preservation of the 
values and ambience (of the Santa Monica Mountains)," Gross said. "The Dos 
Vientos project, as proposed, is not compatible with those values." 
</P>
<P>
 Humans as well as animals could suffer when the project is built, as the new 
homes will increase air pollution, noise and traffic in Newbury Park, according 
to a city-approved environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 And the problems could get worse in the next few decades as several other big 
commercial and residential projects are planned for Newbury Park -- including 
an additional 2,130 houses on Dos Vientos Ranch in later phases of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen Newbury Park residents wearing "Rethink Dos Vientos" buttons told 
the council that their community would lose its rustic tranquillity and 
degenerate into an overbuilt, problem-plagued suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 But developers Operating Engineers offered another forecast during a spirited, 
four-hour hearing that began Tuesday evening and stretched to 1 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer's representative, Bob Levenstein, outlined half a dozen benefits 
that his project would bring to the Newbury Park neighborhood: 
</P>
<P>
 * Operating Engineers and another Dos Vientos developer, Courtly Homes, will 
pay the city a combined total of $12.6 million for the right to build up to 
2,350 houses on the ranch, under a contract negotiated with the council four 
years ago. Both developers will also pay substantial fees for parks, schools, 
roadwork and air quality control. 
</P>
<P>
 * Operating Engineers will preserve 1,000 acres of the most sensitive land as 
open space and fully maintain it forever. The acreage includes most of the 
ridgeline but not the wildlife corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Operating Engineers will build and maintain miles of trails, plus 40 acres 
of parks and playing fields. 
</P>
<P>
 * The developers will also provide sites for day care and a new school, and 
will build an equestrian center to replace the Two Winds stables slated for 
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that developers have spent more than six years devising plans for Dos 
Vientos Ranch, Levenstein added: "It's an extraordinarily important addition to 
the city of Thousand Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 110 residents who packed City Hall on Tuesday night, however, saw 
the project's importance primarily in negative terms. They urged the council to 
consider canceling the contract guaranteeing the developers 2,350 houses on Dos 
Vientos in light of new information about environmental impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the council majority stood by the development agreement, agreeing with 
Mayor Alex Fiore that "a deal's a deal." Breaking the contract, Fiore said, 
would invite multimillion-dollar lawsuits from the developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Schillo and Councilwoman Judy Lazar agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to appease irate residents, Schillo suggested forming a citizens 
committee to monitor the developer's compliance with more than 260 conditions 
tacked on to the project's approval. As watchdogs, the citizens would also 
oversee the developer's efforts to minimize any ill effects from the project. 
</P>
<P>
 A second citizens group would advise the city on how to spend the $12.6 
million in development fees paid by Courtly Homes and Operating Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo also asked the developers to consider preserving part of the 
threatened wildlife corridor by shifting some houses to a parcel now reserved 
for a stable. 
</P>
<P>
 Equestrians have rejected that site as too small, so if developers can find a 
new location for the corral, they could use the plot for houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have objections to working with city staff to redesign the project," 
Levenstein said. But he added that he liked Schillo's proposal "as a matter of 
principle" and said he would "look at it very carefully."

THIS TIME, PUNKY THE DOG'S NOISE-SENSITIVE NEIGHBOR BARKED UP THE WRONG TREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Slurping on a plastic water bottle and rolling belly up in the grass, Punky 
has no clue about the trouble he's caused. 
</P>
<P>
 But his neighbors have a pretty good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 They've been watching, bemused and annoyed, during a long 
neighbor-against-neighbor battle over Punky's barking. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent salvo came this week when a Superior Court jury awarded 
Punky's owners $12,000 after finding that they had been wrongly prosecuted for 
their mutt's high-spirited yaps. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogfight, however, is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
 It all started two years ago when Thousand Oaks resident Calvin Gregory 
complained about Punky, a mixed-breed shepherd belonging to Joe and Genie 
Flores. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory lives next door to Punky, and often works at home. He says the dog 
howled and moaned at every noise. He says he could hear Punky with the windows 
closed and the television on. He says the dog woke him up at night and 
disturbed him during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 So Gregory sent a barrage of protest letters to the Flores family. He had no 
trouble thinking of what to write -- he says he has filed at least seven 
complaints against dogs in the neighborhood since he moved to the Wildwood area 
15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 With this most recent problem pet, Gregory said he received no response. So he 
made a citizen's arrest of Joe Flores in August, 1993. And he asked the city of 
Thousand Oaks to prosecute Flores for a misdemeanor: violating a noise 
ordinance. The city did so. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of the barking dog made it to Ventura County Municipal Court a few 
months later but ended in a mistrial. And the city decided not to press the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could feel the tension in the neighborhood," said Bruce Meredith, who 
lives across the street. "I thought the whole thing was ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to clear Punky's name, Joe and Genie Flores decided to fight back 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
 They filed suit in Superior Court, accusing Gregory of malicious prosecution. 
They asked the jury to order Gregory to pay their legal fees plus compensation 
for stress and wages lost when they took time off work to deal with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 And Monday, after a weeklong trial and several hours of deliberations, the 
jury awarded the couple $12,000 -- $8,000 for punitive damages, $3,000 for 
attorney's fees and $1,000 for lost earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory vowed to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Punky continues to run 10 miles a day with Genie Flores' father, 
nuzzle up to Joe Flores' knees for a cuddle and slurp passersby with a raspy, 
goopy tongue. Being a canine, he also continues to bark. 
</P>
<P>
 At least a dozen neighbors have testified in court that Punky barks no more 
than the average dog, certainly not enough to annoy a reasonable resident. To 
bolster the case, Joe Flores kept a voice-activated tape recorder in his house 
for five weeks last year and found only 11 brief periods of barking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never even hear it," said Sam Mizuno, who lives two doors away from Punky. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get used to a little bit of barking," Darrel Priebe added. "It's part of 
a suburban neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gregory insists that Punky's bark is intolerable -- or, at least, it used 
to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog mysteriously quieted down earlier this year, he said, and he claims 
credit. "We have really helped the animal," Gregory said, suggesting that the 
owners take better care of Punky now. "I'm sure the dog is a lot happier 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 If Punky's happy, so are Joe and Genie Flores. 
</P>
<P>
 They can't quite understand how a barking-dog case could take so much time, 
but they're pleased with the court's recent decision. And they're thrilled that 
Punky has been vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good boy," Genie said, scratching Punky between the ears. "We've never 
had problems with him." 
</P>

TAX OKD FOR PLAN TO RENOVATE SHOPPING CENTER; THOUSAND OAKS: CITY COUNCIL 
APPROVES CREATIVE FUNDING SCHEME FOR JANSS MALL, SEARS PROJECT. UP TO $35 
MILLION IN BONDS ARE TO BE ISSUED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With more fumbling than fanfare, Thousand Oaks City Clerk Nancy Dillon 
unsealed an envelope and began tallying ballots cast in a special election to 
determine whether the city should levy new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 Every affected property owner had voted to accept the assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 Unusual? Surely. Surprising? Not at all. 
</P>
<P>
 For this election involved only two property owners -- those holding title to 
Janss Mall and the Sears department store. And both had asked the city to 
impose the new tax as part of a creative financing scheme to pay for renovating 
the aging shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Approved by the council in a 4-1 vote late Tuesday, the financing plan will 
work this way: 
</P>
<P>
 The city will issue up to $35 million in bonds, selling them to investors to 
generate a pot of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Mall developers will use that money to pay for part of the mall's extensive 
face lift. Earmarked exclusively for public facilities, the bond money will 
cover the cost of landscaping, street improvements and a new parking garage to 
serve both Janss Mall and the nearby Sears store. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers will then pay off the bonds over 30 years through the special 
taxes, levied through a "community facilities district." 
</P>
<P>
 This form of financing should be cheaper than taking out a conventional loan, 
experts said, because interest rates on municipal bonds generally run several 
percentage points lower than bank rates. The potential savings prompted the 
Gregson Trust, which owns the Sears parcel, and Merged Centers, which owns 
Janss Mall, to seek city help. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of council members approved the plan after experts assured them 
that the city would carry no liability if the developers default on payments to 
bond-holders. 
</P>
<P>
 Janss Mall and the Sears building, which are worth at least three times as 
much as the bond issue, will serve as the city's collateral, according to bond 
counsel Paul Thimmig. The city will also own the soon-to-be-built parking 
garage, although Janss Corp. will pay to maintain and operate it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all would like to see a (renovated) Janss Marketplace replace what was 
once a vibrant Janss Mall," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "This is one way we 
can help with minimal liability -- really none, in fact." 
</P>
<P>
 But holding the mall as collateral did not sit well with Councilwoman Elois 
Zeanah, who cast the only vote against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah noted that the city already owns several large parcels, such as the 
former city hall on Hillcrest Drive, and has been unable to sell them for cash. 
"We have mega-million-dollar surplus properties that we can't place," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In her critique of the proposal, Zeanah also suggested that the city's bond 
rating could drop if the mall developers fail to repay investors. 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed, Thousand Oaks' name will be on the bond issue documents, so the 
city's reputation could suffer in case of default, underwriter John D. 
McAllister told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, whenever you have a bad experience -- be it with a ride at Magic 
Mountain or a bond issue -- your perception will be tainted," McAllister said, 
explaining that some investors might shy away from Thousand Oaks bonds in the 
future if the Janss Mall issue turns sour. 
</P>
<P>
 But most municipal bonds are purchased by institutional investors, such as 
mutual fund managers, who have the experience to look beyond the city's name 
and focus on the parties truly responsible for the bond issuance, McAllister 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Renovations on Janss Mall are expected to start this summer after the 
landowners wrap up negotiations with a handful of tenants whose stores will be 
demolished during the construction.

REESE LEAVES LASTING IMAGE OF FRIENDSHIP, DEDICATION; BASEBALL: DEATH OF 
LONGTIME COACH ALLOWS THOSE IN THE ANGEL ORGANIZATION TO SHARE FOND MEMORIES. 
</P>

<P>
 It was four months ago on a sweltering day during the Angels' spring training 
camp when Jimmie Reese stood on the practice field, hitting grounders to 
pitcher Julio Valera. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, who could work wonders with his fungo bat, had Valera moving to his 
left, to his right, back and forth . . . and now panting, Valera bemoaned: 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmie, aren't you getting tired?" 
</P>
<P>
 Reese: "I'm doing just fine, son. You keep standing there, and I'll keep 
hitting them." 
</P>
<P>
 Valera, 25, hung his head in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, who was 92, simply chortled, and then hit another one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll always remember that moment," said Angel owner Jackie Autry, "because 
that's how I want to remember Jimmie. He loved the game like no one else." 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, who died early Wednesday of respiratory failure, always told friends 
that he wanted to leave this world wearing his baseball uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Today at the Fairhaven Memorial Park, Reese will be in a casket, wearing his 
Angel uniform, No. 50. His fungo bat will be at his side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes an organization is judged on all of the players that have left," 
said Tim Mead, Angel assistant general manager, "but the greatest Angel in 
history finished his career right here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who gave Reese a lifetime contract six years ago, already have 
decided to retire his number. The players will wear commemorative patches with 
the words, "No. 50, Jimmie Reese," above the "E" on their uniform. They also 
promised to retire Reese's locker. 
</P>
<P>
 "God, how he loved the game," said former Angel Manager Gene Mauch, his voice 
cracking on the telephone, "and how the game loved him. Baseball was his life, 
and like a lot of us, it was a religion." 
</P>
<P>
 When the players arrived Wednesday for their workout in preparation for the 
season's second half, which resumes tonight against the Baltimore Orioles, they 
looked toward Reese's locker. There was a picture frame with his jersey inside 
it. His fungo bat was in the locker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad day for baseball," Angel left fielder Bo Jackson said. "But I 
don't think we should mourn his death. We should celebrate for all he's done. 
He would have wanted it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys are in good spirits because we know he's in a better place, and all 
we can say is, 'We miss you, mullion.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Mullion" was the word that Reese lovingly called everyone. It was slang for 
being ugly, and no matter if you were Nolan Ryan, Reggie Jackson or Julio 
Valera, you were called a mullion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to make it a point every day to spend at least five minutes with 
him," first baseman J.T. Snow said, "because he was such an inspiration. He'd 
rag us, and we'd rag him right back." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a miracle, of sorts, that Reese was with the Angels last spring. He had 
missed the second half of the 1993 season because of poor health, but there he 
was on the opening day of spring training, showing up daily at 8 a.m., and 
hitting fungoes by 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "He mustered everything he had to be back this spring," said John Sevano, 
Angel vice president. "He wanted to be around everyone one last time. I think 
it was his way of saying goodby." 
</P>
<P>
 Reese spent the entire spring with the Angels, and was there for every home 
game in April. Then, suddenly, he wasn't around. Soon, word came out that he 
was in a convalescent home. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no family to take care of him, and he never qualified for any 
player-pension program, but the Autrys made sure that he was always provided 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 Players popped in when they could to see him. Bobby Knoop, Angel bench coach, 
even visited the day before the Angels left on their 13-day trip. Then came the 
call Tuesday afternoon. Doctors didn't know if Reese would make it through the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi, who gave Reese his company car and personal 
attendant this spring, went to the hospital with Mead. Mario Dalessi, the 
former general manager of the Jolly Roger Inn who named a suite after Reese, 
was there. So was Ben Cook, a longtime Angel fan. 
</P>
<P>
 They stayed with Reese until about midnight. It was time to say their goodbys, 
not knowing whether they'd be seeing each other again. Reese alertly stuck out 
his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good strong handshake," Mead said. "It felt as strong as it was five 
years ago. For a moment there, I thought we were going to arm-wrestle because 
he wanted to take his (oxygen) mask off. That's Jimmie. He may be the most 
loved man I ever met. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, he told us how much Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig owed him in some card 
game about 60 years ago. Now he can go collect it himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Reese entered baseball in 1917 when he was a batboy for Frank Chance of the 
Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League. You know, Tinker to Evers to 
that Chance. 
</P>
<P>
 He played 13 years in the PCL, three years in the major leagues, and spent 22 
years as a coach or manager. Yet, his fame evolved when it became known he used 
to be Ruth's roommate. Everyone wanted to hear a story. 
</P>
<P>
 "People used to want him to tell bizarre stories about Babe Ruth, but he 
wouldn't do it," said reporter Tracy Ringolsby, whose best man was Reese at his 
1978 wedding. "He'd only tell stories about the good things Ruth did for 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, except for the time Ruth hung Jimmie up on a hook on his locker one 
day, hit a homer, and decided to keep hanging Jimmie in the locker until the 
streak ended." 
</P>
<P>
 Reese's greatest trait is that he never had an enemy. He may be the only man 
in the history of baseball that everyone loved, and even more enigmatic, Reese 
loved everyone he met. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent 46 years in the game," said Buzzie Bavasi, former Angel general 
manager, "and I've never heard anyone say anything negative about Jimmie 
Reese." 
</P>
<P>
 There may have been no greater exhibit of Reese's popularity than the 1992 
All-Star game, when he was selected as honorary captain. He walked to a Pacific 
Coast League exhibit with Sevano, and before long, folks started recognizing 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few turned into a crowd," Sevano said, "and a crowd turned into a throng. 
Security wanted to close the place down at 10, but Jimmie wouldn't let them, he 
kept telling them he had to sign the cards for the kids. Jimmie was so happy 
that someone wanted his autograph. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it became 10:30, the crowd had gotten so big that they had to escort 
Jimmie back to the hotel just for protection." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day before the game, Joe DiMaggio spotted Reese. DiMaggio left his 
entourage and walked toward Reese, spending 20 minutes with him reminiscing 
about his days in the Pacific Coast League." 
</P>
<P>
 While it seemed as if everyone knew Reese, in reality, few ever did. They had 
been told Reese was married once, sometime back in the 1920s, but it was taboo 
to bring up what happened. Whenever the subject arose, Reese would grow 
teary-eyed, and walk away. 
</P>
<P>
 He had no family. He was an orphan born in New York City. His real name was 
Hymie Solomon, but he changed it for baseball. Why, it wasn't until after his 
80th birthday party, hosted by Rod Carew in 1981, that they realized he had 
been fibbing about his age all these years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don Baylor and all the fellas presented him with a car," Jackie Autry said. 
"Well, Buzzie went to the DMV to get it registered, and that's when we found 
out that we had just celebrated Jimmie's 83rd birthday, not his 80th." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann: "I think his only family were the people 
he knew in baseball. He brought love into everyone's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can only hope that when your times comes, you will be remembered like 
Jimmie Reese." 
</P>

years, had been Angel conditioning coach since 1972. A1

MIKE DOWNEY: WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; THE GIANTS REACH THIS SUPER BOWL 
</P>

 When we spun the globe to begin this great adventure, Passport to Pasadena, 
there were 154 nations, from Australia to Zaire, fighting for the heavyweight 
soccer championship of the world. Iceland wanted it. The Ivory Coast wanted it. 
Wales wanted it. Now, only two can still win, and the World Cup couldn't do 
much better than this -- Italy vs. Brazil, the clash of the titans.  
</P>
<P>
 Roma vs. Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto vs. Romario. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophia Loren vs. Sonia Braga. 
</P>
<P>
 Come Sunday, sit back and sop up the juiciest of matches. This one is going 
tohave an international flavor, Europe mixing with South America, with a couple 
of three-time champions out to regain their standing as soccer's superpower. 
And remember, it ain't over until the fat tenor sings. 
</P>
<P>
 I can already hear it, and see it, and smell it. 
</P>
<P>
 I can picture the scene Sunday at, say, Cafe Brasil, 10831 Venice Boulevard, 
Los Angeles, home of "The Real Homemade Meal," or at By Brazil, 1615 Cabrillo, 
Torrance, home of "All You Can Eat Brazilian Barbecue," or at 14 Below, 1348 
14th Street, Santa Monica, featuring its big- screen TV at "Brazilian World Cup 
Headquarters," or at Zabumba! 10717 Venice, L.A., with live music every night 
at "The Brazilian Party Place." 
</P>
<P>
 It'll be a hot-time in the old town Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as I can picture the scene at any of Southern California's two or three 
billion Italian restaurants, where a whole ocean of wine is going to get drunk 
Sunday, in happiness or in sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 Who will win? 
</P>
<P>
 I have no idea. This is Frazier vs. Ali. All we can do is put them in the 
center of the arena and let them slug it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Who needs to win? 
</P>
<P>
 "Brazil needs to win the title more than Italy does," claims Bebeto, speaking 
on behalf of his Brazilian teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will make our country better. We need to give Brazil a big present. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to leave any stone unturned until we have won." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil deserves a break. Things are so unstable down there, even the money has 
changed. On July 1, while the players were touring North America, back home the 
entire system of currency switched over to something else. Now these poor guys 
don't even know whether they will be paid off in real or cruzeiro real or if 
they had better cash in those traveler's checks right after going to 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is Carlos Alberto Parreira, the beleaguered Brazil coach, whose 
job security seems to rate right up there with any manager of the New York 
Yankees. Parreira is surprised to find Italy in the final. He thought for sure 
Germany would be there for Pasadena's big party. So did Germany's coach, Berti 
Vogts. So did Germany's former coach, Franz Beckenbauer. And so did, well, 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 But you know how Italy loves a party. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what we have are a couple of dream teams, representing, as Brazilian 
superstar Romario says, the "two great schools of soccer." (Sorry, Berti. 
Sorry, Franz.) 
</P>
<P>
 It was quite a scene in the Rose Bowl parking lot once Brazil headed off 
Sweden, 1-0. A man on a 20-foot bicycle built for three (complete with baby 
seat) pedaled around the crowd, shouting: "Bra-zeeel! Bra-zeeel!" There was 
singing and dancing and there was Moribel Moraes, dropping to her knees to kiss 
the Pasadena cement. 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend, Martha Wade, 26, of Costa Mesa, said: "She came all the way up 
from Brazil just for this. I guess you can see how happy she is." 
</P>
<P>
 One more game like this and she would be even happier. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when California really could be the Brazilian Party Place. 
</P>
<P>
 (Or the Italian.)

JIM MURRAY: WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; SAMBA DOESN'T NEED HARMONY 
</P>

<P>
 It was like a battleship sinking a rowboat -- and taking all day to do it. A 
lion eating a canary but getting a toothache in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil beat Sweden, 1-0. But the Brazilians should be ashamed of themselves. 
It was like a firing squad that kept missing the guy in the blindfold. Talk 
about the tortoise and the hare. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil looked as if it had many more players on the field than Sweden and, 
finally, it did. That came when the Swedish captain got red-carded (given the 
bum's rush) for some arcane infraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden was bigger, slower and blonder. They had great patience. But that's not 
much good in a fight. Even after the game, the Swedish coach, Tommy Svensson, 
admitted, "I must recognize we lost to a much better team." The Swedes looked 
like a guy plugging leaks in a crumbling dike. Their goalkeeper must have 
thought it was raining balls. 
</P>
<P>
 I had a disadvantaged view of the game. I was seated behind a giant television 
set whose picture was hard to see in the light, so, most of the game, I could 
see only half a field. For the first half, I thought the Swedes hadn't even 
showed up. They were never in the part of the pitch I could see. Brazil had the 
ball most of the day. The only guy on the Swedish team who got to touch it was 
the goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 I am glad to be able to hail it as just another victory for disharmony. A blow 
against team spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, when you stop to think about it, Ruth and Gehrig didn't speak to each 
other for years. Didn't stop the Yankees from winning pennant after pennant. 
Tinker and Evers of the famous Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance combination didn't 
speak either. Didn't stop them from making double plays. They wrote poems about 
those. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oakland A's of the early '70s used to fight each other in the clubhouse 
before the game. Then they went out with black eyes and won three World Series 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 So, there really wasn't any reason for panic under Sugar Loaf Mountain in Rio 
or reason for the girl from Ipanema to cry because the two star Brazilian 
players, the Ruth and Gehrig of World Cup soccer, Bebeto and Romario, didn't 
like each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, this wouldn't warm the cockles of a manager's heart. It's all very 
well in baseball, which isn't, after all, a team game so much as a series of 
solos. But you would think that in World Cup soccer the strikers and sweepers 
had to get along with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario was on the record as having given teammate Bebeto a nickname -- the 
Portuguese word for "crybaby." Then he announced on the eve of the Brazilian 
team's departure for the World Cup that he wouldn't fly with Bebeto. He didn't 
particularly want to be in the same country as Bebeto, never mind the same 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was that, between World Cups, they were big rivals on competing 
teams in Spain. It was Nicklaus against Palmer, Dempsey-Tunney. They weren't 
buddies, they were competitors. No love lost. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came the World Cup. You might not want to invite Bebeto and Romario 
to the same party, but on the same team they do nicely, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the scourge of the competition, the Two Horsemen of the Apocalypse. 
Murder and Mayhem. The Boys from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil has scored 11 goals in this tournament. And Romario and Bebeto -- 1 and 
1A -- have scored eight of them. It was Romario who headed in the winning goal 
Wednesday -- in the 81st minute of the game. If he doesn't get his head in the 
way of that ball, they might still be playing. "He got in a very good 
performance with his head," Sweden's goalkeeper was to say. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario (full name: Romario de Souza Farias) is not otherwise noted for good 
performances of the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario is what would be called in our country a "flake." First of all, he 
wasn't married at home plate like our resident flakes but he was married at the 
penalty kick line in the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario likes the penalty line. He spends a lot of his game there. He lets 
Bebeto and the other guys go back and bring up the ball. "Sometimes people 
think I am asleep," he once observed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes he is. He probably took too many shots to the head, but Romario is 
famous on three continents for his formidable eccentricity. He has been known 
to have trouble getting interested in a game when he doesn't have the ball. And 
sometimes even when he has the ball. His teammates have been known to complain. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer players are itinerant peddlers shopping their wares -- the ability to 
kick a round ball with reasonable accuracy in any direction including back over 
their heads -- to the highest bidder. Soccer players are like watchmakers or 
diamond cutters. Not everyone is willing to invest the time to get good at what 
they do. So they're in great demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario and Bebeto (his real handle is Jose Roberto Gama de Oliveira, so the 
press is glad he has any nickname) are now the Terrible Twosome of the 
tournament. On the same team, they constitute a monopoly, a restraint of trade. 
God help Italy, which has only a Baggio or two to handle them. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario is celebrated for hanging a left hook on the jaw of a rival player in 
the Spanish league this January. He had to jump to do it. He's only 5 feet 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Bebeto is bigger, rangier and, in general, happier -- or less temperamental -- 
than Romario. 
</P>
<P>
 The two had a celebrated reconciliation of sorts for purposes of solidarity on 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 But they didn't really need it. It's hard to improve on getting to the edge of 
winning the World Cup. No one said you had to like each other. The Swedes are 
one big happy family. That might be their trouble right there. They stick 
together. Down around their goal line. They might need somebody who sulks if he 
doesn't get the ball. Or calls a news conference to announce he won't ride on 
the team plane with anyone who won't get it to him. A little feud may not be 
all that bad for the team. Just ask the Oakland A's. Or the '27 Yankees. Love 
is overrated as a team strategy.

BASEBALL AMBASSADOR REESE DEAD AFTER 78 PRO SEASONS; OBITUARY: ANGEL COACH AND 
FORMER MAJOR LEAGUE PLAYER WAS BABE RUTH'S ROOMMATE. HE WAS 92. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was Babe Ruth's roommate. He was Nolan Ryan's and Reggie Jackson's best 
pal. But to those close to him, Jimmie Reese will always be remembered for the 
man he was, not the men he knew. 
</P>
<P>
 His love of the game buoyed him through 78 seasons of professional baseball -- 
from batboy for the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League in 1917 to 
conditioning coach and fungo hitter extraordinaire for the California Angels in 
1994 -- and along the way he lifted the spirits of countless managers, coaches, 
players, clubhouse personnel and sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese died Wednesday morning at a hospital in Santa Ana. He was 92, and in his 
22nd season with the Angel organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Said owner Gene Autry: "I was very fond of Jimmie Reese. He's one of the 
finest men I've ever known. We will miss him, I'll tell you that. He was a 
wonderful, wonderful man." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Autry's wife, Jackie: "He represented the best part of baseball. . . . 
He was an extraordinary gentleman. We should get his fungo bat and put it in 
the Angel Hall of Fame." 
</P>
<P>
 Reese broke into professional baseball with the minor league Oakland Oaks in 
1924 and six years later was purchased by the New York Yankees. With the 
Yankees, he roomed with the legendary Ruth, an association that provided Reese 
with a collection of tales that never failed to mesmerize listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, he became mentor and close friend of players such as Ryan, 
Jackson and Jim Abbott, but few who crossed his path were untouched by his 
sincerity, his good nature and his uncanny ability to make people smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, born in New York City Oct. 1, 1901, spent three seasons in the majors, 
two with the Yankees and one with the old St. Louis Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 It was as the former roommate of the notorious, fun-loving Ruth that Reese 
gained most of his fame. And he enjoyed every minute of it. 
</P>
<P>
 He once said that if he lived to be 100, he would never forget Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friendship with Babe meant that I walked the streets of New York with 
him," Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wanted to be around him. People would yell his name or just run up 
and touch him. A lot of times people would ask him for money. Times were hard 
in those days. Babe would give a guy $10 and say, 'OK, you owe me.' But he knew 
he'd never see the guy again." 
</P>
<P>
 But hanging around Ruth had its price. Once when the Yankees were in St. 
Louis, Reese said, Ruth's wife ordered him to drive Babe from the hotel to the 
ballpark. Make sure there were no stops, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went out a side door and got in his 16-cylinder Packard," Reese recalled. 
"And there was a lady in a parked car. The Babe said we were going to take a 
little detour. 
</P>
<P>
 "We followed her a couple of miles to an apartment. The Babe told me to read a 
book or two. An hour or so later he came out puffing. He lit a cigar and said 
we better get to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Infield practice was on when we arrived. Manager Bob Shawkey said hi to the 
Babe. But to me he said, 'Where the hell you been, Reese?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Shawkey had to come up with something, so he told me, 'Reese, I think you're 
bad company for Babe to keep.' I all but fell over, but Babe thought it was a 
howl." 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Reese's favorites was Ryan. The former pitcher and Reese became 
friends when Ryan and Reese both joined the Angels in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 The first day of spring training, Reese, with his famous fungo bat, chased 
Ryan all over the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is that guy?" Ryan asked. "He's going to kill me the first day." 
</P>
<P>
 They ultimately became close friends, and one of Reese's prized possessions 
was the baseball Ryan used to complete his fifth no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea how we became friends," Reese once said. "I must be at least 
10 years older than he is." 
</P>
<P>
 From the time he was hired as batboy in 1917, Reese never missed a summer's 
participation in the national pastime until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 What doctors called a coronary occlusion threatened his career but after 
missing most of the 1991 season, Reese was back in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels announced at the time that Reese had been signed to a lifetime 
contract and would not have to do any more traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese began his playing career in 1924 with the Oakland Oaks of the PCL as a 
second baseman. In 1930, along with another infielder, Lyn Lary, Reese was sold 
to the Yankees. The price for the pair was $125,000, at the time a 
record-breaking figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese played 232 major league games, batting .278. He was a deadly 
pinch-hitter, getting 15 hits in 33 at-bats for a .455 average. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, a slick-fielding second baseman who averages .278 would last a 
decade. Unfortunately, Reese broke in the year the majors had their liveliest 
baseball. In 1930, nine of the 16 teams averaged better than .300. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to the Pacific Coast League in 1933, then retired as a player 
after the 1938 season, having spent 13 seasons in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 After retiring as a player, Reese served as scout, manager and coach, finally 
joining the major league Angels in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1927, after hitting .337 for Oakland, Reese was given a "Jimmie Reese Day," 
$1,000 and a suitcase full of clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-two years later, there was another "Jimmie Reese Day." The Angels 
honored him in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese said he was mystified by the day in his honor. All he ever wanted to do, 
he said, was play, watch, teach and talk baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese had no survivors. Donations may be made in Reese's name to the Jackie 
Robinson Foundation, 3 West 35th St., 11th floor, New York, N.Y., 10001-2204; 
and Amigos de los Ninos, P.O. Box 2602, La Habra, Calif., 90632-2602. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be visitation from noon to 7 p.m. today at Fairhaven Memorial Park, 
1702 E. Fairhaven Ave., in Santa Ana. Memorial Services will be conducted at 1 
p.m. Friday at the Samsvic Chapel, Calvary Church of Santa Ana, 1010 N. Tustin, 
Santa Ana.

RAIDER LINEBACKER MAKES QUICK ASCENT; PRO FOOTBALL: BIEKERT EXPECTED TO START 
AFTER UNREMARKABLE ROOKIE SEASON IN '93. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tell most fans that the starting middle linebacker for the Raiders is Greg 
Biekert and their response is, "Who?" 
</P>
<P>
 But tell folks back in Colorado and Iowa, who knew Biekert growing up, and 
their response would most likely be, "How?" 
</P>
<P>
 Greg has boldly gone where no Biekert has gone before. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Dave, wasn't an outstanding athlete and has been in the computer 
business for the last 30 years. The athletic careers of both of Greg's brothers 
ended when they graduated from high school. One became a police officer, the 
other a rancher. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior Biekerts have quickly learned to appreciate their son's unexpected 
accomplishments. They attend a couple of Raider games a year and watch all they 
can on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife, Sheila, and I always tell people that Greg got his ability from the 
other one," said his father. "Greg says it came directly from God." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question the ability is there. Greg has all the attributes a 
linebacker needs -- speed, toughness, instinct and an understanding of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 At Longmont High in Colorado, Biekert was an all-state pick after amassing 100 
tackles and eight sacks in his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 At Colorado, he became the school's all-time leader in solo tackles, and in 
his senior year was all-conference and honorable mention All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only in that senior season that Biekert began to think that maybe he 
wouldn't be using his marketing major for a while, that maybe he could make 
some money playing football. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders thought so too, drafting him in the seventh round in 1993, the 
181st player taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Guys in that position rarely set the NFL afire in their first seasons and 
Biekert was no exception. He played in every game, but mostly on special teams, 
taking his place at linebacker only when the outcome of the game had been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem for Biekert. He knew he had a lot to learn at a position where he 
would be responsible for calling out the coverages for a squad that had some 
veterans who were pros when Biekert was still a kid. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Raiders, he had to grow up fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Colorado, we would have 15 to 20 coverages with some adjustments," Biekert 
said. "Here, we might have 50 with adjustments on each." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Haslett, the Raider linebacker coach and the man who became the team's 
biggest Biekert booster after seeing him at Colorado, has no doubt the 
6-foot-2, 240-pounder can handle the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a good nose for the ball and he's very intelligent," Haslett said. "If 
I ever had a problem with him last year, it was getting him to run the show, 
telling people what to do. He didn't take the bull by the horns. Maybe it's 
because he's young, but he didn't let everybody know who he is." 
</P>
<P>
 That was understandable. Biekert was a rookie last season and veteran Joe 
Kelly was running the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Biekert, 25, had plenty of time to learn. Or so he thought. 
</P>
<P>
 But suddenly, in the midst of the off-season, Kelly was gone, cut because of 
salary-cap considerations and his lack of speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, there was a big hole in the middle of the Raider defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the spotlight was on Greg Biekert. 
</P>
<P>
 His major competition for the starting job at middle linebacker is Rob 
Fredrickson, the team's top draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fredrickson is not at training camp, holding out while contract 
negotiations continue. 
</P>
<P>
 And even when he arrives, Fredrickson will have more to tackle than running 
backs. He is an outside linebacker who must learn to play inside. And he is a 
college player who must learn to play with the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 Biekert went through all that last year, but he proved a quick study. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would know what I did wrong right away," he recalled. "They didn't have to 
say anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes there won't be much to say this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know all the guys now," Biekert said. "I'm a lot more comfortable and a lot 
more confident. Once you learn, you can start to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the experience can make all the difference. It's tough enough for a 
linebacker who recognizes what is going on in front of him to break through the 
physical barriers in his path, find the man with the ball and tackle him. For a 
novice linebacker who loses that first step because he's still trying to figure 
out what's happening, it sometimes seems impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't be thinking while you're playing," Biekert said. "You have to 
anticipate. If the ball is snapped and you're still thinking, you're going to 
be in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though training camp is less than a week old, Haslett already sees the 
difference in Biekert. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not afraid to tell people what to do now," Haslett said. "He's helping 
the younger guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Can Biekert hold off Fredrickson and win the starting job? 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he does won't affect his standing in the Biekert household back in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents couldn't care less whether I became a football player or not," 
Biekert said. "As long as my brothers and I are happy with what we do, they're 
proud of all of us."

 Former New York Giant quarterback Phil Simms effectively announced his 
retirement Wednesday when ESPN said he had joined the cable network as a studio 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38-year-old Simms, released by the Giants in June, will appear on ESPN's 
"NFL Prime Monday" and also will play an undetermined role in the network's 
Sunday studio coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Simms said last week that once he made a decision on joining a network -- he 
also interviewed with Fox -- that would be it for his football career even if a 
team called with an offer for him to play. "We are very impressed with Phil's 
ability to communicate," ESPN executive editor John Walsh said. "ESPN is the 
network for the real NFL fans. Phil will fit right in." 
</P>
<P>
 Simms spent 15 years with the Giants, leading the team to two Super Bowls. 
Last season, Simms went to his second Pro Bowl after completing a career-high 
61.8% of his passes while leading New York to the conference semifinals.

<P>
 Junior, 34, a 13-year NFL veteran, is expected to retire.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; FOLSTON, A SECOND-ROUND PICK, SIGNS

<P>
 The Raiders signed another of their 1994 draft choices, James Folston of 
Northeast Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Folston, a second-round pick who has played both at linebacker and in the 
defensive line, will be tried at outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have three of their six draft choices signed. Still out are No. 1 
pick Rob Fredrickson, a linebacker from Michigan State; third-round selection 
Calvin Jones, a running back from Nebraska, and fourth-round choice Austin 
Robbins, a defensive lineman from North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Also signed was free agent Mike Alexander, a wide receiver originally picked 
by the Raiders in the eighth round of the 1988 draft. Alexander has since 
played for the Buffalo Bills, the San Francisco 49ers and the Calgary 
Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders continue to talk to fullback Tom Rathman. The unrestricted free 
agent, who made $985,000 last season with the San Francisco 49ers, has 
reportedly been offered $600,000 a year for each of the next two seasons by the 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest the 49ers wanted to go to retain Rathman was $450,000 to $500,000 
a season. "I think he's probably leading south," said John McVay, 49er vice 
president. "We have an offer out there to him. The coach has assured him of 
every opportunity to compete for the position." STEVE SPRINGER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams continue to keep an eye on the off-season weight of second-year 
tailback Jerome Bettis, who weighed in at 247 pounds, seven over his playing 
weight, during mini-camp in May. But Bettis worked with a personal trainer in 
June, and offensive coordinator Chick Harris is confident the focal point of 
the team's offense will be in shape by early training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll lose that (seven pounds) in the first two days of camp," Harris said. 
"We know he'll be in here at his weight. His mom even called me the other day 
and said she can't cook for him anymore. No more pork chops or sweet potato pie 
for him. He's off that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Isaac Bruce, a second-round draft pick who agreed to terms on a 
three-year contract Tuesday night, is expected to sign by the end of the week. 
Bruce's deal leaves the Rams with only one of their 10 draft picks unsigned -- 
first-round selection Wayne Gandy. . . . Outside linebacker Roman Phifer was 
held out of workouts Wednesday after straining his right hamstring Tuesday.

WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; COMMENTARY; STARS LEAVE EARLY, BUT WORKERS NEVER 
QUIT 
</P>

<P>
 Italy beat Bulgaria, 2-1, in the semifinals of World Cup '94 before a crowd of 
77,094 Wednesday at Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands. The stars of the game 
were Demetrio Albertini and Pierluigi Casiraghi for Italy and Trifon Ivanov and 
Yordan Letchkov for Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 What about Roberto Baggio and Hristo Stoitchkov? 
</P>
<P>
 Forget them. You can read 25 stories and 25,000 words about those two today. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the superstars. They scored all the goals, Baggio two for Italy and 
Stoitchkov the one for Bulgaria. They will be idolized, romanticized and 
drooled over in newspapers from Harrisburg to Heidelberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Their huge talents notwithstanding, they're a bit too much upon occasion -- 
soccer soap operas, if you will. Wednesday was one of those occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio's two goals, scored five minutes apart midway in the first half, were 
things of beauty and joys forever for the highlight film guys. Stoitchkov, with 
his exceptional left foot, scored a penalty-kick goal after a teammate was 
fouled in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 That made it 2-1 going into the second half. After that, the game degenerated 
into a full-scale Shakespearean drama, with a couple of minutes of soccer 
sprinkled in here and there. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 67th minute, Baggio made a one-on-one run into the penalty area, but 
the ball was stolen from him as he was about to make his final reverse move. He 
stopped dead-still while the play headed back upfield, then limped a bit and 
slowly made his way to the sideline to be attended to. He left his team a man 
short for a minute and a half, then returned for a few halfhearted minutes 
before leaving for a substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio said he "felt a very sharp pain," and his coach, Arrigo Sacchi, said 
the injury was to "a stretching muscle in one of his two legs." The Italians 
said they would know more today about Baggio's status for Sunday's final in the 
Rose Bowl. Take all the money you've got and bet that he'll play. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoitchkov, for whom the term prima donna was invented, strutted and sulked 
through most of the game and berated his teammates when the ball was not placed 
perfectly on his left foot, within 15 yards of the goal, which, of course, it 
never was. Stoitchkov strolled the flanks, took a few halfhearted runs at long 
passes and showed his intensity mostly while sprinting to spots to take free 
kicks and the penalty kick earned by the hard digging of others. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 75th minute, Stoitchkov took a long run to the penalty area, similar to 
Baggio's about eight minutes earlier. He, too, lost the ball. He, too, stopped, 
bent over for a while, then moved slowly back into play. Four minutes later, 
he, too, was relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, with still more than 10 minutes to play, his team trailing by 
only one goal and a spot in the World Cup final on the line, Stoitchkov came 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, he said he "had trauma" in his leg and his coach, Dimitar Penev, 
said he took Stoitchkov out so he would be OK for the third-place game. The 
third-place game. He actually said that. Maybe this game won't make it in this 
country, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 All this time, as the theatrics of the stars held center stage, the worker 
bees, the blue-collar guys from both teams, were running and tackling and 
digging deep with every ounce of energy they could summon. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's Albertini set up the first goal with a pretty lead pass to Baggio, 
then kept the game flowing nicely Italy's way with his smooth play at midfield. 
Casiraghi, the Italian striker who isn't Baggio, worked hard for angles and 
passing lanes and ran the forward wings tirelessly. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria's bearded Ivanov and balding Letchkov, the hair-everywhere and 
hair-nowhere duo, also worked all day. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanov started guarding Baggio after the Italian star had scored his second 
goal and was threatening to turn the game into a rout. Soon, he had bashed 
heads with Baggio, badly bruising his own shoulder and breaking part of one of 
Baggio's teeth. At the end, long after Baggio and Stoitchkov had left and 
everybody else was on the verge of exhaustion, defender Ivanov was sprinting 
down on offense and taking flying headers off wild passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Letchkov, whose penalty kick after overtime had clinched Bulgaria's 
advancement against Mexico, and whose header beat Germany in the quarterfinals, 
also worked nonstop until the final whistle. When Stoitchkov left, Letchkov was 
the only real chance Bulgaria had, and he never quit attacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Albertini, Casiraghi, Ivanov and Letchkov were the guys in the trenches, the 
pulling guards and pass-blocking tackles. If they played baseball, they would 
squeeze home the winning run; in basketball, they would dish off on a 
two-on-one break. 
</P>
<P>
 While those guys showered, Baggio and Stoitchkov took their curtain calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio, who had wept in the middle of the field at game's end and timed his 
exit to be last off the field, told reporters, "I cried so much because this is 
my work, my life. It is made of sweat and tears." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoitchkov blamed the referee for the loss, saying he called a bad game 
against the Bulgarians because he was French and Bulgaria had beaten out France 
for a spot in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 He also praised Baggio like a man who had a gun to his head: "He did what the 
team expected of him." 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Albertini, Casiraghi, Ivanov and Letchkov were long gone, probably 
out gassing up the team buses.

SOCCER / GRAHAME L. JONES; WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; ITALY SHOWS GRACE, 
BULGARIA LOSES CHARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "After the match is when you do the analysis," Bulgaria's Hristo Stoitchkov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it can hardly be done beforehand, can it? 
</P>
<P>
 But then, the Bulgarians got just about everything backward on Wednesday, 
losing to Italy, 2-1, and seldom looking anything like the team that had beaten 
Argentina and Germany on its way to the World Cup semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the Italians were quick, the Bulgarians were slow. Where the Italians 
were inventive, the Bulgarians were uncomplicated. Where the Italians were 
daring, the Bulgarians were dull. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams are now headed for Pasadena, but one will be playing in a largely 
meaningless third-place game Saturday and the other will be playing for the Cup 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 12-year wait, Italy is back in the World Cup final. Only one member of 
this Italian team -- defender and captain Franco Baresi -- was on Italy's 1982 
World Cup-winning squad. And back then Baresi was a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, even though he is recovering from an injury and diagnostic surgery only 
three weeks ago, Baresi could be called on to step onto the greatest soccer 
stage of all and play in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 If he does, it will be a fitting climax to a marvelous international career. 
But that's another story. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason Italian Coach Arrigo Sacchi might be forced to play Baresi is that 
central defender Alessandro Costacurta made the biggest mistake of his career 
Wednesday, fouling Stoitchkov and earning a second yellow card that will keep 
him out of the final. 
</P>
<P>
 It was virtually the only serious error the Italians made on an afternoon when 
they entertained a Giants Stadium crowd of 77,094 with what was unquestionably 
their best performance of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Led, not surprisingly, by Roberto Baggio, Italy was unstoppable during one 
10-minute spell midway through the first half. That's when Baggio scored his 
two goals and had the fans tossing flags at him in delight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulgarians, whose defense had been one of the team's strongpoints, had no 
answer for Baggio, who danced past both Zlatko Iankov and Petar Houbtchev 
before slotting the ball past goalkeeper Borislav Mihaylov for his first goal. 
</P>
<P>
 On his second, he simply outran the defense and fired a superb pass from 
Demetrio Albertini beyond Mihaylov's reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like that it was 2-0 and the game was, for all intents and purposes, 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's performances had been sporadic during its first five games, with 
occasional touches of inspiration surrounded by hours of plodding play. Beset 
by injuries and suspensions, the Azzurri seemed incapable of 90 minutes of 
coherent soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 All that changed Wednesday. With Baggio and the unheralded Pierluigi Casiraghi 
playing as twin strikers up front and the midfield of Nicola Berti, Albertini, 
Dino Baggio and Roberto Donadoni winning the majority of its battles, the 
Italians were in command from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Albertini was especially effective. He started by probing the Bulgarian 
defense for weaknesses with long passes into the penalty area, then, after 
Baggio had given Italy the lead, began firing a few shots himself. The first of 
these could easily have found the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Benarrivo, whose excellent play at left back has made him one of the 
discoveries of this tournament, started the move when he dribbled past Ilian 
Kiriakov on the left wing and crossed to Roberto Baggio, who played the ball 
back into the path of Albertini. 
</P>
<P>
 Albertini unleashed a fierce shot that slammed into the right post before 
being cleared. Seconds later, Albertini fired another stinging shot that 
Mihaylov did well to tip over the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
 This span of excellence was climaxed by Roberto Baggio's second goal. From 
then on, it was simply a matter of playing out the last hour. The game's 
quality dropped perceptibly, especially after Stoitchkov had cut Bulgaria's 
deficit in half. 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing worth noting in the second 45 minutes. Bulgaria did not have 
the talent to pierce Italy's back four of Roberto Mussi, Costacurta, Paolo 
Maldini and Benarrivo, and goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca was seldom troubled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulgarians later complained that referee Joel Quiniou of France had twice 
denied them penalty kicks and was perhaps biased against Bulgaria. The claims 
were ludicrous and served only to impugn the reputation of a capable and 
experienced official. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy was the better team and Italy is in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the match is when you do the analysis," Stoitchkov said. 
</P>
<P>
 But all he did was complain.

WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; AFTER SOME OF BEST, IT'S THE WORST FOR ITALY; 
SOCCER: TWO QUICK GOALS SHOW ITALIANS AT THEIR FINEST, BUT COSTACURTA WON'T BE 
AROUND TO PLAY IN THE FINAL ON SUNDAY.

 There were five magic minutes when the soccer was exquisite, al dente. The 
crowd was loud and friendly, the sun shone and fortune smiled. But not even 
winning calms the stormy passage of the Italian team that has climbed to near 
the pinnacle of the soccer world. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a big, loving but fractious family, a good time is never had by all. In 
victory Wednesday, Italy advanced from unresolved contretemps to fresh 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Hero Roberto Baggio wept with joy: "This is my work, this is my life. It is 
made up of sweat and tears. This time I cried because I am very, very happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Goat Alessandro Costacurta could not be consoled. The 28-year-old AC Milan 
defender helped win a game, but lost every player's dream and stalked off the 
field in disgust. In the first half he was part of an in-the-box flurry that 
gave Bulgaria its penalty kick goal. In the second, he fouled another attacker 
and received a yellow card, his second. It will keep him out of Sunday's final 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that we have made the finals still hasn't hit me emotionally," said 
Italian captain Paolo Maldini, "but we all are very upset about Costacurta. A 
player may get only one chance in his life to play in a Cup final." 
</P>
<P>
 Costacurta was conspicuous by his absence after the game, but every Italian 
player seemed eager to commiserate, a platoon suddenly missing one of its squad 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd give anything if he could play," said midfielder Roberto Donadoni. Said 
midfielder Demetrio Albertini, another AC Milan teammate: "We have another 
chance to show our stuff. My feelings are all with Costacurta. He's a 
charismatic leader and we're going to miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of Costacurta, injured captain Franco Baresi and the suspended 
Mauro Tassotti will complicate Italian defensive strategy in Pasadena on 
Sunday, just as it will add new scenes to the theatrical Italian quest for an 
unprecedented fourth World Cup championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with great tradition and some of the best players in the world, Italy 
has seemed more novice than nifty for much of its 1994 Cup trail. 
</P>
<P>
 It qualified with difficulty in its European group, played indifferently in 
pre-tournament warm-ups and lost its first Cup game to Ireland. It had to come 
from behind to finish third in its group, and needed last-minute dramatics to 
beat second-round and quarterfinal opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Under iron-willed Coach Arrigo Sacchi, it has been a draining month in 
America, both for the players and for Italian fans who deported themselves in 
the streets and fountains of major cities until the wee hours this morning. "A 
heart pill Cup," an Italian commentator joked. 
</P>
<P>
 American summer heat has particularly sapped the Italians, despite Draconian 
conditioning under Sacchi, a former AC Milan coach. It was a stifling 93 
degrees in the steamy Meadowlands at game time Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 All week, the Italian press has quoted Italian players, complaining about the 
heat and Sacchi's demands that Italy play a hard, running, pressing game. 
Commentators have urged a more controlled, Brazilian style of play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Italy came out running again Wednesday, and for five breathtaking minutes 
in the middle of the first half it played some of the best soccer America has 
ever seen. Roberto Baggio scored twice, and two other attacks came close, to 
the delight of 77,094, most in buoyant red, white and green. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were moments there in the first half when I thought it could have been 
4-0," midfielder Dino Baggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 The brilliance seemed to prove the value of Sacchi's pressing style of play, 
but as it did in the quarterfinal against Spain, Italy quickly wilted in the 
heat and wound up hanging on in exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to keep that rhythm up," Roberto Donadoni said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our best game for the first 35 minutes, but then after the penalty the 
heat slowed the game," Dino Baggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Can Italy risk running out of steam against formidable Brazil on Sunday? That 
key question, together with the question mark of Roberto Baggio's injured leg, 
is bound to fuel family debate within the lively Italian camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Sacchi seems to thrive on the mini-controversies and jostling within La 
Famiglia , as much as he welcomes the sense of unity that emerges when a player 
like Costacurta is lost to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy, says Sacchi, has progressed steadily during its bumpy American sojourn. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look back at how we started in this very stadium (losing to Ireland), 
you will have to consider that in soccer, as in life, nothing is certain," he 
said.

 After it was over, after Bulgaria's dream machine was left broken and battered 
in a 2-1 semifinal loss to Italy, Hristo Stoitchkov was asked if God was still 
a Bulgarian. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," the temperamental striker said. "But the referee was French." 
</P>
<P>
 And in soccer, that might mean more. At least it did to Bulgaria on Wednesday 
at the Meadowlands where the World Cup's surprise team finally met a match it 
did not like. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone wearing the white, green and red of Bulgaria thought Joel Quiniou, 
the referee, not Italy, was the problem. The consensus from coach to players to 
the Bulgarian press was Quiniou missed two crucial calls in the second half 
that would have given Bulgaria a good chance to send the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today it was again proven the officiating of this World Cup was among the 
weakest in the history of World Cups," said Stoitchkov, who was replaced in the 
79th minute because of a slight leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it was East European suspicions left over from the Cold War, but the 
Bulgarians had reason to question the choice of Quiniou as their referee. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it was last November in Paris that Emil Kostadinov scored in the 
last minute to eliminate France from World Cup '94. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it was a mere coincidence that this referee was chosen," 
Stoitchkov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kostadinov was involved in the first controversial play midway through the 
second half when he dribbled through the Italian defense into the penalty box. 
The ball took a high bounce and hit Alessandro Costacurta's hand. Kostadinov 
said it was intentional. 
</P>
<P>
 Quiniou did not see it that way, and he probably was right. When the ball 
accidentally hits a defender's hand, play continues. Otherwise, Bulgaria would 
have earned a penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "The referee had the whistle in his mouth, and then he looked at the linesman 
and changed his mind about blowing the whistle," said Borislav Mihaylov, 
Bulgaria's goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 The second controversial play came near the match's end when Yordan Letchkov 
collided with Roberto Mussi on the right side of the goal. Bulgaria wanted a 
free kick, but Quiniou did nothing. Both players were going for the ball and it 
was difficult to determine if a foul was committed. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Dimitar Penev of Bulgaria thought his team deserved one call, if not 
both. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two is too much," he said. "Maybe one would have been fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria's defeat did not detract from its brilliant performance in the 
tournament; it has a chance to finish third in the world. Its sudden rise in 
international soccer still is difficult to fathom. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine years ago, it seemed Bulgaria would never develop a serious soccer 
program. During a 1985 match pitting Levsky Sofia against CSKA, the army team, 
a riot broke out when players, coaches and fans charged the Communist regime 
fixed the game in CSKA's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 While fans brawled in the stands, Stoitchkov and CSKA teammate Nasko Sirakov 
fought with Mihaylov in the tunnel leading to the locker rooms. They were 
suspended for life but reinstated after seven months -- in time for World Cup 
qualifying in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard feelings have never ceased, but the three have been instrumental in 
leading the 1994 national team. 
</P>
<P>
 A bigger obstacle was gaining international experience until the breakup of 
Communist East Europe. Sirakov, Bulgaria's leading scorer in last year's club 
league, was the first to play abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, others followed and more than half of the World Cup team is playing in 
West Europe now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to worry about what the government says anymore," Mihaylov 
said. "That has been the secret." 
</P>
<P>
 Now there are other problems, namely, money. After Bulgaria's victory over 
France in Cup qualifying, federation president Valentine Mihov offered $100,000 
bonuses to players. 
</P>
<P>
 The federation was unable to deliver, which caused an uproar on the eve of the 
World Cup. Players were mollified with $25,000 bonuses, but not before Mihov 
was forced to resign a few weeks before the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's settled now," said Hristo Danov, federation vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything except that French referee.

WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; THEY WERE A MAN SHORT ALL DAY LONG; SWEDEN: IF 
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT, ASK THE SWEDES, WHO COMPLAIN THAT THE REFEREE WAS A SOUTH 
AMERICAN AND. . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Swedes left the Rose Bowl after their semifinal almost in the same kind of 
mood they were in after playing their first World Cup game here last month. 
</P>
<P>
 A complaining, whining kind of mood. 
</P>
<P>
 If it wasn't the heat . . . it was the officiating. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's game was played late in the afternoon, so heat took the day off. 
That left the officials as targets. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sweden, one major difference in its 1-0 loss to Brazil was the loss of 
captain Jonas Thern, who was given a red card and ejected in the 63rd minute 
for what was termed a vicious foul on Brazilian midfielder Dunga. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the Swedes had been hanging on against the offensive onslaught 
known as Bebeto and Romario, repelling wave after wave. 
</P>
<P>
 If 11 men were having problems handling Brazil, then playing one man short was 
a fairly ridiculous proposition -- particularly if anyone expected Sweden to 
score. Eighteen minutes later, the inevitable occurred when Brazil finally 
scored on a header by Romario in the 81st minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't much that we could do, but playing a player down makes a big 
difference," Swedish goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he (the referee) had a good match. He made mistakes that a good 
referee shouldn't make. You can't beat Brazil with 10 players." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sweden Coach Tommy Svensson: "We would have needed some luck, even at 
full strength. Hard plays happen when you are fighting for the ball. I thought 
the play earned a yellow card, but not a red. I can only say that I do not 
really understand the call." 
</P>
<P>
 What set back the Swedes was that Thern, 27, is his team's premier midfielder, 
the main cog in the transition from defense to offense. He is known for his 
concentration and powerful shot. He has ample experience, too, having made his 
national team debut in 1987 and played in the 1988 Olympics and the 1990 World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Thern, who has been hampered by injuries, has played for Napoli in Italy and 
recently signed a three-year deal to play for AS Roma. 
</P>
<P>
 His departure hurt an already hurting Swedish midfield. Even before the 
semifinals, the Swedes were without another midfielder, Stefan Schwarz, who 
received his second yellow card of the tournament on Sunday against Romania and 
could not play against Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Svensson needed to shore up the midfield. He inserted Stefan Rehn and pulled 
Martin Dahlin in the 68th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Thern did not play against Romania in the quarterfinals, sitting out with a 
swollen knee. But Romania is not quite Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Thern said Dunga embellished their midfield collision. "I am very 
upset," he said. "There was no warning from the referee. At the most, he should 
have given me a foul or a caution. And the other player was only acting. By not 
letting me stay in the game, it weakened our midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not out to hurt him." 
</P>
<P>
 Thern told Swedish reporters that one of the reserves claimed that the 
referee, Jose Torres Cadena of Colombia, was not even watching the collision, 
that he had his eye on the ball. Ravelli said Dunga may have made it look worse 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the referee didn't see what happened," Ravelli said. "He (Dunga) flew 
up in the air like he had wings. The referee only saw that Dunga took a dive." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunga, of course, disagreed when told of the Swedish players comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a foul without the ball," he said, looking exasperated. "Is that right 
or that not right?" 
</P>
<P>
 That was not the only call the Swedes disagreed with. Two other players 
received yellow cards -- defender Roger Ljung in the 29th minute and Tomas 
Brolin in the 86th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Svensson was asked what he thought of a South American referee being assigned 
to a game involving Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little afraid about that, even before the match," he said. "It seemed 
like he was giving the Brazilians some favors. But really, that is not 
something you can do anything about." 
</P>
<P>
 Thern said he thought Cadena should not have been working the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like we would have had a referee from Denmark," Thern said.

WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; BRAZIL'S TAFFAREL, JORGINHO: THE LONELY AND THE 
BRAVE; SOCCER: GOALKEEPER BARELY NEEDS TO BE THERE, AND MIDFIELDER NEVER STOPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 One runs a marathon every game. The other is not much more than a spectator. 
One sweats so much that that the field doesn't have to be watered after he 
plays. The other could set up an hibachi on the penalty spot and not have to 
worry about having his barbecue disturbed. One will receive a $120,000 bonus if 
his team wins the World Cup. So will the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorginho, Brazil's peripatetic defender, should demand a double share. 
</P>
<P>
 Claudio Taffarel, Brazil's lonesome goalkeeper, should be thankful that he 
doesn't have to buy a ticket to the games. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorginho is the hardest working man on Brazil's defense. He also is the 
hardest working man on Brazil's offense. 
</P>
<P>
 From his position in the back, he wears a path down the right side of the 
field that looks after a while like another sideline. At one moment, he has 
invaded the opponent's penalty area, lurking near the goal. At the next, he is 
stealing the ball in the midfield. Look again, and he is at the other end of 
the field, protecting Brazil's flank. 
</P>
<P>
 When the game is finished, and the Brazilians have won again, it is their 
famous forwards, Romario and Bebeto, who invariably are asked to take the bows. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though their teamwork in this tournament has been magnificent as they 
have gleefully assisted on each other's goals, they sometimes need a middle 
man. In the semifinal game Wednesday at the Rose Bowl against Sweden, it was 
Jorginho who played that role. 
</P>
<P>
 After 80 minutes of futile attacking by the Brazilians, they finally broke 
through when Bebeto directed a pass from the center of the field, just outside 
the penalty area, to Jorginho on the right. He crossed the ball in front of the 
goal to Romario, who headed it into the left side of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a play that we practice," Jorginho said later. "We tried it several 
times today, but it didn't succeed. We never had the opportunity to get it to 
Romario in that spot before because they (the Swedish defenders) were too tall. 
But he was in the perfect position this time." 
</P>
<P>
 He did not say it, but it also was a perfect crossing pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden's goalkeeper, Thomas Ravelli, called it too "hard and wicked" for the 
defenders to handle.  
</P>
<P>
 Brazil Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira spoke afterward of his team's supremacy, 
emphasizing their 26 shots and nine legitimate scoring opportunities, but that 
was the only time they converted in their 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not frustrated, but I was becoming impatient," Jorginho said. "When you 
attack and attack and don't score, you press more. Then, you leave your end of 
the field open, and that is very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous is not a word that applied to the Swedes' offense Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Taffarel faced only three shots, none from inside the penalty area, and if any 
of his stops were worthy of being called a save it might have been because he 
had to bend over once. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not unusual. Before the semifinal, he had only eight saves in five 
games. When Brazil beat the United States in the second round, the third of his 
four shutouts, he faced only one shot, none after the 12th minute. He had 
similar experiences against Russia and Cameroon and even against the Dutch for 
a half before they fell behind, 2-0, and were forced to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 During an exhibition before the World Cup, Brazilian reporters allegedly 
complained that they were not allowed by security forces to interview Taffarel 
during a game. The story seemed ludicrous at the time. Not so now. What else 
does he have to do during a game? 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing the Brazilians' awesome offense, teams tend to go into a defensive 
shell against them. Those that don't find Brazil's underrated defense difficult 
to penetrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Taffarel insisted Wednesday that he does not get bored. 
</P>
<P>
 But, asked if he ever felt threatened Wednesday, he thought for a moment and 
said, "No." 
</P>
<P>
 On the day after games, Parreira makes practices optional for the starters. 
Taffarel usually goes, to get some work in scrimmages. On one recent morning, 
Jorginho also went. But not to scrimmage. He ran.

COMMENTARY; WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; SWEDISH STRATEGY WENT FOR NIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today Romario has the world of international soccer precisely where he has 
always wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
 On bended knee, bowing before his cleated feet, thanking him profusely from 
the bottom of a billion hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 Had it not been for Romario's noggin in the 81st minute Wednesday, Brazil and 
Sweden might have very well finished their World Cup semifinal in a nil-nil 
draw, dragging 84,569 unwilling passengers along for a dead-end drive through 
overtime and into soccer's version of the California lottery, also known as 
penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 And you know what that would have meant. 
</P>
<P>
 Svennin' Time.  
</P>
<P>
 Penalty kicks are the reason the fjord-like, no-motion, 
bore-them-til-they-keel Swedes made it to the Rose Bowl instead of Hopalong 
Hagi and the Roamin' Romanians. That's enough. This World Cup needed Sweden in 
its final the way next year's Super Bowl needs the Buffalo Bills, but for 80 
minutes, the Swedes were a fluke, a quirk, a sneeze by Brazilian goalkeeper 
Claudio Taffarel away from slow-dancing with Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 They were 80 minutes of hell. Sweden's Tommy Svensson, in the biggest match of 
his coaching career, with a chance to put his country in its first Cup final in 
36 years, decided to borrow a strategic page from that feared and revered 
soccer juggernaut, the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 This was Brazil 1, USA 0 all over again, except that there are no two dots 
over the O's in "Tony Meola." 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes played Boraball. They vacuum-packed the defense tightly around 
their most imaginative, creative player -- goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli -- and 
planted themselves like a thicket of tall, white birch trees in the Pasadena 
turf. 
</P>
<P>
 If a Swede falls in the forest and no one hears it because everybody's 
sleeping, does that Swede make a sound? 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the noise in this match was the thud, thud, thud of Brazilian shots 
smacking against Swedish shins, Swedish knees, Swedish stomachs. The United 
States played this way out of necessity. The United States managed three goals 
in four World Cup games -- and one of them was scored by a Colombian. Another 
glanced beneath the crossbar and slanted into the net. The U.S. was all glove, 
no hit. Banjo hitters in shorts and shinguards. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sweden, Sweden had options. 
</P>
<P>
 It had Martin Dahlin, who scored twice in a 3-1 Group B victory over Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 It had Tomas Brolin, the hard-churning striker who pumped in three goals in a 
World Cup qualifier against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 It had Kennet Andersson, whose two goals ousted Saudi Arabia in the round of 
16, whose dangerous in-the-air presence had Brazil Coach Carlos Alberto 
Parreira this week calling him "one of the revelations of the Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Svensson, however, chose option D, which was none of the above, everybody drop 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 You may have heard about the efficient, workmanlike 4-4-2 defensive alignment 
that brought the Swedes this far. Allegedly, that means Sweden plays with four 
defenders, four midfielders and two strikers, whose job it is to direct the 
ball in the general vicinity of the opposition net. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, that was nothing more than a bad rumor. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of this game, the Swedes were playing 10-0-0. Until Jonas Thern got hit 
with that red card in the 63rd minute. That made it 9-0-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Sweden decided to get conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 68th minute, Svensson pulled Dahlin and replaced him with a 
ball-controlling midfielder, Stefan Rehn. 
</P>
<P>
 While this is not quite the soccer equivalent of a general handing over his 
sword, it should have been accompanied with a public-service announcement on 
the Rose Bowl message board. 
</P>
<P>
 SWEDEN IS PLAYING FOR PENALTY KICKS  
</P>
<P>
 PLEASE FEEL FREE TO USE THE REST ROOM OR CHECK OUT THE CONCESSION STANDS FOR 
THE NEXT 50 MINUTES OR SO  
</P>
<P>
 You could have landed a small Cessna on Brazil's defensive half of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Or played a slo-pitch softball game. 
</P>
<P>
 Or played another soccer game, better still. 
</P>
<P>
 Svensson chalked it up to fatigue, to the fact that "we did not recover well 
from our tough match on Sunday. Some players were not at full strength and that 
created some unsure play." 
</P>
<P>
 "Today," Svensson assessed, "we were not up to par." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, the analogy was a poor one. 
</P>
<P>
 In golf, even if one is not up to par, one at least must try a few shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Gratefully, Romario kept his head on the ball in the 81st minute, put the ball 
past Ravelli, put the Swedes out of their misery. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden -- with a game as bland as its all-white, ripped-off-from-Penn-State 
uniform -- will not be permitted anywhere near Sunday's championship final. 
</P>
<P>
 All hail the great Romario, the man who saved the 1994 World Cup.

EDNEY TAKING HIS SHOT AT NATIONAL TEAM; BASKETBALL: UCLA GUARD IS COMPETING FOR 
A SPOT ON THE TEAM THAT WILL REPRESENT THE UNITED STATES AT THE GOODWILL GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tyus Edney slipped the red, white and blue Team USA basketball practice jersey 
over his head, glanced at the talent spread throughout the room and pondered 
the moment at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Edney, UCLA's swift and steady senior point guard, would walk onto the 
floor at Crawford Hall for the first time, taking the initial step toward 
turning a dream into reality. The emotion of his participation, however, 
overwhelmed him before he even touched a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really important for me to play for (the national) team," Edney said 
recently. "It's just exciting to have the opportunity to represent your 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up and watching all the Olympic teams and the Dream Team you say to 
yourself, 'Well, maybe one day I can do that, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One of the nation's standout guards, Edney, 21, is battling for a position on 
the team that will represent the United States during the Goodwill Games, July 
23-28 at St. Petersburg, Russia. And although he might not survive the final 
cut, he has displayed flash and substance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of fun playing against this type of competition; the best 
competition in the country," Edney said. "It's been intense at times. You 
always have to play your best just to compete at the level of everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Edney's best is usually better than most, which is why he's here. 
</P>
<P>
 Team USA Coach George Raveling invited Edney and five others to compete for 
four open roster spots on the 12-man team. The slots were vacated because of 
injuries to Corliss Williamson (left wrist) of Arkansas and Randolph Childress 
(left shoulder) of Wake Forest, and summer-school scheduling conflicts 
encountered by Ed O'Bannon, Edney's teammate at UCLA, and Marcus Camby of 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, who coaches USC, is well aware of Edney's skills. For three seasons, 
Raveling has watched Edney spark the Trojans' cross-town rival with seemingly 
impossible passes and clutch jump shots. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd favorite at Pauley Pavilion since his freshman year when he supplanted 
senior point guard Darrick Martin as the starter, Edney arrived on the UCLA 
campus with little fanfare. He was not highly recruited while at Long Beach 
Poly -- but he quickly showed that that was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, Edney averaged 15.4 points and 5.8 assists, placing him ninth and 
third in the Pacific 10. Few are better in the clutch, as his .820 free-throw 
percentage of last season (.825 in his career) attests. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney was lavished with postseason honors, including his second consecutive 
All-Pac 10 selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been a Tyus Edney fan," Raveling said. "He does an excellent job 
pushing the ball and leading the transition game." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Marina High standout Cherokee Parks (Duke), Damon Stoudamire of Arizona 
and Scotty Thurman of national champion Arkansas are among the eight players 
assured of traveling overseas. The final roster will be determined when 
training camp ends Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The last spot might come down to a showdown between Edney and Arkansas point 
guard Corey Beck. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney and Beck play the same position and are equally relentless on defense -- 
any type of defense, anywhere on the floor at anytime of the game. The 
similarities, however, end there. 
</P>
<P>
 Diminutive by major hoops standards, Edney (5 feet 10, 145 pounds) possess a 
consistent touch from the perimeter and uses his quickness to break down 
defenses and get into the lane. Conversely, Beck (6-2, 190) is physical, 
rebounds well and scores inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corey is a strong guard," Edney said. "He utilizes his strength well." 
</P>
<P>
 The admiration is mutual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tyus is a great player," Beck said. "I have a lot of respect for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoudamire (5-11, 165) and Edney are virtually identical twins on the court, 
so the edge could be Beck's because of the large size of opposing guards in the 
tournament. But while size is important, the coaches said Edney's possible 
presence is no cause for worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be more concerned if Tyus only played one end of the floor," Raveling 
said. "But that big guard has to guard Tyus, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "So for what we might give up on defense, we'll get more back." 
</P>
<P>
 If Edney does make the team, minimizing the problem of his lack of size is not 
impossible, assistant coach Kelvin Sampson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look at Tyus' size, or Damon's size for that matter, as being a 
hindrance for us," said Sampson, coach at Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can do some things with our full-court pressure and our half-court 
pressure to counteract that. And most teams' offenses are not geared toward 
posting up point guards." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Edney said, his size is no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can only be so effective as a point guard if you're posting up all the 
time because you can't run the team," Edney said. "You get help from your big 
guys on defense in that situation, and you can counteract that on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "My strength is getting the ball up and down (the floor)." 
</P>
<P>
 And at speeds that almost make you sympathize with beleaguered would-be 
defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney has been in his element during the team's practice games in the ASICS 
Summer Pro League at the Bren Center. He has been freezing defenders with 
wicked crossovers, darting through the lanes, tossing pinpoint passes and 
dribbling a basketball faster than most of his counterparts move with 
unoccupied hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will help out in the long run," Edney said. "The guys playing in the 
league are the same type of guys we'll be playing overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a little experience playing against some of these guys in (pickup) 
games at UCLA, and it always helps me out." 
</P>
<P>
 When Edney returns to school, he will prepare for his final season. Including 
Edney, the Bruins have four starters back from last season's squad that 
achieved a No. 1 ranking at one point before suffering a humiliating 112-102 
loss to Tulsa in the first round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Add four highly regarded freshmen whom some consider among the best recruits 
in the nation, and the Bruins again have great expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem, Edney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since I've been at UCLA we've been a targeted team," Edney said. "People 
want to beat us and I kind of like that situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Edney, who is studying communications, said he is on track to graduate with 
his class. Barring complete erosion of his skills, he has a legitimate shot at 
being a first-round selection in the 1995 NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Former USC linebacker Willie McGinest is a boyhood buddy of Edney's and a 
former teammate at Long Beach Poly. McGinest was selected in the first round of 
the NFL draft by the New England Patriots and recently signed a four-year, 
$6-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 His pal's good fortune has Edney thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at Wil and it's exciting to see someone who you know and played with 
be successful," Edney said. "You look at yourself and you say, 'Yeah, I want to 
accomplish those things, too.' "

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: 3-TIME SUPERCROSS CHAMPION STANTON ANNOUNCES 
RETIREMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Stanton, a three-time national Supercross champion and twice winner of 
the Superbowl of Motocross in the Coliseum, has announced his retirement at 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "Racing just isn't as much fun as it used to be," Stanton said. "I know I'm 
not putting as much into it as I did a few years ago, and I decided it was time 
to get out because the spark just isn't there." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton, who lives in Sherwood, Mich., and has a winter home in Riverside, 
made the announcement midway through the national 250cc outdoor season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll finish out the final seven races of the season for Honda and then do 
some invitational races in Europe and Japan, and that will be it," he said at 
his home track in Buchanan, Mich. "I'm only 26, but I've been racing nearly 
every week for 22 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton has been a factory rider for Honda since 1989. He won Supercross 
titles in 1989, 1990 and 1992 and also won 250cc outdoor championships in those 
seasons. He was named winner of the Mickey Thompson Award of Excellence in 
1989, and in 1992, he followed up his national Supercross season by winning the 
world championship in Geneva, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning in Los Angeles was definitely a high point in my career," he said. 
"All the factory guys are there and it's the granddaddy of Supercross, so it's 
No. 1 for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 After his successful 1992 season -- he edged Damon Bradshaw for the Supercross 
crown by winning the season finale in the Coliseum -- Stanton never seemed to 
get it going again. Back injuries held him back last year, when he won only one 
Supercross event. This season, he has failed to win for the first time since 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished second to Honda teammate and reigning champion Jeremy McGrath at 
Anaheim, but slipped to ninth at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the second nationally ranked motocross rider to retire in the last year. 
Bradshaw, who won an international race in Japan when he was 16 and twice was 
runner-up for Supercross championships, called it quits at 21 last October. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Stanton's 17 Supercross victories were those in 1989 and 1992 at the 
Coliseum, 1990 at San Diego and 1991 at Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a spur-of-the-moment thing," he said of his retirement. "I pretty 
much made up my mind in March, but didn't want to say anything because I didn't 
want to have a big deal made of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said he and his wife, Sarah, will live in Michigan, but he hopes to 
continue working with American Honda in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have a lot to give to the younger riders," he said. "I know I was 
helped by Rick Johnson when I joined Honda, and I'd like to do the same for the 
next generation of riders." 
</P>
<P>

AN ANGEL REMEMBERED; JIMMIE REESE WAS KNOWN FOR HIS LOVE OF BASEBALL -- AND 
PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE and CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four months ago, on a sweltering day during the Angels' spring training camp, 
Jimmie Reese stood on the practice field, hitting grounder after grounder to 
pitcher Julio Valera. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, who could work wonders with his fungo bat, had Valera moving to his 
left, to his right, back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmie, aren't you getting tired?" he moaned. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Reese: "I'm doing just fine, son. You keep standing there, and I'll keep 
hitting them." 
</P>
<P>
 Valera, 25, hung his head in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, 92, simply chortled, and then hit another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll always remember that moment, because that's how I want to remember 
Jimmie," said Angel owner Jackie Autry. "He loved the game like no one else." 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, who died Wednesday morning of respiratory failure, always told friends 
that he wanted to leave this world wearing his baseball uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Today at Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa Ana, Reese will be lying in a 
casket, wearing his Angel uniform, No. 50. His fungo bat will be to his side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes an organization is judged on all of the players that have left," 
said Tim Mead, Angel assistant general manager, "but the greatest Angel in 
history finished his career right here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who provided Reese a lifetime contract six years ago, have already 
decided to retire his number. The players will wear patches in commemoration 
over their hearts -- above the letter E on their uniforms -- reading: No. 50, 
Jimmie Reese. They also made a vow that no one will ever again use Reese's 
locker. 
</P>
<P>
 "God, how he loved the game," said former Angel manager Gene Mauch, his voice 
cracking on the telephone. "And how the game loved him. Baseball was his life, 
and like a lot of us, it was a religion." 
</P>
<P>
 When the players arrived Wednesday for their workout -- preparing for the 
season's second half, which starts tonight against the Baltimore Orioles -- 
they looked toward Reese's locker. There was a picture frame with his jersey 
inside it. His fungo bat was lying in the locker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad day for baseball," Angel left fielder Bo Jackson said, "but I 
don't think we should mourn his death. We should celebrate for all he's done. 
He would have wanted it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys are in good spirits because we knows he's in a better place, and all 
we can say is, 'We miss you mullion.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mullion was the word that Reese lovingly called everyone. It was slang for 
ugly, and no matter if your name was Nolan Ryan, Reggie Jackson or Julio 
Valera, you were called a mullion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to make it a point every day to spend at least five minutes with 
him," first baseman J.T. Snow said, "because he was such an inspiration. He'd 
rag us, and we'd rag him right back." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a miracle, of sorts, that Reese was even with the Angels this spring. 
He missed the second half of the 1993 season because of poor health, but there 
he was the opening day of spring training, showing up at 8 a.m. sharp each day, 
hitting fungos by 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "He mustered everything he had to be back this spring," said John Sevano, 
Angel vice president. "He wanted to be around everyone one last time. I think 
it was his way of saying goodby." 
</P>
<P>
 Reese spent the entire spring with the Angels and attended every home game in 
April. Then, suddenly, he wasn't around. Soon, word came out that he was in a 
convalescent home. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no family to take care of him, and he never qualified for any 
player-pension program, but the Autrys made sure that he was always provided 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese's greatest trait was that he never had an enemy. He may be the only man 
in the history of baseball that everyone loved, and even more enigmatic, Reese 
loved everyone he met. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think his only family were the people he knew in baseball," said Angel 
Manager Marcel Lachemann. "He brought love into everyone's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can only hope that when your times comes, you will be remembered like 
Jimmie Reese."

MOORE AND LAPPER SIT THIS ONE OUT; SOCCER: EVEN THOUGH COUNTY NATIVES DIDN'T 
PLAY IN WORLD CUP, THEY STILL HAVE FOND MEMORIES AND OFFERS TO PLAY ELSEWHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They didn't make any "Tonight Show" or "Late Show With David Letterman" 
appearances. Their pictures didn't appear in Sports Illustrated or on the cover 
of Soccer America. 
</P>
<P>
 They were part of the U.S. soccer team's inspiring World Cup run, but they 
didn't take part in it, thus many of the spoils that have been heaped upon 
their more famous and more scraggly haired, goateed teammates have eluded 
Joe-Max Moore and Mike Lapper, two Orange County natives on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though Moore and Lapper didn't play in four U.S. World Cup games, 
it's not as if 1 1/2 years of training with the team, some 50 exhibition games, 
and dedication to their goal of playing in soccer's showcase event went for 
naught. 
</P>
<P>
 Lapper, a former Marina and UCLA standout, is weighing an offer from the Salsa 
that will likely make him one of the American Professional Soccer League's 
highest-paid players, while continuing to explore options abroad.  
</P>
<P>
 Moore, who played at Mission Viejo and UCLA, attracted enough interest during 
the team's pre-World Cup tour to earn what is believed to be a six-figure 
contract with F.C. Saarbruecken, a second-division team in Germany. He leaves 
for Europe next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this opportunity would have been there if I wasn't on the World 
Cup team," said Moore, 23, a midfielder/forward who scored 10 goals since 
joining the team in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I trained hard for a year and a half, and thought I could help the team out 
in the World Cup but wasn't given the opportunity. Of course, it bothers me, 
but I have to go on and prove myself in Europe, and hopefully in 1998 I'll be 
on the field (for the World Cup)." 
</P>
<P>
 Lapper, a central defender who was beaten out by Alexi Lalas for the starting 
job, seemed to have a little easier time accepting his role; defense was the 
U.S. team's strength, making it hard to criticize Coach Bora Milutinovic's 
decisions on the back line. The offense, on the other hand, mustered only three 
goals -- including one kicked in by a Colombian defender. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't that bad," said Lapper, 24, who led the team in minutes played in 
1993 but saw minimal action in 1994. "Obviously I wanted to be in the lineup, 
but Bora didn't see that as being best for the team. As a player you have to 
respect that decision and try to play a role as a substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost had to be a cheerleader during games. You have to play role reversal 
-- what would I want from a guy if he was on the bench and I was playing? You 
have to swallow your pride and remember it's a team game, that you're only as 
successful as the weakest person on the team." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team's 2-1 upset of Colombia, a team some predicted would win the 
World Cup, was the obvious highlight of the tournament, with a hard-fought, 1-0 
loss to eventual finalist and world power Brazil in the Round of 16 rating a 
close second. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Lapper and Moore, the lasting memory of this World Cup might be the 
way Americans have reacted to it. Long considered a third-world nation when it 
comes to soccer, the United States shattered the World Cup attendance record 
before Wednesday's semifinals. Capacity crowds and festive scenes have been the 
norm at most venues, and U.S. television ratings have been solid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fan craziness has been unreal," Lapper said. "At the Brazil game (in Palo 
Alto) we saw people there hours before the game already partying. That was 
great to see. I never thought it would be like this, but sure enough, the 
American fans came out." 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of the games has also been a major factor in the tournament's 
success. With three points, instead of two, awarded for a victory in the first 
round, there were more exciting Group play matches than in past World Cups. 
</P>
<P>
 There were several thrilling round-of-16 games, including Italy-Nigeria, 
Romania-Argentina and Mexico-Bulgaria, and each of the quarterfinal and 
semifinal games have been filled with memorable goals and dramatic moments, 
with an occasional touch of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it has been a great World Cup, and to have it happen in the U.S. is 
unbelievable," Moore said. "I talked to a lot of people who were not soccer 
fans before the World Cup, who have seen it on TV, and the way they talk about 
it, it changed a lot of people's minds. It ought to do some good for soccer in 
this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Will soccer finally take root as a legitimate spectator sport in this country, 
though? That is the question -- and challenge -- for a U.S. Soccer Federation 
that hopes to capitalize on World Cup fever by establishing a U.S. pro league. 
</P>
<P>
 But tentative plans don't call for the league to begin play until April, 1995, 
and the luster of the World Cup will have worn off by then. There are also 
doubts as to whether the league will ever get off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're optimistic, but at the same time we've all heard this song and dance 
before," Lapper said. "We're definitely going to put forth our best effort, do 
as much as we can in terms of promoting the league and getting it going." 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup might also be an albatross to a new league. Now that American 
fans have seen the best soccer in the world, the caliber of play in any U.S. 
pro league will inevitably fall short of World Cup standards. And fickle U.S. 
fans generally don't like to be associated with anything that's perceived as 
second-rate. 
</P>
<P>
 For a league to have any chance to succeed, Lapper and Moore believe it's 
imperative to sign players from the World Cup team, especially fan favorites 
such as Lalas, goalie Tony Meola and midfielder Cobi Jones. To do that, a 
league must be able to compete with the six-figure salaries U.S. players can 
receive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to put all the guys on the World Cup team in the limelight so people 
can say, 'Hey, let's go see Alexi, let's go see Cobi,' " Lapper said. "Then 
they'll notice the talent of the other players. But you have to get them 
connected through the better-known guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Moore: "The league won't survive without those players." 
</P>
<P>
 Though several U.S. players will soon return to their European clubs, and 
others are considering European offers, Lapper said most U.S. players would 
stay if there was a first division-caliber league, both in play and 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 "In talking among the players, if there was a league that could come close to 
the pay in Europe, I think a lot of guys would play here," Lapper said. "Guys 
would love to play here. It would be a dream come true."

NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART; RUGBY ABOUNDS IN WILD CONTRADICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Spinella is the kind of guy who mothers hope their sons grow up to be. 
</P>
<P>
 He is painfully polite and talks in the soft tones reserved for libraries and 
churches. He is intelligent, with degrees in mathematics and chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the topic turns to his obsession, rugby, a wicked grin surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 He begins talking about bruises, scrapes, bone-jarring tackles and 
free-for-all scrambles. He remembers with delight the pleasure he used to get 
after giving his opposite number a good lick. 
</P>
<P>
 Spinella, 47, is the organizer for the Eagle Rock Sevens rugby tournament, an 
annual competition that has drawn 24 teams from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament is divided into three divisions of differing skill levels. 
Games will be played from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday at John Ferraro 
Athletic Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Rugby is a sport of contradictions. Though brutal, it absolutely does not 
accept unsportsmanlike play.  
</P>
<P>
 The competition is cutthroat but enjoys a strong camaraderie among team 
members as well as opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 And probably no one illustrates this better than Spinella, whose demeanor 
belies the violence of the sport he loves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a ruffians' game played by gentlemen," said Spinella, whose serious 
playing days ended in 1979 after his second knee injury. "It's a melting pot." 
</P>
<P>
 Myriad people from wide-ranging backgrounds show up to play. Doctors, lawyers, 
students, businessmen, part-time actors, engineers, rocket scientists . . . the 
list goes on. Spinella is an environmental chemist. 
</P>
<P>
 "You meet a whole group of people," said Kevin Easton, a member of the Eagle 
Rock Athletic Club's rugby team. "It's nice that we all share the same 
enthusiasm and regard for the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is a physically punishing sport. There are no timeouts and there is 
just a five-minute rest between 40-minute halves. There are no huddles, water 
breaks or TV timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sport has the contact of football, the running of basketball and 
soccer," Spinella said. "The only way you come off the field is if you get 
carried off." 
</P>
<P>
 Much like football, the objective is to advance the ball across the opposing 
team's goal line and touch it down for a four-point "try," rugby's version of a 
touchdown.  
</P>
<P>
 The ball can only be passed backward or laterally on the field of play, which 
is 100 meters by 70 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the opposing team tries to stop forward progress by tackling the 
player with the ball. Blocking is not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional rugby is played with 15 players a side or team. During the summer, 
however, it is played with seven a side.  
</P>
<P>
 With fewer players on the field, "sevens" is the showtime of rugby, 
emphasizing speed and finesse rather than strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really rough in there," said Kevin Meyer, an ERAC team member. "You can 
bite, scratch, anything goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Spinella saw his first rugby match when he was with the Air Force and 
stationed in British Columbia, Canada, in 1969.  
</P>
<P>
 Discharged the following year, he went to the University of Denver, where he 
planned to play football as a 6-foot, 210-pound lineman. The school, however, 
dropped the program. 
</P>
<P>
 One day Spinella was playing touch football -- against members of the rugby 
team, and was asked to join them for their next rugby game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said if you see the ball, just pick it up and run with it," Spinella 
said. "All I knew was there was no blocking and no forward passing." 
</P>
<P>
 The first time the ball squirted Spinella's way, a lineman's fantasy was 
played out when he picked it up and ran for a try. 
</P>
<P>
 "I picked up a rugby ball and immediately I knew what to do with it," he said. 
"There were no questions, no second-guessing at what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Spinella has since been involved in the sport as a player, coach or 
administrator wherever his work has taken him.  
</P>
<P>
 He has coached at Colorado State, UC Santa Barbara and UCLA. He also was 
president of the Southern California Rugby Football Union for four years and 
coached the ERAC's team for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 He still stays involved with the game whenever possible, organizing 
tournaments and helping promote the sport in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being involved now gives the players a chance to enjoy the game a little 
longer," Spinella said. "That's really why all of us stick around." 
</P>
<P>
 Most ruggers get involved with the sport after being invited to participate by 
a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a spectator for a while and watched my brother-in-law play," Meyer 
said. "They kept on trying to get me to play. I kept on putting them off -- in 
other words, I dogged them for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer eventually gave in and has found that rugby was much tougher than 
football, which he played while at Burbank High. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rugby is a lot tougher to play," he said. "You have to be a lot more 
conditioned. . . . You don't see 270-pound guys playing rugby because you've 
got to be fit." 
</P>
<P>
 The sport has also provided a social outlet for people who would otherwise 
stay in a 9-to-5 rut.  
</P>
<P>
 Family members, girlfriends and friends all gather for a postgame "social" 
that the home team hosts for the visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very family oriented," said Brenda, Spinella's wife.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have the wives, the girlfriends come out. Over the past four years I've 
been involved in this, I've seen marriages and children come out of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone is welcomed to just watch or play, without regard to size or athletic 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's welcome," Spinella said. "You might be great, you might not. 
There's a level of play for everybody." What's Afield?

BOOKISH ADVERSARY BARS FISCHER'S WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has won every title available to him and is undefeated outdoors, yet Jeremy 
Fischer has been unable to top one opponent this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The unbeaten adversary is not an individual. Rather it is the state high 
school record of 7 feet 4 1/2 inches in the high jump set by Maurice Crumby of 
San Francisco Balboa High in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, a June graduate of Camarillo High, appeared to be the heir apparent 
to Crumby after clearing a region record of 7-4 in the Santa Barbara Easter 
Relays in March, but that remains his personal best entering today's junior 
(age 19 and under) meet among the United States, Canada, Cuba, Jamaica and 
Japan at State University of New York at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest with you, we thought we'd have the state record by now," 
Camarillo Coach Dennis Riedmiller said. "In fact, I thought he had it in 
Florida. I still don't know how he knocked the bar off." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer cleared 7-2 1/2 to win the USA Track & Field Junior championships at 
Florida State last month before missing three times at 7-5. He came so close to 
making the height on his second attempt that Riedmiller said afterward that he 
was "still trying to find the thread on his uniform" which dislodged the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wisconsin-bound Fischer, who is regarded as a high school athlete for 
record purposes until August 31, does not appear overly concerned with topping 
Crumby's record. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he'd like to break it -- and figures he has a good chance at doing so 
-- he doesn't feel he has to for the season to be a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'd be nice to say that Jeremy Fischer is the best jumper to have come out 
of California," he said. "But I'm not going to be all depressed if I don't do 
it. . . . Just to have had some decent chances at the record is an honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer has taken 15 jumps this season at heights which would have broken or 
equaled the state record. 
</P>
<P>
 After clearing 7-4 in Santa Barbara, he missed three times at 7-5 1/2. He did 
likewise after making 7-3 at the Mt. San Antonio College Relays in April. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the Southern Section Division I title at 7-2 1/4 in May before missing 
three attempts at 7-4 3/4, and he missed three times at 7-4 1/2 after winning 
last month's Golden West Invitational at 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the national junior championships and the three misses at 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of those 15 jumps, seven or eight have been close," Riedmiller said. 
"There were two or three jumps when I definitely thought he had made it." 
</P>
<P>
 A bruised quadriceps on Fischer's left leg, the one on which he plants before 
jumping, contributed to a mild slump during which he cleared only 6-8 in three 
invitational meets in a row. But he's cleared 7 feet or higher in seven 
consecutive finals since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm building back up again," Fischer said. "The injury hurt my 
chances of peaking in June, but it really doesn't bother me any more. I think 
I'm definitely capable of getting a (personal record) in the next two meets." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer will probably need a personal best to win the World Junior 
Championships July 20-24 in Lisbon, Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jagan Hames of Australia has cleared 7-6 this season and Jordi Rofee of Spain 
has scaled 7-4, but Fischer doesn't mind the unusual position of being an 
underdog. In fact, he figures it will help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'll have to (set a personal record) to win and that's good," Fischer 
said. "I think that will push me. I think that will motivate me. . . . I'd 
really love to win the World championships. That would be cool." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be doubly cool if he broke the state record in the process.

DIGEST: SCYPHERS TO MEET WITH SCHOOL BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Scyphers will meet today with members of the Simi Valley school board, 
who likely will determine the embattled baseball coach's future at Simi Valley 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've finally come through the legal procedures that will allow this 
thing to come to closure," board member Doug Crosse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers and board members will meet at 2:30 p.m. at the district office to 
discuss the disciplinary actions suggested by Principal Kathryn Scroggin. 
Crosse said the board also is likely to consider Scroggin's recommendation that 
Scyphers be rehired with 10 stipulations that he maintain certain conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, 41, was suspended as baseball coach May 3 while police and the 
district investigated alleged financial and disciplinary improprieties. The 
district attorney cleared him of criminal wrongdoing June 8, and his suspension 
was lifted the following day. 
</P>
<P>
 Because all coaches in the district are on one-year contracts, Scyphers needed 
the approval of Scroggin and the board to return as coach next season. JEFF

LOWER PROFIT FORECAST SPURS REGENCY SELLOFF; TRADING: SHARE PRICES PLUMMET 
AFTER TUSTIN NURSING HOME OPERATOR ANNOUNCES LIKELY EARNINGS DROP DUE TO 
OPERATING PROBLEMS AFTER MERGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shareholders sold almost 4.7 million shares of Regency Health Services' common 
stock in wild trading Wednesday as the price fell almost 40% on word that the 
nursing home operator's profits will likely be far short of earlier forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Only last-minute stock buyback pledges by Regency's chairman and its largest 
shareholder kept the price from plummeting lower. At one point during the day, 
Regency shares were trading at $7.625, down from Tuesday's closing price of 
$14.125. The stock, which closed at $8.75, had traded as high as $19.375 on 
March 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive selloff was triggered by Regency's announcement that its earnings 
for the rest of the year would fall well below the level forecast by industry 
analysts after Regency's acquisition in April of fellow nursing home operator 
Care Enterprises of Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard K. Matros, Regency's president and chief executive, blamed the decline 
on a loss of operating control that occurred as he and several other key 
officers turned their focus from daily operations to the acquisition and 
subsequent integration of Regency and Care personnel, systems and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have enough information coming to me to assess that this was an 
issue," he said in an interview. "If I'd have been here or had sufficient 
information, I could have caught it sooner." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20% of Regency's 20.5 million shares were traded Wednesday, about 60 
times the stock's typical daily volume. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's merger indigestion," said Linc Werden, an analyst with Prudential 
Securities in New York. "Top management has now admitted that the expanded 
operation was larger than they could comfortably handle. They were in over 
their depth, and operating problems developed." 
</P>
<P>
 Werden said he thinks Regency can get the situation under control but 
cautioned that it could take time. "The people that were in charge (of 
integrating operations) are gone," he said. "Though they've hired new people, 
the recovery depends on how well a relatively new operating team can perform." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to reassure investors and prop up the tumbling share price, Smith 
Management Co., a Regency Health Services affiliate and the company's largest 
single shareholder, with about 20% of its stock, said Wednesday it had 
authorized the purchase of as many as 1 million Regency shares in the open 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Regency Chairman Cecil Mays also issued a statement before the market closed 
Wednesday that he had instructed his broker to purchase $100,000 worth of the 
company's stock. Mays, who owned 800,000 shares when he placed the purchase 
order, said his losses on paper topped $4 million for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Regency also said Wednesday that it will sell some facilities and has 
established a $10-million reserve to cover costs associated with the sales. 
Matros said that strategy, however, should not have affected earnings estimates 
because it was announced before the Care Enterprises acquisition was completed. 
"It was in our proxy," issued last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Regency bought slightly larger Care Enterprises for $120 million worth of 
stock, Regency officials said they would have no problem integrating Care into 
their operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, Regency is forecasting second-quarter earnings of just 10 cents 
to 12 cents a share, down from 16 cents a share a year earlier and far short of 
the 22 cents projected by analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 Matros, who was Care's president and chief executive before the acquisition, 
said there have been no problems associated directly with the Care operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Care had to do with it only to the extent that the assimilation of the two 
companies caused myself and several other key people to focus on the 
assimilation, so we weren't as focused as normal on other operations of the 
company," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The operations team charged with that task simply was not able to handle it, 
he said, because Regency more than doubled in size to 94 facilities from 41 
with the Care purchase. The company expects revenue to top $360 million this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 While Matros traveled the country wooing investors and grappled with the tasks 
of pulling two large health corporations together, the executive in charge of 
operations was Tim Paulsen, Regency's senior vice president. Paulsen, who 
recently resigned and could not be reached for comment Wednesday, "was in over 
his head," Matros said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems that developed stemmed from leaving daily operations in the 
charge of people "who weren't used to having responsibility for a corporation 
of this size," Matros said. 
</P>
<P>
 He described the operating problems as loss of cost control at various 
facilities. With nearly 100 nursing homes to operate, an inability to keep a 
lid on payroll and supply spending "adds up quickly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things went along pretty well for a while just out of habit, but eventually 
the problems showed up," Matros said. "We run a $13-million monthly payroll, 
and just a few extra hours of labor a day at each facility can add $500,000 a 
month to that." A Big Decline 
</P>
<P>
 Regency Health Services' stock dropped sharply Wednesday after the 
announcement of a decline in projected earnings. Monthly closing prices: 
</P>
<P>
 June, 1993: $10.63 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's close: $8.75

TELEDYNE FACES NEW CHARGES OVER EXPORTS OF ZIRCONIUM; DEFENSE: A FEDERAL GRAND 
JURY ACCUSES THE COMPANY OF FILING FALSE PAPERS ON THE INGREDIENT USED IN 
MAKING BOMBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ and RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teledyne Inc., already facing criminal charges of illegally exporting 
zirconium used to make cluster bombs for Iraq, was indicted again Wednesday on 
new charges of conspiring to ship 154 tons of the material to Jordan in the 
late 1980s, the Justice Department announced. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal grand jury in Washington charged the Los Angeles-based defense 
contractor and three foreign firms with filing a false export application for 
the zirconium, saying it would be used by a Greek firm to make containers for 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the four-count indictment alleges, Teledyne knew the material -- 
which increases the power of explosives -- would not be used for those 
purposes. The indictment claims that after the cargo left U.S. ports, it was 
diverted to Aqaba, Jordan, in June, 1988, in violation of U.S. munitions 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of the charges, Teledyne and the other corporations face more 
than $20 million in total fines and possible suspension of future exports, the 
Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teledyne, whose Wah Chang division in Albany, Ore., sold the zirconium 
pellets, promptly called the allegations "unwarranted" and said the company 
would "vigorously defend itself against the charges." 
</P>
<P>
 The required export licenses were obtained from the U.S. government, and the 
company had official assurances from the Greek government that the zirconium 
would not be improperly diverted, according to William J. Linklater, a lawyer 
for Teledyne. He also disputed the allegation that Teledyne knew its export 
application was false. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, the grand jury's action further opens the door for a public airing 
of how Teledyne and other companies and individuals allegedly provided bomb 
parts that ultimately went to the Middle East in the years leading up to the 
Persian Gulf War in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Teledyne is already facing charges, leveled by a federal grand jury in Miami a 
year ago, that the company illegally shipped 130 tons of zirconium to Chilean 
arms merchant Carlos Cardoen between 1983 and 1988. Cardoen used the zirconium 
to produce 24,000 cluster bombs for Iraq, according to that indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment Wednesday does not specify where the zirconium that was 
ostensibly bound for Greece ultimately went after it arrived in Jordan. 
However, Assistant U.S. Atty. Eric Dubelier told Associated Press that the 
cargo "probably did go to Iraq."  
</P>
<P>
 In the Miami case, Teledyne had contended that U.S. government officials knew 
the zirconium would be used to make bombs but that they approved the sale 
nonetheless as part of a secret plan to help Iraq in its eight-year war with 
Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 But in May, a federal judge ruled that Teledyne could not use as a defense its 
assertion that the U.S. government quietly approved of the exports. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest indictment also marks the fourth time Teledyne has been charged 
with federal felonies since the late 1980s, giving it one of the worst ethics 
records in the U.S. defense industry. The company has also faced half a dozen 
civil fraud suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the latest charges mar Teledyne's recent attempts to emerge from its 
years of litigation. In April, Teledyne settled two major civil suits brought 
by the Justice Department and four whistle-blowers for more than $112 million. 
The charges included padding contracts and improperly testing electronic 
components. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment in Washington also names as defendants a Greek container firm, 
a German export concern and a Belgian company, along with a Teledyne Wah Chang 
salesman, Edward Johnson, and a member of the Belgian firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 54, could not be reached for comment. Linklater, the attorney, said 
Johnson is on a leave of absence to recover from recent surgery.

REGULATORS APPROVE RULES ON FUND ADS; SECURITIES: THE INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER 
GROUPS PRAISE THE SEC CHANGES. RANKINGS ARE AT ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New truth-in-advertising rules for the booming mutual fund industry were 
approved by government regulators Wednesday, a move consumer activists called a 
welcome step toward ending hype and distortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mutual fund advertising and disclosure needs major improvement," said 
Jennifer Kohn, consumer advocate with the New York City Public Advocate's 
Office.  
</P>
<P>
 The rule changes concern what mutual funds can say in advertisements about 
their performance and how they are ranked by major analytical services such as 
Morningstar, Lipper Analytical Services or Money magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules, approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, require fund 
companies to make specific disclosures when they include rankings in their 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, they cannot claim in a headline or prominent statement that a 
fund was a best performer in a category unless it was actually ranked No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds must fully describe the criteria on which the ranking is based, whether 
sales charges known as "loads" are figured into the rankings, and whether fees 
were waived or expenses deferred during the period in which the fund was 
ranked. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual funds are pools of money that are invested by professional money 
managers with specific goals. The managers buy stocks, bonds or other financial 
products with investors' funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual funds have grown rapidly in size and number in recent years as interest 
rates declined, leaving investors looking for alternatives to money market and 
other accounts that ended up paying annual returns of about 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 There are now more than 4,000 mutual funds nationwide, and one out of every 
four U.S. households owns shares in one. 
</P>
<P>
 R. Clark Hooper, a vice president at the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, 
said the new rules are aimed at making fund ads "reasonably well understood by 
someone without an in-depth knowledge of the mutual fund industry." The NASD, 
an industry self-regulatory group, developed the rules for the SEC's approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators have brought enforcement cases against mutual fund companies for 
misleading ads. The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs last summer 
charged Dreyfus, Franklin and Charles Schwab with deceptive advertising in 
print ads or brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 The three fund companies settled the charges last fall by agreeing to revise 
the offending ads, said Kohn, who participated in the settlements.

MEDIA WORLD IN MOTION; ALL EYES ON CBS . . .; AFTER LOSING QVC, IT MAY BE NEXT 
ON THE AUCTION BLOCK 
</P>

<P>
 Like a midair explosion, the scuttled merger plan of QVC Inc. and CBS Inc. has 
sent both companies spinning into play. Analysts on Wednesday said CBS could 
fetch more than $4 billion, while QVC might sell for nearly $3 billion if more 
than one bidder materializes. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS formally confirmed Wednesday that it will not pursue QVC in the wake of a 
surprise $2.2-billion bid from Comcast Corp. for the home shopping channel. But 
industry executives agreed that CBS is on the auction block, having tipped its 
hand last month by agreeing to a QVC merger and new management. Analysts said 
the most logical bidders include Walt Disney Co. and Turner Broadcasting Co., 
or perhaps a group led by QVC Chairman Barry Diller. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC, for its part, said it will negotiate with Comcast and "explore 
alternatives in order to maximize shareholder value." There was a flurry of 
speculation that other bidders may emerge from the ranks of cable TV companies 
or telephone firms eager to acquire programming. A source in the QVC camp would 
not rule out a bid from Diller himself, because the QVC chairman wants to run 
his own company. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some onlookers were fascinated by the speed with which CBS Chairman 
Laurence A. Tisch abandoned the QVC deal Tuesday night, within hours of the 
discovery of Comcast's rival bid. By early Wednesday, the CBS board had even 
adopted a different plan, announcing that it would buy back 22% of CBS' own 
stock for $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of fighting for QVC, the CBS chairman "ran for the door and went right 
through it," marveled one top Hollywood executive, who speculated that tension 
must have crept into the dealings between Tisch and Diller. He also said the 
71-year-old Tisch may have been feeling some seller's remorse about giving up 
his chief executive's job to Diller. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, however, opinion quickly swung to Tisch's defense, as analysts 
applauded the stock repurchase plan at $325 per share. Analysts explained that 
the action will buoy the CBS stock price while the company awaits overtures 
from bidders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tisch has been handling the stock brilliantly. He may not be an expert in 
programming, but he understands Wall Street," said John Tinker, an analyst with 
Furman Selz. "He's making the right moves; he's keeping the stock up." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS shares rose $8 to $308 on the New York Stock Exchange, while QVC soared $6 
to $42 in Nasdaq trading. After falling as low as $14.125, Comcast's stock 
recovered slightly after company executives explained their bid to more than 
100 institutional investors in a conference call. Comcast shares closed at 
$15.125, down $1.50 from the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
 The business world was stunned by Comcast's surprise bid for QVC late Tuesday 
because Comcast -- a founding shareholder of QVC -- had wooed Diller for the 
job of running the shopping network and had unflinchingly backed his 
unsuccessful $10-billion bid for Paramount Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 But in separate interviews, both Diller and Comcast President Brian Roberts 
offered the same account of their frank talks in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Diller "said to us all along, 'If you don't like CBS, you can make a bid for 
the whole company,' " Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The QVC chairman concurred. "You bet I did. . . . I have no (reason) to be 
angry with them," Diller said. 
</P>
<P>
 By that token, the QVC board meeting Wednesday was described as a civilized, 
one-hour-and-15-minute affair conducted at the Manhattan law offices of 
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. Afterward, one source said QVC and Comcast were 
already tackling a merger agreement that could be signed within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 As reported, Comcast has offered to pay $44 a share to QVC's shareholders, but 
the company told analysts it would be willing to change the structure of the 
deal, perhaps offering stock instead of cash to certain shareholders, such as 
John Malone's Liberty Media, who want to avoid a big tax bill on their profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The CBS move prompted analysts to immediately increase their per-share 
earnings projections because the company's equity base will shrink as a result 
of the buyback. Still -- if CBS is worth $360 per share, as some analysts say 
-- the company could still reap a premium price for the remaining shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to sell, you may as well bring the value up for the guys who 
remain," one institutional investor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tisch-controlled Loews Corp. said Wednesday that it will tender its CBS 
shares, fulfilling Wall Street's expectation that Tisch is committed to taking 
some cash out of the company at this time. Comcast Corp. at a Glance

MEDIA WORLD IN MOTION; . . . AND ON DILLER; AS MERGER FAILS, MOGUL RETURNS TO 
SQUARE ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When QVC Inc. lost the brutal Paramount Communications takeover battle to 
Viacom earlier this year, Chairman Barry Diller issued the now classic line: 
"They won. We lost. Next." 
</P>
<P>
 When "next" turned out to be his planned merger with CBS Inc., Diller again 
entered the spotlight as a major deal maker. But with that agreement derailed 
Tuesday by a rival QVC bid from cable's Comcast Corp., Diller is essentially 
back to square one -- a mogul without portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry speculation now has Diller, 52, leapfrogging into any number of new 
opportunities that will be his should he leave QVC. Associates say he will 
probably spend the next several days weighing Comcast's $2.2-billion bid before 
deciding on his next move. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will concentrate on what is best for QVC and its shareholders, of which he 
is one of the biggest," one knowledgeable source said. "He thought the deal 
with CBS was the best one at the time, but the world changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Comcast's surprise bid not only killed the proposed CBS-QVC merger, it 
also sent a wave of depression through the ranks of CBS managers who had looked 
forward to Diller's re-energizing the company the way he did Paramount Pictures 
and Fox Inc. in years past. The failed deal also left a scorched path on Wall 
Street, where Diller's once-polished image has been tarnished. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diller has done very little to impact the core business of QVC," said Peter 
J. Siris, an analyst with UBS Securities. in New York. "The stock price today 
would be higher if he hadn't joined it and the company had gone on its own 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 QVC stock skyrocketed from the low 30s in 1992 when Diller joined the company 
to more than $70 a share last year on the expectation that he would transform 
QVC into an interactive powerhouse. With the support of major shareholders 
Tele-Communications Inc. and Comcast, Diller had publicly announced plans to 
reshape QVC by adding an upscale shopping channel and international ventures in 
Mexico and Britain. There was even a hint of an eventual foray into Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stock recently fell to its 1992 level as those ventures were slow to 
develop. In addition, analysts noted Wednesday, this is the third failed merger 
attempt in Diller's relatively brief 18-month tenure. The others were for 
Paramount and the rival Home Shopping Network. 
</P>
<P>
 To some degree, Wall Street is responding to the rift that has developed 
between Diller and Brian Roberts, 35, the Comcast president who wooed Diller to 
the home shopping channel more than two years ago with the promise that the 
company would become a launching pad for high-tech cable programming ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 That relationship was a close one until QVC began talks with CBS last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the past days' events say Diller may have made a fatal 
miscalculation in not including Roberts in his merger talks with CBS Chief 
Executive Laurence A. Tisch. The merger, though it would have married the 
top-ranked broadcaster and a highly profitable shopping channel, would have 
forced Comcast into a background role because federal regulations severely 
limit "cross ownership" of TV networks and cable companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brian Roberts has worshiped at the feet of Barry Diller for two years," said 
one person close to him. The QVC bid has "got to be political." 
</P>
<P>
 Others Wednesday agreed that Roberts became infuriated when Diller jilted him 
and may have been seeking revenge in making the rival offer for QVC. Said one 
about Roberts: "He's certainly a player now." 
</P>
<P>
 Some question whether Comcast will actually proceed with its $44-a-share bid 
to acquire the part of QVC it does not already own, but analysts agree that the 
CBS-QVC merger, which would have put Diller in charge of CBS, is dead and has 
no chance of being revived. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, despite vows of mutual support, the comfort level between Diller and 
Roberts has clearly dropped, and many are now betting that Diller will collect 
his stock options -- which will yield him a profit of about $100 million -- and 
look for a new home. 
</P>
<P>
 Where that might be is not known. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen & Co., the New York investment bank, is said to already be preparing to 
solicit competing bids for QVC. Industry sources said Wednesday that TCI was 
looking at the possibility of making a bid for QVC and merging it with Home 
Shopping Network, in which it has a major stake. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI Chief Executive John Malone is known to be unhappy with the Comcast bid 
and to have favored the CBS-QVC merger on long-term strategic grounds. As the 
most powerful player in the cable TV industry and one with a growing interest 
in "content," Malone could yet help Diller set his sights on a new target.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: WILL THE SAVVY AMATEUR INHERIT ON-LINE GOLD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Misdial a phone number these days and there is a good chance you won't just 
hear a voice mail message or the telltale beep . . . beep . . . beep of a fax 
machine, but the buzz-saw whine of a computer bulletin board or on-line 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of amateur bulletin boards -- computerdom's cousin to ham radio -- 
is spiraling into the hundreds of thousands. Hundreds of organizations are 
hooking up to the Internet every month. Apple Computer, AT&T and Microsoft all 
promise to move into on-line consumer services in a big way. Rupert Murdoch and 
General Electric are already there with Delphi and GEnie. 
</P>
<P>
 Practically every other week, "content providers" (multimedia bafflegab for 
organizations that own their own data) leap into the on-line El Dorado hoping 
to mine digital dollars. Newspapers like the Washington Post and Los Angeles 
Times have cut on-line distribution deals with Ziff Interactive and Prodigy, 
respectively, while NBC announced it will join publications like Time magazine 
and the New Republic in cyberspace via America Online. 
</P>
<P>
 With on-line industry revenues of more than $500 million last year 
accompanying a 25% growth in paying subscribers, the computer cognoscenti are 
already predicting a "shakeout in cyberspace." There is a growing glut of 
on-line services, they contend, and the market can't support them all. 
</P>
<P>
 A shakeout may be coming, but not because of any on-line gluts. That's a bit 
like saying there's a glut of telephone numbers and the market can't support 
them all. While it's undeniably true that the rush to on-line has a 
lemming-like quality mixed with equal parts of greed and fear, it's also true 
that the economics of on-line services are being radically and fearsomely 
transformed. 
</P>
<P>
 This shakeout will instead shatter the very notion of an interactive 
"information utility" that got Prodigy, CompuServe and America Online launched 
in the first place. Their business model is being ruthlessly undermined by the 
rise of cheap memory, cheap software and cheap telecommunications. They're 
begging to be bypassed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time, Information Age industrialists thought you had to invest 
millions in the hardware, software and telecommunications technologies 
necessary to launch a national on-line service. IBM and Sears have reportedly 
poured more than $1 billion into their Prodigy over the last decade. CompuServe 
and America Online have spent tens of millions. On-line services were seen as 
capital-intensive businesses that required tons of money for software and 
systems development. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, it turns out that on-line services don't have to be 
capital-intensive at all. If you've got half a mind to launch an on-line 
service, that's all you need. An agile entrepreneur or intelligent content 
provider can start up and maintain a dial-up on-line service for a few thousand 
-- not a few million -- dollars.  
</P>
<P>
 If you are on the Internet, the barrier of entry to offering on-line 
information and interaction globally is practically zero. The issue is whether 
you offer the sort of information and interactions people want. If you do, the 
real challenge then is creating a billing system to collect your money. 
Convincing a few advertisers to sponsor your wares might also be nice. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, you need software that is compatible and user-friendly for the 
people who log on to your service, but increasingly, that kind of network 
interface software is becoming as accessible and affordable as spreadsheets and 
word processors. Prediction: Microsoft will make more money selling interface 
software to on-line services than running one. 
</P>
<P>
 The folks at America Online, Prodigy and CompuServe should be terrified. Right 
now, their content providers pay big bucks to be on their network.  
</P>
<P>
 In market terms, however, a Time magazine or NBC needs them like the 
proverbial fish needs a bicycle. There is absolutely no inherent economic or 
technological reason why Time needs to go electronic via an America Online 
versus having its own on-line service for subscribers. In 1994, the cost to 
Time is marginal. Just wait. Instead of "information providers" paying on-line 
services to carry their content and support their chat lines, the on-line 
services will be bidding to keep the content on the network, just as networks 
pay affiliates to carry their television programming. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, an America Online has an "installed base" of personal computer 
subscribers. But there is nothing that prevents a Time or a Newsweek from 
giving their readers the option to call in directly. In other words, these 
media providers will bypass the on-line resellers of their information.  
</P>
<P>
 Don't be surprised when magazines and newspapers begin to disintermediate 
existing on-line services and offer toll-free (advertiser-sponsored) access to 
their own on-line services. Of course, you'd still be able to do all the 
electronic mail and bulletin board communications functions that the on-line 
services now provide. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, expect financial service firms like American Express, Fidelity and 
Merrill Lynch to offer their own "free" on-line advisory services off toll-free 
numbers. Again, given that the bulk of their data is already digitized, 
launching these services will represent -- at most -- a marginal cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The catch? You might have to make four or five toll-free calls on your 
personal computer to network to your favorite media instead of just one toll 
call to the service. Sending e-mail might be more difficult -- although you can 
be sure these new services will negotiate Internet access to other on-line 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 This trend toward on-line disintermediation doesn't mean there will be a 
cyberspace shakeout; quite the contrary, it implies that consumers will have a 
very crowded and competitive marketplace from which to choose.  
</P>
<P>
 The critical observation is that the larger on-line services like Prodigy and 
CompuServe can no longer rely on other people's information to lure new 
subscribers. They'll need to offer new kinds of interactive programming. So 
what will the Howard Stern and Rush Limbaugh of on-line services interact like?

 Helms Blocks Clinton Nominee: Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) is blocking the 
President's choice to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 
retaliation for the transfer of a federal employee who criticized White House 
policy on gays and lesbians.Helms invoked a "hold" on the confirmation vote of 
Mary Schapiro and three other nominees for federal posts after Karl Mertz, an 
Agriculture Department employee in Georgia, was transferred after saying he 
opposed extending certain rights and benefits to homosexuals. Helms' action in 
effect keeps Schapiro from taking over. The CFTC has not had a permanent head 
since Clinton took office.

 Bill Would Regulate Over-the-Counter Derivatives: Rep. Edward J. Markey 
(D-Mass.) said the bill he introduced aims to regulate such activities by 
securities firms and insurance companies, closing what he calls a "regulatory 
black hole" in government oversight of a $12-trillion market. The bill is the 
third piece of legislation introduced this year that seeks to rein in 
derivatives -- financial contracts designed to offer a sort of insurance 
against unexpected declines in the bond, stock and currency markets.They can 
also be used for speculation. The bill would force businesses defined as 
derivatives dealers to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
offer a definition of what constitutes a derivative, and give the SEC the power 
to set capital standards, conduct inspections and receive financial reports 
from dealers.

 Broker Charged With Misappropriating Money: State regulators moved to revoke 
the license of Huntington Beach insurance broker Richard Allen Kaley, accusing 
him of pocketing $487,000 in premiums in 1993.Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi said Kaley collected the money from about 40 customers but failed to 
forward it to the insurers issuing the policies. The accusation is the first 
step in administrative proceedings to remove his license. An Insurance 
Department spokeswoman said she did not know whether Garamendi would refer the 
case to law enforcement authorities for criminal prosecution. Kaley could not 
be reached for comment.

 Blockbuster Park Clears Hurdle: Despite protests from environmentalists, 
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. Chairman H. Wayne Huizenga won permission from 
two Florida counties to levy taxes and use other quasi-governmental powers so 
he can build a giant theme park in south Florida. The Dade and Broward county 
commissions approved Blockbuster's proposal to create a special government 
district for its 2,400 acres. Final approval of the plan is still several 
months off.

 Chrysler Executives Told to Bird-Dog Quality: Robert J. Eaton, angered that 
the company's cars fared below average in recent quality surveys, has assigned 
his top executives to special teams to find and fix the problem. The chairman 
divided the company's 23 vice presidents, president and himself among four 
teams, each focused on one of the company's vehicle groups: large cars, small 
cars, minivans and trucks. The campaign was launched last month after all 
Chrysler Corp. passenger car brands ranked below the industry average in J.D. 
Power & Associates' Initial Quality Study, which measures problems new-vehicle 
buyers have during the first three months of ownership.

 Virtuality, IBM to Develop Virtual Reality Computer: IBM Corp. and 
Britain-based Virtuality plan to jointly develop a low-cost computer equipped 
to design virtual reality software. The companies said the new system, to go on 
sale later this year, would initially be marketed to software developers in the 
architectural, medical and entertainment markets.The new computer would enable 
more software companies to give their programmers the equipment needed to 
develop new software for virtual reality -- an artificial computer-generated 
world that the operator can enter through the use of special helmets and 
gloves. The computer will also be equipped with new peripheral items such as 
lightweight virtual reality headsets and a virtual reality mouse. No price has 
been set for the product.

 Boston Fed Names First Female President: Cathy Minehan, 47, senior vice 
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, had been acting president 
since Richard Syron left in April to become chairman of the American Stock 
Exchange. Her appointment, effective immediately, was applauded by critics who 
have charged that the Fed's top ranks are dominated by white men.Minehan is an 
expert on payments systems. She began her career with the New York Fed in 1968, 
and she was made senior vice president there in 1987, becoming the first woman 
to achieve that rank at any of the 12 regional Federal Reserve System banks. 
She was named first vice president and chief operating officer of the Boston 
Fed in 1991.

 L.A. Gear Inc. to Pay $70,000 Over Mercury Shoes: The company has agreed to 
pay the state of Minnesota to settle charges that it failed to warn consumers 
that some of its lighted athletic shoes contain mercury and that throwing them 
in the garbage is illegal. The footwear company has also set up a nationwide 
toll-free number that consumers can call to obtain free mailers in which to 
send the sneakers back to the company for recycling."The mercury in just one 
pair of athletic shoes is equal to the amount of mercury in 2,200 
'significantly contaminated' northern pike," state Atty. Gen. Hubert Humphrey 
III said. The My Li'l Lights and L.A. Lights shoes use half a gram of mercury 
each in an electric switch that activates a small light in the shoe.

SMALL STOCKS LEAD RALLY; YIELDS EASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Technology shares paced a strong rally in smaller stocks Wednesday, as some 
healthy second-quarter earnings turned sidelined investors into buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, yields continued to ease, responding to another government 
report showing subdued inflation. A firmer dollar also helped bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks leaped 
9.76 points to 719.35, its highest close since June 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners topped losers by 15 to 11 on Nasdaq as this week's rally in depressed 
technology issues gained more steam. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue chips, in contrast, had a relatively dull day. The Dow industrials 
finished up just 1.62 points at 3,704.28 on moderate Big Board volume. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks and bonds were both buoyed by the Labor Department's June consumer 
inflation report, which showed prices up 0.3% for the month -- about in line 
with economists' projections. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the government reported that wholesale prices were unchanged 
overall in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The two inflation reports allayed some investors' fears that interest rates 
were poised to go even higher, after their recent surge. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, yields edged lower on short- and long-term securities. The 
30-year Treasury bond yield ended the day at 7.67%, down from Tuesday's 7.68%. 
</P>
<P>
 The beleaguered dollar fell early in the day but rebounded later and thus 
provided more inspiration for stocks and bonds. The greenback closed in New 
York at 98.30 Japanese yen, up from 97.50 on Tuesday. It also finished at 1.539 
German marks, up from 1.529. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, currency traders cautioned against calling the solid one-day gains a 
reversal of the bearish trend that has crushed the dollar in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Moore, a director at American Express Bank, said the dollar's rebound was 
"not conclusive yet. . . . There is some buying interest, but this could be 
just a minor short-covering correction." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, analysts said the rally in beaten-down tech stocks is also partly 
short-covering. 
</P>
<P>
 In a short sale, bearish traders sell borrowed stock, expecting to buy it back 
later at lower prices. If the market begins to rally, some short traders rush 
in to buy stock to cover their positions. Such short-covering can produce 
explosive, but brief, rallies in down markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Nasdaq technology issues rallying on their earnings reports included 
Chipcom, up 7 1/4 to 46 3/4; Seagate Technology, up 1 1/4 to 24 5/8, and 
Xircom, up 1/2 to 16 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other tech gainers, Intel gained 1 5/8 to 61 3/4, Compaq leaped 1 7/8 to 
36 7/8, AST Research jumped 1 3/8 to 15 3/4, Sybase surged 2 3/4 to 48 1/2 and 
3Com gained 3 7/8 to 55 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other stocks responding to second-quarter earnings reports included Hilton 
Hotels, up 1 3/8 to 62 7/8; International Paper, up 1 1/4 to 71 3/8, and First 
Chicago, up 1 to 49. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the takeover rumor mill, Quaker Oats jumped 2 3/4 to 77 on rumors Philip 
Morris may make a bid. Morris slipped 3/8 to 52 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, Tustin-based nursing home chain Regency Health Services 
plunged 5 3/8 to 8 3/4 after saying that earnings, hurt by recent acquisitions, 
will fall below analysts' expectations for the rest of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another loser was publisher Houghton-Mifflin, which sank 5 to 40 3/8 after 
its math textbooks received an unfavorable opinion from a California education 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's FTSE-100 index jumped 41.4 points to 3,005.3, helped by 
positive inflation news in Britain. In Frankfurt, the DAX index added 5.95 
points to 2,054.00. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei index rose 139.93 points to 20,540.41, while Mexico 
City's Bolsa index lost 23.31 points to 2,264.97.

SEC REPORTEDLY CONSIDERING PROBE OF TRADES BY FIDELITY STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Washington Post

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission is weighing whether to launch a formal 
investigation of Fidelity Investments for possible securities law violations in 
connection with stock trading by mutual fund managers for their personal 
accounts, according to industry and government sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said they expect the agency's preliminary examination to be 
referred to the SEC's enforcement division within a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC action will stimulate more debate over personal trading by mutual fund 
managers, traders and research analysts say. Earlier this year, a blue-ribbon 
panel issued a new set of voluntary personal trading guidelines for the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources say the new phase of the government's interest in Fidelity comes 
after a six-month SEC examination of the mutual fund giant's books by 
government accountants, who reportedly found a widespread pattern of high-speed 
personal trading by some Fidelity money managers. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is concerned that Fidelity employees who engaged in rapid 
trading may have breached their fiduciary duties to the funds' shareholders, 
the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said the SEC's recent examination of Fidelity raised the question 
of whether some Fidelity employees may have been "frontrunning," or trading on 
privileged information for themselves in advance of a purchase by one of 
Fidelity's funds, which would then boost the stock price. An SEC spokesman had 
no comment, saying, "We neither confirm nor deny the existence of any 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity spokeswoman Constance Hubbell said, "The SEC has conducted its 
routine, annual examination regarding our code of ethics, and to the best of 
our knowledge, the SEC is not taking any further action at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity has been tightening its personal trading rules since November, the 
company says. In 1993, Fidelity stiffened the rules following instances in 
which employees of the investment department bought stocks that were 
subsequently driven up in price when one or more Fidelity funds acquired the 
shares, according to sources at Fidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell said Fidelity recently told employees they must do their personal 
trading through Fidelity's discount brokerage from now on.

COALITION PROPOSES PUBLIC QUAKE INSURER; INSURANCE: CONSUMER GROUPS CALL ON THE 
LEGISLATURE TO CREATE A NONPROFIT VEHICLE TO SOLVE HOMEOWNERS CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of consumer groups, convinced that the California homeowners 
insurance crisis is being trumped up by insurance companies, called on Gov. 
Pete Wilson and the Legislature Wednesday to create a public nonprofit 
corporation to be the sole seller of earthquake and homeowners insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups -- the Center for Public Interest Law, Consumer Action, the 
Economic Empowerment Foundation, the Utility Consumers Action Network and the 
Proposition 103 Enforcement Project -- also asked that in the interim, 
insurance companies be prohibited from withdrawing from the homeowners and 
earthquake insurance market. 
</P>
<P>
 Their proposal for a public insurance vehicle comes as state officials, 
business organizations and other interest groups are debating how to provide 
consumers with earthquake protection when the insurance industry considers the 
coverage too risky for conventional underwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing claims of $6 billion or more from the Northridge earthquake, many of 
the state's largest carriers have recently either halted or severely restricted 
their writings of both homeowners and earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers say they would resume selling homeowners coverage if the state would 
drop its requirement that homeowners insurers also offer earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer groups say the industry has seized on the Jan. 17 quake as a way 
to obtain unjustified price increases on homeowners insurance while abandoning 
the riskier earthquake line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They made the charge in a lengthy letter Wednesday to Wilson and other top 
state officials. A public insurance corporation, the groups wrote, "would 
significantly reduce the cost of the coverage by eliminating the profit margin 
private insurers now demand." 
</P>
<P>
 But Marjorie M. Berte, Wilson's insurance adviser, said Wednesday that making 
insurance coverage public still doesn't solve the problem of how to build up a 
fund big enough to cover another Northridge-size quake or a bigger one. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is in no position to pledge cash or borrowing to cover that kind 
of catastrophe," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Cooley, a vice president for State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance 
Co., California's largest property insurer, said a California-only public 
corporation would also lack private carriers' ability to call in employees from 
around the country to handle claims after a major disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer coalition's plan, plus proposals for an insurance 
industry-financed earthquake pool, are among the topics to be discussed Friday 
in a meeting at State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's San Francisco 
offices. Real estate industry officials and bond market experts have been added 
to the list of business people invited to the second such problem-solving 
session. The first was held last week.

ARTHUR ANDERSEN LOSES $1.9-MILLION NEGLIGENCE JUDGMENT; ACCOUNTING: PACIFIC 
COAST PACKAGING SUED OVER THE FIRM'S FAILURE TO DETECT EMBEZZLEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 A Montebello company has won a $1.9-million judgment against Arthur Andersen & 
Co. in a suit accusing the accounting firm of negligence during a four-year 
period in which the client's controller embezzled $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest on the judgment could bring to nearly $3 million the sum owed to 
Pacific Coast Packaging. An attorney for Pacific Coast said Los Angeles County 
Superior Court Judge J. Kimball Walker will determine the interest award next 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury in Kimball's Norwalk court rendered its verdict against the Big 6 
accounting firm late Monday and decided Tuesday that Pacific Coast was owed 
interest on the amount. 
</P>
<P>
 However, an attorney for Arthur Andersen said he believes that, at the very 
least, the judge will cut the jury award in half. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm expects to file a motion "within the week" to have the jury's verdict 
set aside and "will not rest until it's a complete victory," said Marshall 
Grossman of the Century City law firm Alschuler, Grossman & Pines, which 
represented Andersen in the six-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The embezzlement by the controller, Edwin H. Carr Jr., began in 1986 and was 
discovered in late 1990 by a Pacific Coast Packaging employee. It created 
serious financial problems and forced Pacific Coast's parent company to sell a 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr was convicted and served a jail term; the lawsuit was filed against 
Andersen in 1992, according to Michael Winsten, one of two attorneys from the 
firm Bye & Hatcher in Irvine who represented Pacific Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Andersen was the company's auditor from 1978 until 1991. It contended 
that it was not hired to conduct a fraud investigation and therefore could not 
be held liable for Pacific Coast's losses. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as in a lengthening string of recent decisions against accounting firms, 
the jury apparently rejected that argument and found Andersen's auditors 
primarily negligent for not detecting the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the state Board of Accountancy filed documents seeking to revoke or 
suspend Arthur Andersen's license, accusing it of negligence in its audits of 
three S&Ls, including Irvine-based Lincoln Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen's attorneys said the move is aimed at coercing it to settle with the 
state. The accounting firm has already paid more than $79 million to the 
federal government, stemming from charges related to its audits of Lincoln and 
other failed thrifts.

DEFEAT OF BILL DEALS BLOW TO PROSPECTS FOR LABOR REFORM; UNIONS: THIS WEEK'S 
SENATE VOTE ON PROPOSED STRIKER REPLACEMENT LEGISLATION IS SEEN AS FORCING A 
CHANGE IN TACTICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Prospects for sweeping labor law reforms envisioned by the Clinton 
Administration and organized labor were badly damaged by this week's defeat of 
a bill intended to ban companies from firing and permanently replacing 
strikers, many business and labor observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 To hold any serious chance of passage, future labor law proposals backed by 
unions and the Administration will need to be moderated to satisfy 
conservatives, the observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Several factors figure in their reasoning. First, if a bill as dear to union 
members as the striker replacement bill failed, other major labor-backed 
legislation with less emotional and widespread appeal would also stand to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, pro-business Republicans are expected to gain seats in Congress in this 
fall's elections, presenting further obstacles for future labor-supported 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 If unions and their Democratic allies couldn't win on labor law reform this 
year, "they certainly can't do it next year," said Bradley J. Cameron, a 
spokesman for the Labor Policy Assn., a group representing big corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration in 1995 is due to push for changes in labor laws that have 
governed relations between unions and management since the 1930s. To start the 
process, President Clinton named a panel to suggest ways to modernize labor 
laws and make U.S. employers more competitive globally. 
</P>
<P>
 Headed by former Labor Secretary John T. Dunlop and including many other 
members friendly to organized labor, the Dunlop Commission issued a preliminary 
report last month that generally was well-received by labor and management. It 
decried such things as the growing gap between high-wage and low-wage workers, 
along with the rising number of lawsuits stemming from employment disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's work is expected to face more controversy, however, when it 
proposes specific legislative reforms in a report due after the November 
elections. Particularly sensitive is the expected review of the laws and 
employment practices that, labor officials say, have made it more difficult for 
unions to organize workers. 
</P>
<P>
 If the commission recommends legislation that "corresponds with organized 
labor's wish list, it's not going to go anywhere," said Jeffrey A. Joseph, vice 
president for domestic policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospects also appear dim for a labor-backed bill in the Senate to overhaul 
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Such legislation is taking a 
back seat to health care reform, which "will eat up most of the calendar this 
year," said David M. Saltz, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saltz, clearly disappointed by the failure of the striker replacement bill 
to overcome a filibuster in Senate votes on both Tuesday and Wednesday, wasn't 
willing to concede defeat on labor's legislative agenda. He argued that there 
is even a chance to revive the striker replacement bill this year if Democratic 
senators succeed in attaching the proposal to legislation supported by 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Saltz also contended that some senators who opposed the striker replacement 
bills were locked into their positions because of previous public statements on 
the issue and that they might show more flexibility on other labor-backed 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each issue has a life and dynamic of its own," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One option for the Dunlop Commission or the Clinton Administration, Cameron 
said, might be to sidestep some of the controversial issues concerning union 
rights and focus instead on other ways to enhance labor-management cooperation 
and employment-related litigation.

 Consumer prices rose moderately in June, slightly faster than the previous 
month, providing what analysts said is the merest glimmer of possible higher 
inflation to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department said Wednesday that the consumer price index was up 0.3% 
in June, following a 0.2% rise in May and 0.1% in April. Rising gasoline 
prices, car prices and car financing costs contributed significantly, along 
with higher clothing and medical care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, prices at the consumer level are rising at an annual rate of 
just 2.5%, even better than the modest 2.7% gain posted for all of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some analysts said there are warning signs that the cost of living 
could climb. 
</P>
<P>
 "The June figure is just a little disappointing," said Prof. Norman Robertson 
of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. "It's a little on the high side, 
suggesting there is some increase in the inflation rate on the horizon." 
</P>
<P>
 "The inflation report is neither good nor bad near-term but leaves open the 
question of whether inflation will accelerate in the future," said Allen Sinai 
of Lehman Bros. investors. 
</P>
<P>
 But other economists said inflation is mostly a figment of the worried 
imaginations of nervous investors and traders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inflation remains a non-problem despite the continued growth in the U.S. 
economy," said Martin Regalia of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, we have modest inflation, and I expect it to continue," said 
economist Carl Palash of MCM MoneyWatch, a New York financial adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 "Goods prices, outside of energy and food, have accelerated and likely will 
continue due to low inventories for items like automobiles and apparel," he 
said. "But offsetting that is deceleration in services prices." 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer price report came just one day after even better inflation news. 
The Labor Department reported Tuesday that wholesale prices held steady in 
June, the third straight month in which inflation at the producer level was 
nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department also reported Wednesday that the weekly earnings of 
Americans in June declined 1% after rising 0.5% in May. It was the first 
decline in earnings since February. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the evidence that inflation is subdued, many analysts expect the 
Federal Reserve Board to raise short-term interest rates for the fifth time 
this year -- probably when central bank policy-makers next meet, on Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Since February, the Fed has boosted the federal funds rate -- the rate banks 
charge each other for overnight loans -- from 3% to 4.25% and has raised the 
discount rate for direct Fed loans to banks from 3% to 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Those predicting an additional increase cite shortages and higher prices for 
some commodities and sharp increases in the size of the work force, which could 
lead to labor shortages and thus higher wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the economy continues to perform well, expanding at a healthy rate 
after spectacular growth in the final months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer price report was generally in line with analysts' predictions and 
produced a positive reaction on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But the falling U.S. dollar and fears of higher interest rates are still 
troubling the financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation has remained calm throughout the prolonged economic recovery. Prior 
to last year's 2.7% rise in the cost of living, inflation was up 2.9% in 1992 
and 3.1% in 1991. Consumer Price Index

SALICK BREAKS NEW GROUND IN DEAL WITH FLORIDA HMO 
</P>

<P>
 In an attempt to show that comprehensive and cost-effective care can be 
provided for a large number of cancer patients at a fixed fee, Salick Health 
Care said Wednesday that it has signed a pioneering agreement with a Florida 
health maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based operator of cancer clinics said the deal with Physicians 
Corp. of America marks the first time a private health care firm has agreed to 
provide a full range of services to a large group of patients under "capitated" 
payment arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitation is a payment method used in managed health care plans such as HMOs, 
in which a provider is paid a set monthly or annual fee for each member. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Salick will provide services, including inpatient, 
outpatient and home care, to Physicians Corp.'s HMO members in south Florida. 
The agreement is valued at up to $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the company's program is to provide cost-effective care without a 
reduction in quality, Chairman and Chief Executive Dr. Bernard Salick said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its contract with Physicians Corp., Salick Health will provide 
cancer treatment under a set of clinical guidelines aimed at standardizing 
treatment for patients. It will also provide detailed analysis of the quality 
of care patients receive. DAVID R. OLMOS

GLENDALE FEDERAL TO SELL WASHINGTON THRIFTS; BANKING: FIRST INTERSTATE BANCORP 
WILL PAY $190 MILLION FOR THE 25-OFFICE UNIVERSITY SAVINGS BANK, THE S&L'S LAST 
OUT-OF-STATE OPERATION.

<P>
 Glendale Federal Bank took its final step toward becoming a California-only 
savings and loan Wednesday, announcing that it has agreed to sell the last of 
its out-of-state banking operations to Los Angeles-based First Interstate 
Bancorp for $190 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate's purchase of Glendale Federal's 25-office University Savings 
Bank unit in Washington state should be completed by the first quarter of next 
year, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Federal, which has slowly been narrowing its losses, is betting that 
its best chance of returning to profitability lies in California's fledgling 
recovery. If the sale is completed, it would leave Glendale Federal with 132 
branch offices in California. 
</P>
<P>
 By focusing solely on California, "we believe we have developed a solid 
foundation for future growth," said Stephen J. Trafton, GlenFed chairman and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulators nearly seized Glendale Federal a year ago because it was 
seriously undercapitalized. But the Glendale-based thrift completed a massive 
recapitalization plan in September and has since been selling off its 
out-of-state operations and portfolios of bad loans to raise cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The company agreed to sell $226 million in sour real estate and commercial 
loans to a consortium of investors last month, slicing its non-performing 
assets by 22% in one fell swoop. In April, GlenFed sold its 60 Florida branches 
to Barnett Banks Inc. of Florida for more than $243 million. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate, meanwhile, has been moving in the opposite direction, 
seeking to expand its market outside California. Earlier this year, the bank 
bought 15 Great American Savings Assn. branches scattered across Washington 
state, which First Interstate has targeted for an aggressive expansion program.

 Renault May Be Up for Sale: The French government said it will hire a bank to 
advise it on a possible public sale of the state-owned car and truck maker.But 
it said a decision to hire an adviser does not imply that a decision has been 
made to sell Renault, the world's sixth-largest auto maker. "It will elucidate 
the different possible options for an opening up of Renault's capital," 
Minister of the Economy Edmond Alphandery said in announcing the move. Renault, 
20%-owned by Swedish car and truck maker Volvo, is valued at about $8.6 billion 
by analysts, and several French companies, including defense and publishing 
group Matra-Hachette, have expressed interest in buying it.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; COMPANIES LOBBY FOR DISCOUNTS, NOT 
MILEAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A consortium of Fortune 500 companies, tired of paying premium air fares for 
business travel, plans to ask the federal government this month for clearance 
of a plan that could give corporations steep discounts for travel in lieu of 
receiving frequent-flier miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current ticketing system, corporate travelers frequently cannot take 
advantage of discount fares offered to leisure travelers, so they pay the 
highest ticket prices. At the same time, however, the employee who travels, not 
the corporation itself, gets the frequent-flier miles. 
</P>
<P>
 This in effect means that the company pays for a benefit it doesn't get, said 
Kevin Mitchell, founder and president of Business Travel Contractors Corp., a 
17-company consortium based in King of Prussia, Pa., which announced its 
formation last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Business Travel Contractors wants to set up a system that gives participating 
members special corporate rates from airlines instead of frequent-flier miles. 
The consortium would set the rates, and the airlines could accept or reject 
them. The proposed rates, called business contract fares, would be based on 
mileage and would be the same for all carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind banding together as purchasers is that airlines would not want 
to lose the volume of business represented by consortium members. Mitchell 
expects the consortium to represent $2 billion to $4 billion annually in air 
travel dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The consortium already includes such industry giants as General Motors, 
Chrysler, Merck, Black & Decker, Bell Atlantic and Whirlpool, each of which has 
contributed research and development seed money to prepare the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is the consumer, not the supplier, fixing the price in this case, 
the group is taking the precautionary step of running its plan by the antitrust 
division of the Justice Department this month before taking it to the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the airlines are officially remaining quiet on the issue until 
the Justice Department has reviewed the proposal, which could take three to six 
months. However, several airline representatives, who asked not to be named, 
expressed doubts that the effort will fly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're talking about (getting rid of) frequent-flier miles, then we would 
not be interested," one said. "We view the frequent-flier program as the 
cornerstone of our marketing program." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, when IBM reportedly approached United Airlines and American Airlines 
earlier this year about a similar proposal for a corporate discount without 
frequent-flier miles, it was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frequent-flier programs are a billion-dollar business," said Ken Heldt, 
president of RAN Decisions, a Colorado Springs, Colo.-based firm that helps 
companies set up programs to reclaim their employees' frequent-flier miles for 
use in future business travel. "They've become a new way of advertising for the 
airlines." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, pressure from companies to get reduced fares is mounting. 
Companies have only two choices in reducing air travel costs, Heldt said. 
"There aren't any other ways to save money other than getting a discount or 
using (frequent-flier) awards," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Business Travel Contract plan, member corporations would purchase 
tickets from contract airlines at a "net" price that would exclude the cost of 
including frequent-flier miles, travel agency commissions and other marketing 
costs the public pays for in the ticket price. Member companies would pay their 
travel agencies a fee for each ticket so the airlines would not have to pay the 
agencies commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Companies could save up to 20% of their travel costs under the plan, Mitchell 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which has not yet disclosed specific fare proposals, has run its 
own analysis of airline ticket costs to determine what it believes would be a 
fair net price for its corporate customers, said Mitchell, former vice 
president of conference and travel management for Cigna Cos. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal has drawn criticism from some travel industry groups. The 
American Society of Travel Agents, for one, plans to fight it.  
</P>
<P>
 "ASTA is inalterably opposed to any plan that would alter the agent-travel 
supplier-consumer relationship that has served the traveling public so well," 
the Washington-based group said in a statement last month when Business Travel 
Contractors announced its plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see no advantage in putting a middle man or a corporation in the airline 
business," said Jeanne Epping, senior vice president of ASTA and an agent with 
Santa Cruz Travel in Santa Cruz. "We don't think it would reduce costs per se." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ASTA particularly objects to changing the way tickets are issued, Epping said. 
The plan would eliminate airline commissions, which are worth 10% or more of 
the ticket price. Instead, companies purchasing the tickets would pay the 
agents a fee for their services. The amount of the fee has not been decided 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, ASTA doesn't believe buyers should dictate the price of a 
seller's services, Epping said. "We will oppose this concept with the carriers, 
the participating corporations and the Department of Justice if necessary," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the group said it is working to get airlines to address many of the 
same issues as those brought up by the Business Travel Contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that frequent-flier programs have resulted in higher fares for the 
business traveler, Epping said. "We have asked airlines to review" their 
frequent-flier policies.  
</P>
<P>
 ASTA has also advocated a simpler fare structure with fewer fare changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Business Travel Assn., an Arlington, Va.-based trade group 
representing corporate travel planners, is withholding judgment while it 
studies the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Business Travel Contractors Corp. approach is another adaptation of 
volume purchasing," NBTA President E.J. Hewitt said, adding that it calls for 
"new methods in marketing airline tickets, new procedures in travel management 
and a new relationship with travel agents." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yet questions regarding antitrust, airline acceptance of the program, actual 
savings to firms and how this proposal would impact the way in which business 
travel is presently managed all need to be answered before travel managers 
could consider implementing this proposal," Hewitt said. Creative Ticketing 
</P>
<P>
 Business travelers often fly midweek and cannot qualify for lower air fares. 
This inspires the cost-conscious to "bend the rules" to get discounts. Three 
common techniques:  
</P>
<P>
 * Back-to-back: This works when (for a midweek trip) it is cheaper to buy two 
round-trip tickets that require a Saturday night stay than to use one 
unrestricted fare. Travelers simply use the outbound portion of each ticket, 
never using the returns.  
</P>
<P>
 * Nesting: This works when a business traveler needs to routinely take midweek 
trips. A series of round-trip tickets can be bought, each including a Saturday 
night stay, that alternately begin in the destination or originating city. A 
ticket might be bought leaving Los Angeles on a Tuesday morning, returning the 
following Tuesday night. At the same time, another round trip can be bought 
leaving San Francisco on Tuesday night, returning the following Tuesday 
morning. Mixing the tickets creates a round trip each Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hidden city: Sometimes a lower fare will exist to a destination that 
connects through a higher-priced hub city. To take advantage of lower fares 
when you want to travel to a hub, book your flight to the least expensive 
"hidden city" (beyond the hub) and get off at the hub. Warning: Checked luggage 
will go to the ticketed destination.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; THE FALLING DOLLAR CLOUDS EUROPEAN COMPANIES' PROFIT 
PICTURE; TRADE: LARGE MULTINATIONALS DO AS MUCH AS HALF THEIR BUSINESS IN U.S. 
DOLLARS. WHEN THE GREENBACK FALLS, SO CAN PROFITS.

<P>
 In late April, Mercedes-Benz Chief Executive Helmut Werner strode into a 
meeting, overjoyed with a big bank's latest forecast: The dollar was heading 
toward 1.80 marks from 1.66 by year's end, a hike that would add $263 million 
to the revenue of Mercedes' North American car operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner isn't overjoyed anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 With the dollar having fallen about 6% against the mark in the last six weeks, 
to 1.5405 on Wednesday, and declining against other major European currencies, 
the profits of multinationals that depend on the U.S. market are threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Large companies across Europe, such as Mercedes parent Daimler-Benz in 
Germany, Elf Aquitaine in France and Hanson in Britain do as much as 50% of 
their business in U.S. dollars. When the dollar falls, profits can follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in the nature of U.K. public companies to have big international 
exposure," said Rob Buckland, European equity strategist at NatWest Securities 
Ltd. "Some 25% of the earnings of U.K.-listed companies come from the U.S., so 
the dollar must have a very important impact." 
</P>
<P>
 British companies' total exposure to swings in the dollar can be even higher. 
Currencies in many Asian areas, such as territory of Hong Kong, are pegged to 
the dollar to make trade easier. So when profits from Asian operations are 
included, some large British corporations wind up with 40% to 50% of their 
earnings in dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, European companies have also been reaping the benefits of the 
ravaged dollar to go on shopping sprees in the United States, snapping up 
companies whose price tags have fallen along with the currency. For example, 
Roche Holdings of Switzerland is in the middle of purchasing U.S. firm Syntex 
Corp. for $5.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 British companies have been fortunate that the dollar has not fallen as much 
against the pound as it has against the mark or the yen. The pound is up only 
about 3% against the dollar since June 1, trading at $1.5660 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany, particularly in the auto industry, it's another story. Some 
analysts say the falling dollar may put more pressure on Mercedes and other 
German auto makers to rescind some earlier price cuts and raise U.S. prices for 
the 1995 model season, which starts this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 When the dollar falls below 1.65 marks, car makers don't easily make a profit 
on their exports to the United States and dollar-pegged Asian markets, said 
Joachim Bernsdorff, an analyst at Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "They lost money last year because of the exchange," which averaged 1.65 marks 
to the dollar in 1993, Bernsdorff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't see what they lost, because the German parent sells at a loss to a 
U.S. subsidiary so that the subsidiary can show a profit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mercedes and counterparts BMW and Porsche hedge against currency 
fluctuations, those hedges cover only six- to nine-month periods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer this goes on, the more we would be worried," said Hans Christian 
Haas, a trader at Dresdner Bank who closely tracks the car industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States takes 12% of Mercedes' sales and 15% of BMW's output. Most 
of Volkswagen's VW brand cars sold in the United States are made in Mexico, but 
its Audi brand models are built in Germany and also face pressure from a 
falling dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutch aircraft maker Fokker will also be significantly hurt by the weaker 
dollar. Though its production is based in guilders, aircraft sales are 
generally denominated in dollars. Fokker spokesman Leo Stein said the 
persistently low dollar is the main reason behind its cost-cutting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Fokker "adapted its cost structure when it became clear that the dollar fell 
structurally below 2 guilders," he said. The dollar has been below 2 guilders 
since July, 1991. The company's two major stake holders, Deutsche Aerospace and 
the Dutch government, said recently that they would inject $566 million into 
cash-strapped Fokker. 
</P>
<P>
 At Benetton, the Italian clothing manufacturer and retailer, about 70% of 
revenue comes from outside of Italy. One-fifth of its sales are in dollars.

DECOR DISPUTE A BITTER BREW; RETAIL: TRIANGLE SQUARE CALLS THE SOON-TO-CLOSE 
COFFEE STORE'S 'RECYCLED' LOOK UNAUTHORIZED. THE SHOP OWNER SAYS MALL OPERATORS 
OBJECT TO 'SOUL.' 
</P>

 When Jill Kitches moved to Newport Beach from Tucson recently to look for 
work, she found a comfortable spot to sip coffee and fill out job applications 
-- a table at Alta Coffeehouse & Roasting Co.'s year-old store at Triangle 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the outside it looks like your typical, cold mall building," said Kitches, 
who once worked at a small coffee shop in Arizona. "But inside it's a nice, 
comfortable shop. I even thought of asking for a job." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday afternoon, Kitches was sipping coffee and filling out yet another 
application. But she's crossed Alta off of her list of possible employers 
because the popular shop is closing its doors this weekend, the victim of a 
bitter dispute between store owners and the mall's operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Triangle Square managers said Wednesday that Alta's owners will vacate the 
building by Wednesday and that several other operators are interested in 
opening a new coffee shop in Alta's space. Store owners contend that the 
multilevel mall hasn't attracted the type and number of shops needed to 
generate enough foot traffic for the coffee shop to turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of what prompted the dispute, Kitches says she will miss Alta's 
tasty coffee, friendly staff -- as well as the eclectic design elements that 
apparently drove a wedge between Triangle Square and Alta. 
</P>
<P>
 Mall manager Lars Anderson said Wednesday that Alta co-owner Patty Spooner 
made substantial architectural changes after the store's design was approved. 
"What they did looks completely different from what was submitted," Anderson 
said. "They did it without discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, maintains Spooner, who said mall officials knew perfectly well that 
the shop's design would differ dramatically from the cool, polished look of 
Niketown, Virgin Megastore, Sfuzzi and other Triangle Square retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent recently to mall executives and distributed to customers, 
Spooner complained that "when we started moving in and showing our 'soul,' you 
and your partners vehemently protested our design and our philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alta's neighbors revel in their high-tech, polished digs, but the coffee 
shop's owners are more at home with recycled fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 Spooner says she found Alta's bathroom doors at a Goodwill store, and the 
shop's wooden floor was stripped from an abandoned house in Newport Beach. The 
bookcase that divides the shop was saved from another house that was slated for 
demolition. Most of the shop's kitchen equipment was acquired at auction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole place is made of recycled materials," Spooner said. "It's all up to 
code, and when we finished it, we did a great job. But we didn't conform to 
their corporate style." 
</P>
<P>
 Spooner argues that the mall has been trying to dump the coffee shop for 
months because of the design disagreement. She also faults the mall for not 
fulfilling promises made in 1993 about the volume of foot traffic that would be 
passing by the shop's front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Spooner admits, though, that she "was probably stupid" for signing a lease 
that she now believes is costlier than any other lease at Triangle Square. In 
the letter distributed to customers, she writes that "we were naive, we didn't 
think to judge the quality of customer base on their average dollar spent; we 
judged on smiles returned." 
</P>
<P>
 Spooner, who also owns a wholesale coffee distribution company, said she can't 
afford to reopen elsewhere immediately. She also said that mall managers won't 
let her recoup losses by selling the Triangle Square operation to an interested 
buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 She faults the mall for refusing to negotiate a new deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't how it's supposed to be," said Spooner, who has about 20 employees 
at the shop. "We started out here before Nike and before Virgin. We've been 
paying rent until recently. But when we said we needed to talk, they would have 
nothing to do with us."

BRIEFCASE: TRAVEL AND TOURISM; UP TO 240 DISNEYLAND WORKERS MAY LOSE JOBS IN 
ROUND 2 OF LAYOFFS

 Disneyland workers are bracing for another round of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 2% of all positions at the theme park -- as many as 240 jobs -- will be 
cut by September unless attendance drastically improves, Disney theme park 
chief Judson C. Green said in a recent memo to employees.A similar memo is 
being circulated at Walt Disney World in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1% or 2% cut may sound modest compared to recent reductions in other 
Southern California industries such as aerospace, but because Disneyland has 
such a large staff -- it is Orange County's largest employer -- that total 
would be significant. 
</P>
<P>
 The park has 9,000 workers in the off-peak season and 12,000 in the summer, 
meaning that the staff cut could range from 90 workers to as many as 240. The 
result of a 2% cut would be more severe in Florida, where the company has 
35,000 employees. There, it could mean the loss of as many as 700 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 A Disney spokeswoman said that Green sent the memo to quell rumors about the 
extent of impending staff cuts. He did not say how the reduction will be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite lavish spending by Disney on new rides and attractions, the parks are 
not having a good year. International tourism, particularly to the United 
States from Asia, has been down because of concerns about crime and natural 
calamities in both California and Florida, Green said in interviews last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The parks already trimmed their payrolls once this year, with about 60 
positions cut at Disneyland in February. And the company has encouraged older 
workers to retire by imposing deadlines to take advantage of health benefits.

MAJOR HOME BUILDER FORMED BY MERGER; CONSTRUCTION: NEW SAN JUAN GROUP OF COS. 
WILL BE 55% OWNED BY SANTA MARGARITA CO., 45% BY WESTERN NATIONAL GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Signaling a continued shift toward home building, the Santa Margarita Co. said 
Wednesday that it will own 55% of a home construction concern created in the 
merger of two local firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the San Juan Group of Cos., the new company combines Western National 
Homes, the apartment and home building arm of Western National Group, the 
largest apartment developer and manager in Orange County, and the San Juan 
Group, a home builder owned by the Santa Margarita Co., developer and manager 
of 40,000 South County acres, of which it owns 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the Santa Margarita Co. purchased the San Juan Group from 
investors. Santa Margarita President Anthony R. Moiso had already held a 
controlling stake in the San Juan Group, which was sold for an undisclosed 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The new company will become one of Orange County's largest builders if it 
makes good on plans to build 300 to 500 homes and about 1,000 apartments each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a logical combination of our two businesses and complementary 
skills," said Matthew K. Osgood, 34, president of Western National Homes, who 
will be president and chief operating officer of the new company, which will be 
located in Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Western National Group would own 45% of the combined building company, with 
Santa Margarita Co., the developer of such master-planned communities as Rancho 
Santa Margarita and Las Flores, owning the controlling stake. No layoffs are 
planned at the company, which will have 50 employees. Financial details were 
not released. 
</P>
<P>
 The new entity would build apartments for Western National, which plans to go 
public with a $167-million real estate investment trust offering this year. The 
privately held company has more than $1 billion in assets and 27,000 mostly 
California apartment units under management, nearly 80% of them in Orange 
County. Western National had earlier said its home building arm would not be 
included in the REIT. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Western National Homes built about 200 single-family homes and 230 
apartments, while San Juan built about 150 homes, all in Rancho Santa 
Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds as if they are developing an in-house building entity for the Santa 
Margarita Co. -- with full-range capability of both single-family homes and 
apartments," said John Shumway, president of Market Profiles of Costa Mesa, a 
real estate consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good fit because it's a merger of expertise. San Juan was primarily a 
home builder and Western National has been apartments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumway said that if the merged company builds up to 500 homes and 1,000 
apartments each year, as it plans, it would be one of the larger builders in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be known as a home builder that also builds apartments," said 
Dennis Bean III, 41, president of the San Juan Group, who will be chief 
executive officer of the new company. "We are bringing together some talented 
people and we want to get busy and build some of these projects."  
</P>
<P>
 He said San Juan has plans to buy 112 housing lots in Rancho Santa Margarita 
and several other sites in south Orange County, including in the 1,000-acre Las 
Flores master-planned community. San Juan Group of Cos. at a Glance

</P>
<P>
 * Headquarters: Rancho Santa Margarita 
</P>
<P>

and San Juan Group, founded in 1990. 
</P>

 * Projects: Plans to build as many as 500 homes and 1,000 apartments a year, 
making it one of Orange County's largest builders.

 United Front: The 93 Orange County-based employees of United Airlines have a 
new boss: themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the local force among 75,000 United workers who will share a stake in 
the giant carrier as a result of shareholders' approval this week of one of the 
largest employee-ownership deals. 
</P>
<P>
 United's presence at Orange County's John Wayne Airport may grow if its 
planned United Shuttle goes forward here. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed as an "airline within an airline," United Shuttle would operate at 
lower overall costs than the rest of the carrier and concentrate on relatively 
short trips. That way, United could compete against discount carrier Southwest 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "United's commitment to Orange County has always been strong," said United 
spokesman John D. Kiker. "Now that we have a stake in the future, I think the 
friendly skies have just become friendlier." 
</P>
<P>
 United now has 17 daily flights in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 While the carrier has not indicated which could become United Shuttle flights, 
a good choice might be its seven daily flights to San Francisco. Southwest 
started flying to San Jose and Oakland in May, but so far there are no discount 
flights from Orange County to San Francisco.

 Good Use of Leftovers: The Anaheim Marriott is putting its leftovers to good 
use, sending its surplus food to two local social service agencies to help them 
feed their clients and to minimize waste. 
</P>
<P>
 The food is going to the Anaheim Interfaith Shelter for homeless families with 
children and to the Syntone Treatment Center, which cares for abused boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftovers from the hotel can include as much as 50 pounds of chicken salad or 
a like amount of deli meats.  
</P>
<P>
 "So many people are in need of food in Orange County," said Dennis Nau, the 
hotel's director of food and beverage service. "Our donation of the hotel's 
excess food is ideal for all involved, and so simple."

sales of two summers ago, making it a challenge for some vacationers to get the 
cheap seats they were counting on. 
</P>
<P>
 With airplanes averaging more than two-thirds full, the least expensive 
tickets are hard to come by on flights to popular tourist spots, travel agents 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for this range from improvements in the economy to airline 
cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, airlines offered discounts for summer trips as high as 40% 
and many of these cheap seats filled quickly. Many who figured they could hold 
out for the next promotion are disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 American Airlines spokesman Tim Smith says travelers shouldn't despair. If 
passengers are willing to be flexible on the flight time or whether they make a 
connection, cheap seats are available, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many airline watchers expect that another sale will be launched in August for 
fall travel, but that prices won't be much cheaper for the rest of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The seat shortage is the result of a recovering economy colliding with a 
shrinking industry, said Helane Becker, airline analyst at Lehman Brothers, a 
New York investment firm. Since the half-off discounts of two years ago packed 
jets at money-losing fares, airlines have been grounding aircraft and canceling 
orders for new planes.

CORPORATE DOWNSIZING CAN BE DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD; RESTRUCTURING: IT DOESN'T 
ALWAYS IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY -- AND IT MIGHT END UP COSTING MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA GENASCI, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Millions of employee layoffs have helped corporate America cut expenses. But 
evidence is growing that the strategy known as downsizing produces destructive 
side effects that range from demoralized workers to job burnout. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, researchers and strategists say the attempt to strengthen profits 
and productivity through cutting layers of workers may actually have cost many 
companies billions of dollars. Nor is it clear that downsizing has made 
businesses as productive as initially hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of the downsizing of the last 10 years has been an enormous waste of 
time and energy, and in many cases has been spectacularly unsuccessful," said 
Michael Hammer, a consultant specializing in re-engineering efforts. "I'm 
seeing many companies go that route and then regret it." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there is a powerful argument for cutting unnecessary workers in an 
age when technology can do the work of several people. If American industry is 
to remain competitive on costs, work force cutbacks are still seen as an 
obvious way to achieve the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, on Wall Street, a main barometer of corporate performance, investors 
usually act favorably to word of cost-cutting. Stock prices often jump when 
companies terminate workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, charge that re-engineering has become a fad, with companies 
embracing the strategy without considering the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer estimates that 70% of the corporate cost-cutting he has observed has 
not achieved hoped-for results. And a survey of top executives by the 
consulting firm Arthur D. Little shows about two-thirds are not satisfied. In 
hindsight, many said they should have planned more carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem, the study found, was a conflict between the executives' 
objectives, motivations and expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Peter Scott-Morgan, associate director at Little and author of the book 
"The Unwritten Rules of the Game," said not surprisingly, chief executives have 
been reluctant to address their failures. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a conspiracy of silence," Scott-Morgan said. "But many feel 
the changes have been too slow or too patchy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tragedy is that so many people are suffering and the reasons for which 
they have had to suffer not being achieved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the obvious emotional and financial cost to employees is the 
less-publicized and not insignificant cost to companies themselves. American 
corporations are spending between $7 billion and $10 billion a year on 
re-engineering, Scott-Morgan estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of America's largest companies have been shrinking since the mid-1980s 
and the economic recovery has not slowed the pace. For example, after 
eliminating about 100,000 jobs since 1984, AT&T is still dropping 1,000 a 
month, spokesman Burke Stinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1983 to 1993, Fortune 500 companies eliminated 4.7 million people from 
their payrolls, or one-quarter of their work force, said David Birch, president 
of Cognetics, a Cambridge, Mass., business research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a study for the Census Bureau's Center for Economic Study questions 
whether job cuts and improved productivity -- a key rationale for many 
restructurings -- necessarily go hand-in-hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many ways the message is that we need to be careful when we look at trends 
in the economy and then apply them to all industries," said University of 
Maryland economics professor John Haltiwanger, one of the study's authors. 
</P>
<P>
 An analysis of productivity at 140,000 factories during the 1980s found that 
while 55% of gains came where the work force fell, the other 45% came at plants 
with growing employment. 
</P>
<P>
 David Noer, author of "Healing the Wounds: Overcoming the Trauma of Layoffs 
and Revitalizing Downsized Operations," said the anger and fear among employees 
who survive layoffs limit their risk-taking -- and hurt productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem, Hammer and other strategists say, is that in their quest 
for efficiency, many companies have ignored the human side of the drama, that 
restructuring efforts are changing how employees view their work lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, loyalty was a given: If you worked hard, you attained. An employee 
gave the company loyalty and received a steady job, service pins and a secure 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new reality is that people come to the office understanding . . . that to 
rely on the paternalism of the company is a mistake," Stinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although companies have found loyalty is hard to engender amid massive 
layoffs, they are also beginning to recognize that without significant 
commitment from workers the changes won't be successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives also have not considered how restructuring affects the workload of 
remaining employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "All many companies are doing is eliminating people, throwing them over the 
side of the boat, and they aren't eliminating work," Hammer said. "Companies 
then have to work the remaining people harder and they become stressed and 
unhappy."

KLM DISCOVERS IT PAYS TO CATER TO A SPECIAL BREED OF PASSENGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 KLM Royal Dutch Airlines runs one of the best but least-known hotels at 
Schiphol airport. Instead of silken sheets or caviar, its pampered guests are 
offered beds of fresh hay and diets of dog biscuits. 
</P>
<P>
 This takes place at KLM Cargo's unique animal hotel, which has housed some of 
the world's most valuable creatures, from racehorses to rhinos, elephants and 
killer whales. 
</P>
<P>
 But of all the animal species which have passed through its portals over the 
years, KLM Cargo has developed a special expertise in flying and caring for 
horses. 
</P>
<P>
 KLM flies about 3,000 horses yearly and has been appointed the official 
carrier for the World Equestrian Games, scheduled for the Hague at the end of 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Piet Hamstra, KLM Cargo's transport manager for live animals, said KLM has 
already flown in some international horse teams as the buildup to the games 
begins. This month, the equine population in the Netherlands will have swollen 
by 800 to 1,000 horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Many will arrive by road, as no trainer would willingly fly his horses when 
there is a traversable trailer route, Hamstra said. 
</P>
<P>
 But thousands of horses fly around the world every year and KLM, along with 
Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Air France, has become a specialist in what Hamstra 
said can be "a very lucrative business." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides events like this year's World Games, the horse business also has its 
own defined trade flows and its own specialist language in which Hamstra is 
expert. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the United States to Germany, Holland and Italy, we see flows of quarter 
horses. . . . Trotters are permanent features on routes into Scandinavia and 
there are always polos coming out of South America and Argentina particularly," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 KLM Cargo was quick to move into the market when it first started booming in 
the early 1980s. It developed its own special horse box for long-haul flights 
and hired the specialist staff it needed to become a market leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Grooms (some 80% of whom are women, according to Hamstra) may travel with 
their horses. The KLM box has a special compartment where the groom stands up 
to comfort the horse. KLM is the only airline in the world that allows grooms 
to stand, without a seat belt, during takeoffs and landings, for the sake of 
the horse's well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 "Care, care, care. That's the most important factor. Horses are not cargo; 
they are passengers," said Hamstra, adding that horses can experience the same 
fears and tensions experienced by many humans during flight. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need liquid and they need food. Just like you, when they are scared, 
they may want to drink a bit more than usual. We've come to know how to treat 
them, and they respond well to lots of care, some hay or perhaps an apple."

LOUIS VUITTON HANDBAGS STAND TEST OF TIME, WORLDWIDE RECESSION; FASHION: SALES 
ARE UP 35%. WITH NO CLEAR, DIRECT COMPETITOR, EXPANSION IS GOING INTO HIGH 
GEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 LV monogrammed handbags, the ultimate status symbols of the 1980s, have 
withstood worldwide recession and careening currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk down any fashionable street from New York to Tokyo and the gold and brown 
leather products by Louis Vuitton abound, perennially popular amid the 
ever-changing whims of fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 All this bodes well for the French luxury goods industry but the head of Louis 
Vuitton, Yves Carcelle, struggles to name a product with as high a profit 
margin as his own luxury leather-luggage range. 
</P>
<P>
 Business is booming, sales across its handbags-to-travel trunks line are up 
35% so far this year, with customers rationed to just one or two of the same 
item from its own shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese buyers who purchase half of Louis Vuitton's output are busy buying, 
and Carcelle said his luxury-priced goods are seeing growth rates not seen 
since the boom years of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Vuitton's shop in Paris' prestigious Avenue Montaigne is busy with 
buyers picking over a line stretching from a leather business-card holder for 
$73 to a luxury upright trunk carrying 30 pairs of shoes for $29,600. 
</P>
<P>
 Outrageous, one says? But the Louis Vuitton line is considered a long-term 
purchase, one untouched by yearly changes in style, like table silver or a 
diamond ring. 
</P>
<P>
 The luggage group, part of Bernard Arnault's LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton 
empire, stacked up $983 million of sales in 1993 with an operating profit 
margin of 42.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 With no clear direct competitor, and current sales strong in its worldwide 
chain of 177 company-owned stores, Carcelle sees no reason why profit margins 
should fall as the group struggles to meet an almost insatiable demand for its 
leather goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The business is a true money-spinner, showing sales just below LVMH's 
Christian Dior and Givenchy perfume division, but producing nearly three times 
the profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Carcelle cannot think of a product with the 40%-plus margin of his own group. 
"Perhaps Rolex (watches), but there are few figures available," he told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Carcelle said the key to the group's success is quality, and that quality 
image is reinforced by only selling its goods through company-owned shops where 
cutting prices to boost sales is simply unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite sluggish demand in other segments due to the lagging world 
economy, the 160-year-old company is busy building a new factory in central 
France to meet a burgeoning demand for its luxury goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen recovery in the United States since April, 1993, in Japan from 
September and in Europe from October to November," Carcelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the future, he sees expansion of its own stores into new countries at 
a rate of 10 to 12 stores a year, new leather products and a gradual upturn in 
consumer spending fueling further expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, founded in Asnieres in northwest Paris by a luggage-maker who 
gave the company its name, invented the modern trunk for travelers with a sense 
of luxury in the last century and went on to produce its first famed 
monogrammed bag in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 The line was expanded in 1986 with the Epi line of luxury leather goods, and 
the Taiga line was added in 1993 to appeal to male buyers. Today, around 2 
million pieces are sold each year.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: B&BS CAN JUMP-START A WEARY RELATIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone in a long-term relationship knows that love's rocky road sometimes 
feels like a transcontinental highway to hell. You and the beloved are speeding 
along on cruise control when the going gets a bit rough. First you lurch and 
sputter, then overheat, and finally come to a shuddering halt. 
</P>
<P>
 What now? Well, you can turn to those popular love mechanics of talk radio, 
afternoon television or the best-seller lists. Or if things break down 
completely, you can head to a therapist for a major tuneup. But if what your 
relationship really needs is a romantic jump-start, you might consider heading 
to a bed and breakfast inn. 
</P>
<P>
 With at least seven of them right here in the county, a couple in need of 
togetherness can find it in less time than it takes to get the oil changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People often go to these places because they are peaceful and there are no 
distractions," said Jane Hulse, who wrote today's Centerpiece story on local 
B&Bs. "There are no children and usually no TVs. And they are definitely 
romantic." 
</P>
<P>
 And though plenty of newlyweds go on their honeymoon, Hulse said bed and 
breakfast inns attract many people who have been together for a long time and 
need to get reacquainted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found that a lot of people go to B&Bs to celebrate their anniversaries," 
said Hulse. "It is a good time to rekindle a tired relationship, as well as 
assess where the relationship is going. And they can talk about the things that 
need to change." 
</P>
<P>
 But be forewarned: If either the talk or the passion gets too overheated, 
couples may find themselves wishing they had chosen a somewhat different 
setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Though most B&Bs are lovely and romantic, they are not necessarily private," 
Hulse said. "Most are old houses converted to inns, so the walls can be rather 
thin." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither nocturnal sounds nor thin walls will be deterrents for movie buffs 
attending a 1926 classic on Sunday. "The Night Cry," a Rin Tin Tin silent film, 
will be shown as part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area's 
"Silents Under the Stars" series. For more on the screening, check out the Reel 
Life column (Pancho Doll writes about the film) and the Jaunts column (Hulse 
writes about the musical accompaniment). And remember to take a blanket.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: ACOUSTICATS' BLUEGRASS SOUND BECOMING PROGRESSIVELY UNIQUE; 
QUINTET IS KNOWN AS A BLUEGRASS GROUP, BUT REALLY PLAYS MUSIC FROM THE 
MOUNTAINS OF CALIFORNIA, OR 'BROWN-GRASS MUSIC.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you haven't yet had the pleasure of hearing the Acousticats, their new CD, 
"The Cat's Meow" lives up to its name. And it's a great introduction to the 
California-based quintet's unique sound. The group will unveil its second album 
Sunday evening at Nicholby's during a concert and release party. 
</P>
<P>
 The Acousticats' first record, "Down at Evangelina's," made it to the 
bluegrass charts. And they headlined last month's annual Live Oak Folk Music 
Festival near Santa Barbara. Which might lead readers and listeners alike to 
conclude that this is a bluegrass group. Cy Clarke, lead vocalist, guitarist 
and composer of most of the Acousticats' material defined their musical style. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're known as a progressive acoustic band but also at times as bluegrass," 
Clarke said. "But we don't play music from the hills of Tennessee. We play 
music from the mountains of California. We don't play bluegrass -- we play 
brown-grass music." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said the group avoids political themes in favor of evoking the diverse 
culture of California. For instance, Clarke's new song, "Kern County Fandango," 
is about the dance parties held on the early California ranches. And they've 
included an old Allman Brothers rock 'n' roll song, "In Memory of Elizabeth 
Reed." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our influences are steeped in the past. But the Acousticats are part of a new 
and emerging tradition in music," Clarke said. And in keeping with the latest 
trend in music of artist-owned labels, the Acousticats have debuted the album 
on their own label, Ranch Records California. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever you call the music -- it's great listening. Joining Clarke are Phil 
Salazar (fiddle), Charl Ann Gastineau (violin), Tom Corbett (mandolin, guitar) 
and Rick Borella (bass). 
</P>
<P>
 "Phil and I have worked to create the hallmark of our sound -- the interplay 
of the twin fiddles. The original compositions provide the catalyst for 
innovative arrangements, finely tuned vocal harmonies and hot solos," Clarke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To get that hot fiddle sound, Salazar said he first improvises the fiddle 
solos, transcribes them from a recording and later writes the twin fiddle 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phil plays fiddle and Charl Ann plays violin. But there really is no 
difference except stylistically. Charl Ann's is more of a persuasive violin 
style. Phil just flat out shreds. And he probably does it better than anyone," 
Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to joke," said Salazar, "Charl Ann teaches the violin Suzuki method 
and I teach the Harley-Davidson method." 
</P>

 Save the Dates: The following country stars will perform at the Ventura County 
Fair, which runs Aug. 17-28: Hal Ketchum and Carlene Carter, Aug. 17; the 
Marshall Tucker Band, Aug. 19, and Tanya Tucker, Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Darlene O'Connell & the Dixie Flyers will play for a Ventura Concert Theatre 
Country Dance Night, July 23. And the group will open the Jerry Jeff Walker 
concert at the same venue on Aug. 26. Platte River Crossing is slated to play 
for the theatre's Country Dance Night on Aug. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular local band Shiloh will open for Restless Heart on Oct. 15 at the 
fourth annual Gold Dust Gala fund-raiser sponsored by Community Memorial 
Healthcare Foundation in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're looking for places with no cover charge, Logsdon's in Santa Paula, 
has free line-dance lessons Wednesdays from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. The bonus is 
Steve Hill performing for your listening and dancing pleasure. And the Starting 
Gate in Ventura has free line dance lessons on Wednesdays from 6 to 8 p.m. and 
live country bands on the weekend. The Galleon Room in Goleta offers couples 
dance lessons Thursdays from 7 to 8:30 p.m. and some of the area's best country 
bands play there Thursday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that clubs don't clear enough profit 
to pay a dance instructor, a live band or deejay and the rent. These venues 
can't run on goodwill alone. Yet many dance fans arrive early to avoid a cover 
charge where it applies. And some folks even visit their cars where they keep a 
cooler with water or soda. This sort of stuff has caused some club owners to 
consider switching to a non-country format in hopes of attracting a more 
profitable clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 Cousins has changed its format to live music Thursdays through Saturdays. Miss 
Ila offers 7 p.m. lessons on Two-Step Tuesdays and Kathy Bailey teaches on West 
Coast Swing Wednesdays, beginning level at 7 p.m. and intermediate at 7:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Susette Warynick, owner of the Orchid Bowl and Galleon Room, gets a gold star 
for submitting band and dance info regularly and on time, no less! If you want 
your listing to reach the readers, please follow her example at least two weeks 
before the event. Details

 The Simi Valley Poetry Series, organized and nourished since 1980 by Marilyn 
Hochheiser, will end its long run in a Grand Finale. The event will be held at 
the Simi Valley Library, 2969 Tapo Canyon Road, on Saturday from 7 to 10 p.m. 
Sherman Pearl and Michael Stephans are the featured poets. Joining them will be 
poets who can sign up for open readings 10 minutes before the event begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "We began the series at a time when there was nowhere for poets to share their 
work and now there are many places that welcome poetry readings," said 
Hochheiser, who is a published poet, writing teacher and an editor at Verve 
Magazine.

THEATER REVIEW; LAUGHING ALONG WITH 'THE TEMPEST'; A SPIRIT OF FUN EMERGES IN 
THE CLASSICS IN THE PARK PRODUCTION OF SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Although it can be viewed as one of Shakespeare's deepest, most thoughtful 
works, there's plenty of fun to be had from "The Tempest." And that's the 
approach taken in the production by Classics in the Park, touring various 
Ventura and Los Angeles facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Michael Jordan has chosen to present the entire play for laughs, even 
the character of deposed nobleman and bitter magician Prospero. Another 
unconventional decision by Jordan is the casting of Aaron Craig in that role: A 
star of last year's Ojai Shakespeare Festival, he's surely one of very few 
actors to have played young Romeo and old Prospero within a year's time. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewed last week at Borchard Park, the play moved somewhat erratically, actors 
standing around waiting for their cues or dropping their lines entirely too 
often. Still, there was much to enjoy about the show, most of it occurring when 
Richard Winterstein was on stage as the monster Caliban. 
</P>
<P>
 Made up to resemble the Incredible Hulk, Winterstein interprets the half 
man-half fish as more petulant than enraged, to strong comic effect. As the 
friendly spirit Ariel, Pamila Canton changes costumes as frequently as Diana 
Ross, and in fact often resembles a lounge singer as she flits about the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The young lovers -- Prospero's daughter Miranda and the prince Ferdinand, who 
gets washed up on Prospero's island after a shipwreck -- are portrayed most 
convincingly by Pepita Merayo and Keith Cable as a couple of pre-Elizabethan 
airheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Diderrich and Kathryn Baron have some good scenes together as drunken 
Stephano and jester Trinculo; even funnier are the scenes in which they expose 
Caliban to his first taste of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 James Catlett, Rebecca Hanes, Rochelle Robinson, Mark M. Gales and director 
Jordan mainly stand and (it seems) stare at one another as Ferdinand's fellow 
castaways, Neapolitan nobles. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "The Tempest." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Conejo Park, Dover and Hendrix avenues, Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: Free.

CENTERPIECE: INN FOR A REAL TREAT; COUNTY B&BS LET YOU ESCAPE WITHOUT VENTURING 
FAR FROM HOME. THE SETTINGS ARE PASTORAL, ACCOMMODATIONS ELEGANT TO COZY. AND 
ALL OFFER A BIG DOSE OF CHARM. 
</P>

<P>
 So you want to get away from it all. Just for a night or two. No cooking, no 
cleaning, no kids, no chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 No time. 
</P>
<P>
 No time to drive to that little getaway four hours up the coast. No time to 
fight the Los Angeles traffic and fly to that little getaway. What to do? 
</P>
<P>
 Stay right here in Ventura County. Book yourself a room at a bed and breakfast 
inn. There are at least seven operating in the county, including the two newest 
ones in Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeling romantic? How about the Madame Pompadour room at La Mer in Ventura. 
Along with the elegant French decor, you get an ocean view, wood-burning stove, 
balcony and private entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeling sultry? Check out the Casablanca room at the Fern Oaks Inn in Santa 
Paula, where the canopied wicker bed lends a tropical feel, and you can watch 
the moon rise over the mountains from a private veranda. 
</P>
<P>
 Bed and breakfast retreats are on the rise in California. But they're not the 
casual European-style bargain spots they were once patterned after. Now they 
are somewhere between cute and elegant, and the prices are up there with the 
nicer hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 In California alone there are 760 B&B's (more than 500 north of Monterey), 
with a burst of new ones in the last five years, according to the California 
Assn. of Bed and Breakfast Inns. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the popularity? People can no longer afford to take the traditional 
two-week vacation, so they scout out spots they can get away to for two days, 
according to Cheryl Eigenhuis, owner of the Fern Oaks Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want to spend all their time on the road," said Eigenhuis, whose 
clientele is mostly from the Los Angeles area, but with a surprising number 
from Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 One local was Mary Doll of Santa Paula, who splurged on her 40th birthday and 
spent the night there with her husband, Dan. That would have been special 
enough, but the couple also invited friends to stay overnight and enjoy a 
catered dinner Eigenhuis prepared for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all had breakfast in the morning," Doll said. "I had all my friends around 
me. It was a great birthday." 
</P>
<P>
 If you decide to try out a B&B, here's what you'll need to know: 
</P>
<P>
 * Expect to pay an average of $120 a night, according to the association's 
state-wide estimate. In Ventura County, the cost ranges from a low of $50 for a 
room with a shared bathroom, up to $155. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most inns now provide rooms with private bathrooms. The owners agree that 
people are more hesitant these days to share a bathroom with strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although some places will serve you breakfast in bed, be prepared for the 
communal breakfast, which brings you face to face with strangers over coffee 
cake and Belgian waffles. "People make friends -- they exchange addresses," 
said Gisela Baida, who owns La Mer with her husband, Mike. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expect a cozier ambience than a hotel, a historical flavor, antiques and 
collectibles, complimentary wine or tea in the afternoon, distinctive rooms, 
better quality linens, libraries and usually a congenial owner on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't expect a television or telephone in the room, swimming pool, fax 
machine, gift shop or someone to carry your luggage to your room, which often 
is up a flight of stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * In older inns (and most of them are) be prepared for thin walls. This was a 
drawback for a Ventura couple whose stay at a local B&B was crimped by the 
chatty couple in the next room. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be other pitfalls. Dave and Terri Slone, who celebrated their 15th 
anniversary recently at La Mer, will tell you about the B&B they once stayed in 
along the central coast. "It was at the on-ramp to the 101," Terri Slone said, 
"and the 18-wheelers. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Bed and breakfast inns have transformed over the last 10 or 20 years, 
according to Sandy LaRuffa, director of the state association, based near Santa 
Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 What was then a sideline for someone with a big house and a spare bedroom or 
two is now a full-blown business. "It's moved from being a hobby to the 
professional arena. They've upgraded tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is what you can find in Ventura County: SANTA PAULA 
</P>
<P>
 Fern Oaks Inn: Owner Cheryl Eigenhuis bought this rambling 1929 Spanish-style 
home and turned it into an elegant four-bedroom B&B three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Located at the edge of Santa Paula on the road to Ojai, it's impossible to 
miss. It's a peach-colored stately two-story house, canopied by giant oak trees 
and surrounded by rose gardens and fruit trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, which was for years the residence of a doctor, has a large living 
room and the formal dining room is fitted with an eight-place table where 
guests eat together. Or they can eat in the cozier kitchen nook. 
</P>
<P>
 Eigenhuis prepares a full gourmet breakfast. Here's a sampling: New 
Orleans-style French toast baked in carmel with strawberries and whipped cream, 
or maybe eggs Oscar. She bakes her own buttermilk biscuits and cinnamon rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, guests can help themselves to hot apple cider, homemade 
cookies and fruit. In the afternoon she offers sherry, and each room has 
chocolates and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eigenhuis, an interior designer, has given each of the upstairs bedrooms a 
theme, such as the "Williamsburg Room," with its four-poster bed. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Oriental rugs and decorator touches, the elegant feel is pleasantly 
offset by Eigenhuis' dog, Sam, a Pomeranian who charms guests with his snoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Details: Rooms, all with private baths, range from $95 to $110. The only 
television is in the living room. Grounds include pool-patio area. For 
information, call 525-7747. 
</P>
<P>
 White Gables Inn: If you want a homier feel, try the 100-year-old home of Bob 
and Ellen Smith. It's a three-story Victorian house on a historic residential 
block. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smiths remodeled it into a B&B three years ago, after they retired from 
jobs with Southern California Edison. Avid antique lovers, they have crammed 
the house with their finds -- furniture, dolls, lamps, claw-foot bathtubs. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the three bedrooms has an elegant antique wood bed with a massive 
intricately carved headboard. Another, called the "Bear Room," is furnished 
with antiques and the couple's teddy bear collection. A third room takes up the 
entire third floor and is a favorite with honeymooners. 
</P>
<P>
 The house is certified as a historic landmark and was used as a rest home and 
boarding house. It has a front porch where guests can sit to enjoy the feeling 
of the old residential neighborhood with its tall trees. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dining room, guests sit together at a big table for a formal breakfast. 
Waffles -- Belgian or maybe macadamia nut -- are frequent entrees, with Bob 
Smith, chairman of Santa Paula's planning commission, at the waffle iron. 
Coffee cake, made from Ellen Smith's mother's recipe, is another staple. They 
also offer sherry to guests. 
</P>
<P>
 The comfortable inn feels like someone's home, especially with the piano in 
the living room, books, personal knickknacks and family pictures throughout. 
The Smiths acknowledge it is their home first, which makes the place all the 
more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Details: The rooms, all with private baths, range from $85 to $115. Television 
in the living room. For information, call 933-3041. OJAI 
</P>
<P>
 Theodore Woolsey House: Who is Theodore Woolsey? He was the dean of 
international law at Yale University in Connecticut before he built this 
5,000-square-foot New England-style home off Ojai Avenue in 1887. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife was ailing with tuberculosis, according to local history, and Woolsey 
thought the hot spring spa, then located across the road, would be helpful. The 
couple lived in the two-story stone and clapboard house with their two sons, 
Heathcut and Salisbury. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the rambling house is owned by Ana and Phil Cross, who bought it in 1983 
and, after extensive remodeling, opened it as a B&B in 1987. It's set on seven 
acres with a big lawn, pool, towering trees, a rose trellis at the entrance and 
a long shaded veranda. 
</P>
<P>
 The large living room has a comfortable rustic feel -- hardwood floors, a 
stone fireplace, loaded bookcases and an ivy plant with vines that run the 
length of the room. Besides a piano, there is a 1950s Wurlitzer jukebox full of 
oldies. 
</P>
<P>
 The six rooms are furnished with antiques in keeping with the period of the 
home. (One is done in a French decor.) Some have fireplaces and televisions. 
Most have full bathrooms but for one, it's a short trek down the hall to a 
shared bathroom with a brick chimney in the middle and an old-fashioned 
pull-chain toilet. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dining room, there are four tables where guests can eat alone or with 
others. The Crosses serve a buffet-style breakfast they call expanded 
continental. They set out coffee cakes, breads, croissants, bagels, cereal, 
yogurt and fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Be sure to take a look at the oak tea cart that holds the breakfast goodies. 
It's an old gynecologist table -- complete with stirrups -- that the couple 
picked up at a flea market. 
</P>
<P>
 Details: The rooms, most with private baths, range from $50 to $110. On the 
weekend there is a two-night minimum. For information, call 646-9779. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai Manor Hotel: This venerable two-story building, with its big front porch, 
is Ojai's oldest structure. Built as a schoolhouse in 1874, it later served as 
a hotel and rooming house until Mary Nelson opened it as a B&B 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It's downtown, one block off Ojai Avenue, making it easy to traverse the town 
on foot. With its clean, simple lines and hardwood floors, the hotel reflects 
its schoolhouse period. You won't find flowery wallpaper and decorator glitz. 
Instead the feel is tasteful simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 All six rooms are along an upstairs hallway and there are three bathrooms at 
the end of the hall. Two of the rooms have balconies, and one, called the 
treehouse room, overlooks a sprawling oak. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson is always on the lookout for unique finds at flea markets, swap meets 
and antique stores. In one of the rooms, the large headboard for the queen-size 
bed is made of decorated tin. In another, the quilt is a rare design. And in 
the living room, she displays her collection of sculpted hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson serves a buffet-style continental breakfast in the dining room where 
the table seats eight. Guests can pick from apple cake, breads, cheeses, cereal 
and fruit. Nearby is a wood-burning stove that provides heat during chilly 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 She keeps sherry and other beverages on hand for guests who can relax in the 
garden or in big chairs on the front porch. There is no television. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson grew up in Ojai and her family bought the hotel in 1955. In the 10 
years she has run the place, she has seen people spend their honeymoons there 
and then return for their anniversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Details: Rooms, with shared bathrooms, range from $90 to $100. For 
information, call 646-0961. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa de La Luna: This is the house the Scott family built. Doris Scott and her 
late husband Bud built the 5,000-square-foot Spanish-style home themselves in 
1968, modeling it after a Colonial hacienda they had seen in a village in 
northern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 1984 Summer Olympics that drew them into the bed and breakfast 
business. When the call went out for Ojai Valley residents to open their homes 
to athletes, the Scotts did exactly that. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, they expanded the guest quarters. Now there are seven rooms -- 
three in the main house, two in a converted caretaker's home, and two others on 
the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings are part of a seven-acre estate they call the Gardens of 
Perpetual Spring, so named for the 2,000 flowers, shrubs and trees the family 
has planted. Ancient oak trees envelop the long driveway leading to the main 
house, lending to the secluded feel of the place. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge wooden front doors open to a spacious entryway with a high, beamed 
ceiling. Doris Scott and her daughter, Carol Barr, are artists and the house is 
filled with their work. Together they painted an exquisitely rendered rose on 
the dining room ceiling. Bud Scott, who was a retired dentist, carved the long 
dining room table. 
</P>
<P>
 A different entree is served for breakfast each day. It might be Belgian 
waffles and scrambled eggs one day, or eggs and hash brown potatoes topped off 
with an English muffin on another. The orange juice is squeezed from oranges 
grown on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 When you take a seat at the breakfast table, be sure to face the window. 
You'll look out on an aviary where two dozen or so canaries and other birds 
flutter about. 
</P>
<P>
 Details: Rooms, all with private baths, range from $80 to $95. On weekends 
there is a two-night minimum. For information, call 646-4528. VENTURA 
</P>
<P>
 La Mer: If you want a taste of Europe, come to La Mer. The place has many 
continental touches, from the flags flying out front to the German heritage of 
owner Gisela Baida. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the five rooms is decorated with a different country in mind -- 
France, Germany, Austria, Norway and England. The "Peter Paul Rubens" room has 
a European bed more than 200 years old. The "Captain's Coje" has a Norwegian 
nautical theme with a custom-designed ship's bed and maps. All but one of the 
rooms has a private entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Gisela Baida and her husband, Mike Baida, bought the 1890 Cape Cod-style 
Victorian house and converted it into a B&B nine years ago. The house, which 
sits on a hillside overlooking downtown Ventura and the ocean, was originally 
owned by Robert Brakey who, in the city's early days, operated a house moving 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests enjoy breakfast with an ocean view at two tables in a rustic nook off 
the small parlor. There they can dig into Bavarian fare that includes cakes, 
breads, cheeses, fruit, croissants, muesli (made by Gisela Baida) and black 
forest ham. She collects fresh eggs from the tidy little chicken coop adjacent 
to the house. Guests may request a soft-boiled egg, which arrives topped with a 
crocheted covering in the shape of a hen. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple provide some other nice touches: a complimentary bottle of wine, 
champagne or sparkling cider, European chocolate bars and bed sheets that are 
hand-pressed. The rooms have old-fashion radios that play tapes of vintage 
radio mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Details: Rooms, all with private baths, range from $105 to $155. Two-night 
minimum on the weekends. The only television is in the parlor. For information, 
call 643-3600. 
</P>
<P>
 Bella Maggiore Inn: This bed and breakfast inn has more of a hotel feel to it 
than the others, perhaps because it has 24 rooms and it's wedged into a 
downtown business block. 
</P>
<P>
 Named for Lake Maggiore in northern Italy, the inn has a European ambience 
that visitors experience as soon as they see the carved stone on the front of 
the building and the window awnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the lobby has an impressive Italian chandelier, grand piano, artwork 
and a fireplace. But the inn's most stunning feature is the large ivy-covered 
courtyard where guests eat breakfast at private tables. Nearby a fountain spews 
water, and the trees overhead filter the sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Here guests get a full breakfast -- omelets, French toast or maybe Greek-style 
eggs -- along with a cold buffet of fruit, bagels and muffins, cereal and 
yogurt. Recently the inn opened its courtyard dining to the public too. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs, the rooms all have telephones and televisions. They are not 
decorated with antiques and collectibles but they do have some charming 
touches, such as the hand-painted scrollwork on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Another charming, not to mention historical, touch is a ghost named Sylvia, 
who, as legend has it, was a prostitute during the 1940s. She fell on hard 
times and hanged herself, the story goes. Now believers say her presence is 
felt in the aroma of cheap rose perfume. 
</P>
<P>
 The building was renovated in 1984, and has been managed by owners Tom and 
Cyndi Wood since then. In the 1920s and 1930s, it was "El Nido Hotel." The 
building was designed by Albert C. Martin, who also designed Ventura's City 
Hall and Grauman's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Details: Rooms range from $75 to $150 on the weekend. For information, call 
652-0277. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: For information on bed and breakfast spots in the state, you can call 
the California Assn. of Bed & Breakfast Inns, located near Santa Cruz, (408) 
464-8159. They make referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 * GUIDEBOOK: The association put out a guidebook this year that includes more 
than 200 listings with descriptions, prices and phone numbers. The guidebook is 
available free from the state. To request one, call 800-862-2543, but it may 
take a couple of weeks to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 * UP THE COAST: There are also 16 bed and breakfast inns in the Santa Barbara 
area, including two in Summerland. One, the Simpson House, located in downtown 
Santa Barbara, was recently awarded the American Automobile Assn.'s highest 
rating. Many of these places have a two-night minimum requirement on the 
weekends. For information, call 800-676-1266. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUT TO SEA: Smuggler's Ranch is your kind of B&B if you really like to get 
away. A 105-year-old, two-story adobe building with two-foot-thick walls, the 
ranch is on Santa Cruz Island, 25 miles across the Santa Barbara Channel. It 
has been open for business for several years, but accommodations were 
primitive. Recent renovations, however, restored the building and added hot 
showers and flush toilets. Meals include native Santa Cruz Island leg of lamb. 
Fly in to a private airstrip. Friday and Saturday night, with flight and meals 
included: $315 per person; Saturday night: $235 per person. Reservations: 
310-430-2544.

NIGHT LIFE: BRANCHING OUT; SIMI VALLEY'S TREE OF LOVE PLAYS BASIC ALTERNATIVE 
ROCK FEATURING STRONG VOCALS.

<P>
 Imagine a night on the town that is like this: Good music, no booze, no long 
lines to the restroom, no trouble, no hangovers, no DUIs and no cops. Is it a 
church social in Mayberry? 
</P>
<P>
 No, it must be the Vampyre Lounge in Simi Valley, home to industrial strength 
coffee. Wednesday night, the all-ages venue will host Tree of Love, one of Simi 
Valley's favorite bands. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, the land of many malls, many bands and few venues, the Tree 
band shares popularity with a couple of other local groups, April's Motel Room 
-- which just released an album on Epic -- and Contradiction. In fact, Tree of 
Love bandleader/singer/bassist Geoff Ruble was once in bands with Scott Semple 
of Contradiction and Tom Kelly and John Baffa of April's Motel Room. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tree band plays basic alternative rock featuring strong vocals by Ruble 
and Kelly Vold. Matt Blunt, who has played with Ruble since they were kids, is 
the drummer. Jason Orme has been the guitar player for the last 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 After the important work of the day was completed (surfing) Ruble talked about 
his favorite band. 
</P>
<P>
 How come there's so many bands in Simi Valley and nowhere to play? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know, but there are always parties; we've played so many parties in 
Simi Valley. Maybe it was just luck, but we'd usually get in at least a set 
before the cops came. Right now, I think the Vampyre Lounge is kinda cool. 
Since there's no age limit, it's usually packed. Last time we played there, it 
was so crowded, they quit letting people in. Besides that, there's the MVP 
Sports Bar, which is strictly a money gig. We usually only do originals and 
those people are always yelling at us to do Creedence or some Southern Rock 
song. But mostly, I'm stoked on the Vampyre Lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 What effect has the signing of April's Motel Room had on the local scene? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure yet. I guess it tells us that a career in music is attainable. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you think Tree of Love music sounds like? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a cross between Motown and punk. We can play three sets -- we have over 
30 songs. Once in a while when we feel like messing around, we will do a cover 
song. We'll ask for requests, then try to do it right there. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the songwriting process like for you? 
</P>
<P>
 I usually come up with something on my acoustic guitar, and before I know it, 
I'm thinking about a melody, then a bridge, then a chorus then some lyrics 
about whatever's on my mind at the time. The songs I write are mostly love 
songs and about growing up -- the transition from a kid to a man. I have a B.A. 
in English literature from CSUN which has helped me to write songs, if not get 
a job since I work at a mortgage company. 
</P>
<P>
 Do local bands have to play L.A. to get anywhere? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that's where all the bands go to play. We play down there at least once 
a month. I mean, it's easy to get our friends to watch us play in Simi Valley, 
but if you can go to L.A. and play for a roomful of strangers and they like it, 
then you've proved something. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the plan, man? 
</P>
<P>
 We're working on another tape, and we're really gonna push it this time. We've 
got some things happening with a publicist, and we met this manager guy who 
said he could get us on the radio. Then we hooked up with this guy named Jeff 
Eyrich who used to play bass with the Surf Punks. He's a surfer from Malibu and 
we just hit it off. He's produced a lot of stuff like "A Million Miles Away," 
that Plimsouls' song. He's got a lot of connections. We want to get this tape 
out to the A&R guys and play the killer shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Do people dance when Tree of Love plays? 
</P>
<P>
 My eyes are mostly closed when we play. I just really get into it. If people 
are just watching intently and attentively, that's cool. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you like most about being in a band? 
</P>
<P>
 It's just having an outlet for doing what I do. Music is what I do and I know 
that's why I was put on Earth. Playing music is the most incredible feeling 
there is, except surfing. The only problem is, music is a job you don't get 
paid for, at least with money. But once you finally get paid, it's a big 
paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of music did you like growing up? 
</P>
<P>
 The Beatles. I used to hear them all the time when I was a little kid. I 
remember I listened to "Hard Day's Night" over and over. Then, I really got 
into that Knack record, "My Sharona," and then I started listening to all the 
new wave stuff like Oingo Boingo, but mostly for me, it was Beatles because 
they always seemed to be having so much fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Your wife sang on the last tape, but Kelly Vold is in the band now -- what's 
up? 
</P>
<P>
 My wife is pregnant and is expecting Oct. 8. It was cool when she was in the 
band because we could spend time together. After the kid is born, I've thought 
about having two female singers in the band, but I don't know what's going to 
happen. I've known Kelly since junior high school. She used to sing in the 
chorus and stuff and I remember one time, she sang a Billy Joel song at an 
assembly. But right now, we just want to get better as a band, write better 
songs, and just keep improving. Details

PIERCE GETS CHANCE TO SHOW HIS STUFF AT SLAM-N-JAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Pierce returned from an all-star basketball camp in New Jersey last 
weekend with some flattering press clippings and a trail of college coaches 
following his every move. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, not much has changed for the Inglewood High senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce said he has received an average of seven to eight recruiting letters a 
day since January. If anything, the volume of mail figures to increase after 
his strong showing last week at the Academic Betterment and Career Development 
Camp at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, a 6-foot-6 forward who led Inglewood to the Southern Section Division 
II-A title last season, was named to the 12-player all-star team at the camp, 
which attracted 157 blue-chip players from the United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, he resumes his act locally. South Bay fans will get a chance to 
watch Pierce and many other prep standouts in the 11th annual Nike Slam-N-Jam 
National Invitational Tournament, to be played Saturday through Thursday at 
West Torrance and South Torrance high schools. Sixty-five all-star teams from 
18 states are expected to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, who will play on the same team with Serra forward Leonard Butler, 
another South Bay all-star, has been doing a good job this summer of balancing 
basketball, academics and recruiting, Inglewood Coach Pat Roy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how a kid can do it, but he's definitely doing it," Roy said. 
"Most players by now would be bigheaded, but he's still the same person." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy said college interest in Pierce has picked up since the ABCD camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last week, I've received at least 20 calls from the top schools in the 
nation," Roy said. "One of the New Jersey papers wrote that (Pierce) is 
arguably the best player in the country and definitely one of the top five in 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Such praise could make a player's head spin, but Pierce seems to take it in 
stride. He knows his basketball prowess won't mean a thing if he fails to meet 
NCAA academic requirements. He is awaiting the results of his first try at the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test, taken last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just try to stay focused on the harder things that are going to help me," 
Pierce said. "I try not to let basketball take me away from school work, 
because I know what needs to be done first." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce said his grades at Inglewood are in order. When it comes to picking a 
college, however, there is no order of preference. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed to list his top schools, Pierce mentioned Arizona, Kansas, UCLA, 
California, Kentucky and Georgia Tech. But, he emphasized, that doesn't rule 
out others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty wide open," he said. "I haven't really told anybody no yet. I 
feel like I'm strong enough to deal with it when it happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy, likewise, is confident Pierce can handle matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very mature," the coach said. "He has everything under control." 
</P>
<P>
 As Inglewood's only returning starter, Pierce will be at the controls of the 
Sentinel basketball team next season. He averaged 23.2 points and 11 rebounds a 
game last season, leading Inglewood to a 30-4 record with his rare combination 
of inside strength and outside shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Pierce, with less support, be asked to do more in 1994-95? 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of looks that way," Roy said. "We lost nine players. We have a lot of 
new guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Pierce has already demonstrated he is capable of carrying the load. 
He held his own against many of the nation's top players at the ABCD camp. 
Stephon Marbury of Lincoln High in Brooklyn, N.Y., regarded by many as the best 
guard in the country, was named the top senior at the camp. Timmy Thomas, a 
6-11 forward from Patterson Catholic in Patterson, N.J., was named the top 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fun going against people who are all-stars," Pierce said. "You get to 
show them what you can do. You step up your game a little more because it's 
better competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce will play for Team Nike in the Las Vegas Grand Finale on July 25-30, 
and he will return to the East Coast in August for a tournament in New York. In 
between the all-star competitions, he plays for Inglewood in summer league 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's still getting better as a player," Roy said. "It seems like he can do a 
little more each day. When people come to see (Inglewood) play next season, 
they're going to see an even better Paul Pierce." 
</P>
<P>
 Just what every coach in the area didn't want to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes well, Torrance may become the permanent home of the Slam-N-Jam 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Tournament director Issy Washington said financial considerations prompted him 
to move the event from Long Beach State, where it had been staged the past 
several years. He said West and South high schools will each receive a $2,000 
donation to their athletic programs, plus a percentage of the gate if 
attendance is good. He said the rental of Long Beach State's gym cost about 
$10,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in it to make a bundle, but I want to keep expenses under control," 
Washington said. "Torrance has treated us like kings, so we may stay." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's tournament features many of the nation's best players. Values for 
Better America, the top-seeded team, includes sophomore sensation Schea Cotton 
of Mater Dei, Westchester guards Ben Sanders and Danny Walker, and 6-9 Jelani 
McCoy of St. Augustine in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 After VBA, the top teams are Boston Athletic Basketball, All Ohio Red, New 
York Riverside Church and American Roundball, a Southern California squad. New 
York Riverside Church, led by 6-4 swingman Richie Parker, won a prestigious 
tournament in Washington, D.C., last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Team Nike, coached by Washington, is seeded seventh and includes Peninsula 
juniors Phil Belin and Andrew Klein. Other area players participating include 
Anthony McNair of Morningside (Team L.A.), and Jamal Reed and Bobby Terrell of 
Carson (South Bay). 
</P>
<P>
 Games will be played all day at both sites from Saturday to Thursday, with the 
championship game scheduled for 8:30 p.m. Thursday at South. Tickets will be 
available at the door. Information: (310) 532-0622 or (310) 675-5146.

THEATER SCENE; THE MAN BEHIND 'MAN OF LA MANCHA' TELLS HOW IT STARTED; AUTHOR 
TELLS QUIXOTIC TALE OF HOW HE CAME TO WRITE A PLAY THAT BECAME A HIT MUSICAL. 
IT'S BEING STAGED AT TWO LOCAL THEATERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two local companies are producing versions this year of the venerable musical 
"Man of La Mancha" -- one ends July 23 in Camarillo; the other begins Sept. 16 
in Thousand Oaks. Local actors might be distressed (which to audition for?) and 
local audiences might be confused (which to attend?). 
</P>
<P>
 But one man who should be pleased at the news of every new production is Dale 
Wasserman. The former Moorpark and Westlake Village resident wrote the show, 
and accrues royalties every time it is performed. "I rarely know where it's 
going to play," said Wasserman, who now lives in Arizona. "But to my knowledge, 
there must be between 80 to 100 productions a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the life of Spanish novelist and playwright Miguel de Cervantes and 
his best-known literary creation, Don Quixote, the story, said Wasserman, 
"speaks across borders well, without any references to political situations -- 
it's about as close to universal as one can get. I didn't know when I was 
writing it, of course; in fact, I never understood why it was so successful." 
</P>
<P>
 "Man of La Mancha" appeared in its original form, without songs, as a 1960 
television drama, "I, Don Quixote." Lee J. Cobb starred as Don Quixote; Eli 
Wallach as Sancho Panza, and Colleen Dewhurst as Quixote's inspiration, the 
barmaid he calls Aldonza. Wasserman, who has authored a number of screenplays 
including "The Vikings," "Mr. Buddwing" and the unproduced first draft of the 
Elizabeth Taylor-Richard Burton "Cleopatra," wrote "I, Don Quixote" while 
living in Spain, working on a film script. 
</P>
<P>
 "An article in the International Herald-Tribune said, erroneously, that I was 
in the country writing a new adaptation of 'Don Quixote.' As it happened, I'd 
never read the novel. I still haven't, all the way through. As a matter of 
fact, I don't really like the novel." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he noticed that "there have been over 400 adaptations of 'Don Quixote,' 
and they've all failed. I began researching it, and the one thing that 
interested me was the character of Cervantes, not Don Quixote. He was a failed 
playwright and wandering actor who loved the theater, but the theater never 
loved him back. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Man of La Mancha' is not a play about Don Quixote at all, but a play about 
Miguel de Cervantes, fusing him and his character. Then I went to Switzerland 
and spent three months writing the play as a television special." 
</P>
<P>
 There were pressures from producers wanting him to adapt his play for 
Broadway, Wasserman said. "When I had a little breathing room, I said 'Oh, 
let's do it.' It was very easy for me, because in play form it was already 
almost a musical." 
</P>
<P>
 The songs, written by Joe Darion and Mitch Leigh, were "all taken from what I 
called my 'aria speeches,' " Wasserman said. "One of the problem with being a 
book writer on a musical is that you write your heart out writing a speech, 
which a lyricist takes and you lose it as your own. I am a playwright; for me, 
music is a way of heightening emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 The show opened in Broadway in late 1965, becoming a major hit (over 2,300 
performances) before playing to international acclaim. Wasserman expects to be 
in Thousand Oaks for the Santa Susana Repertory Company's September production, 
though he'll miss the current Camarillo Community Theater edition at the 
Camarillo Airport Theater (see calendar listings for further information). 
</P>
<P>
 But he'll be back: early next year, one of two new Wasserman theatrical 
projects, a musical called "Western Star," will have its premiere at the Santa 
Barbara Civic Light Opera. (The second, a new adaptation of the 1947 John 
Latouche-Duke Ellington musical "Beggar's Holiday," is scheduled to open in 
Chicago later this year. A film script based on the life of Carthaginian 
general Hannibal and planned to star Denzel Washington, has been optioned by 
Zev Braun productions.) 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserman, whose other best-known play is his adaptation of Ken Kesey's "One 
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," said he wrote "Western Star" not for Broadway but 
directly for community and regional theater companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theaters across the country are no longer getting material from Broadway 
because there is no material on Broadway," he said. "And the property that 
plays the mortgage (for community groups) is the musical. I thought I'd try 
something unconventional and write a musical for stock and amateur companies, 
and not give a damn whether it plays Broadway or not." 
</P>
<P>
 The inspiration for "Western Star" came, Wasserman explained, "from one of the 
books of the Bible; I'd hate to tell you which one, I rather the audience 
figured that out for themselves. I've written much about the American West -- 
books, movies and things. The very American notion that there are always 
solutions lurking over the next horizon has always interested be because it's 
so delusional. If 'Oklahoma!' is authentic American folklore, than I'm a pixie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had in mind a musical that would have the real pain and pleasure, the 
uniquely American mixture of tenderness and violence, of myth and harsh 
reality."

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; SILENT MOVIE PUTS THE CONDOR IN A BAD LIGHT; 
'THE NIGHT CRY,' MADE IN 1926, PITS THE LARGE VULTURE AGAINST THE HEROIC RIN 
TIN TIN. THE ACTION-PACKED DRAMA WILL BE SHOWN AT PARAMOUNT RANCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Carrion eaters have a tough time maintaining a good public image. Consider a 
1926 film to be shown Sunday at the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation 
Area that vilifies the California condor. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a Rin Tin Tin film that pits Warner Bros. best known bowser against a 
sheep killing, baby snatching, villainous member of the vulture family. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Haberkamp of the Silent Society of Hollywood Heritage, which is 
screening the movie as part of the recreation area's Silents Under the Stars 
series, said the plot develops after a condor destroys a herd of sheep and Rin 
Tin Tin is blamed for the deed. 
</P>
<P>
 He vindicates himself and implicates the condor, but before a posse can be 
mounted, the condor nabs a baby, setting up the showdown scene between dog and 
bird. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scenes are quite dramatic," Haberkamp said. "I don't know how they did 
it. Of course animal protection laws then weren't what they are now." 
</P>
<P>
 We might be revealing too much of the climax, but after the fight, condors 
moved one step closer to extinction, at least in a figurative sense. 
</P>
<P>
 The species is on the mend now, thanks in part to a more accurate image of the 
condor's role as an environmental garbage disposal, not a predator. Previously, 
nobody thought to explain how a 20-pound bird could dispatch a 100-pound sheep, 
but as we know, good science makes bad movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie titled "The Night Cry" starts at 8 p.m. at Paramount Ranch in the 
recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Sunday, "The 24th International Tournee of Animation," a program of 14 
short films from Europe and the United States, comes to the Lobero Theater in 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection proves that stop-motion animation is enjoying a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prehistoric Beast" by Oscar-winning special-effects artist Phil Tippett, 
which depicts two dinosaurs stalking each other in a Mesozoic forest, eclipses 
the other films. This superbly animated short was a test for "Jurassic Park," 
and it looks like a sequence from a big-budget feature. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be a tribute to Will Vinton Studios. Vinton coined the term 
claymation and his studio also created the California Raisins. Call 963-0761 
for show times. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A study commissioned by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television 
Producers sent local film people reaching for their calculators. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance said that The Business contributes $202 million to Ventura 
County's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got our attention," said John McKinnon, Fillmore's film commissioner. 
"It's tough to get a handle on the amount that goes into a community. They 
spend money in restaurants, hotels and building supply. The spillover is 
difficult to figure." 
</P>
<P>
 But $202 million? 
</P>
<P>
 Bud Phillips said that's accurate. As the head of the consulting firm that put 
the study together, Phillips said salaries account for $157 million and another 
$45 million is spent on services here. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said a handful of payroll companies accounts for the majority of 
payroll checks in the industry. His company divided the payrolls by ZIP code to 
get the $157 million figure. The vendor figure could represent anything from 
film processing to catering supplied by Ventura County businesses. The vendor 
survey wasn't restricted to filming that took place here.

ON THE ROAD: PEACE CORPS RIGORS LURE WOMAN FROM PRIVILEGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The young woman's house is a sprawling suburban place a block away from 
parkland dominated by majestic Santa Monica Mountains. Her neighborhood is a 
patchwork of such modern, airy homes and is quiet, neat, white, prosperous, 
orderly, safe, unrelentingly pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 She grew up here. Attended St. Julie Billiart Church. Went to public schools, 
was a student government big. Then left for the University of California at 
Riverside. She majored in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many who first experience life away from home, she was one of those 
students who held on to who she was while growing up. She joined the Catholic 
Newman House near campus, attended Mass on Sunday and prayer meetings during 
the week. She pulled back on the student government thing but kept some 
comforts and old habits. She had a car. She studied hard and got good grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many of her age and predilection, she spent a fair amount of energy 
each day maintaining her look: two curling irons, the right makeup, the right 
clothing. Her idea of a big night out was dinner at a hole-in-the-wall 
Riverside bistro with her boyfriend of nearly four years. They'd have a bottle 
of red, fried calamari, pasta with pesto, dessert of Ben & Jerry's peanut 
butter and chocolate, cookie dough chocolate ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 On the face of it, this was shaping up to be The Perfect Life. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Jennifer Rupp, now 22, got radical. Or sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 She leaves this month for Bamako, Mali, a small republic in French West 
Africa. She'll live there for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 No running water. No electricity. No big houses. 
</P>
<P>
 No long baths. No curling irons. No mattress and box-spring. 
</P>
<P>
 More to the point, there's plenty of malaria and Africa's wildly escalating 
HIV infection rate, estimated in some regions to involve 40 percent of the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Rupp has joined the Peace Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that? 
</P>
<P>
 The Peace Corps was, in its relevant zenith in the 1960s, the place for young 
Americans in a booming postwar America to place their booming altruism. Then 
came Vietnam, which lent the corps's recruits an alternative, somewhat tie-dyed 
look. In any of its forms, though, the corps was always the outfit in which to 
do good, make a difference, build a better world. 
</P>
<P>
 The '90s are different. Forget the world for a minute. America's got 
in-the-face problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Our cities crack under the pressure of ethnic strife. Our economies, local and 
national, heave and wheeze, searching for stasis more than wildfire growth. And 
our youngest and brightest college graduates compete for jobs in a shrunk, 
protean marketplace. Self-involvement is often the result, evolved from the 
political narcosis of college campuses in an overindulged 1980s to a worried, 
compulsive 1990s. Any way you cut it, there's been so much me, me and me. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jennifer Rupp is not particularly worried about herself. Not in the 
conventional sense, anyway, which is why her behavior can be called radical. 
</P>
<P>
 She could have run headlong into the marketplace, likely competing 
successfully for a numbers job somewhere. Instead she'll be advising Mali's 
government-subsidized "entrepreneurs" on business efficiencies, organization, 
strategies for independence. 
</P>
<P>
 She could have decided to kick around for a while before, perhaps, deciding to 
go to grad school. Instead she'll be doing 10-hour days for no pay as an alien: 
a conservative, white, middle-class American woman in a French-speaking black 
world of emerging literacy. Alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Is she wary? Yes. Is she humbled? You bet. 
</P>
<P>
 But ask her why she truly is doing this, and you won't get a Catholic answer. 
It's not just to help an emerging nation. It's to help Jennifer Rupp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I have something to prove to myself," she says. "I am what I seem. I 
am conservative. I do like comforts. And I've never been anywhere. I just want 
to be sure that that's not just who I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask her what her greatest strength is, she'll tell you, "Maybe I'll find that 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, ask her what she thinks it will look like to pull up to her parents' 
wonderful house here after two years amid impoverishment and risk, she'll look 
you in the eye and say, "I think it will look as terrific and horrifying as 
Bamako will look to me this July." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't mind Rupp's uncanny vision in these matters. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just who she is.

AT THE MARKET: NO WALLFLOWER, THAT POPULAR BOUGAINVILLEA; BEYOND ITS BEAUTY, IT 
CAN BE COUNTED ON TO BE HARDY AND RESISTANT TO BUGS AND DISEASE. AND THIS 
SEASON IS 'BOOGIE' TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Hardy. Colorful. Low-maintenance. Heat loving and water thrifty. 
</P>
<P>
 The bougainvillea. 
</P>
<P>
 This shrubby evergreen vine is currently making a big splash at a nursery near 
you. With good reason: Summertime is "boogie" time. And many garden centers 
have stocked up on these Brazilian natives, offering their supplies at sale 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a dismally bland spot in your yard in dire need of some brightening 
up? A bougainvillea might just be the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 With numerous varieties available, versatility has become a bougainvillea 
trademark. Obscure that bare spot along an unsightly fence or wall with the 
outreaching, vine type. Others are easily trained to remain contained and 
tree-like where needed. Some do just fine as ground cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we're selling a lot them," said Kyle Puerner of Green Meadow 
Nursery in Camarillo. Puerner said bougainvillea are available in one-, five- 
and 15-gallon containers. There's one to meet your specific planting 
requirements, he said, whether plans call for trellises, stakes or something 
bushy to keep in a container. 
</P>
<P>
 Given Ventura County's diverse climate zones, sometimes what you plant can 
depend on where you live. With the bougainvillea, your only concern is to make 
sure the plant has heat -- if you live inland -- or light -- if you live by the 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "They love heat. The more heat the better," said Chuck Tarpley of Enchanted 
Way Nursery in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the more inland areas you'll find they bloom more because of the heat -- 
the heat brings out the flower," said Scott Klittich, proprietor of Otto & 
Son's Wholesale Nursery in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the coast you'll definitely want to find the bougainvillea a spot where 
it will be washed with direct sunlight, Tarpley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do beautifully along the ocean," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The beautiful color these plants produce -- reds, pinks, oranges, golds, 
lavenders and others -- can be a bit confusing. Take a close look. The flower 
is actually a tiny, insignificant thing. The three papery leaves -- or bracts 
-- surrounding the diminutive flower is what makes these plants so colorful. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the plant flowers," Klittich said, "that physiologically tells the 
(bracts) to turn color." The result is a brilliant show of vibrant color 
throughout the plant, interspersed with medium to deep green leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond its beauty, a bougainvillea can be counted on -- once it is established 
-- to be hardy and resistant to bugs and disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting it established, though, will take some care. 
</P>
<P>
 "The roots can be a real problem," Puerner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because roots do not bind to soil, thus forming a root ball, the roots are 
highly sensitive to any disturbance. Therefore, you need to take extreme 
caution removing the bougainvillea from its container. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarpley suggested that you first cut the bottom off the container. Place the 
plant in the hole. Then cut the container from top to bottom. Fill the hole 
with a 60-40 ratio of soil to organic material. Next, gently lift and slide the 
container off the plant and pack the surrounding soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Watering, too, is crucial during the first couple of months. You'll need to 
water regularly to ensure that the plant takes hold. The proper amount of water 
depends on climate and soil conditions, Tarpley said. Your local nursery can 
give you the particulars. 
</P>
<P>
 An established plant can withstand long dry periods. Easing off on the water 
during the midsummer actually promotes flowering. 
</P>
<P>
 One other concern is frost, which can be problematic for this otherwise 
easy-to-care-for jewel. If frost is a concern in your area, the plants should 
be moved to a protected area if possible, or planted in the warmest spot in 
your garden. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * PRICES: Bougainvillea prices can differ depending on your choice of garden 
centers. Currently, many nurseries have the plants on sale -- a five-gallon 
container normally going for around $19 can be had for about $12. The 
gallon-sized are going for as low as $4. 
</P>
<P>
 * COLORS: Varieties are many, but you should narrow your choice down to the 
type of plant growth that best suites you. One of the most popular is the San 
Diego Red -- a vigorous, high-climbing type. The Crimson Jewel is a more 
shrubby, sprawling plant. The La Jolla, with its bright red bracts, makes for a 
great compact container plant.

FOR THE KIDS; FAMILY SAFETY CAN BE FUN AND GAMES; A FIREFIGHTER'S MUSICAL 
PRESENTATION IS A LIGHTHEARTED WAY TO PREPARE CHILDREN FOR EARTHQUAKES, FIRES 
AND OTHER EMERGENCIES.

 How do you teach kids about earthquakes without scaring them to death? 
</P>
<P>
 If you're firefighter Jim Swing, you belt out a little ditty to the tune of an 
old Bill Haley and the Comets classic. 
</P>
<P>
 It goes something like: When it shakes, rattles and rolls, You got to duck, 
cover and hold. Then he might top it off with "The Rumble Bumble Boogie Woogie 
Shakey Quakey Rhythm and Blues." 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets rid of the earthquake jitters," said Swing, who lives in Moorpark. 
"It helps kids to make light of the shaking." 
</P>
<P>
 The touch may be light, but the message is serious in the two-hour class Swing 
teaches for kids and parents through the Moorpark Community Services 
Department. The class meets Saturday, from 10 a.m. to noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Swing -- what better name for a guy who once played with country rock bands -- 
is a Torrance firefighter and paramedic. He formed the South Bay Firefighters 
Band four years ago after he was named the department's education officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-member band has been teaching fire safety through music shows to 
schoolchildren in the Los Angeles area ever since. In Moorpark this weekend, 
he'll be a solo act and his repertoire will be all-around safety -- fire, 
earthquake and first aid. 
</P>
<P>
 He starts by showing the children a 20-minute video about the firehouse, based 
on "Sesame Street" characters. Meanwhile, he talks to the parents about 
lifesaving techniques -- how to do the Heimlich maneuver on children and 
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't get into CPR, but I recommend that everyone take that," said Swing, 
45, and the father of two small children. 
</P>
<P>
 After the video, he shows the kids some of his equipment, such as his helmet 
and breathing mask. That way they'll know what a suited-up fireman looks like 
and won't be frightened in a real emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he brings out his guitar. Some of the songs are written by Swing, others 
are from different firefighting organizations. There is the song "Two Ways 
Out," about exiting during a fire; "Cool Water," about first aid for burns, and 
the rap song "Hunt for Home Hazards." 
</P>
<P>
 During the class, Swing also plays games with the kids. "We try to make it a 
little fun," he said. He gets the parents to hold a blanket about two feet off 
the floor as if it were a blanket of smoke. Then he shows the children how to 
scrunch down low and crawl under the blanket, as they should in a real fire. 
</P>
<P>
 He also preaches the stop-drop-and-roll message by sticking a piece of felt in 
the shape of a flame on them, and then having them roll on the floor to knock 
it off. Even though it's fun, the children seem to retain the safety 
information, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For many children, earthquakes are terrifyingly real. "I tell them it's 
something natural, like rain or the wind blowing," he said. "It's just the 
earth settling down. Not a lot of people are hurt by it." 
</P>
<P>
 He gives them some quake tips: Get under a table, hold on with one hand and 
cover your head with the other hand. "Move with the furniture," he tells them. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving them some practical tips helps parents and children psychologically, he 
said. "They have some control -- there is something they can do." 
</P>
<P>
 The songs and games open a dialogue between parent and child on the subject of 
safety. "Some kids are anxious about this, and a lot of them hold that stuff 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
 The class also is good for parents, he said. It gets them thinking more about 
safety. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Mommy (or Daddy) and Me and Fireman Jim," family class on safety. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday, 10 a.m. to noon. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Moorpark's new Arroyo Vista Recreation Center, at Tierra Rejada Road 
and Countrywood Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: $10 per family 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Pre-registration is required at the center or at 799 Moorpark Ave. 
Children should be 3 years and older. For more information, call 529-6864, Ext. 
231.

SHOPTALK; COMPARED TO NATURAL SOAPS, OTHER BARS ARE ALL WASHED UP; UPSCALE 
GROCERY STORES ARE THE BEST PLACES TO FIND IMPORTED AND CHEMICAL-FREE BRANDS AT 
A FAIR PRICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It all started a few years ago with an extended vacation abroad. It wasn't the 
vacation, though, it was the souvenir. Soap. Lots of little bars pilfered from 
some of Europe's finest hotels. At first, we were underwhelmed. But when we 
broke open the wrappers, we were struck by the difference between these 
precious little bars and our own big bars of soap. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bars lasted twice as long as bars three times bigger. They also felt 
better, smelled better and left our skin softer. What is the difference between 
the average bar of American-made soap and a bar of natural soap or soap 
imported from Europe? A truckload of chemicals, that's what. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical bar of soap purchased at our local supermarket has artificial 
scents, dyes, preservatives and even animal fats. A box of unscented Dove 
listed seven different "sodium" something-or-others, including sodium chloride 
(hey, isn't salt drying?) and a "Masking Fragrance" (masking what?). 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen or 17 ingredients listed on average compared to the three or four 
ingredients listed on an imported or natural bar of soap. One of our favorite 
soaps lists as its ingredients: coconut oil, 98%; lavender, 1.5%; olive oil, 
.5% That's it. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, buying good soaps can be an expensive habit. Small bars of 
glycerin soaps (3.5 ounces) were $3.10 each at a chic bath accessory store in 
The Oaks mall. Another bath emporium, in the same mall, had prices that were 
even more daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 But we have found good soaps at good prices. Upscale grocery stores are the 
place to buy wonderful natural and imported soaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Trader Joe's has soap imported from Greece called Kiss My Face. These soaps 
are $1.49 for a hefty 8-ounce bar. 
</P>
<P>
 We also loved Rovar's Oatmeal soap. This soap is a steal at $.69 for two 
3.4-ounce bars. 
</P>
<P>
 (Check out the other bath treats at Trader Joe's. The moisturizing lotion 
called A Midsummer-Night Cream is wonderful. Unscented and with aloe vera, it 
contains no chemicals, no mineral oil, no animal byproducts. An 18-ounce 
container costs only $1.99.) 
</P>
<P>
 Gelson's Market in Westlake has our favorite soap. Called Le Petit 
Marseillaiss, this soap -- which has a lighter fragrance than a bar of 
unscented Dove -- is imported from France and comes in seven varieties. At 
$3.59 for a 9-ounce bar that lasts and lasts, this soap just seems extravagant. 
</P>
<P>
 Gelson's also has a good selection of glycerin soaps by Clearly Natural. These 
bars are $.77 for 4 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Mrs. Gooch's Natural Foods Market in Thousand Oaks has the 
largest selection of natural soaps. 
</P>
<P>
 They have more soap by Kiss My Face, including a smaller-size bar. They also 
charge a bit more. The same 8-ounce bar that's $1.49 at Trader Joe's is $2.25 
here, but there is a larger variety from which to choose. 
</P>
<P>
 Other interesting soaps were the Sirena coconut-oil soap from Mexico, a 
bargain at $.89 for 4 ounces. The Reviva Lab's Seaweed Soap is made with a 
vegetable base and is $2.99 for a 4.5-ounce bar.

EARTHWATCH: DEADLINE APPROACHES FOR CLEAN-AIR DECISIONS; EPA IS UNDER ORDER TO 
ATTAIN MINIMUM HEALTH STANDARDS IN THE COUNTY. CARS FUELED BY NATURAL GAS MAY 
BE A SOLUTION.

 It's crunch time for those responsible for cleaning up local air pollution, 
and in certain respects this means you and me. Next week, at the Ventura County 
Hall of Administration, local officials, business people and members of the 
public are going to meet with folks from the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency 
</P>
<P>
 The feds are under court order to step in and make Ventura County attain 
minimum healthful air quality -- using methods determined in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Local business face possible shutdowns or expensive refitting -- which means 
potential job loss, according the EPA. Local drivers may be looking at 
"no-drive" days. 
</P>
<P>
 We have only a few weeks to complete an alternative plan to counter the 
Washington one. The rub is that it has to meet the national healthful air 
standard. But how we do that is largely up to us. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA will hear testimony next Wednesday but take written comments until the 
end of August. Then, if they approve of our locally originated solution, it 
will be put into effect next February. If our ideas are short of the mark, 
Uncle Sam's ideas will rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that it was a local group, Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, that 
brought the suit that created this situation. It contended that local and state 
enforcement of air-quality standards were short of the Federal mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Economic Development Assn. and the county's Council on 
Economic Vitality will be at the hearings supporting such smog-busting measures 
as a half-cent increase in county sales taxes to support mass transit and 
higher vehicle registration fees keyed to miles driven. 
</P>
<P>
 A further irony here is that, to preserve local business -- and the jobs 
involved -- the council and the association are all for shifting the burden of 
cutting down smog away from industrial polluters to the driving public. You and 
me. We've been the source of two thirds of the mess all along. 
</P>
<P>
 What to do? Earthwatch has reported on the possibility of buying low-pollution 
cars and vans. The ones presently being marketed locally by Ford, GM and 
Chrysler are powered by natural gas -- which is 60% cleaner than the wet stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week these Detroit firms got a little more serious and launched a joint 
scheme to create an industry-standard compressed gas tank. This could, they 
say, aid them in eliminating the price differential, which presently makes 
clean air vehicles 10% more expensive. This has hurt sales, even though 
operating expenses are much less and the engines last forever. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gas Co. says the number of natural gas vehicle refueling stations is 
growing locally. 
</P>
<P>
 And their new joint-venture vehicle conversion facility in East Los Angeles is 
about to deliver 15 vans for Gas Co. use in our county next month. 
</P>
<P>
 You and I can have our Caprice or Caravan converted there -- but only by 
plunking down several grand. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Lung Assn. of Ventura County supports natural gas transportation 
as a way to fight respiratory disease, and they use such a van. "For clean-air 
driving, it's what's most feasible for the everyday person now," said 
association executive Edna Ray. Next week she's launching a county-wide public 
relations campaign including a 30-minute video entitled, "Clean Air Is Up To

JAUNTS; PIANIST ADDS A MODERN TOUCH TO OLD MOVIES; MICHAEL MORTILLA USES 
KEYBOARDS AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT TO EMBELLISH SILENT FILMS SHOWN ON AN OUTDOOR 
SCREEN. MOTHER NATURE'S SHOW IS A BONUS.

<P>
 You can go to a movie theater any time, but it's not every day that you can 
sit under the stars in a mountain park and watch a silent film while the 
crickets chirp. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, if you can hear the crickets. One of the best parts about seeing the 
film classics at the Paramount Ranch near Agoura is hearing the fancy keyboard 
work of Michael Mortilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortilla, 40, is a rarity. He has garnered a worldwide reputation for his 
ability to provide the musical accompaniment to silent films. You can see him 
in action at 8 p.m. Sunday when the melodrama "The Night Cry," a 1926 film 
starring Rin Tin Tin, is shown on the outdoor screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is the first of two to be shown this summer by the National Park 
Service and the Silent Society of Hollywood Heritage as part of their "Silents 
Under the Stars" program, begun six years ago at the re-created Western town. 
The second film, "Manhandled," starring Gloria Swanson, will be shown Aug. 21 
at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortilla, who lives in Santa Barbara, has provided the musical accompaniment 
for the films since the program began. Some fans come to hear him as much as to 
see the classics. 
</P>
<P>
 The astonishing thing about Mortilla is that usually he is seeing the film for 
the first time, improvising on the spot, without a clue as to the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 "That gets a little tricky," he said. "You never know when the gun will go 
off, or if the gun will go off, or whether the man is the hero or the villain." 
</P>
<P>
 Mortilla does a lot more than simply tickle the keys. He brings a series of 
keyboards and computer equipment so that he can push a button and go to a whole 
range of sounds -- piano, flute, oboe -- or special effects, such as a dog 
barking or a gunshot. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of quick thinking goes on," said Mortilla, a composer for theater and 
dance as well as a UC Santa Barbara faculty member. 
</P>
<P>
 The silent films are shown in the open-sided building known as the pavilion, 
which was built by Paramount Studios to house large props during the 1920s and 
1930s when the movie ranch was in its heyday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch itself is nestled in the mountains. Until the late 1940s, its 
canyons, oak groves, streams and rolling grasslands provided the backdrop for 
the movies made by the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Park Service took over 300 acres of the ranch in 1981, 
re-creating some of the Western sets where the television show "Dr. Quinn, 
Medicine Woman" is filmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences at silent movies can explore the Western sets at the ranch before 
the films begin, or they can picnic on the grounds. Some moviegoers say that 
part of the program's appeal is watching the sunset and the moonrise over the 
hills, breathing the cool mountain air and hearing the birds and crickets, and 
maybe a coyote. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mortilla, all that nature stuff can be a headache. 
</P>
<P>
 He has to deal with moths that flicker around his lights, and other pesky 
insects such as the fire ants that attacked his foot during a performance. 
</P>
<P>
 He takes it all with a sense of humor. After all, he is quick to point out, 
the original purpose of the early silent film accompanist was to cover the 
sound of the projector. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last six years, he has accompanied at least 125 films. His most famous 
silent-film stint was to provide new scores for 12 restored Charlie Chaplin 
films for Los Angeles-based Film Preservation Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortilla is a self-taught musician who nonetheless worked closely with dance 
great Martha Graham in New York City during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 He served as composer and accompanist for Graham's company and collaborated 
with her on the PBS special, "In Performance at the White House." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday he'll be a world away as Rin Tin Tin takes to the screen. Details 
</P>

GOINGS ON; 'CABARET' DANCES ITS WAY TO SBCC; THE SMASH BROADWAY AND FILM HIT, 
SET IN BERLIN OF THE 1920S, IS BEING REPRISED AT THE COLLEGE'S GARVIN THEATRE.

<P>
 It has been nearly 30 years since director Harold Prince and his cast took to 
Broadway with the musical "Cabaret," a story of romance and decadence in 1920s 
Berlin, during the rise of Nazism. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years and eight Tony Awards later, the company toured the United States 
with the popular show. In 1972 it became an Academy Award-winning movie, 
directed by Bob Fosse and starring Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey. And in 1987 the 
show returned to Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Now "Cabaret" is at Santa Barbara City College's Garvin Theatre, in a 
production by the SBCC Theatre Group, under the direction of Pope Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, which opened last week, will run through July 23. Show times are 
Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m. Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets are $14 (Friday 
and Saturday), $12 (Thursday and Sunday), with $2 discounts for seniors. Call 
965-5935. The theater is located on the 800 block of Cliff Drive. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 SBCC's Garvin Theatre Complex -- the Studio Theatre part of it -- will play 
host to another Broadway smash, with tonight's opening of the 1970s rock 
musical "Godspell." The cast consists of local junior high, high school and 
college students involved in Access Theatre's Youth Access to the Arts program. 
</P>
<P>
 Through mime, slapstick, song, and dance, "Godspell" takes a carnival-like 
approach to the Gospel according to St. Matthew. Performances are Tuesday 
through Saturday at 8 p.m. and this Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets are $14 (general), 
$12 (seniors and children). Call 965-5935. 
</P>

 The New Vic Theater will present the 24th International Tournee of Animation, 
a 1 1/2-hour collection of the world's best, through Tuesday at the Lobero 
Theatre. Shows tonight, Friday, Monday, and Tuesday at 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. and 
Sunday at 4:30 p.m., 7 p.m., and 9 p.m. Admission is $6 (adults), $4 (children 
and seniors). The Lobero is located at 33 E. Canon Perdido St. Call 963-0761 or

 The Santa Barbara Jazz Society will host a Bastille Day Celebration this 
evening at the Cutter Motors Showroom, with an exhibit of artwork from 25 area 
artists and an "All-Star Jazz and Blues Review." Musicians will include Fred 
Raulston, Harold Acey, Theo Saunders, and Ray Bailey. Admission is free. The 
party will begin at 6 p.m. French attire is optional. The showroom is located 
at 402 S. Hope Ave.

 Here are a couple of events at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History: 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's Astronomical Unit will take over the planetarium tonight through 
July 22 to present a series of shows called "Comet Crash." The timing coincides 
with the anticipated collision, later this month, between the comet 
Shoemaker-Levy, and the planet Jupiter. Shows will begin at 8 p.m. General 
admission is $3 (adults), $2 (children). 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Saturday, museum visitors can check out antique natural history 
prints of exotic mollusks. The collection, based on discoveries made during 
18th- and 19th-Century expeditions to North and South America, the Pacific 
Islands, the Philippines, and other locations, has been maintained in Europe 
for 150 years by the family of Baron de Ferussac. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum, located at 2559 Puesta del Sol Road, is open Monday through 
Saturday 9 a.m.-5 p.m., Sunday 10 a.m.-5 p.m. General admission is $5 (adults), 
$5 (teens and seniors), $3 (children age 2-12). Call 682-4711.

<P>
 Take a really large model of the Eiffel Tower, add a parade of poodles, toss 
in some escargot, some crepes, and the cancan, and what have you got? No, not a 
stomachache. 
</P>
<P>
 You've got the 7th Annual French Festival (a Fete Francaise) Saturday and 
Sunday at Santa Barbara's Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be international dancing, music (including tunes by J.T. and the 
Zydeco Zippers and Renaissance songs by the Greenwood Singers), cultural 
exhibits, classic French cars and an abundance of food -- prepared by local 
eateries the likes of Citronelle, La Casbah and The French Bakery. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will run 11 a.m.-7 p.m. both days. Admission is free. The park is 
located off the Mission Street exit of U.S. 101. Call 564-PARIS for more 
information. 
</P>

<P>
 Their music has been referred to as a mix of California Honky Tonk and 
psychobilly. And it's been dubbed "Bakersfield Country Music." Whatever the 
classification, the Twangin' Iguanas will undoubtedly add an original twist to 
their country music, Sunday, in a free concert at Santa Barbara's Alameda Park 
bandstand. The concert will run from 3 to 4:30 p.m. Call 963-0611 ext. 4530 for 
more information. The park is located at Micheltorena and Anacapa streets.

THEATER REVIEW; A SOLID GRIP ON ORTON'S BRILLIANT SATIRE; ENSEMBLE THEATRE 
COMPANY IS UP TO THE CHALLENGES OF THE TAXING 'WHAT THE BUTLER SAW.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 "Was your stepmother aware of your love for your father?" demands the leering 
psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived in a normal family," protests his unwilling patient. "I had no love 
for my father!" 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the wicked, barbed-wire satire of Joe Orton, whose brilliant comedy 
"What the Butler Saw" puts a post-Freudian spin on sophisticated wit worthy of 
Oscar Wilde. 
</P>
<P>
 Ensemble Theatre Company's lively staging proves worthy of the precision 
timing and razor-sharp performances required for Orton's particularly taxing 
farce. While a few opening night lapses showed the need for some settling in, 
it's clear director Robert Grande-Weiss and his talented cast have a solid grip 
on the piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, they have accurately captured the cynical context of Orton's 
worldview, in which the only genuine impulses are greed and lust -- morality 
and human values are simply hypocritical impediments to gratification. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's increasingly tangled plot stems from the ill-fated attempts by Dr. 
Prentice (Charles de L'Arbre), the lecherous head of a lunatic asylum, to 
seduce his would-be secretary Miss Barclay (Emma-Jane Huerta) during an 
interview. Having persuaded her to remove her clothes for a "routine" medical 
examination, he is interrupted by the unexpected arrival of his nymphomaniac 
wife (Gretchen Evans), followed by the pompous examining psychiatrist 
(Christopher Vore) representing the government -- "Your immediate superiors in 
madness," he declares huffily. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to explain away the naked Miss Barclay as a patient, Dr. Prentice sets 
in motion a convoluted series of mistaken identities and provocative 
situations, which also entangle a larcenous, blackmailing bellhop (Devin Scott) 
and a thick-headed policeman (Ron Scala) investigating -- of all things -- the 
missing parts from an exploded statue of Winston Churchill. 
</P>
<P>
 The good doctor's ingenuity is taxed to the limit as he even forces Miss 
Barclay and the bellhop into gender-switching disguises. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must tell the truth!" wails the hapless Miss Barclay. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a thoroughly defeatist attitude," Prentice counters. 
</P>
<P>
 While we can't help wishing for more outright cunning in de L'Arbre's 
characterization of the doctor, Evans' performance as his meddling wife never 
fails to delight with its quirky inflections. Huerta and Scala supply much of 
the outright physical comedy, while Scott's hilarious rendition of a woman is 
downright masterful. Vore skillfully navigates the tongue-twisting rapids in 
some of the play's most complicated speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 Though briskly paced, the piece occasionally stumbles on a misplaced 
commitment to the realistic beats of natural dialogue. Quite unnecessary -- 
people don't converse in repartee this perfectly loony, so why bother making it 
seem as if they do? 
</P>
<P>
 As Orton himself put it, "lunatics have to be melodramatic. The subtleties of 
drama are wasted on them." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "What the Butler Saw" 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Through Aug. 14, Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7; 
Sunday matinees at 2 p.m. on July 17 and Aug. 7. 
</P>

 * WHERE: Alhecama Theatre, 914 State St., Santa Barbara.

 After 31 years doing business in Thousand Oaks, Du-pars coffee shop closed its 
doors in 1991. To the dismay of many longtime customers, it was the end of an 
era. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, a new era is about to begin. Just as dramatically as Du-pars left, it is 
returning. On Monday, a new member of the 56-year-old Du-pars chain is 
scheduled to open at 75 W. Thousand Oaks Blvd., right next door to the previous 
location. 
</P>
<P>
 The big question is, will it be just like its predecessor? 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have the same menu," said Linda Williams, a bookkeeper in the Du-pars 
executive office. "But we won't be identical, because it's not going to look 
the same inside." The inside, she said, will consist of two separate coffee 
shops and a bar.

 Calling all cooks. The 27-year-old Santa Paula Citrus Festival, to be held 
Aug. 5-7, will be highlighted by its inaugural Citrus Recipe Contest. Deadline 
to enter is July 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Paula has been known historically as the citrus capital of the world," 
said Jim Garfield of Santa Paula's Cal West Real Estate, the contest organizer. 
"We just decided to do the contest because the citrus festival has very little 
to do with citrus, unless we specifically tie it in to something." 
</P>
<P>
 If it weren't for the contest, said Garfield, the most citrus you'd be apt to 
see at the festival would be at the Chamber of Commerce lemonade stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Contest rules, as you might suspect, are pretty straightforward: Use citrus. 
</P>
<P>
 The food item can be anything -- main dish, salad, dessert, beverage, etc. And 
the ingredients must include either lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruit, 
avocados or some combination of the above. "But not all of them, please," said 
Garfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrants may submit as many dishes as the want. If you're interested, call 
525-5523.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; VIVA! FOR THOSE CHILE VERDE OMELETS; THE SAVORY SAUCE DRAWS 
FOLKS FROM FAR AND WIDE TO VINCE'S IN SANTA PAULA, AN INVITING SPOT FOR 
BREAKFAST OR LUNCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It may be true that people come from as far away as Los Angeles, and even San 
Jose to eat Vince Montes' chile verde omelets Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 They probably know exactly what they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 When a colleague of mine said that he'd read in a usually reliable travel 
newsletter that the eggs rancheros and chile verde served at Vince's Coffee 
Shop are the best, I figured it was worth at least a trip. I made three. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time, I drove right by the place, stopped at a service station to 
check the address, then drove back down Main Street, finally ending up parked 
under a tree in front of Vince's. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula is a very neat little town. There aren't many left these days, 
towns where there's still the flavor of the early Southern California orange 
and lemon groves, where the downtown streets still have trees, parking is 
parallel and lots of people know one another. The Latino influence is also very 
strong in Santa Paula, with store signs in Spanish and plenty of Mexican 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince's is right in the middle of all this, a sort of turquoise-colored 
building, the front half seating perhaps 30 people, with the back half serving 
as kitchen. It has hamburgers and french dips and fried egg sandwiches on the 
menu, but so much chile verde that you'd have to include Vince's on any list of 
Mexican restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 I've tried other things at Vince's besides the chile verde. The scrambled eggs 
with chorizo ($4.75), for instance. Not great; dry and grainy. And I can't say 
I'd brag much about the brand of tortillas they use. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vince Montes, who's been in this location for 15 years, can do a lot of 
bragging about his chile verde. On the eggs rancheros ($5.75), one of the 
restaurant's most popular dishes, the eggs are fried, then covered with a 
ranchero sauce -- spicy but not too spicy, with the chile verde served on the 
side. With the omelet ($5.85), the eggs are soft but not runny. The egg texture 
is just right -- unlike many places where the omelets are overcooked -- letting 
the eggs and the chile merge. 
</P>
<P>
 Montes makes the chile verde himself, usually coming in early in the morning, 
but sometimes turning the cooking over to someone else if the demand increases 
later in the day (not too much later, since this is strictly a breakfast and 
lunch spot). 
</P>
<P>
 The dish is done from scratch. It begins with a large pot of pork butt cut 
into cubes. The pork is not marinated, but simmered in its own juices, but not 
too long -- overcooking will cause the meat to fall apart. Montes' pork is 
exceptionally tender but holds together. 
</P>
<P>
 The chile sauce, I'm told, is made of jalapenos, onions, tomatillos and 
tomatoes, with spicing of oregano, garlic powder and cumin. A little La Palma 
hot sauce is added and some flour and water to thicken things up a bit. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Vince's Coffee Shop. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: 827 E. Main St., Santa Paula, 525-0314. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: Breakfast or lunch for two, $8-$15. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Open for breakfast or lunch, Monday to Saturday, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. No 
credit cards.

O.C. EXEC'S BAPTISM OF FIRE IN D.C.; GOVERNMENT: GSA CHIEF ROGER JOHNSON 
REFLECTS ON FRUSTRATING FIRST YEAR THAT MADE HIM YEARN FOR HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It all seemed to come crashing down one night last March when Roger Johnson 
walked into his Georgetown living room and just stood there. He couldn't 
remember feeling more alone -- bewildered really. The cold outside was bitter, 
the worst in anyone's memory. Three thousand miles away stood his seaside dream 
house, where the warm shores of Laguna Beach were his back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 What was he doing here, anyway, closed up in this four-story silo of a house 
in Washington, a city so insanely ambitious that people compete to leave the 
office last and it's a badge of honor never to see your kids? 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson had come to the nation's capital as the highest-ranking Republican on 
the Clinton team, tapped by the President himself. His assignment was to run 
the General Services Administration, seen by some as the Keystone Cop of 
federal agencies, a place so bound in red tape that it concocted nine pages of 
rules for the simple task of buying an ashtray. 
</P>
<P>
 What he found was a Washington more daunting than he could have imagined, 
where back-biting, put-downs, suspicion and half-truths seemed a way of life. 
Not in 35 years as a businessman had he been treated this way. That March night 
he came this close to quitting. This wasn't the way it was supposed to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Janice, I've never felt so alone," he told his wife of 37 years -- his 
college sweetheart -- standing in the living room. "I'm to the point where I 
don't think I can trust anyone in this town." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a savvy CEO who had turned a foundering Irvine computer firm into a 
Fortune 500 company, had come to Washington in 1993 with visions of 
"reinventing government." He would lend his expertise to the American people, 
whip a wasteful agency into shape and give something back to his country in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he was beginning to wonder. Someone in his office seemed to be leaking 
false information about him. He fired two people as a result. The press began 
scrutinizing his expense vouchers, forcing him to explain trips back to Orange 
County. Some members of Congress branded him the worst combination of uppity 
and stupid -- Mr. Johnson Goes to Washington -- another pain-in-the-neck 
newcomer bent on fixing the bureaucracy and screwing things up. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporate world was rough-and-tumble, but at least the players were 
civilized. Here people were just mean. One lawmaker suggested that they "send 
Roger Johnson back to Orange County on a bicycle with no seat." Some 
congressional staffers dismissed him as "arrogant, naive, sophomoric." 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to shake up the federal government," one critic later gloated. "He 
got his (rear end) kicked. Badly." 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to Johnson was less a question of administrative talent than a 
clash of cultures. East Coast political meets West Coast corporate. In the 
comforting arms of Irvine's Western Digital Corp., CEO Johnson gave an order, 
the order was followed, the problem was fixed, and everybody was happy. But in 
Congress, CEOs looking for slaps on the back sometimes get kicks in the pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting personally attacked, and I couldn't figure out why. I've spent 
35 years mostly getting patted on the head. I thought of leaving. I had some 
good people around who got me through this," Johnson said in a recent 
interview, looking comfortable at long last in his cavernous navy blue office, 
the mystery of Washington clearer to him now. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, he's even able to joke about it. "There's more than a three-hour time 
difference here. I think I found Atlantis." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 As the story goes, Roger Johnson was so disillusioned with the state of the 
economy under President George Bush that he once told a newspaper reporter 
something to this effect: If a Democrat would give him a reason, Johnson would 
vote for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton, then little more than an asterisk in the polls, called him up 
and gave him one. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was a member of the powerful Lincoln Club, a group of moneyed Orange 
County Republicans who fuel GOP candidates and causes. For one of such an 
exclusive cult to support a Democrat was unprecedented. But Johnson and seven 
other powerful Orange County Republicans shocked the nation by withdrawing 
their support from Bush and throwing it to Bill Clinton. The Orange Eight, as 
they would be remembered, decided to announce their allegiance to Clinton on 
Aug. 21, 1992, at a press conference in Newport Beach's Pacific Club, a bastion 
of Republicanism where Bush and Ronald Reagan were often feted. 
</P>
<P>
 They figured the local papers might show up. They walked in to find 11 
television cameras, the major news magazines and virtually all of the national 
print media. Word leaked out that "traitors" were about to defect on sacred 
ground. Lincoln Club members scrambled to stop the press conference. It never 
dawned on Johnson that what he was about to do would ruffle so many feathers. 
Certainly, he never dreamed it would lead him to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life was no longer the same after that," he said at the White House dining 
room one recent afternoon. "I latched onto a wild train." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton made a steady rise in the polls and Johnson came to genuinely admire 
him, not as Bush's lesser evil but as a visionary in his own right, he said. 
Election night was heady stuff. Headier still was the day the new President 
named Johnson to head the GSA, an appointment "beyond my wildest dreams," he 
said then. 
</P>
<P>
 The pink Mediterranean-style Laguna dream house was rented out. Johnson and 
his wife bought a brick place in Georgetown where homes bump up against each 
other and people hire valets to find their dinner guests a parking spot. Their 
cherrywood headboard wouldn't fit up the old narrow staircase, so they bought a 
new one. Janice Johnson had the blue walls painted blush and they moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington society embraced them. There was dinner at the White House with 
Isaac Stern; Johnson sat next to the President. Columnist Art Buchwald had them 
over in December. Never had life been more exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 But through it all there persisted a hostile undercurrent that said living in 
the public eye would not be simple. Back in Orange County, the Republican 
establishment was plenty mad. Janice Johnson was shunned at some lunches. At 
one reception, a local Republican notable referred to Janice Johnson and 
another Orange County Eight -- Irvine developer Kathryn G. Thompson -- as 
"turncoats." When a local Boy Scout group decided to honor Roger Johnson at its 
annual fund-raiser, bitter Republicans staged a boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 And this was just the start. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No one had to tell Roger Johnson that the GSA administrator post was not the 
flashiest job on the Hill, even if it does employ nearly 20,000 workers and 
oversees $60 billion in government spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as the government's Wal-Mart, the GSA is its phone company, car buyer, 
supply warehouse and purchaser of almost everything the bureaucracy requires, 
from personal computers to pencils. Linked together, a year's supply of GSA 
paper clips would extend half way around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 What someone did neglect to tell Johnson, however, was that he was taking over 
an agency dogged by one of the worst reputations in the federal government. It 
had gone through 17 administrators in 23 years; the average staying just 18 
months. It employed one supervisor for every four employees. Congress had 
repeatedly criticized it for failing to prevent or detect waste, fraud and 
abuse. Auditors concluded its ineffective procurement policies were costing the 
government millions in cost overruns. GSA folklore was rife with stories like 
the Navy commander who planned to buy a $79 vacuum cleaner until the GSA 
insisted he get the $348 model. Johnson walked into a department that, just a 
year before, had somehow lost track of 236 federal aircraft it was supposed to 
manage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only criticism I have of the Administration is, no one sat me down and 
said, 'This is the mess you are walking into,' " Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a CEO, he could cut at least 10% out of any annual budget. As GSA chief, 
opportunities to trim and streamline seemed to be leaping out at him. Why lease 
a federal building for decades when it's cheaper to build it instead? Why tear 
down a veterans' hospital in one end of town only to build a military hospital 
in another? 
</P>
<P>
 "I walk in here and I see billions of dollars lying in the streets. My mouth 
waters," Johnson said. "But every time in this town that I reach out to pick up 
a gold nugget, I get hit by lightening." 
</P>
<P>
 He had come onto the scene raring to reinvent. He cut $1.2 billion in waste 
out of nearly 200 planned federal construction and leasing projects. He worked 
with Vice President Al Gore on the National Performance Review, a study that 
spotlighted the now-infamous nine-page ashtray. He ordered all federal law 
enforcement agencies to destroy surplus and outmoded firearms rather than sell 
them to gun dealers, reversing a policy that in the past 10 years put more than 
60,000 weapons on the streets. He forged a unique partnership with the GSA's 
two largest labor unions. He held round-table discussions asking the 
demoralized GSA staff how they think it could be done better. He kept his 
promise to downsize the department without a single layoff. He helped lead the 
way in reforming how the government buys things and coined a new motto for 
efficiency: "better, cheaper, faster, easier, smarter or not at all." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotta give the guy an A for effort," Harry Dawson, president of American 
Federation of Government Employees Council 236 -- one of two labor unions that 
represent GSA workers -- said with cautious praise, noting that grievances have 
fallen as much as 80% since Johnson came on board. "It's too early tell how 
this will end, but so far, I think, Roger Johnson is the best administrator 
we've seen in 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) praised Johnson's efforts to upgrade an 
antiquated federal computer system that occasionally causes the government's 
right hand not to know what the left is doing. "I am just sorry somebody didn't 
do this a long time ago," Glenn said. "He's doing it, to his everlasting 
credit." 
</P>
<P>
 But the voices of praise seemed lost in a thunder of criticism. Some 
Republicans didn't trust Johnson because he supported a Democrat, and some 
Democrats didn't like him because he remained a registered Republican. Hateful 
newsletters, anonymously written, were landing on his desk. If one union leader 
lauded him, another demanded he resign. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington press pored over his travel vouchers and overnight mail 
receipts, then raised questions about whether he spent federal funds for 
personal use. Although an internal investigation concluded that he had broken 
no rules, Johnson decided to repay $1,062.55 to clear the air. The 
reimbursement was viewed by some an admission of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all, Johnson's grand plans for change -- which had the enthusiastic 
backing of the President and vice president -- had overlooked one detail: 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, he was the bull in the federal china closet -- cocky, rushing 
to change an agency he had not taken the time to figure out, and neglecting to 
inform Congress, where six major committees are authorized to oversee what the 
GSA does. 
</P>
<P>
 "If what is wrong with the GSA could have been fixed that easily, it would 
have been fixed a long time ago," one congressional source grumbled. "He got 
off to a terrible start." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps his most vocal critic -- Rep. Jack Brooks, a Texas Democrat and 
powerful chairman of the House Judiciary Committee -- said Johnson's 
reorganization plans were gutting the GSA's central purpose: to monitor what 
other agencies procure. 
</P>
<P>
 At congressional hearings in March, Johnson was blistered. Said Brooks: 
"They've turned the meat house over to the lion and I want to get that lion." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was accused by committee members of keeping secrets from Congress, of 
attempting to unravel the agency he was supposed to run. Members hollered at 
him. Government Computer News, a Washington-area trade publication, ran an 
editorial cartoon of an astonished-looking Johnson emerging from the hearing 
with his severed head in his hands. "Mr. Johnson Goes To Washington," read the 
caption. 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't the way he wanted to be seen, the man who sings in the car on his 
way to work, who loves opera and hates conflict -- even if he has been known to 
jab a few chests to get something done -- this father of three and grandfather 
of two who brings his staff souvenir boxes of White House M & M candy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely everything I had been trained for (in the corporate world), all I 
had learned, my instincts, value system were not applicable here," Johnson 
said. "One and one kept coming up three, one, 27." 
</P>
<P>
 He seemed to be taking all of it personally. His asthma worsened, aggravated 
by stress. He had trouble sleeping. His sense of humor -- so pervasive that he 
once found the wit to crack a joke after getting hit in the head by a flying 
golf ball -- was flickering. His friends and family noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My Lord," Janice Johnson said, looking at her disillusioned husband that 
March night in the living room. "This isn't Roger." 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of times he sounded so down. . . . I was concerned whether his 
health could take that stress and strain," Thompson, the Orange County 
developer, said. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife flew home to Orange County in March to visit friends. As the plane 
landed in Southern California, she wondered if going to Washington had been the 
mistake of their lives. She told a newspaper reporter that the critics on 
Capitol Hill could all "jump in the Potomac." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sort of statement that can get you in trouble around here. Instead, 
it prompted a personal letter of encouragement from the President and two from 
the First Lady. Vice President Al Gore learned of Johnson's rocky start and 
gave him a hearty "Go get 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 Winter passed. Cherry blossoms burst into bloom everywhere. Janice Johnson 
found a Georgetown home built in 1811, with a master bedroom addition, circa 
1840. Her husband apologized to Congress, assuring members that he had no 
secret plan to reorganize the agency and promising to keep them informed. In 
recent weeks, even his harshest enemies seemed to be turning around, crediting 
him with an attitude adjustment and acknowledging that some of his ideas might 
even be good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will take some share of the blame," Johnson said when asked to consider 
again the question that dogged him for months: What went wrong? "I was used to 
not worrying my board of directors until I came to some sort of conclusion. 
Here you have to keep them briefed, otherwise they invent their own 
implications and impugn motives to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of it, he said, was just miscommunication. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the only Fortune 500 guy around here," he said. "I was saying things and 
using words that have completely different meaning in government. I would say 
this agency needs to be competitive. That was read that I intended to dismantle 
it and privatize it. I was talking about finding out what we are doing that's 
good and what we are doing that's not good." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson calls upon the electorate to send to Washington more lawmakers who 
understand a profit and loss sheet. The trouble, he said, is not the nine pages 
of specifications required to buy an ashtray, but the culture that produced the 
nine pages in the first place. "There is no room left in this town for 
reasonable judgment. The town is paranoid about making mistakes and the process 
has taken over for common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's hot outside. Johnson steps out the back of the GSA headquarters at 18th 
and F streets, where his chauffeur, James, stands beside the black Chrysler New 
Yorker. Johnson pauses. Should he and a reporter walk the couple of short 
blocks to the White House or ride? He decides to ride and gives the nod to 
James. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to determine whether this would be considered a business meeting 
or a personal meeting," he explains, evidently still skittish about the expense 
account scrutiny. "If it was personal, we shouldn't use a government car. But 
this is business." 
</P>
<P>
 He settles back in the cushy gray leather seats. If there is one thing he 
wants to make clear, it's that he has more admiration for the President and the 
First Lady than he did the day he endorsed him. Clearly, this government job 
pays him a fraction of the money he was earning in private life. He just turned 
60 and could be sailing in the Pacific with Janice at one side and a margarita 
at the other. He stayed on to serve the President. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think more today than I did 2 1/2 years ago that he is a person of great 
vision, of extremely good intentions, he and Hillary both." 
</P>
<P>
 With his sights reset, Johnson moves forward, calling most recently for a 
review of government building contracts. The investigation will likely make 
some waves, but he has grown accustomed to boats rocking. "I think I walked 
through hell and came out the other side -- a little burned, but not fatally. I 
came here thinking that on a scale of 1 to 10 I could achieve a 7. I now think 
if I achieve a 1, I probably should be sainted." 
</P>
<P>
 After a lunch at the White House, he grabs a couple of boxes of M & M's and 
offers an informal tour. He comes to the famous pillared north entrance, the 
one that leads to the residential quarters, the President's front door, so to 
speak. The guard smiles and waves him through. He strolls to the Oval Office, 
through the Rose Garden where Socks is usually basking in the sun, but not 
today. The staff is vacuuming and primming. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something stimulating about just being here, off the path of the 
public tours. The baptism was hell, but watching him stroll the quiet corridors 
that Lincoln walked, one wonders if he wouldn't do it all again. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't put down your right hand or left foot around here without touching 
history," Johnson says, smiling contentedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," he decides. "It's been worth it." Profile: Roger Johnson

ANGELS COACH JIMMIE REESE DIES AT AGE 92; OBITUARY: DURING 78 YEARS IN BASEBALL 
HE WON THE FRIENDSHIP OF GAME'S GREATS, REGARD OF LEGIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He was Babe Ruth's roommate. He was Nolan Ryan's and Reggie Jackson's best 
pal. But to those close to him, Jimmie Reese will always be remembered for the 
man he was, not the men he knew. 
</P>
<P>
 His love of the game buoyed him through 78 seasons of professional baseball -- 
from batboy for the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League in 1917 to 
conditioning coach for the California Angels in 1994 -- and along the way he 
lifted the spirits of countless managers, coaches, players, clubhouse workers 
and sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, 92, died Wednesday morning at a hospital in Santa Ana. He was in his 
23rd season with the Angels organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very fond of Jimmie Reese," Angels owner Gene Autry said. "He's one of 
the finest men I've ever known. We will miss him, I'll tell you that. He was a 
wonderful, wonderful man." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Autry's wife, Jackie: "He represented the best part of baseball. . . . 
He was an extraordinary gentleman. We should get his fungo bat and put it in 
the Angel Hall of Fame." 
</P>
<P>
 A fungo bat, long and thin with an extra-long handle and occasionally one flat 
side, is used by coaches to hit grounders and fly balls while players practice 
fielding. Reese was known throughout baseball for his ability to use it to drop 
a ball on a dime. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese broke into professional baseball with the minor league Oakland Oaks in 
1924 and six years later was purchased by the New York Yankees. With the 
Yankees, he roomed with the legendary Ruth, an association that provided Reese 
with a collection of tales that never failed to mesmerize listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, he became mentor and close friend of players such as Ryan, 
Jackson and pitcher Jim Abbott, but few who crossed his path were untouched by 
his sincerity, his good nature and his uncanny ability to make people smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, born in New York City on Oct. 1, 1901, spent three seasons in the 
majors -- two with the Yankees and one with the old St. Louis Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 It was as the former roommate of the notoriously fun-loving Ruth, baseball's 
first great home-run hitter, that Reese gained most of his fame. And he enjoyed 
every minute of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used to always tell us," Jackie Autry said, "I didn't really room with 
Babe Ruth. I roomed with his luggage." 
</P>
<P>
 Reese once said that if he lived to be 100 -- and he didn't miss by much -- he 
would never forget Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friendship with Babe meant that I walked the streets of New York with 
him," Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wanted to be around him. People would yell his name or just run up 
and touch him. A lot of times people would ask him for money. Times were hard 
in those days. Babe would give a guy $10 and say, 'OK, you owe me.' But he knew 
he'd never see the guy again." 
</P>
<P>
 But hanging around Ruth had its price. Once when the Yankees were in St. 
Louis, Reese said, Ruth's wife ordered him to drive the Babe from the hotel to 
the ballpark. Make sure there were no stops, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went out a side door and got in his 16-cylinder Packard," Reese recalled. 
"And there was a lady in a parked car. The Babe said we were going to take a 
little detour. 
</P>
<P>
 "We followed her a couple of miles to an apartment. The Babe told me to read a 
book or two. An hour or so later he came out puffing. He lit a cigar and said 
we better get to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Infield practice was on when we arrived. Manager Bob Shawkey said hi to the 
Babe. But to me he said, 'Where the hell you been, Reese?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Shawkey had to come up with something, so he told me, 'Reese, I think you're 
bad company for Babe to keep.' I all but fell over, but Babe thought it was a 
howl." 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Reese's favorites was Ryan. The former pitcher and Reese became 
friends when Ryan and Reese joined the Angels in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 The first day of spring training, Reese ran Ryan all over the outfield with 
his famous fungo bat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is that guy?" Ryan asked. "He's going to kill me the first day." 
</P>
<P>
 They ultimately became close friends, and one of Reese's prized possessions 
was the baseball Ryan used to complete his fifth no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea how we became friends," Reese once said. "I must be at least 
10 years older than he is." 
</P>
<P>
 From the time he was hired as batboy by the Los Angeles Angels in 1917, Reese 
never missed a summer's participation in the national pastime until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 What doctors called a coronary occlusion threatened his career, but after 
missing almost the entire 1991 season Reese was back in 1992, celebrating his 
76th summer in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels announced at the time that Reese had been signed to a lifetime 
contract and would not have to do any more traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 In his day, though, he traveled lots. He was a second baseman when he began 
his playing career with the Pacific Coast League's Oakland Oaks. In 1930, along 
with another infielder, Lyn Lary, Reese was sold to the Yankees. The price for 
the pair was $125,000, at the time a record figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese played 232 major league games, batting .278. He was a deadly 
pinch-hitter, getting 15 hits in 33 at-bats for a .455 average. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, a slick-fielding second baseman who bats .278 would last a decade. 
Unfortunately, Reese broke in the year the major leagues had their liveliest 
baseball. In 1930, nine of the 16 teams averaged better than .300. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese returned to the Pacific Coast League in 1933. He retired as a player 
after the 1938 season, having spent 13 seasons in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 After retiring as a player Reese served as scout, manager and coach, finally 
joining the major league Angels in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1927, after hitting .337 for Oakland, Reese was given a "Jimmie Reese Day," 
$1,000 and a suitcase full of clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-two years later, there was another "Jimmie Reese Day." The Angels 
honored him -- fittingly -- before a Yankee game in 1989 as the greatest fungo 
hitter, nicest man and best living symbol of baseball tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese said he was mystified by the day in his honor. All he ever wanted to do, 
he said, was play, watch, teach and talk baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese had no survivors. Donations may be made in Reese's name to the Jackie 
Robinson Foundation, 3 W. 35th St., 11th floor, New York, NY 10001-2204, and to 
the Amigos de los Ninos, P.O. Box 2602, La Habra 90632-2602. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be visitation from noon to 7 p.m. today at Fairhaven Memorial Park, 
1702 E. Fairhaven Ave., Santa Ana. Memorial services will be conducted at 1 
p.m. Friday at the Samsvic Chapel, Calvary Church of Santa Ana, 1010 N. Tustin 
Ave.

MACY, FEDERATED SAID TO AGREE TO MERGER ACCORD 
</P>

<P>
 Retailing giants R. H. Macy & Co. and Federated Department Stores have reached 
a tentative merger agreement that would create one of the nation's largest 
department store chains and further intensify California's competitive retail 
environment, industry sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although final details have yet to be worked out, the board of directors of 
New York-based Macy, which owns Bullock's department stores, is scheduled to 
meet today to review the merger agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the tentative agreement, Macy and Federated, whose stores include 
Bloomingdale's, would then develop a joint plan to help Macy emerge from 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection, retailing sources said. Federated would 
take on much of Macy's huge $6-billion debt and Macy would operate 
independently under the Federated umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to the negotiations said that Macy Chairman Myron E. Ullman III 
would remain with the merged company as a senior executive under the proposed 
agreement. Ullman and Federated Chairman Allen I. Questrom completed the 
proposed deal by telephone after Macy and Federated negotiators made 
substantial progress in talks in New York, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 A merger of the two companies would create a chain with more than 300 stores 
and about $13 billion in annual revenue. For Cincinnati-based Federated, a 
major goal of a merger would be to get a base in California, where nearly half 
of Macy's 111 Bullock's and Macy department stores are located. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy also has 11 of its 12 I. Magnin stores in the state. Federated's 
Bloomingdale's division has already announced plans to expand into Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 A marriage between Macy and Federated would put more pressure on the Broadway 
and Robinson-May department store chains. The combined company will have 
greater ability financially to remodel its stores and to keep it filled with 
fresh merchandise, said John Golisch, a partner specializing in retailing for 
the Arthur Andersen & Co. accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Golisch applauded the merger. He said it reflects a broad pattern in retailing 
of "consolidation into bigger, stronger companies with more clout." He said the 
deal could lead to job cuts, however, as the merged company cuts back office 
workers from overlapping business operations. At the same time, he said, that 
would reduce the company's costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval of the merger agreement by Macy's board, however, is not certain. The 
famed department store operator had rebuffed Federated's initial overtures more 
than six months ago in a bid to remain independent. However, Macy has become 
more receptive under pressure from creditors, which includes Federated. Macy's 
board was also said to have been impressed with some of the merger plans 
presented last week by Questrom. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Macy's board said it was not comfortable with some aspects of 
Questrom's proposal, including possible antitrust problems in areas where both 
companies compete. Federated officials have addressed those concerns in its 
most recent merger proposal, say industry sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal must also win the support of an important group of Macy creditors, 
its bondholders. Their opposition could prevent the bankruptcy judge from 
approving plans to get Macy out of bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Macy and Federated in less than a month have gone from being the Hatfields 
and the McCoys to being the Romeo and Juliet of the retailing," said Alan 
Millstein, a retailing consultant in New York and publisher of the Fashion 
Network Report newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Millstein said the deal will be "greeted with Hosannas by Wall Street," but 
will be bad news for many consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone will have to pay for the acquisition, and it's going to be the 
consumers, who will wind up paying higher prices," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Southern California, Millstein said, the deal likely will mean the 
"resurgence of the fashion image of Bullock's." 
</P>
<P>
 A merger represents a reversal of fortunes for both retailers. Federated once 
owned Bullock's and I. Magnin until it was acquired by Canadian businessman 
Robert Campeau. After the Campeau takeover, Federated sold its I. Magnin and 
Bullock's store groups in California to Macy in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Federated once had a California presence through Bullock's, none of 
its chains -- Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Strauss, the Bon Marche, Burdines, 
Goldsmith's, Jordan Marsh, Lazarus, Rich's and Stern's -- have stores in 
California.

BUS FARE HIKE OKD, BUT TOKEN COST UNCHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles bus fares will go up to $1.35 on Sept. 1 -- the first increase in 
six years -- and general monthly passes will no longer be available, the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority decided Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 To temper the 23% increase, up from the current fare of $1.10, the authority's 
board of directors voted to keep the price of a discount token at 90 cents 
rather than raise it to a dollar, as originally proposed by MTA Chief Executive 
Officer Franklin E. White. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes squeaked by with the two-thirds majority required from the 
13-member body. After the 9-3 vote, Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria 
Molina, who introduced the compromise, called it an acceptable "middle ground" 
position that would help rescue the cash-strapped MTA from bankruptcy, yet 
recognize the plight of the system's poorest riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best we could do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fares in Los Angeles have been among the lowest of major metropolitan areas, 
and the increase will make them comparable to those in other large cities, MTA 
research has shown. 
</P>
<P>
 But community activists opposed to fare increases immediately lambasted the 
plan, accusing the MTA of pursuing costly rail projects while slighting a bus 
network that serves 15 times as many people. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've spent all their money on these incredibly ill-advised rail projects, 
and now they're coming after the bus constituency to finance the rail," said 
Chris Niles of the Labor/Community Strategy Center, a Mid-Wilshire-based 
watchdog group. Niles described bus riders as needy people who "make $11,000 
(or) $12,000 a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Niles said eliminating the $42 general monthly pass will pose a severe 
hardship to the county's most disadvantaged residents, many of whom rely 
completely on public transit. Students, the elderly and the disabled will still 
be eligible for monthly passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Norma Lazaro, who has depended on buses for 17 years to shuttle her from her 
home in Atwater Village to her clerk job seven miles away in Downtown Los 
Angeles, said the increase could be difficult for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I can request somebody to bring me to work," Lazaro said. "I'll have to 
budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also denounced new reductions in bus service, approved separately 
Wednesday, that they believe will maroon hundreds of passengers, even though 
the affected lines are less heavily used. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials insist that a combination of fare increases and service cuts is 
imperative to help pluck the agency out of a sea of red ink. Just a year after 
its creation through the merger of the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission and the Southern California Rapid Transit District, the agency faces 
an operating deficit of $126 million and a capital shortfall of $170 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the MTA expects the new fare and service cutbacks to frighten away 
about 6% of its 1.1 million daily bus riders, it estimates that the higher 
fares will rake in an extra $31.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 That amount falls $8.8 million short of what planners had hoped to gain from 
increasing token charges by a dime apiece. With the passage of the compromise 
proposal, staff members must now find ways to trim more money from the agency's 
proposed $2.9-billion budget, final approval of which has been postponed for a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA already has undergone two series of layoffs and job reductions over 
the past year, and has instituted a hiring freeze. Some projects, such as the 
Blue Line light rail extension to Pasadena, have been cut back. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency also is embroiled in a bruising round of negotiations with its 
three biggest unions, including its bus and train operators, who have set a 
strike deadline of 12:01 a.m. Monday if no agreement is reached on their demand 
for a 3% raise and a cost-of-living increase. The MTA's drivers, mechanics and 
clerks -- about 6,500 employees out of its 9,100-person work force -- have been 
without a contract since July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the plan to raise bus fares and slash service that generated the 
most controversy since planners introduced the concepts several months ago. At 
the time, officials talked about the possibility of pushing the cost of a ride 
up to $1.50, even though they acknowledged that 62% of bus passengers come from 
households with incomes of $15,000 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the agency subsequently scaled down the fare to $1.35, the proposal 
remained a politically loaded issue.. In fact, Molina's amendment was narrowly 
defeated on its first try, and it wasn't until outgoing board member Evan 
Braude reversed his vote that the alternative was passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Braude, a Long Beach city councilman whose term expires Monday, said he 
switched sides because his replacement on the board supported Molina's plan, 
guaranteeing its approval if the board had postponed action by a week, as had 
been suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a labor contract coming up," he said. "I wanted to get this done 
before that." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan said he supported the compromise because the 
90-cent tokens would allow poor riders to save on the $1.35 full fare and could 
entice others to use the system because of publicity about the token discount. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics of the plan doubt that enough riders will switch over from cash to 
tokens. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, only about 6% of passengers opt for the tokens. For Molina's plan 
to work without draining more money from the agency, she hopes that about a 
third of the riders will take advantage of the cheaper tokens. 
</P>
<P>
 At 90 cents a token, 21 round trips a month -- about the number of working 
days -- would cost $37.80, which Molina called an affordable option for the 
working poor. However, observers note, this does not involve transfers, which 
will continue to cost 25 cents and which many riders need to get from home to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Other elements included in the plan adopted Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Monthly passes for college and vocational school students will be $30, up 
from $25. 
</P>
<P>
 * Passes for schoolchildren will be $20, up from $18, but will be good on 
weekends for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Passes for senior citizens and the disabled, including blind passengers, who 
previously traveled for free, will be $12, up from $10. 
</P>
<P>
 * Zone surcharges will apply on express bus lines and the Blue Line trolley -- 
50 cents per zone. An end-to-end ride on the Blue Line, from Long Beach to Los 
Angeles, will end up costing $2.35, more than double the current $1.10 fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Two local service bus lines were canceled as part of the package of service 
reductions: lines 208 (Beachwood shuttle) and 152 (Burbank shuttle). Service 
also will be scaled back on Lines 94, 104, 225 and 320. 
</P>
<P>
 The frequency of three peak-hour express routes (Lines 443 and 445 from the 
South Bay to Union Station and Line 457 between Los Angeles and Long Beach) 
also were cut back on a four-month trial basis. Officials expect the combined 
cutbacks to save up to $20 million. Past Hikes 
</P>
<P>
 Bus fares will rise to $1.35 for a one-way trip, the first increase in six 
years. 1980: 85 cents 1982*: 50 cents 1985: 85 cents 1988: $1.10 1994: $1.35 * 
Price dropped because some sales tax money provided partial transit funding for 
three years.

PASSPORT, CASH REPORTED IN SIMPSON CHASE CAR; EVIDENCE: INVESTIGATORS SAY THE 
ITEMS COULD SUGGEST THAT HIS MOTIVE FOR DISAPPEARING WAS FLIGHT, NOT SUICIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Police have recovered nearly $10,000 and a passport from the Ford Bronco in 
which O.J. Simpson was a passenger during a nationally televised pursuit June 
17, sources close to the investigation said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, law enforcement sources said the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Internal Affairs Division has launched an investigation into a senior police 
officer who apparently bought the gun that Simpson carried during the low-speed 
chase through Orange County and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The passport and the cash intrigue investigators because they could undermine 
the former football star's contention -- outlined in a letter read shortly 
after he disappeared -- that he was distraught and planning to kill himself 
when he failed to surrender as promised to authorities. The passport and the 
money could suggest that Simpson's real motive was to flee, investigators and 
other observers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources refused to say if they had information about when 
Simpson withdrew the money or about how he came to have the gun on the day he 
disappeared before he was spotted on Interstate 5 in Orange County. Those facts 
could prove significant in attempting to assess his motives that afternoon, 
legal experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's motive is important, they said, because evidence of flight to avoid 
prosecution can be introduced in a criminal trial to suggest that a defendant 
had "consciousness of guilt." It therefore could be used to bolster the 
prosecution's contention that Simpson murdered his ex-wife, Nicole Brown 
Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this evidence exists, it's very powerful for the prosecution because you 
don't take a passport to a suicide, and $10,000 is a lot of walking-around 
cash," said John Wiley, a UCLA law professor and former federal prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley, who cautioned that he is not privy to evidence of the cash or the 
passport, noted that a set of jury instructions deals with destroying evidence, 
intimidating witnesses and fleeing. If deemed appropriate, those instructions 
can be read to the jury by the judge in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such instructions allow jurors to infer guilt from a defendant's 
actions, jurors are not required to draw those inferences. They are only 
permitted to do so if they feel that the inferences are appropriate to the case 
they are considering. Nevertheless, the instruction can weigh heavily against 
defendants, Wiley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's powerful stuff," Wiley said, "because it's coming from the judge, not 
the lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lead attorney, Robert L. Shapiro, could not be reached for comment 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun that was in Simpson's possession was registered to Earl C. Paysinger, 
a highly respected Metropolitan Division lieutenant who works in the mounted 
unit, sources said, but was purchased about five years ago. Paysinger, who 
holds an off-duty job as a private security guard for Los Angeles Raiders owner 
Al Davis, has told investigators that he bought the gun for Simpson as part of 
a job that he once had providing security for the famous athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 If that story is correct, the officer probably broke no laws and probably 
would not face serious discipline, sources said. They added that investigators 
are looking into whether Paysinger had sought to help Simpson avoid a waiting 
period on the purchase of a handgun; if so, that could expose the lieutenant to 
disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't comment on any of the evidence in this case," Cmdr. David J. Gascon 
said Wednesday. "But yes, we are indeed conducting an internal affairs 
investigation relative to issues involving the weapon in Mr. Simpson's 
possession at the time of arrest." 
</P>
<P>
 Gascon refused to confirm or deny that Paysinger is the subject of the 
internal investigation, saying the matter would be handled confidentially, as 
are all LAPD personnel inquiries. Paysinger, a 17-year veteran of the 
department who is described by colleagues as an exemplary officer, was not 
available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest disclosures in the closely watched case also could figure in 
whether prosecutors decide to bring criminal charges against Al Cowlings, 
Simpson's longtime friend and former teammate. Cowlings was behind the wheel 
during the nationally televised police pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, police booked him on suspicion of aiding a felony fugitive. 
He posted $250,000 bail and has been free since. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his attorney, Cowlings has said he was not trying to help Simpson flee 
but was trying to keep his lifelong friend from committing suicide. If evidence 
suggests that Simpson's real motive was to flee, however, that could undermine 
Cowlings' defense as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors received the Cowlings case from LAPD detectives Tuesday but 
deferred announcing a decision on whether to bring charges. They are expected 
to announce their decision by Friday, when Cowlings is scheduled to appear in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 As both sides prepare for what appears to be a fast-approaching trial -- 
Simpson's attorneys have indicated that they hope to be ready by late September 
-- much attention has focused on DNA tests that are being done in an attempt to 
pinpoint whether blood recovered from the scene of the crime and from Simpson's 
estate matches samples taken from him and from the two victims. Some of the 
preliminary tests are completed, sources said, and continue to point to Simpson 
as a probable source of blood droplets found at the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary tests are not admissible in court, however, and final test 
results are still days or weeks away. Simpson's legal team has been attending 
recent testing and may challenge the DNA results, either by arguing that the 
tests were improperly performed or by contending that DNA tests are inherently 
unreliable and should not be used in the trial.

A CEO FINDS GOVERNMENT NOT EAGER TO BE REINVENTED; REFORM: SOUTHLAND EXECUTIVE 
ARRIVED AT U.S. AGENCY FULL OF IDEAS. A POLITICAL RUDE AWAKENING WAS IN STORE.

<P>
 It all seemed to come crashing down one night last March when Roger Johnson 
walked into his Georgetown living room and just stood there. He couldn't 
remember feeling more alone -- bewildered, really. The cold outside was bitter, 
the worst in anyone's memory. Three thousand miles away stood his seaside dream 
house, where the warm shores of Laguna Beach were his back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 What was he doing here, anyway, closed up in this four-story silo of a house 
in Washington, a city so insanely ambitious that people compete to leave the 
office last and it's a badge of honor never to see your kids? 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson had come to the nation's capital as the highest-ranking Republican on 
the Clinton team, tapped by the President himself. His assignment was to run 
the General Services Administration, seen by some as the Keystone Cop of 
federal agencies, a place so bound in red tape that it concocted nine pages of 
rules for the simple task of buying an ashtray. 
</P>
<P>
 What he found was a Washington more daunting than he could have imagined, 
where backbiting, put-downs, suspicion and half-truths seemed a way of life. 
Not in 35 years as a businessman had he been treated this way. That March night 
he came close to quitting. This wasn't the way it was supposed to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Janice, I've never felt so alone," he told his wife of 37 years. "I'm to the 
point where I don't think I can trust anyone in this town." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a savvy CEO who had turned a foundering Irvine computer firm into a 
Fortune 500 company, had come to Washington in 1993 with visions of 
"reinventing government." He would lend his expertise to the American people, 
whip a wasteful agency into shape and give something back to his country in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he was beginning to wonder. Someone in his office seemed to be leaking 
false information about him. He fired two people as a result. The press began 
scrutinizing his expense vouchers, forcing him to explain trips back to Orange 
County. Some members of Congress branded him the worst combination of uppity 
and stupid -- Mr. Johnson Goes to Washington -- another pain-in-the-neck 
newcomer bent on fixing the bureaucracy and screwing things up. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to shake up the federal government," one critic later gloated. "He 
got his (rear end) kicked. Badly." 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to Johnson was less a question of administrative talent than a 
clash of cultures. East Coast political meets West Coast corporate. In the 
comforting arms of Irvine's Western Digital Corp., CEO Johnson gave an order, 
the order was followed, the problem was fixed and everybody was happy. But in 
Congress, CEOs looking for slaps on the back sometimes get kicks in the pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting personally attacked, and I couldn't figure out why. I've spent 
35 years mostly getting patted on the head. I thought of leaving. I had some 
good people around who got me through this," Johnson said in a recent 
interview, looking comfortable at long last in his cavernous navy blue office, 
the mystery of Washington clearer to him now. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, he has even able to joke about it. "There's more than a three-hour 
time difference here. I think I found Atlantis." 
</P>
<P>
 As the story goes, Roger Johnson was so disillusioned with the state of the 
economy under President George Bush that he once told a newspaper reporter 
something to this effect: If a Democrat would give him a reason, Johnson would 
vote for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton, then little more than an asterisk in the polls, called him up 
and gave him one. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was a member of the powerful Lincoln Club, a group of moneyed Orange 
County Republicans who fuel GOP candidates and causes. For one of such an 
exclusive coterie to support a Democrat was unprecedented. But Johnson and 
seven other powerful Orange County Republicans shocked the nation by 
withdrawing their support from Bush and throwing it to Bill Clinton. The Orange 
Eight, as they would be remembered, decided to announce their allegiance to 
Clinton on Aug. 21, 1992, at a news conference in Newport Beach's Pacific Club, 
a bastion of Republicanism where Bush and Ronald Reagan were often feted. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton made a steady rise in the polls and Johnson came to genuinely admire 
him, not as Bush's lesser evil but as a visionary in his own right, he said. 
Election Night was heady stuff. Headier still was the day the new President 
named Johnson to head the GSA, an appointment "beyond my wildest dreams," he 
said then. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington society embraced him and his wife. But through it all there 
persisted a hostile undercurrent that said living in the public eye would not 
be simple. Back in Orange County, the Republican establishment was plenty mad. 
Janice Johnson was shunned at some lunches. At one reception, a local 
Republican notable referred to Janice Johnson and one of the Orange Eight -- 
Irvine developer Kathryn G. Thompson -- as "turncoats." When a local Boy Scout 
group decided to honor Roger Johnson at its annual fund-raiser, bitter 
Republicans staged a boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 And this was just the start. 
</P>
<P>
 No one had to tell Roger Johnson that the GSA administrator post was not the 
flashiest job on the Hill, even if the agency does employ nearly 20,000 workers 
and oversees $60 billion a year in government spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as the government's Wal-Mart, the GSA is its phone company, car buyer, 
supply warehouse and purchaser of almost everything the bureaucracy requires, 
from personal computers to pencils. Linked together, a year's supply of GSA 
paper clips would extend halfway around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 What someone did neglect to tell Johnson, however, was that he was taking over 
an agency dogged by one of the worst reputations in the federal government. It 
had gone through 17 administrators in 23 years; the average staying just 18 
months. It employed one supervisor for every four employees. Congress had 
repeatedly criticized it for failing to prevent or detect waste, fraud and 
abuse. Auditors concluded that its ineffective procurement policies were 
costing the government millions in cost overruns. GSA folklore was rife with 
stories like the one about the Navy commander who planned to buy a $79 vacuum 
cleaner until the GSA insisted he get the $348 model. Johnson walked into a 
department that, just a year before, had somehow lost track of 236 federal 
aircraft it was supposed to manage. 
</P>
<P>
 As a CEO, Johnson could cut at least 10% out of any annual budget. As GSA 
chief, opportunities to trim and streamline seemed to be leaping out at him. 
Why lease a federal building for decades when it is cheaper to build? Why tear 
down a veterans' hospital in one end of town only to build a military hospital 
in another? 
</P>
<P>
 He had come onto the scene raring to reinvent. He cut $1.2 billion in waste 
out of nearly 200 planned federal construction and leasing projects. He worked 
with Vice President Al Gore on the National Performance Review, a study that 
spotlighted the now-infamous nine-page ashtray instructions. He ordered all 
federal law enforcement agencies to destroy surplus and outmoded firearms 
rather than sell them to gun dealers, reversing a policy that in the past 10 
years had put more than 60,000 weapons on the streets. He forged a unique 
partnership with the GSA's two largest labor unions. He held round-table 
discussions asking the demoralized GSA staff how they thought things could be 
done better. He kept his promise to downsize the department without a single 
layoff. He helped lead the way in reforming how the government buys things and 
coined a new motto for efficiency: "better, cheaper, faster, easier, smarter or 
not at all." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotta give the guy an A for effort," Harry Dawson, president of American 
Federation of Government Employees Council 236 -- one of two labor unions that 
represent GSA workers -- said with cautious praise, noting that grievances have 
fallen as much as 80% since Johnson came on board. "It's too early to tell how 
this will end, but so far, I think, Roger Johnson is the best administrator 
we've seen in 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
 But the voices of praise seemed lost in a thunder of criticism. Some 
Republicans didn't trust Johnson because he supported a Democrat, and some 
Democrats didn't like him because he remained a registered Republican. Hateful 
newsletters, anonymously written, were landing on his desk. If one union leader 
lauded him, another demanded he resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all, Johnson's grand plans for change -- which had the enthusiastic 
backing of the President and vice president -- had overlooked one detail: 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, he was the bull in the federal china closet -- cocky, rushing 
to change an agency he had not taken the time to figure out, and neglecting to 
inform Congress, where six major committees are authorized to oversee what the 
GSA does. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was accused by members of the House Judiciary Committee of keeping 
secrets from Congress, of attempting to unravel the agency he was supposed to 
run. Members hollered at him. Government Computer News, a Washington-area trade 
publication, ran an editorial cartoon of an astonished-looking Johnson emerging 
from the hearing with his severed head in his hands. "Mr. Johnson Goes To 
Washington," read the caption. 
</P>
<P>
 He seemed to be taking all of it personally. His asthma worsened, aggravated 
by stress. He had trouble sleeping. His sense of humor faded. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter passed. Cherry blossoms burst into bloom everywhere. Janice Johnson 
found a Georgetown home built in 1811, with a master bedroom addition, circa 
1840. Her husband apologized to Congress, assuring members that he had no 
secret plan to reorganize the agency and promising to keep them informed. In 
recent weeks, even his harshest enemies seemed to be turning around, crediting 
him with an attitude adjustment and acknowledging that some of his ideas might 
even be good. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the problem, Johnson acknowledges now as he searches for what went 
wrong, was simple miscommunication. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the only Fortune 500 guy around here," he said. "I was saying things and 
using words that have completely different meaning in government. I would say 
this agency needs to be competitive. That was read that I intended to dismantle 
it and privatize it. I was talking about finding out what we are doing that's 
good and what we are doing that's not good." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson calls upon the electorate to send to Washington more lawmakers who 
understand a profit and loss sheet. The trouble, he said, is not the nine pages 
of specifications required to buy an ashtray, but the culture that produced the 
nine pages in the first place. "There is no room left in this town for 
reasonable judgment. The town is paranoid about making mistakes and the process 
has taken over for common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the GSA headquarters at 18th and F streets, Johnson slips into his 
chauffeur-driven Chrysler New Yorker. If there is one thing he wants to make 
clear, it's that he has more admiration for the President and the First Lady 
than he did the day he endorsed Clinton. Clearly, this government job pays him 
a fraction of the money he was earning in private life. He just turned 60 and 
could be sailing in the Pacific with his wife at one side and a margarita at 
the other. He stayed on to serve the President. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think more today than I did 2 1/2 years ago that he is a person of great 
vision, of extremely good intentions, he and Hillary both." 
</P>
<P>
 With his sights reset, Johnson has moved forward, calling most recently for a 
review of government building contracts. The investigation will likely make 
some waves, but he has grown accustomed to boats rocking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I walked through hell and came out the other side -- a little burned, 
but not fatally," he says. "I came here thinking that on a scale of 1 to 10 I 
could achieve a 7. I now think if I achieve a 1, I probably should be sainted." 
</P>
<P>
 After a lunch at the White House, he grabs a couple of boxes of M & M's and 
offers an informal tour. There is something stimulating about just being here, 
off the path of the public tours. The baptism was hell, but watching him stroll 
the quiet corridors that Lincoln walked, one wonders if he wouldn't do it all 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't put down your right hand or left foot around here without touching 
history," Johnson says, smiling contentedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," he decides. "It's been worth it." Profile: Roger Johnson

COURT INVALIDATES '92 WELFARE CUTS; FINANCE: FEDERAL APPEALS PANEL SAYS IMPACT 
ON STATE'S POOR WAS NOT CONSIDERED. IF THE RULING IS UPHELD, IT COULD NULLIFY 
SUBSEQUENT CUTBACKS AND WORSEN BUDGET CRISIS. 
</P>

<P>
 In a decision that could have repercussions across the nation and muddy the 
state of California's budget picture, a federal appeals court on Wednesday 
invalidated millions of dollars in California welfare cuts, saying government 
officials had failed to consider the hardship they would impose on poor 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-1 ruling by a panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San 
Francisco said the Bush Administration violated federal law in 1992 when it 
approved the cuts without investigating the potential impact on the 2.7 million 
Californians who receive welfare payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing for the majority, Judge Alfred Goodwin said there was clear evidence 
that the benefit reductions would put many segments of the welfare population 
at "increased risk of homelessness, inadequate nutrition, and a variety of 
emotional and physical problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling applied specifically to a portion of the 5.8% reduction in Aid to 
Families With Dependent Children benefits that was imposed Dec. 1, 1992. But 
lawyers on both sides of the issue said it could also nullify a further 2.7% 
reduction approved last year and a 2.3% cut scheduled to go into effect in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, if it is upheld on appeal to the full 9th Circuit Court, could 
spark another budget crisis for the state's already hard-pressed treasury. A 
consultant for the Assembly's budget-writing Ways and Means Committee said the 
decision could cost the state between $125 million and $130 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for Gov. Pete Wilson declined to say what their next move would be, 
but they are expected to try to delay any potential impact on the state budget 
by requesting that the issue be heard by all 11 judges on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-judge panel did not specifically order that benefits be raised, but 
advocates for the poor said they believed restoration of benefits would be the 
ultimate result, if the ruling survives further challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some policy makers have felt there are no limits when they want to 
balance the budget by reducing living standards of poor families. . . . I think 
this decision will set a much stricter standard for that," said Casey McKeever, 
an attorney for the Western Center on Law and Poverty, which sued the state and 
federal governments on behalf of welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor, who said he was still reviewing the decision, predicted that 
other programs for the poor would suffer if the state is eventually required to 
restore welfare benefits. Specifically, he said, it would affect programs that 
provide incentives for adult aid recipients to work and for teen-age welfare 
recipients to stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "If, in fact, the result of this decision is to deprive thousands of 
California families of the dignity of work and the opportunity to better their 
lives through participation in programs like (these), that would be a terrible 
tragedy for California," Wilson said through a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was clearly a setback for Wilson, who has spearheaded the move to 
cut welfare benefits since taking office in 1991, contending that the 
reductions would serve as incentives for benefit recipients to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature refused to cut benefits as deeply as the governor requested 
but complied each year with his request for some reductions. In 1991, lawmakers 
lowered grants by 4.4%, in 1992 by 5.8%, in 1993 by 2.7% and this year, by 
2.3%. For a family of three, that meant the maximum cash benefit had dropped 
from $694 a month in 1991 to $593, the level that was set to go into effect in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law, however, forbade cutting benefits below the level of May 1, 1988, 
unless federal officials specifically agreed to waive the legal requirements. 
In California, for a typical welfare family of three, the May, 1988, benefits 
provided a maximum cash grant of $633 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson Administration made a formal request for the required federal 
waiver, contending that the cuts would allow the state to test the validity of 
its theory that welfare reductions would encourage recipients to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bush Administration not only approved the cut, but gave California 
permission for additional reductions of 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for the poor challenged the Bush Administration's approval, arguing 
that such "human experiments" could not be allowed under federal law if they 
caused undue hardship. And the California welfare cuts, they contended, would 
cause extreme hardship, especially for welfare families in which the adults 
could not find work or were disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate court agreed and overruled a decision by U.S. District Judge 
David Levi of Sacramento that had upheld the state's position. Advocates for 
the poor, wrote Judge Goodwin, "have indisputably shown that California's 
experiment has serious problems both as an experiment and as an attempt at 
welfare reform . . . given the minimum level of benefits already paid to AFDC 
families, it is difficult to imagine that the benefits cut would radically 
change the existing incentives to work." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeever said the ruling could revolutionize the way waivers of federal law 
are approved. If the ruling is upheld, he said, it would also force courts in 
other states to nullify welfare cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the court's decision begins to bring back the purpose of the waiver 
authority from a mere attempt to evade the law to more genuine attempts to 
improve the operation of the welfare system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some lawmakers have viewed the waiver authority as an open season on the 
safety net for the poor and the court's decision, I think, places enormous 
limits on the ability to avoid federal laws that protect minimal living 
standards for the poor."

BISHOPS ATTACK ABORTION COVERAGE IN HEALTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN and KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's Roman Catholic bishops Wednesday announced a massive grass-roots 
campaign to eliminate abortion coverage from health care reform legislation, 
saying that they are willing to sacrifice their longtime support for universal 
coverage -- and fight against reform -- if Congress includes abortions in a 
standard benefits package. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot compromise on this," Bishop James T. McHugh of Camden, N.J., said 
at a press conference here. 
</P>
<P>
 The mobilization of millions of church members to call and write their 
representatives deals another blow to the prospects of significant 
congressional action on health care reform this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The bishops' announcement was made as the Times Mirror Center for the People & 
the Press released a poll that found that the public opposes abortion coverage 
in a federally guaranteed benefits package by a margin of 68% to 26%. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement and the poll served as a reminder that President Clinton is 
fighting an uphill battle on multiple fronts, each made up of shifting 
alliances that support him on some issues but oppose him on others. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, with the notable exception of abortion coverage, Clinton's 
reform agenda and that of the Catholic Health Assn. are remarkably similar. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the bishops' news conference, abortion-rights activists vowed to 
step up their fight for mandatory coverage, noting that abortions are already 
covered by most private insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't support a plan that takes us backwards, that marginalizes women," 
said Rep. Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.). 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has made a similar argument, but the extent to which the 
President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton are prepared to fight to 
preserve abortion coverage is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 They signaled their awareness that abortion looms as a potential health care 
deal-breaker last month when Hillary Clinton publicly backed off from her 
previous unequivocal support for mandatory abortion coverage by saying that it 
is "very difficult to tell exactly" how the issue will be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 In letters to Democratic congressional leaders who are now trying to fashion a 
compromise health care reform bill in each chamber for a floor vote, the 
bishops made clear their unyielding opposition to any requirement that health 
care plans provide for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We promise our vigorous opposition to any legislation that includes them," 
said the letter, copies of which were sent to Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.). 
</P>
<P>
 The letter was signed by Archbishop William H. Keeler of Baltimore, president 
of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops; Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los 
Angeles, chairman of the conference's Pro-Life Committee; and Bishop John H. 
Ricard of Baltimore, chairman of the conference's Domestic Policy Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 They said mandatory abortion coverage would "force millions of employers, 
churches, and individuals to subsidize abortion in violation of their 
consciences." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a proposed increase in the tobacco tax, abortion coverage poses a tough 
challenge for Mitchell and Foley. To pass comprehensive health care reform, 
they must come up with ways to finesse each issue in order to maximize support 
among lawmakers with deeply held convictions, whose support seems vital if 
there is to be reform. 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, abortion-rights advocates released a letter, signed by 72 
House members, calling on Foley to keep abortion coverage in the health care 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that certain health care benefits should not be covered if some 
people find them politically, morally or religiously unacceptable defeats the 
whole idea of comprehensive health care," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Implicit in such rhetoric is the threat by many members that they will vote 
against health care reform, depending on whether abortion coverage is or is not 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts were skeptical of such threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, for most members, there is no single issue that's worth risking 
the social legislation of a generation," said Edward F. Howard, head of the 
Alliance for Health Reform, a nonpartisan educational group here. "I just don't 
know how many members there are who will stake out a single issue and then go 
over the cliff for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Health care lobbyist Bruce Fried, whose clients have included the Catholic 
Health Assn., which represents 1,200 Catholic health facilities, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inclusion or exclusion of abortion services will not ultimately determine 
whether there's health care reform," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some abortion-rights advocates privately conceded that they may have to accept 
something less than a blanket guarantee of coverage. A potential compromise 
might be a conscience clause allowing employers who oppose abortion to opt out 
of covering it, as well as a similar escape clause for medical providers -- 
provisions that are already in some of the plans passed by various committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although abortion coverage is now included in the vast majority of health 
insurance plans under the rubric of "pregnancy-related services," Helen Alvare, 
the bishops conference planning director, argued that inclusion of abortion 
coverage in a universal benefits package would go far beyond existing practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The status quo is this: Abortion is legal. Anyone is free to buy abortion 
coverage or to buy a policy that excludes it," Alvare said. "But when you make 
abortion coverage a mandatory benefit, you dramatically depart from the status 
quo." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the mobilization effort, Alvare said, 5 million church members have already 
sent cards to members of Congress urging the exclusion of abortion coverage. 
The conference now will urge the signers to remobilize and talk and write to 
their elected representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference also has prepared radio and television ads that "we'll use when 
we decide we need to," Alvare said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bishops also released data from a survey commissioned by the conference, 
which found that while 70% of the public favors universal coverage, 65% oppose 
"taxpayer subsidized abortion coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 In the survey by the Times Mirror Center, respondents were read a list of six 
services -- basic hospital and physician coverage, long-term care, abortion, 
prescription costs, preventive services and psychological or psychiatric 
counseling -- and asked which should be included in a basic health benefits 
package. 
</P>
<P>
 All the services got positive responses of 68% or more except abortion, which 
was favored by 26%. When doctors were read the same list, they said all the 
services should be included. They favored inclusion of abortion, however, by 
only a margin of 52% to 43%. All other services were favored by at least 69%.

NEW CURRENCY AIMS TO COUNTER COUNTERFEITERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fearful of the skills and machinery of high-tech counterfeiters, the Treasury 
Department announced Wednesday the first major redesign of U.S. currency since 
1929, unveiling plans for a new $100 bill with an off-center, and much larger, 
portrait of Benjamin Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised C-note will be available starting in 1996, with new bills for 
smaller denominations issued later. By the year 2000, new versions of all bills 
from $1 to $100 will be in circulation. All will have the same color and 
feature the same historic people as the current greenbacks. But the portraits 
will be 50% larger. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bills are designed to thwart advances in computer printers and copying 
machines. "Access to a variety of technologically advanced equipment has 
resulted in a significant increase in the general quality of counterfeit 
currency," Guy Caputo, deputy director of the Secret Service, told the House 
Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 On the $100 bill, Franklin's face will be moved to the left by one-half to 
three-quarters of an inch, leaving room for an embedded thread, which can be 
seen with magnification to spell out "USA 100," and a watermark portrait of 
Franklin that will be visible when the bill is held up to the light. A new type 
of green ink will appear to turn gold as the bill is handled or viewed from 
another angle. 
</P>
<P>
 The new $100 bill will be printed with a technique called moire-generating 
patterns. Lines on the bill appear straight to the human eye. But when the bill 
is put through a copying machine, the resulting counterfeit lines will be wavy. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury and Federal Reserve officials emphasized that all $100 bills now in 
circulation will remain legal and insisted that there are no plans to recall 
any of the current $100 bills, although they are heavily used by drug dealers, 
smugglers and organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "All genuine United States currency now in circulation, whenever issued, is 
legal tender and should continue to be legal tender," Edward W. Kelley Jr., a 
member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the biggest threat to the safety of U.S. currency comes from 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50%, and perhaps as much as 60%, of the $357 billion in U.S. 
currency in circulation is held outside the United States, Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Secret Service works closely with foreign governments, and more than $120 
million in counterfeit U.S. bills was seized abroad last year, compared with 
just $44 million in bad bills in the United States, Caputo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad $100 bills are so common in the Middle East that many merchants demand 
$120 when someone gives them a $100 bill, to cover potential losses from 
counterfeits, said Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), a member of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The governments of Iran and Syria, as well as Middle Eastern terrorist groups, 
are distributing high-quality counterfeit $100 bills, says a report by a 
terrorism task force of the House Republican Research Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Caputo refused to respond directly to Republican members' questions about the 
so-called super bill, an excellent ersatz version of the $100 bill allegedly 
being printed at the Iranian government mint in Tehran at the rate of $1 
billion a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any conclusive evidence at this point" of any foreign 
government producing counterfeit U.S. currency, Caputo said. The growing threat 
of quality counterfeits has forced the Clinton Administration to take major 
steps to revise the currency design for the first time since 1929, when the 
standard Federal Reserve note shapes, sizes and denominations were established. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, responding to better color copiers, the Federal Reserve began issuing 
a new series of $100 and $50 bills containing a security thread and a 
microprint reading "The United States of America" around the border of the 
portrait, with the type too small to be read without a magnifier and too 
indistinct to show up in a copy reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
 As older bills move from commercial banks to Federal Reserve banks, they are 
replaced with the new series of bills. More than 80% of the $100 and $50 bills 
circulating in the United States are now the new version. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 1990 series of bills can defeat counterfeiting on most current 
color copiers, the Treasury was eager to anticipate the next generation of 
technology, and officials decided to take more radical steps by changing the 
basic look of the currency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of its enduring value and worldwide acceptability, the dollar will 
always be a target of counterfeiters," Treasury Undersecretary Frank N. Newman 
said at the hearing. "We must take steps now . . . to address a threat that 
will increase as technology improves. That is what our program is all about -- 
attacking the future technological threat before it fully evolves." 
</P>
<P>
 The detailed design and production plan for the new $100 bill will be 
completed next year, with the bills printed and issued in 1996. The lesser 
denomination bills will then be issued in intervals of six months to a year, 
and all bills should be circulating by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the pictures on the new currency of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln 
and Alexander Hamilton will be twice as big as they are now, the government 
will prepare new engravings filled with more fine lines and details. The 
pictures will be easily recognizable to the public, but harder for 
counterfeiters to reproduce. New portraits will still be serious and 
statesmanlike. 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't see a grinning Ben Franklin," a Treasury official said. New Design 
to Target Fakes 
</P>
<P>
 Among the likely changes the Treasury Department is considering: 
</P>
<P>
 Larger portraits: For more detailed engraving 
</P>
<P>
 Portrait moved off-center: To make room for a watermark 
</P>
<P>
 Machine-detectable threads: Embedded in the paper, positioned by denomination 
</P>
<P>
 Iridescent Discs: Colored discs only a few millimeters wide that reflect light 
</P>
<P>
 Color-shifting ink: Would appear green when viewed straight on and gold from 
an angle 
</P>
<P>
 Computer-designed patterns: Turn wavy when illicitly copied 
</P>
<P>
 Watermark: Smaller version of the portrait visible only when a bill is held to 
the light

 President Clinton pledged relief funds to flood-ravaged areas of southern 
Georgia Wednesday as his Administration also proposed new flood-control 
measures aimed at accommodating rather than dominating nature. 
</P>
<P>
 The new federal policies, if approved by Congress and carried out by the 
states, would accomplish a sharp break with two centuries of federal 
flood-control efforts. Instead of relying primarily on dikes, dams and levees 
to keep rivers in their places, the government would emphasize keeping people 
out of the way of floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The policies would do so by restoring wetlands, encouraging homes and 
businesses to move out of flood plains and requiring those who do build in 
flood-prone areas to buy expensive insurance and reduce future relief costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, on a one-day visit to tour waterlogged areas of Georgia, promised 
quick federal assistance for flood victims in Georgia, Alabama and Florida, a 
minimum of $60 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the 
departments of Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Agriculture and 
Labor. 
</P>
<P>
 The President said more money would be released once the floodwaters recede 
and a full accounting of the damage can be made. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is to help people put their lives back together," he 
said after his tour. "This is a very serious disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed policies could have an impact on flood-control planning and 
river-side development across the nation, including parts of Southern 
California. Some of the programs, including one that encourages farmers to 
return filled-in wetlands to their natural state, are already in place, 
although their funding has been in question. 
</P>
<P>
 Other proposals would require congressional action, including one to 
reactivate a "water resources council" to coordinate federal and state policies 
and those of Native American tribes. If more people in flood zones are to be 
encouraged to buy flood insurance, as recommended, state and federal 
governments will have to work cooperatively with private insurance firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals are part of the report of an interagency task force that Clinton 
created after last summer's devastating floods in the Midwest. Those floods 
caused more than $12 billion in damage and 38 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, heavy rains following Tropical Storm Alberto have covered parts 
of Georgia, Alabama and Florida and have destroyed millions of dollars worth of 
property, forced tens of thousands of people from their homes and killed more 
than two dozen people. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Southern flooding is only about one-tenth the size of the massive 
Midwestern deluge, the devastation has been amplified by the widespread poverty 
in many of the rural areas now under water -- counties that have some of the 
lowest per capita incomes in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has made a major effort to improve the federal government's response 
to natural disasters, repeatedly visiting disaster sites and pressing for rapid 
action on disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the American people can't depend on their government to handle emergencies 
right, then it's hard to imagine how they could trust us to do anything right," 
Clinton said as he opened a meeting on flood relief with Georgia Gov. Zell 
Miller, Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles, Alabama Gov. Jim Folsom and other area 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, dressed in a short-sleeved plaid shirt and chino slacks, toured the 
flooded area by motorcade and helicopter, abandoning his usual black limousine 
for a bulletproof gray Chevy Suburban van. He viewed the swollen Flint River, 
which has covered schools, houses and thousands of acres of crops. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that this will not be done overnight," Clinton said as he presented 
the money to the governors. "We will stay till the job is done." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the lingering effects of such floods were underscored by the 
committee that reported Wednesday to Clinton on the Midwest flood. Some 100,000 
homes were damaged by that deluge and the financial impact on businesses and 
the loss to the federal government's tax revenues cannot yet be calculated, the 
committee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Floods of such magnitude, the committee warned, will happen again. Federal and 
state governments, it added, must act not just to respond to such disasters but 
to reduce the human and economic tolls of future floods. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of its potentially most controversial proposals, the committee urged 
the federal government to limit the amount of disaster assistance that flood 
victims would get if they do not purchase flood insurance. If put in place, 
such a measure would hamstring presidents as they descend upon disaster areas 
such as Georgia, where poor communities in flood-prone areas go largely without 
flood insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also called for the Army Corps of Engineers -- the federal 
agency most responsible for structural flood-control measures such as dams and 
levees -- to rewrite its guidelines so that environmental considerations are 
balanced against economic ones. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Corps' planning for the rehabilitation of burst levees along the 
Mississippi River, the Army engineers "should consider land acquisition as an 
alternative" to rebuilding structures designed to hold rivers back, the 
committee urged. 
</P>
<P>
 Such proposals won praise from American Rivers, an environmental group that 
has pressed for restoration of wetlands and for lesser reliance on levees and 
dams. Partly because of Clinton Administration actions, more than 5,000 flooded 
homes and businesses throughout the Midwest have been moved from harm's way 
since last summer's flood. Under an emergency program designed to increase the 
region's natural ability to absorb downpours, more than 100,000 acres of 
flood-plain farmland will be voluntarily converted into wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 But one analyst said Wednesday that Clinton's actions in Georgia appear to 
contradict the message sent by his Administration's latest report and by the 
Administration's actions in the wake of the Midwest floods. 
</P>
<P>
 "By giving out disaster relief with no strings attached in Georgia, Clinton is 
rewarding people for poor land-use decisions," said Scott Faber, director of 
flood-plain programs for American Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about people who've just lost everything -- and it's hard for 
a politician not to want to open the government's coffers to them. But it's a 
question of how you provide that help, how do you tailor it. We have to make 
sure we make disaster-relief policy that reduces our relief costs later."

CANDIDATE NOW OPPOSES RAIL BOND MEASURE HE WROTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual twist, the author of a $1-billion rail bond act is now opposing 
his own proposal and seeking to have it removed from the statewide election 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno), in the midst of a spirited state Senate 
campaign, is urging Gov. Pete Wilson to delay the vote on Proposition 181 until 
1996, a request that the governor thus far has opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the governor released Wednesday, Costa cited the state's 
"current economic situation and the voters' opposition to increased bond debt" 
for his reversal. In the June primary, voters rejected four bond measures. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, Costa and other lawmakers have grown increasingly wary of 
putting new spending proposals before voters. Last week, on the eve of the 
summer legislative recess, Costa sought to rally lawmakers to reschedule the 
rail proposal, which would pay for rights of way and intercity trains. 
</P>
<P>
 When his last-minute bid failed, Costa complained that Wilson's opposition 
"made it impossible to remove the bond measure" before lawmakers left town. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa has played a role in funding rail projects since 1989, when he sponsored 
a law that placed rail bonds on the ballot in 1990, 1992 and 1994. Voters 
passed the first proposal but rejected the second bond in 1992, creating a 
$1-billion backlog in transportation projects, Costa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kranhold, a spokesman for the governor, said that when voters approved 
the 1990 bond, they also agreed to place the two other rail proposals on future 
ballots. He said Wilson does not want to tamper with that earlier decision and 
remove Costa's bond from the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond election comes at a particularly sensitive moment for Costa. He is 
trying to unseat first-term state Sen. Phil Wyman (R-Tehachapi) in the 
conservative San Joaquin Valley's 16th Senate District. Costa lost to Wyman in 
a hotly contested 1993 special election. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news release, Wyman suggested that Costa was changing his mind on the 
bond because "it wasn't a good idea to have his name connected to another $1 
billion in red ink in November." 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Gladstein, a Costa campaign consultant, said Costa now plans to vote 
against his own proposal if it remains on the November ballot. However, she 
denied that Costa has changed his mind about rail bonds because of politics, 
maintaining that he believes that it is not the right time for the state to 
take on more debt to pay for rail projects.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; WILSON POLICY PUT BOND RATING AT RISK, BROWN 
SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown returned from Wall Street on Wednesday to 
declare -- in her role as Democratic candidate for his job -- that there is 
only so much she can do in her current official capacity to "rescue" Republican 
Gov. Pete Wilson from the impact of a $7-billion cash flow problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four years of Pete Wilson's fiscal and economic mismanagement have turned the 
Golden State into the IOU state, and America's promised land into the land of 
broken promises -- a sad day for California," Brown, the Democratic candidate 
for governor, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was one of several state officials meeting with investors and 
bond-rating agencies in New York this week in an effort to persuade them not to 
downgrade California's current AA bond classification. A downgrading would lead 
to higher interest rates paid by the state on its borrowing and dim the allure 
of its financial instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown fears that a fourth year of deficit budgeting by Wilson will lead 
Moody's, one of the three major bond-rating agencies, to drop California's 
level to among the lowest of all the states, she said in a news conference held 
just off the floor of the Pacific Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I always have endeavored to do as state treasurer is to state the facts 
and nothing but the facts," Brown said of her role in the annual New York 
sessions. "I have not endeavored to defend the governor's budget. The 
Department of Finance is there to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown did, however, embrace a suggestion by a radio news reporter that her own 
plan for financing California's $3 billion in long-term debt was similar to 
that used by former Republican Gov. George Deukmejian, Wilson's immediate 
predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 "George Deukmejian came into office and said he had inherited an IOU state and 
he would make it an A-OK state," she said. "He did bring California to an A-OK 
status and four years of Pete Wilson has brought this state to its knees -- 
from a AAA state and an A-OK to IOU and down to the bottom of where states are 
ranked nationally among the credit agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 That was only part of the story, however. In the final year of Deukmejian's 
second term, the recession and defense budget cutbacks slammed the California 
economy and plunged the California budget into the red again. 
</P>
<P>
 By January, 1991, when Wilson had to submit his first budget -- and the last 
Deukmejian budget was still in force -- California faced a multibillion-dollar 
deficit. That deficit ultimately was resolved in part through spending cuts and 
a massive tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 A current Brown-for-governor campaign ad is critical of that tax increase, 
opening with an announcer saying, "The Wilson Years: tax hikes, IOUs, now this 
-- $7 billion in borrowing." 
</P>
<P>
 In a response to Brown's ad on Wednesday, the Wilson reelection campaign 
issued a statement saying, without mentioning Deukmejian: "Pete Wilson 
inherited the biggest state budget deficit in American history . . . Gov. 
Wilson balanced the budget despite these enormous challenges." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement also quoted from an Aug. 20, 1991, letter from Treasurer Brown 
to Wilson: "It is clear that it was your good work in providing a prudent, 
balanced budget under extremely difficult fiscal circumstances that enabled the 
(rating) agencies to affirm our creditworthiness. You demonstrated the 
political will to address our budget problem with meaningful reforms." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's own finance plan calls for refinancing the ongoing state debt over a 
five-year period with the sale of bonds to be paid off partly by continuing a 
temporary income tax surcharge on the state's wealthiest taxpayers and by more 
spending reductions.

JUDGE AWARDS $700,000 IN HIKER'S DEATH; COURTS: FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ORDERED 
TO PAY A TOTAL OF $1 MILLION TO THREE OTHERS INJURED WHEN LIGHTNING STRUCK A 
HUT ON MT. WHITNEY. DESPITE PREVIOUS INCIDENTS, NO WARNING SIGN HAD BEEN 
ERECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A judge has ordered the federal government to pay $700,000 to the family of a 
Huntington Beach hiker who died during a lightning storm at the summit of Mt. 
Whitney in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew E. Nordbrock, 26, was one of 13 hikers who had sought shelter from the 
downpour by ducking inside an old stone hut at the summit of the mountain. But 
the hut's corrugated metal roof acted as a lightning rod, and Nordbrock was 
electrocuted. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge William J. Rea also awarded a total of $1 million in 
damages to three surviving hikers who suffered injuries because of the 
electrical charge, which left everyone in the hut with first- and second-degree 
burns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have fought for several years to prove that the government was guilty of 
willful misconduct," attorney Larry R. Feldman said Wednesday. "It is almost 
impossible to believe that the government could have a hut with a metal . . . 
roof and a metal stovepipe on the highest mountain in the continental United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a trap to these hikers, who were all very reasonable and intelligent 
people and thought they would be safe inside," added Feldman, who represented 
Nordbrock's family and the three others. 
</P>
<P>
 In a scathing opinion handed down July 7, Rea wrote that the government had 
displayed "wanton and reckless disregard" for hikers, who had been injured in 
the hut during storms in 1985, 1987, 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite repeated incidents and despite the knowledge that a dangerous and 
potentially life-threatening condition existed, (the government) failed to 
erect any signs or other warnings concerning the hut and its dangers during the 
five years preceding this accident," the judge wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The hut, known as the Smithsonian Hut, was built in 1909 by the Smithsonian 
Institution to shelter scientists conducting astronomical research at the 
summit. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, constructed of granite blocks, has a metal stovepipe that 
attaches to the side of the building and leads into the interior. The stovepipe 
extends about five feet above the roof. There was no lightning protection 
system in place, court records state. 
</P>
<P>
 In late afternoon on July 14, 1990, Nordbrock and three friends had reached 
the top of the mountain when an electrical storm suddenly rolled in. The group 
made a run for the hut, where nine other hikers already had sought refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a minute later, lightning struck the hut, and a surging electrical 
charge threw Nordbrock several feet. He was removed from the mountain by 
helicopter and died a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they needed to do was spend $50 and put a sign out there which warns 
hikers to avoid the hut in the event of rain," Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A warning sign was erected on July 15, 1990, the day after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also awarded $400,000 to James MacLeod, $300,000 to Glen MacLeod and 
$300,000 to Calif Tervo. All three suffered serious injuries in the hut.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; CRIME ISSUE SEEN AS GIVING EDGE TO GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a tribute somber enough to cloud the heart of a sunny little beach 
town. And it was one that demonstrated why Pete Wilson, who has presided over 
some of California's bleakest times, is now considered by many to be the 
favorite to win the race for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a grassy glade next to the baseball field in Live Oak Park, under the 
outstretched arms of an aged sycamore tree, the citizens of Manhattan Beach on 
Wednesday unveiled a memorial to one of their own, Police Officer Martin Ganz. 
</P>
<P>
 He would have been 30 years old Wednesday, had not three bullets from an 
unknown assailant cut him down two days after Christmas and given him unwanted 
distinction as the first Manhattan Beach police officer to die in the line of 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial was achingly personal -- cast bronze representations of Ganz's 
helmet and gloves, sunglasses and keys sat atop a short pillar, set in a bed of 
polished blue concrete. The color, the designer said, of a cop's uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of people, in uniforms, beach gear or dress suits, showed up. They 
filled the white chairs that had been set out and spilled onto the grass 
beyond. In the front row sat Ganz's family, their grief evident still after 
seven months of mourning, and his fiancee, Pamela Ham, dressed in black. White 
roses were pinned to their lapels, and to the lapels of a few city dignitaries 
and the highest-ranking official in their presence, Gov. Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 He was invited by the organizers to help soothe the battered feelings of 
townspeople, whose concern about crime was brought into harsh relief by Ganz's 
killing. Wilson has been to so many of these events that he takes on the 
coloration of a comforting family friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often today . . . people seem to mistake celebrity for heroism, fame for 
virtue, glamour for goodness," said Wilson, facing rows of police officers from 
a host of South Bay cities. "Here in Manhattan Beach, a 29-year-old police 
officer named Martin Ganz, who was not a celebrity, wasn't famous, who had a 
job that was not especially glamorous, was nonetheless a true hero. A man of 
great goodness." 
</P>
<P>
 To Wilson, the grandson of a murdered Chicago cop, expressions of sympathy to 
victims and anger toward criminals come naturally. And that explains much of 
his recent comeback in the polls in a state that is increasingly fixated on its 
fear of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 When state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, the Democratic nominee for governor, 
entered the race, her strategists figured that the economy would be Pete 
Wilson's albatross. Lo and behold, half a year later, crime has risen to be the 
issue of greatest concern to Democrats and Republicans alike. 
</P>
<P>
 And that has shifted much of the campaign dialogue to Pete Wilson's turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has recently sought to wrest the issue from him, unleashing television 
commercials accusing him of presiding over a parole system that has let 
dangerous criminals loose to murder and assault Californians. "Under Pete 
Wilson, dangerous parole violators are escaping justice and innocent 
Californians are being murdered," Brown's current television ad says. "That's 
dead wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Democrats, however, assume that at best Brown can only neutralize 
Wilson's hold on the crime issue. They acknowledge privately that she is 
hamstrung on the issue by her personal opposition to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson angrily denounces Brown's claims, saying that he has worked to stiffen 
criminal sentences and penalties for parole violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a desperate candidate who is admitting now that she is behind in the 
polls," Wilson, who leads by single digits in both his and Democratic polling, 
told reporters after the memorial service. "For her to accuse anyone of being 
soft on crime is more than a little bit hypocritical. . . . If she's serious 
about protecting people, where has she been when the rest of us were fighting 
to change the law?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is well aware that he could be accused of politicizing events such as 
the Ganz service, even if he has spent most of his political life in the 
company of victims' rights activists. His remarks to the crowd Wednesday were 
deliberately nonpartisan; he did not mention Brown until asked about her 
afterward by reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to run for political office, you're going to have to put up 
with cynicism at all times, in particular during campaigns," he said later. 
"Recognition was owed to Martin Ganz, and I don't think that they should be 
required to postpone that to a non-election year." 
</P>
<P>
 After the memorial, a steady stream of young and old paraded up to Wilson, 
handing him printed programs to autograph and wishing him well in his campaign. 
Ganz's fiancee, who earlier had praised Wilson for his words of comfort in 
their previous meetings, gave the governor a hug. And then the mourners 
dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Wilson will do it all again. On Friday, he is set to attend the 
funeral of a Bakersfield-based CHP officer, killed days ago in the line of 
duty.

CHIEF PATENT OFFICER FOR UC TO STEP DOWN; EDUCATION: INTERNAL AUDIT HAD CLEARED 
CARL WOOTTEN OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST A WEEK AGO, BUT RAISED OTHER QUESTIONS 
ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The University of California's chief patent officer resigned Wednesday, less 
than a week after an internal investigation cleared him of improperly steering 
contracts to a business partner but revealed that he once tried to get 
university funds for his own invention. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter of resignation, Carl B. Wootten, director of UC's Office of 
Technology Transfer, said he would step down from the $113,500-a-year post Aug. 
1 after a four-year stint that has increased the university's annual patent 
income from $9 million to $45 million. He said he was leaving because the 
university now wants to take a "less centralized" approach than when he took 
over the office in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 His abrupt departure follows a university management audit that concluded 
Wootten did not violate state conflict-of-interest laws. 
</P>
<P>
 One UC source said, however, that some members of the UC Board of Regents were 
not satisfied with the outcome of the audit and that Wootten was essentially 
forced out as part of a widening rift between UC President Jack Peltason and 
some regents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are less than pleased by the way this has been handled," said one regent, 
who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit released last week is the second examination of Wootten's 
activities. A previous review, issued by Peltason in April, exonerated the 
patent chief but drew criticism as being shallow, prompting regents in June to 
order a more thorough investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wootten, a former University of Virginia official, was the point man in the 
university's efforts to make more money from faculty inventions and research 
applications. The entrepreneurial "for-profit" plan aimed at converting 
brainpower into patent royalties bogged down under faculty resistance. Peltason 
announced in March that he was shelving it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wootten's connections became an issue in September when the San Francisco 
Examiner reported that he steered lucrative contracts to longtime friend and 
business partner Stanley P. Fisher, an Alexandria, Va., attorney. While he was 
exerting official influence, the newspaper reported, Wootten was in partnership 
with Fisher in Quorum-Intech Partners, a start-up high-tech firm. 
</P>
<P>
 UC has paid Fisher's law firm $475,000 since 1992 for patent work, and the 
attorney was paid $30,000 to work as a consultant for the UC technology office 
between 1989 and 1992, last week's audit said. 
</P>
<P>
 UC auditors confirmed that Wootten and Fisher had a longstanding friendship 
and invested $1,000 and $2,000 respectively in 1989 in Quorum-Intech Partners, 
a venture that failed, the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that financial connection, the audit concluded that the patent chief 
did not have a conflict but that he influenced decisions to hire Fisher. 
Auditors said they could not determine whether Fisher actually controlled 
Wootten's money in the partnership around the time the patent chief was getting 
Fisher hired as a $1,000-a-day consultant.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; ACTOR TRIES TO PUT SPOTLIGHT ON NUCLEAR DUMP; 
THE CANDIDATES HAVE AVOIDED ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. BUT ROBERT REDFORD'S RADIO 
ADS RAISE THE WARD VALLEY DEBATE. 
</P>

<P>
 It was threatening to become the first California governor's race in at least 
a decade in which the environment wasn't an issue. Then actor Robert Redford 
decided to bring up a controversial matter that both candidates have tended to 
avoid until now. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of radio ads starting today, Redford urges voters to oppose Gov. 
Pete Wilson's efforts to locate a dump for radioactive waste in the eastern 
Mojave Desert about 20 miles from the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the sound of running tap water, Redford states the concern of 
environmental and anti-nuclear groups that leaking radioactivity from the 
proposed Ward Valley dump could pollute the nearby river, imperiling the 
drinking water supply of millions of people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to imagine that something as commonplace as tap water could become 
radioactive, but it could happen right here in Los Angeles," Redford says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by Americans for a Safe Future, made up of mostly of people in the 
entertainment business opposed to the Ward Valley project, the 60-second ad is 
slated to run several times a day for two weeks on KABC radio, said Michael 
Dieden, a consultant for the group. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of Ward Valley has become a subject of intense debate among 
environmentalists, scientists and policy-makers around the country who are 
struggling with the problem of what to do with the nation's accumulating pile 
of nuclear waste. But it has had no place in a gubernatorial debate focused 
mainly on crime and immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither opposing nor endorsing the dump, Democratic candidate Kathleen Brown 
has said only that she favors "a full adjudicatory hearing on the issue so that 
all sides can be heard" -- a position reaffirmed by her press secretary, John 
Whitehurst, in response to the Redford ad. 
</P>
<P>
 In taking that stance, Brown is echoing the Clinton Administration, which 
first called for such a hearing last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Wilson campaign said the governor would have nothing to 
say in response to the ad unless Brown came out against the Ward Valley 
project. "(Brown) has been unequivocally unclear as to where she stands on Ward 
Valley," said Beth Miller, deputy press secretary for the Wilson campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilson has said little about Ward Valley during the campaign, he 
worked hard behind the scenes to overcome judicial and congressional obstacles 
to the dump and to win over a skittish White House. The federal government owns 
the land where the dump would be located and must approve its transfer to the 
state before the dump can be opened. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ad, Redford raises a crucial safety issue -- whether the Colorado River 
could be poisoned by radioactive waste -- which is far from settled. State 
officials insist that harmful doses of radioactivity could never escape from 
the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the National Academy of Sciences, the nation's oldest and most 
prestigious independent scientific body, convened a panel of experts to 
investigate the suitability of the site. Topmost among the questions 
confronting the panel is whether long-lived nuclear waste, such as plutonium, 
could leak into the ground water under Ward Valley and ultimately make its way 
to the Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is to present its findings to U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt 
by the end of the year. Babbitt has said he then will hold a hearing before 
deciding whether to transfer the 1,000-acre site to California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redford ad is designed to arouse enough public opposition to Ward Valley 
to force the candidates to address the issue, its sponsors say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the politicians have been ducking the issue because the public 
hasn't known about it," said Dieden, the consultant for Americans for a Safe 
Future. "Once we've made the public aware of this plan, we believe the reaction 
is going to be pretty strong, like . . . 'The governor actually wants to place 
a nuclear waste dump next to the Colorado River!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dieden said the ad, which he said cost $10,000, will be broadcast in San 
Diego, San Francisco and Sacramento if enough Los Angeles listeners respond to 
an 800 number asking for support. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure for the Ward Valley project comes not only from the nuclear power 
industry but from hospitals, laboratories and biomedical firms that use 
radioactive materials. California has no officially sanctioned repository for 
the waste, and a growing number of institutions are being forced to warehouse 
radioactive refuse in quarters not designed for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Some hospitals have said they are beginning to cut back on critical research 
that relies on radioactive material in order to generate less waste. Moreover, 
Wilson has warned that the biomedical industry, one of the bright spots of the 
California economy, will look to other states if the Ward Valley site is 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Redford's ad says that Americans for a Safe Future has an alternative plan to 
Ward Valley, but the group's executive director, Matt Peterson, said Wednesday 
that "we're still trying to develop a specific plan." Peterson said the group 
is supporting a bill pending in the state Legislature that would require the 
state Department of Health Services to find an alternative site.

4 PLO OFFICIALS EXPELLED FROM GAZA; MIDEAST: SUSPECTED TERRORISTS WERE PART OF 
ARAFAT'S ENTOURAGE. ISRAEL SAYS THEIR PRESENCE VIOLATED SELF-RULE AGREEMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 Four PLO officials linked by Israeli intelligence to past terrorist attacks 
were expelled Wednesday from the Gaza Strip after Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 
strongly protested their entry as violating the agreement on Palestinian 
self-government. 
</P>
<P>
 The four men, two of whom are believed to have planned the 1974 attack on a 
high school at Maalot in which 21 Israeli teen-agers were killed, entered the 
Gaza Strip on Tuesday morning in the entourage of Yasser Arafat, the Palestine 
Liberation Organization chairman. Israeli officials discovered their presence 
only hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Mordechai Gur, Israel's deputy defense minister, accused Arafat and the PLO of 
deceiving Israel in bringing the four into the Gaza Strip, knowing that Israel 
objected to their return. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot accept this sort of trickery," Gur said. "I don't have any doubt 
that (Arafat) knew because we made (their) names known and said we would not 
allow them to enter. . . . There is no doubt that Arafat knew about the matter. 
We do not accept this, and we will not accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Nasser Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian police, acknowledged the 
four men's entry as a violation of the agreement but said the matter is 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The four tried to get into Gaza illegally, thinking they would sneak in with 
Arafat," Yusuf said by telephone. "It was illegal, but we solved the problem 
and it is all over." 
</P>
<P>
 For many Israelis, nervous about the character of the emerging Palestinian 
Authority, this was confirmation that the self-governing areas could quickly 
turn into a "terrorist state," as critics of the autonomy pact have charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am shocked that the Israeli government did not arrest these murderers of 
children and bring them to justice," Meir Amrusi, chairman of the Families of 
the Maalot Martyrs, said of the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ahmed Tibi, a Jerusalem physician who advises Arafat and serves as an 
unofficial link for him with top Israeli officials, drove three of the men 
across the border into Egypt at midday. The fourth left late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, described as "angered and outraged" by the incident, ordered border 
crossings between the Gaza Strip and Egypt and between the West Bank and Jordan 
closed to all PLO members until the four men were sent back to Egypt. Under the 
autonomy agreement, Israel retained control of the crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to learn this lesson -- they can't cheat on the agreement they 
signed with us," Rabin commented. "It is not proper for someone to smuggle 
these people in the cars accompanying Chairman Arafat." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat requested a "hot line" that would provide him and Rabin with quick, 
direct contact in the future so such incidents do not develop and endanger 
relations between Israel and the new Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Tibi asserted that there had been no attempt to deceive Israel, that Arafat's 
understanding was that there was a general amnesty for members of the PLO and 
its affiliates returning under the autonomy accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot come and say this man did this in the past -- an agreement has 
been signed so that these things will not happen in the future," Tibi said. 
"Those who committed these deeds now support the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the four belong to the Palestinian Democratic Federation, a moderate 
PLO faction. "These people came to build up peace, and they are not coming to 
wage a war against Israel," the federation said in a statement. "It is their 
right to return. The Israelis do not want to forget the past." 
</P>
<P>
 But Yossi Sarid, Israel's dovish environment minister, said the amnesty could 
not be stretched to cover these four. "We are talking about two men who were 
involved in one of the most terrible and difficult events, the Maalot 
massacre," Sarid said. "That is why we think they should not now be entering 
the self-rule areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Tibi said the four had deposited their passports with Israeli border 
authorities when they arrived in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday "proving there was 
no intention to smuggle them in" as Israeli officials contended. Israel was not 
acting in good faith by letting in some PLO officials and barring others, Tibi 
said. "This is explicitly in violation of the spirit of the agreement," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel also objected to the return of 13 other Palestinians who accompanied 
Arafat on grounds of their past activities, but agreed to allow them to remain 
in Gaza after all-night negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli media, quoting intelligence and police sources, identified the two men 
involved in the Maalot attack as Mamdouh Nofal, alleged mastermind of the 
operation, and Nihad Jayousi. An Israeli soldier, a family of three and two 
Arab women as well as the three Palestinian guerrillas from the Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine also died in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 According to press accounts, Israel also objected to the presence of Mustafa 
Liftawi (Abu Firas), onetime head of the PLO's "Western Sector" intelligence 
group in Beirut that planned dozens of operations against Israel. The fourth 
was identified as Jihad Amarneh, also an official of the Western Sector.

U.S. DELEGATION COULD HELP INDIA PRESERVE TAJ MAHAL; ENVIRONMENT: ENERGY 
SECRETARY TARGETS POLLUTANTS IMPERILING THE MONUMENT AND CITIES WORLDWIDE. 
PRIVATE BUSINESS DEALS OKD.

 Swifts flitted about the minarets Wednesday as the setting sun tinted the pale 
white marble of the world's most celebrated monument to eternal love, the Taj 
Mahal, a ruddy orange. 
</P>
<P>
 For people around the globe, the architectural wonder built three centuries 
ago by an emperor to house the tomb of his beloved is a poem in stone to love 
and loss. Officials for the U.S. Department of Energy, however, saw another 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Taj is a monument to the need for sustainable energy," one said. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary visited the Taj Mahal as she led 
what she called "the largest business delegation ever to leave Washington, 
D.C., and the first in the history of our nation to focus on sustainable 
development." 
</P>
<P>
 Its white marble surface menaced by high-level air pollution and the gritty 
industrial zones that have sprouted around it, the Taj, O'Leary said after a 
guided tour, now serves as a "canary in a coal mine," warning the world at 
large of its environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of weekend talks with Kamal Nath, India's environmental minister, 
O'Leary said India and the United States agreed to search together for cleaner 
energy sources that could be used in Agra, a city of more than 1 million 
people, as well as other possible jobs for its populace that would cut air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we think about what sustainable development means, then what better focus 
for the world, not just our two countries, than to wrestle with the issue of 
how we preserve this wonderful monument," O'Leary said as she sat on a bench in 
the Taj's quiet garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Her visit was intended to build on the momentum achieved by Prime Minister P. 
V. Narasimha Rao's May 19 talks at the White House with President Clinton. The 
large business contingent was proof the Americans meant to "do deals," O'Leary 
assured her hosts. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, in New Delhi 120 miles north of here, U.S. business 
representatives signed 11 new private-sector ventures with Indian partners 
involving energy projects as diverse as construction of a $240-million, 
gas-fired 200 megawatt power plant in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh; use 
of sugar cane waste to generate electricity; transfer of U.S. coal-washing 
technology to treat high-ash Indian coal, and manufacture of low-cost solar 
batteries in Madras to power rural telephones and lanterns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means jobs, and high-quality jobs, for workers in the United States and 
India, and in the long run, it also means an opportunity to suppress pollution 
throughout the world," O'Leary said after the signing ceremony of accords she 
predicted would be worth "hundreds of millions of dollars" in new business. 
</P>
<P>
 For India, where insufficient electricity often proves a choke point to faster 
or uniform development, the diverse sources of power should boost the 
government drive to build a more modern, prosperous economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taj was built between 1631 and 1653 by the grief-stricken Mogul Emperor 
Shahjahan for his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Although debate continues on just how 
badly the tomb has been damaged and the precise source, noxious fumes, chemical 
waste and thousands of vehicles plying Agra's overtaxed roads are blamed by 
many. 
</P>
<P>
 Three hundred glass factories and foundries in this city and its environs 
reportedly burn more than 10,000 tons of hard coke every day, releasing large 
quantities of sulfur dioxide. An oil refinery on the Delhi-Agra highway is also 
a major polluter. One expert at Agra University estimated that a square inch of 
the Taj turns yellow every day. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey this year by the National Environmental Engineering Research 
Institute said that, if greater pollution abatement measures are not introduced 
immediately, a quarter of the Taj will be yellowed by 1997. Cracks have also 
appeared in places. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary said that, although one Indo-U.S. study has been done on how to ease 
environmental pressures on the Taj, she and Nath agreed another was needed to 
coordinate plans by the state of Uttar Pradesh, where Agra is located, the 
ministries of environment and tourism and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the study, we can then make a decision about funding," including from 
U.S. sources, O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why American money should be spent on an Indian monument, O'Leary said 
the same solutions developed to protect or restore the Taj could be used to 
refurbish aging U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. taxpayer has a great deal to do with the Taj Mahal," O'Leary said. 
"Things that enrich the soul, no matter where they exist, need to be preserved. 
Most importantly, all issues involving the environment are global issues. And 
in the United States, the American public clearly understands that."

HAITI VIOLENCE WILL GET WORSE, DIPLOMATS SAY; CARIBBEAN: HUMAN RIGHTS OBSERVERS 
LEAVE. SOURCES BELIEVE MILITARY REGIME WILL CRACK DOWN ON ARISTIDE SUPPORTERS. 
</P>

<P>
 The ouster Wednesday of the international human rights mission here is the 
prelude to another wave of violent repression aimed at destroying the last 
remnants of the opposition before any possible American invasion, diplomats and 
military sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The regime will act ruthlessly, according to this theory, so that any U.S. 
occupying force would have to turn to traditional Haitian institutions -- the 
military and the allied, civilian elite -- because there would be no one else 
they could rely on to govern or to run police, security and other necessary 
state functions, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are going to see an increase in the systematic elimination of whatever is 
left" of the loose political coalition established by exiled President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, said a source close to the Haitian military. The source 
said the regime does not "want to leave behind an infrastructure that can 
facilitate an invasion or occupation." 
</P>
<P>
 One security expert said the next days and weeks could see a repeat of the 
bloody repression of the spring and early summer, when the Haitian junta and 
its armed civilian allies murdered an average of 60 people a month in the 
Port-au-Prince area alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears that a new bloody wave was developing resulted from the discovery 
earlier this week of two freshly dug mounds of dirt near the seaside town of 
Leogane, about 18 miles west of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents claimed the mounds were graves containing the bodies of 12 
unidentified men supposedly killed by gunmen when they tried to board a boat 
that would carry them to the United States. But the reports could not be 
confirmed beyond a finding by the U.S. Embassy that there were bodies in the 
graves. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the past killings involved many ordinary people, most of those 
targeted were seen by the military as active supporters of Aristide, who was 
ousted in a bloody military revolt on Sept. 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Aristide's political movement was destroyed then. But evidently not 
enough, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as they (human rights monitors) are gone, the army will do whatever 
it wants," the source said. "They have armed a bunch of civilian supporters, 
and I expect they will be operating in a big way in Cite Soleil and Carrefour." 
Carrefour and Cite Soleil, two dense slums populated overwhelmingly by Aristide 
supporters, have been the focus of military murders, beatings, rapes and 
extortion. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the puppet government of acting President Emile Jonassaint gave the 
100 or so human rights monitors, operating under the auspices of the United 
Nations and the Organization of American States, 48 hours to leave Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the monitors, who were confined to the capital for the most part, 
there will be no systematic tracking of human rights violations. Unofficial 
scrutiny of human rights abuses by reporters has been hampered for weeks now 
under an order from the regime that prevents journalists from traveling outside 
Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 While that restriction has been largely ignored by reporters, diplomatic and 
military sources say they expect the army to begin enforcing the ban; that, in 
turn, may result in the arrest and expulsion of violators. 
</P>
<P>
 The monitors and their administrative staff left on an Air France flight 
Wednesday along with about 170 Haitians approved for refugee status in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Air France announced on Wednesday that it was suspending its 
three weekly flights as of Aug. 1, as demanded by the United States. All other 
passenger flights here were suspended June 25; with the last Air France flight, 
Haiti will be isolated as part of U.N. economic sanctions designed to force the 
military to give up power. 
</P>
<P>
 But most diplomats and military experts here don't see the military regime 
leaving, as the international community hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Biamby and Cedras are here to stay," said a source close to the military, 
speaking of Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the junta's strongman, and his chief of 
staff, Gen. Philippe Biamby. "The rest of the officers are sitting on their 
hands, afraid to move" against the commanders, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said they also expect the army to step up harassment of foreigners, 
particularly news reporters, both to restrict their ability to monitor the 
bloodletting and to intimidate them so they will leave. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if such actions could not be seen as provoking international 
intervention, one diplomat said the military and its puppet government either 
don't believe there will be U.S. action -- or they don't care if there is. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have successfully resisted (international pressure) for 2 1/2 years," he 
said, "and each day encourages them. They are more assured and more audacious. 
They think they can do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, he said, the military is actually more unified than before, 
reinforced by fear that any dissension now would destroy their institution or 
by the belief that Cedras is right and it would be foolhardy to rebel against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said the Coast 
Guard picked up 770 Haitians on Tuesday, bringing the total number to about 
20,000 since June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there were reports that U.S. Marines had staged a mock evacuation 
on the Bahamian island of Great Inagua on Wednesday, practicing the sort of 
operation they might conduct if ordered to get Americans and others out of 
Haiti. Military officials said the two-day mission was routine. But some 
Clinton Administration officials publicized the drill, apparently as part of 
the effort to coerce Haiti's military leaders.

AMERICAN ALBUM: SHRINE MAY BE ANSWER TO PUERTO RICO'S PRAYERS; THOUSANDS OF 
PILGRIMS HAVE FLOCKED TO A WELL CREDITED WITH BRINGING GOOD LUCK, CURES. NOW 
SOME BELIEVE IT CAN BECOME AN ECONOMIC MIRACLE.

 Mist and low clouds routinely brush the mountain tops here, and there is 
something about the way sudden sunlight breaks through that suggests the 
flickering of a celestial spotlight. But for tens of thousands of visitors each 
year, what happens in this remote corner of the island is less meteorological 
than miraculous. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1953, when three schoolchildren reported seeing a vision of the Virgin 
Mary floating in a well, growing numbers of pilgrims have hiked up the mountain 
here to draw water from the well and pray for everything from good fortune to 
miracle cures. 
</P>
<P>
 And apparently, prayers have been answered. "I know that we owe the life of 
our youngest daughter to the Virgin of the Well," said Edmee Roumain, in 
reference to Katia, now 10, who was born with several heart defects. "This has 
been a transformation in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The next transformation to take place could be the one that changes this quiet 
town of 22,000 people -- a place well off the main tourist trails through this 
scenic U.S. commonwealth -- into a major Christian mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 Where there is now a rustic chapel, a small stone well and a modest gift shop 
selling postcards and rosaries, a group of devotees headed by a San Juan 
dentist has plans to develop a virtual Virgin Mary theme park -- a 
multimillion-dollar project that would include overnight accommodations, trams 
to shuttle pilgrims up the mountain and a statue of the blue-robed virgin that, 
at 25 stories tall, would dwarf the Statue of Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 Already the group has spent $200,000 to buy 200 acres of adjacent land for 
what would be called Monte Mistico de Maria (Mary's Mystical Mountain), 
according to Dr. Ricardo Ramos Pesquera. "This is not something we are doing to 
make money," said Ramos, the dentist. "This is for the betterment of Puerto 
Rico, which has problems with drugs, abortion, and crime. I believe this is the 
answer to those problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the shrine's popularity -- an estimated 100,000 people turned out on 
May 29 to mark the 41st anniversary of the Virgin sighting -- it remains 
controversial among Catholics. Until 1989, priests regularly said Mass at the 
mountain site. Then Puerto Rico's Cardinal Luis Aponte Martinez ordered a halt 
to services there, and the local priest was reassigned. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Isidro Labrador Catholic Church, in the center of Sabana Grande, Father 
Hector Rivera says he advises parishioners to stay away from the site until the 
Vatican completes its investigation and decides whether or not to sanction the 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those Catholics who visit the shrine, Rivera said: "They are good people, 
people of faith. But if they follow the church, it is important that they 
wait." 
</P>
<P>
 Many say they cannot. On a recent Tuesday afternoon Rosario Cedano brought her 
2-year-old daughter, Frances, up the mountain. "She has had severe breathing 
problems and pneumonia and pains in her chest," Cedano said. "She does not 
understand why we're here. But I want to do everything I can to keep her 
healthy."

 Behind the chapel is a shed called the casa de testimonios (house of 
testimonials), which is chock a block with votive offerings, sent by the 
faithful, the evidence of miracles worked and prayers answered: crutches, 
casts, wedding gowns, military uniforms, school pictures, rosaries, letters, 
even toys.

<P>
 In a separate glass display case nearby are some 40-year-old photographs of 
the children who say they witnessed the Virgin's reappearance in 1953. Also in 
the case is the "1993 Miss Puerto Rico" sash of Dayanara Torres, inscribed 
"Thanks to the Virgin for granting my dream." Torres went on to become Miss 
Universe.

 Milagros Rivera, a volunteer docent at the shrine, said tour groups from 
Mexico, Spain, the Dominican Republic and many U.S. states regularly show up.

 "I know there are doubters," she said. "But so many have been helped, and so 
many keep coming back."

 On behalf of his Mission of Our Lady of the Well, which counts some 250,000 
members, Ramos said he has made five trips to Rome to plead for the restoration 
of masses at the shrine. While pursuing the blessing of the church, he says 
plans to develop the site into a religious complex are proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an amusement park," he said. "There will be places for reflection 
and prayer. And this is not for me; I don't need more business. This is for the 
spiritual needs of the many." 
</P>
<P>
 The town's mayor supports the project. "This will be a great economic boom for 
us," said Miguel Ortiz-Velas. "Many more people will visit here, and that will 
create jobs and new businesses. There are no ecological problems; the 
consequences are all positive. I can't see anything against it."

NEWS ANALYSIS; IN EARLIER ERA, CLINTON TRIP WOULD HAVE BEEN TRIUMPH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In different times, President Clinton's just completed eight-day trip through 
Europe would have been a sure-fire triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 As the leader of the globe's lone remaining superpower, the youthful President 
chose four countries that must be among the most pro-American anywhere -- 
Poland, Germany, Italy and the tiny Baltic state of Latvia. He had spectacular 
backdrops -- the Warsaw Ghetto memorial, the 17th-Century Palazzo Reale in 
Naples, Berlin's history-laden Brandenburg Gate -- and warm, sunny weather to 
accentuate them. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the President completed his third trip to Europe this year, he left 
behind him few concrete results and a set of mixed emotions that fell far short 
of euphoria. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a fantastic act of goodwill, but he committed himself to very little," 
said Michael Stuermer, director of the Ebenhausen Institute, a German 
government-financed think tank near Munich, commenting on the German leg of the 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's pledge of $200 million in new U.S. aid to Poland, made in Warsaw, 
was more a gesture of solidarity than meaningful assistance; his decision to 
duck the dollar crisis completely at the Group of Seven economic summit in 
Naples diminished his credentials as presiding over the fastest-growing economy 
of the world's seven leading industrial nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the failure to ignite much genuine emotion on his visit had little to do 
with the President himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Europe's polite but uninspiring response to Clinton had far more to do 
with factors beyond his control -- such as the Continent's preoccupation with 
internal problems, the fall from grace of almost an entire political class and 
transatlantic ties that have irrevocably changed with the Cold War's end. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, Clinton is the first President since World War II who is 
not the guarantor of Western Europe's freedom and prosperity. And this change 
has altered the view toward him at virtually every level of European society. 
</P>
<P>
 At the grass roots, this shift in thinking was nowhere more visible than 
during Clinton's visit Tuesday to Berlin and his speech in the shadow of 
Brandenburg Gate, barely a few yards from where the city was divided during 
much of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Three decades ago, when President John F. Kennedy traveled to West Berlin and 
uttered his famous " Ich bin ein Berliner " message of solidarity to the 
beleaguered city, his words fell on a people who knew that their very existence 
depended on him. The majority of those West Berliners had experienced both the 
horrors of war and the benefits of the massive American aid delivered under the 
Marshall Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 While a number of old-timers showed up to hear Clinton on Tuesday, the 
President's appearance had more the feel of a pep rally than a serious 
political event, many analysts observed. 
</P>
<P>
 Numbers also tell the difference. According to Berlin city archives, about 
400,000 people crowded into the square in front of the West Berlin City Hall to 
hear Kennedy; estimates of those who showed up for Clinton ranged from 
one-quarter to one-tenth of that. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers believe the President also suffered from the diminished standing of 
politicians, in general, on a continent mired in a seemingly endless series of 
political scandals and other controversies. The approval rating of Polish 
President Lech Walesa hovers around 5%, much of the Italian political 
Establishment has been swept away by charges of wrongdoing and Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl was booed as he rose to speak in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most of Clinton's major foreign policy problems have come outside of 
Europe, he faced little overt ill will directed at him personally. "There's a 
kind of skepticism and disillusionment of how leaders everywhere are 
performing," said Jack Spence of the Royal Institute of International Affairs 
in London. "I didn't detect any great increase in warmth for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there were some self-inflicted wounds along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 In Naples, Clinton's plan to push immediately for a new round of global trade 
liberalization in areas such as financial services and intellectual property 
rights was immediately shot down by most other G-7 leaders as a threat to the 
most recent world trade agreement, which still faces ratification fights in 
several countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's staff had promoted the plan as a test of the President's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's unrestrained endorsement Tuesday of Germany as America's 
partner in leadership also visibly unsettled Germans, who were quick to stress 
they wanted to lead no one. "Partners in responsibility," stressed Kohl in his 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes after Clinton finished speaking, former German President Richard von 
Weizsaecker was emphatically telling a British Broadcasting Corp. reporter that 
Germany had no wish to act on its own with America, wanting instead to work 
together with all its allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's neighbors, however, seemed far more relaxed at the President's 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton acknowledged that Germany is the most powerful country in Europe," 
noted Belgian Foreign Ministry spokesman Patrick Renault. "That's neither good 
nor bad. It's a simple fact."

TWO INMATES DIE DURING MELEE INSIDE CONNECTICUT PRISON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Club-wielding inmates wearing makeshift hoods attacked other inmates during a 
prison yard melee that left two prisoners dead and at least six others injured, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the injured were in critical condition Wednesday. Two guards also 
suffered minor injuries during the fighting Tuesday in the recreation area of 
the medium-security Carl Robinson Correctional Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 of the prison's 1,600 inmates were in the yard when some prisoners 
apparently fashioned hoods from their T-shirts and chased down others with 
sticks and makeshift clubs. One inmate was swinging a crutch. 
</P>
<P>
 State corrections spokesman Bill Flower said officials did not know what 
caused the fight.

DOCTORS BACK AWAY FROM REFORM, POLL FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a dramatic shift, the nation's doctors are becoming increasingly fearful of 
comprehensive health care reform and many are lobbying elected officials -- and 
their own patients -- to oppose President Clinton's agenda for change, a new 
Times Mirror poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 "Physicians have come to the judgment that major health care reform is bad for 
their health and the health of their patients," said Robert J. Blendon, a 
Harvard University public opinion expert on health care issues and a consultant 
in the Times Mirror survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel the health care reform train is going too far, too fast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Mirror poll data also suggests that the public at large is similarly 
becoming wary about major reform proposals -- even though 76% still back 
Clinton's goal of universal coverage as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The physicians' attitude is a dramatic turnaround from only a year ago when 
64% of those surveyed by Times Mirror said the health care system needed 
fundamental change, said Andrew Kohut, director of the Times Mirror Center for 
The People & The Press. In the new survey, only 39% said fundamental change is 
necessary. Times Mirror Co. is the owner of the Los Angeles Times and other 
newspaper, broadcasting and publishing enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift in attitude by doctors comes as health care inflation has moderated 
and Congress looks increasingly likely to enact legislation that is much less 
far-reaching than the agenda proposed by Clinton last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The general population survey involved 1,021 adults and was conducted from 
June 23 to June 26, with a margin of error of 3 percentage points. The 
physician survey involved 495 physicians and was conducted from June 9 to July 
1, with a 5-point margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll found a strikingly pessimistic mood among physicians, with two out of 
three saying that they expect a reduction in income in the next five years. 
Indeed one out of four said their incomes have already declined, especially 
specialists and others at higher income levels. And nine out of 10 doctors said 
they expect to have more practice restrictions placed on them. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the poll, half the physicians said they have contacted public 
officials about health care reform, 47% have tried to influence their patients 
on the issue and 31% have contributed to a candidate or organization with views 
they favor. 
</P>
<P>
 But the least politically active group are those who support Clinton's plan. 
Only 40% contacted public officials compared to 56% of doctors who oppose 
Clinton's approach. 
</P>
<P>
 That contrast is even greater when it came to lobbying patients. The study 
found that only 23% of Clinton backers talked to their patients, but 55% of 
critics did so. 
</P>
<P>
 In the general population survey, 58% -- compared to 45% last September -- 
said they believe that they will have less freedom to choose their own doctors.

BREYER RANKS DESEGREGATION RULINGS AT TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judge Stephen G. Breyer on Thursday called two Supreme Court rulings enforcing 
racial desegregation in the South the most important legal decisions of this 
century but said it will be "decades before the promise (of fairness to blacks) 
is eventually kept." 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer's comments came during a second day of hearings before the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, in which he skirted most controversies. None of the 18 
senators present questioned Breyer sharply and the committee planned to end his 
testimony today after a closed-door session. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the hearing, Breyer has characterized himself as a dispassionate 
judge with middle-of-the-road views. But on issues of civil rights and 
religion, he responded more forcefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to name the three most important Supreme Court rulings of this century, 
Breyer cited Brown vs. Board of Education in 1954, which said that segregated 
schools were unconstitutional, and a lesser-known decision, Cooper vs. Aaron of 
1958, requiring that black students be admitted immediately to the formerly 
all-white schools in Little Rock, Ark. Both decisions were based on the 14th 
Amendment, which says states may not deny to any person "the equal protection 
of the laws." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do I say Cooper vs. Aaron?" Breyer asked. "The reason that I think that's 
so important is because it means that as a nation these words on paper are not 
just words on paper. . . . It was a definite, firm commitment to that 
principle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 14th Amendment added the one thing that was missing, a promise of 
fairness," Breyer said. "With Brown (the 1954 ruling), the country decided we 
will try to keep our promise. It's hardly surprising . . . given the years of 
neglect, that it will be decades, decades before that promise is eventually 
kept. But we're trying and the trying is absolutely correct." 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer did not name the third ruling but pointed to the dissenting opinions of 
Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis D. Brandeis, who urged the court in 
the 1920s to protect freedom of speech.

U.S. URGES RAILROADS TO INSTALL COSTLY CRASH-WARNING DEVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal officials prodded the railroad industry Wednesday to install expensive 
crash-warning devices to avert potential collisions and hazardous waste spills, 
but rail operators said that costs of the changes might be prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to Congress, the Federal Railroad Administration said that private 
rail operators should devote more resources to "positive train control" 
technology aimed at slowing down speeding locomotives and reducing human error, 
which causes 80% of crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agency shied away from endorsing universal application of 
crash-prevention technology, limiting its initial recommendations to the 
nation's "high-risk" rail corridors, which it will identify within two years. 
Frequency of accidents, traffic density and types of material carried will 
determine which tracks are high-risk, officials said, suggesting that highly 
traveled freight lines in the West and passenger lines in the Northeast will be 
required to use the technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency can order the changes but has delayed action to allow industry 
researchers to develop the technology in conjunction with the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The sooner the new technology is put into use, the sooner "a new Golden Age of 
information-driven high-speed safe railroading" will begin, Railroad 
Administration chief Jolene Molitoris said. 
</P>
<P>
 In its report, the agency asked industry researchers to step up development of 
a computer system with the capability to slow or stop trains using automated 
brakes. The agency also said that it will consider revising rules to improve 
radio communication. Such technology could have averted 116 train-to-train 
accidents and 30 deaths between 1988 and 1993, an agency study found. The 
report recommends using both existing and developing technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The study envisions that industry would bear the brunt of the costs. However, 
industry leaders said that universal use of the new equipment would cost nearly 
$1 billion and would save railroad operators only about $30 million a year.

PENTAGON REPORT BLAMES HUMAN ERROR IN COPTER TRAGEDY; MILITARY: DEFENSE CHIEF 
ORDERS MAJOR SHUFFLING OF OPERATIONS OF AWACS AIRCRAFT. HE CONCURS THAT TWO 
OFFICERS SHOULD BE RELIEVED OF THEIR DUTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pentagon said Wednesday that the downing of two Army helicopters by U.S. 
fighters over Iraq last April was caused by a wide range of avoidable human 
error and it announced a sweeping overhaul of military flight procedures to 
prevent further accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the mishap "a tragedy that never should have happened," Defense 
Secretary William J. Perry approved recommendations that a general and another 
officer be relieved of their duties and told top commanders to decide whether 
others should face punitive action. 
</P>
<P>
 He also ordered a major shuffling of the operations of Air Force AWACS radar 
surveillance planes, which an investigative report Wednesday blamed as a major 
factor in the tragedy in which 26 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-volume report was the result of thousands of hours of analysis and 
interviews with more than 130 witnesses, including the pilots of the two F-15C 
fighters who fired the missiles that downed the two helicopters. It clearly 
stunned the Defense Department leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told 
reporters at a press conference that the investigation showed "there were a 
shocking number of instances in which individuals failed to do their jobs 
properly." 
</P>
<P>
 The general relieved of his duties was Air Force Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Scott 
Pilkington, who had been co-commander, along with a Turkish officer, of the 
U.S.-led operation to enforce the "no-fly" zone in northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said that the "senior missions supervisor" for the AWACS 
operation also was relieved of his duties but they declined to disclose his 
name, pending further investigation. There was no indication whether he might 
be disciplined in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of what was contained in Wednesday's report by a board of inquiry already 
had been disclosed, either in previous remarks by Pentagon officials or by the 
Los Angeles Times and other newspapers in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The document showed, for example, that the lead F-15C pilot mistook the two 
U.S. helicopters for Iraqi planes, and that his wingman, who was piloting the 
second fighter, did not try to prevent the shooting even though he could not 
confirm the identification. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also confirmed earlier speculation that the transponders carried by 
the two helicopters to identify them as American did not transmit the proper 
coded signals -- though it said investigators have been unable to determine why 
the devices apparently malfunctioned. 
</P>
<P>
 But the investigators meted out the lion's share of the blame for the tragedy 
to the crew of the radar-surveillance plane, which it said failed to warn the 
F-15Cs and the Blackhawks of each other's presence, even though it had both 
sets of aircraft on its radar screens. 
</P>
<P>
 And it cited "a breakdown in command guidance and supervision" throughout the 
entire "no-fly" zone enforcement operation in northern Iraq, from a failure to 
integrate fighter and helicopter activities to a laxity in updating rules by 
which the F-15C fighters are permitted to attack an enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 The document said that the AWACS crew erroneously believed that it was not 
responsible for monitoring helicopter flights or for coordinating them with 
fighter operations and did not take a series of routine steps that could have 
prevented the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 And it said the mission crew commander of the AWACS squadron, who had flown 
only one sortie in the three previous months, "was not currently qualified in 
accordance with Air Force regulations." 
</P>
<P>
 Ominously, the report said that both the senior mission commander and the 
controller in charge of the area declined to testify on the advice of their 
lawyers, leaving investigators unable to tell whether they had activated a key 
warning device. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said that the investigators also were missing a four-minute segment 
of videotape from the AWACS plane, which was lost when a crew member recorded 
something else over it. But it said the slip appeared to be inadvertent and 
authorities were able to reconstruct the information. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said Wednesday that the Pentagon already has changed flight procedures 
to help prevent such incidents in the future -- including consolidating 
air-control for helicopter and fighter flights and tightening the conditions 
under which a U.S. jet can fire upon another plane. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also made clear that he had become very much displeased with the way 
the Air Force was operating its fleet of AWACS planes, which until now had been 
regarded as elite units. 
</P>
<P>
 He ordered a major overhaul of procedures and training for AWACS crews 
throughout the Air Force, particularly for joint operations involving the Air 
Force and other services. Such operations have become more common in combat 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
 And he directed the Pentagon's four-service "joint staff" to develop new 
guidelines for interservice operations that take account of lessons the 
military has learned from the April 14 incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident was the second tragedy this year in which errors by Air Force 
controllers were a critical factor. The other, a collision between an F-16D 
fighter and a C-130 transport over a North Carolina base in March, killed 23 
and injured 100. 
</P>
<P>
 * WIDOW'S QUESTIONS: Aviator's widow finds officer's explanation unhelpful. B1 
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 The "no-fly" zone over northern Iraq was established by the United States and 
its allies just after the 1991 Persian Gulf War to prevent the forces of Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein from raiding and killing Kurdish tribesmen who lived 
in that part of the country.

WELFARE REFORMERS CONFRONT OUT-OF-WEDLOCK BIRTHS; SENATE: PANEL SHOWS 
BIPARTISAN RESOLVE TO REDUCE PREGNANCIES BY UNMARRIED AID RECIPIENTS. BUT 
LAWMAKERS ARE DIVIDED OVER HOW TO ACCOMPLISH IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As he presided over the first congressional hearing on the Clinton 
Administration's welfare reform plan, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) on 
Wednesday had the satisfied air of a man finally collecting on a long-overdue 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 30 years ago as a young Labor Department official, Moynihan was 
denounced for a study warning that a rising rate of out-of-wedlock births 
threatened the black community. On Wednesday, he listened as Administration 
representatives and senators from both parties painted the growing rate of 
out-of-wedlock births among all races as perhaps the nation's preeminent social 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ought to be discouraging children born out of wedlock, children born to 
children, period," Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala declared 
in testimony to the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan, who previously has questioned the Administration's commitment to 
welfare reform, praised Shalala's comments as "historic" candor on an issue 
"which we have had great difficulty in addressing." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Senate hearing also showed that important differences divide 
legislators on precisely how to discourage out-of-wedlock births -- which are 
rapidly emerging as the most emotional and polarizing issue in the welfare 
reform debate. 
</P>
<P>
 While Republican Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa urged Shalala to consider 
conservative proposals to cut off benefits entirely to young women who bear 
children out of wedlock, some Democrats raised red flags about efforts to 
discourage such births by reducing benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my perspective, we have to begin to think of the positive inducements in 
addition to the penalties," said Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.). 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing marked the beginning of a long legislative process whose timetable 
and prospects are both unclear. At the session, Moynihan repeatedly indicated 
that he hopes to pass a welfare reform measure this year -- a sentiment that 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) echoed. But aides 
acknowledged that it will be extremely difficult to build a consensus for 
reform in the limited time left to Congress this year -- especially with health 
care and the world trade agreement also demanding legislators' attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Political calculations further complicate the equation. While Democratic 
moderates are generally eager to pass a welfare reform measure that they can 
trumpet in their campaigns this fall, liberals critical of Clinton's plan 
generally are inclined to delay action until next year. On the other hand, some 
liberals fear that delay will leave decisions in the hands of a more 
conservative Congress, if Republicans make expected gains in this fall's 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing Wednesday barely touched the surface of the Administration plan 
and suggested that many senators have not yet sorted out their positions on the 
complex issue. It did, however, make clear that whenever Congress considers 
reform, a top priority will be discouraging out-of-wedlock births. Such births 
now constitute about 30% of all births in America -- about one in five for 
whites, and two in three for African Americans, according to the National 
Center for Health Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, Democrats generally have condemned those who have criticized the 
trend -- such as former Vice President Dan Quayle -- as racist, sexist or both. 
But Clinton has repeatedly raised concerns about the numbers and the hearing 
showed that Democrats appear increasingly comfortable following his lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In its plan, the Administration has proposed a series of measures to 
discourage out-of-wedlock births. It would launch a nationwide education 
campaign against teen-age pregnancy, prohibit women under 18 from establishing 
their own households with welfare grants and give states blanket approval to 
deny additional benefits to women who have additional children while on 
welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing, Shalala, who resisted that so-called "family cap" proposal in 
the Administration's internal deliberations, gave it a decidedly lukewarm 
endorsement. At several points, she declared that there is "no evidence" a 
family cap would discourage women on welfare from bearing additional children. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shalala endorsed the idea as an important signal of public concern about 
out-of-wedlock births. "By raising the issue we also make a very clear 
statement about behavior, about the appropriateness of . . . out-of-wedlock 
births and about family responsibility," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, New Jersey became the first state to implement a family cap 
proposal. Early figures suggest that it may be reducing the number of births to 
women on welfare but the state's governor, Christine Todd Whitman, said this 
week that "it really is too early" to assess the program's impact. 
</P>
<P>
 For liberal constituency groups and legislators, the family cap has emerged as 
an even greater source of concern than the Administration's proposal that 
younger welfare recipients be required to accept work after two years on the 
rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Those concerns were evident in remarks at the hearing from Bradley and Sen. 
John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), both of whom questioned the focus on 
denying welfare benefits as a means of discouraging births out of wedlock. Even 
Moynihan questioned the fairness of the family cap: "It's very hard to blame an 
18-month-old child . . . for its behavior," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the House overwhelmingly went on record Wednesday in favor of a 
controversial provision in the Senate-passed crime bill that is intended to cut 
off welfare and other benefits to illegal immigrants and others not lawfully in 
the United States. The vote was 289 to 121. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents charged that the non-binding instruction to Senate-House crime bill 
conferees was a politically inspired sham that would not affect illegal 
immigrants but would deny benefits to at least 100,000 American Samoans who are 
entitled to them. But advocates insisted that passage of the measure would halt 
an unjustified federal "giveaway" to those who had no right to be in the 
country.

MYSTERY PRESIDES OVER WHO WILL BE SIMPSON CASE JUDGE; COURTS: ONE OF NINE 
JURISTS WILL SOON BE SEEN DAILY ON LIVE TV. EXPERTS SAY AN EVEN TEMPERAMENT IS 
ESSENTIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Somewhere on the ninth floor of the Los Angeles Criminal Courts Building sits 
a judge who is about to be vaulted out of relative obscurity into international 
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 One of nine judges who preside over long cases on that high-security floor is 
likely to be named next week as the trial judge in the case of People vs. 
Orenthal James Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge who presides over the O.J. Simpson murder case "will become the most 
famous trial judge in this country because every day millions upon millions of 
Americans will be watching his or her every move," said UCLA criminal law 
professor Peter Arenella. 
</P>
<P>
 For a judge, such an assignment offers both opportunity and peril. Just as 
Washington federal trial judge John Sirica is remembered for deftly handling 
the case of the Watergate burglars, Chicago federal trial judge Julius Hoffman 
is recalled as an intemperate figure for the way he presided over the trial of 
seven anti-war activists who organized massive protests at the 1968 Democratic 
Convention in Chicago. Five of the defendants were found guilty, but an appeals 
court reversed the convictions, in part because of what it called Hoffman's 
"deprecatory and often antagonistic attitude toward the defense." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge in the Simpson case may have a tougher job than Sirica or Hoffman 
because those cases -- important as they were -- were not televised. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some judges who would love to have this case," said Superior Court 
Judge Robert J. Perry, one of the nine under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Others would find it extremely difficult to be in the glare of the 
spotlight," said Perry, who was one of the prosecutors in the federal 
government's unsuccessful 1984 cocaine conspiracy case against auto mogul John 
Z. DeLorean. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judges basically work in obscurity; you get your name in the paper when you 
sentence someone," Perry said. The global scrutiny of the Simpson case poses an 
added burden, he said: "The judge who ends up with this case ends up 
representing all the judges. Keep in mind, judges here have to run for 
reelection." 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Curtis B. Rappe, who presided over the Cotton Club and 
Eddie Nash murder cases but is not in the running for the Simpson assignment, 
said he thought many judges could cope with the pressures of the former 
football star's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm struck by the judges who get these high-visibility cases. They don't seem 
awed by them," Rappe said. "When it comes down to it, you settle in very 
quickly. You have the cameras in the courtroom, but when I did those cases I 
didn't watch them on TV at night. You're really not a TV star; you're a judge. 
That's it." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Rappe, who became a judge in 1987: "The legal issues don't change if 
it's this case or a routine burglary." 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates for the Simpson case are all "long cause" judges who handle 
lengthy, complex cases, according to Marcia Skolnick, spokeswoman for Presiding 
Judge Cecil J. Mills. Getting such an assignment is a sign that the judge is 
highly regarded by his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Rappe said it was particularly important for such a judge to get the case 
because he or she does not have a regular calendar of cases. "You'll have top 
flight attorneys on both sides raising every issue," and the judge will need 
extra time for research, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Mills, speaking through spokeswoman Skolnick, said he has made 
no decision about who will preside over the Simpson case. He said no 
announcement will be made until Simpson's July 22 arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Municipal Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell ruled that there was 
sufficient evidence to bind Simpson over for trial on charges that he murdered 
his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills is not saying anything publicly about his selection process. People 
familiar with his decision-making style said he is likely to narrow the field 
to two or three before he makes a final choice. Sources also say that his 
second-in-command, Superior Court Judge Lance Ito, is likely to play a role in 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
 One judge, who asked not to be identified, said he thought Mills will probably 
try at least informally to learn the leanings of prosecutors and defense 
attorneys. That way he could avoid the possibility that the judge would be 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Each side can reject one judge without stating any cause. If either wants to 
eliminate another judge, it has to show why the judge is not fit to hear the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers and other legal experts said the judge should have intelligence, 
independence, a strong sense of fairness, considerable composure and a measured 
temperament. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want a judge who is unflappable because of the pressure, both personal 
and professional," said criminal defense lawyer Gerald L. Chaleff, who 
represented Angelo Buono, the man convicted of nine murders in the 1983 
Hillside Strangler case. "You want someone who is fair, but in control, 
evenhanded, but allows the lawyers to try their case." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how experienced the judge, "this case will be different than any 
other case this judge has handled" because of the overwhelming media attention, 
Chaleff said. He said the judge will have to cope with the pressures of a 
widely watched proceeding while making sure that the trial is conducted fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important characteristics are maturity, balance, fairness, a certain 
sense of calm and tranquillity, and comfort with chaos," said Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Alexander Williams, a former federal prosecutor who 
currently is hearing civil cases and is not a candidate for the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys and law professors alike said the judge needs to be analytically 
nimble. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the trial starts, the judge will have to deal with several "very 
interesting and open-ended questions of law," Arenella said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, there will be a major pretrial battle over whether DNA testing 
is admitted," Arenella predicted. "California appellate cases on this issue are 
in conflict. To understand the issues in DNA testing requires a certain degree 
of intelligence. There is a great deal of scientific controversy over very 
subtle points of scientific methodology and reliability." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the trial begins, the judge will need a strong knowledge of the rules of 
evidence because "there are so many decisions the judge will have to make so 
quickly," said Loyola law school professor Laurie Levenson. 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "You need a judge who is neither intimidated by nor plays to the 
television cameras." 
</P>
<P>
 Another qualification: a thick skin. Arenella said the judge should be 
"someone who is not sensitive to the constant Monday morning quarterbacking and 
criticism that the Simpson case will be subjected to by media commentators." 
</P>
<P>
 Also essential is the ability to keep control of the courtroom, said Loyola 
law school professor Samuel H. Pillsbury, a former prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 "As in any case that is hotly contested, both sides are going to be trying to 
take control of the courtroom," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very hard thing to explain because the judge is always in charge. But 
there is a subtle process by which things are negotiated in a courtroom. One 
sign of a judge who is in control is that you don't notice it. There aren't 
enormous battles," Pillsbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 In courthouse circles, a frequently named front-runner for the case is Judge 
Paul G. Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
 He has presided in several noteworthy cases. In May, 1991, Flynn sentenced an 
Echo Park man to 13 years in prison for voluntary manslaughter after he killed 
his former wife -- who had moved back into his home -- and her lover as they 
lay in bed watching an X-rated video. In April, Flynn ruled that rapper Snoop 
Doggy Dogg and two other men must stand trial in the 1993 murder of an 
Ethiopian immigrant. s He was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, 43, is considered a long shot because he has been on the bench for less 
time than any of the others (he was appointed in 1992 by Gov. Pete Wilson) and 
because Simpson's original attorney, Howard Weitzman, was one of the lawyers 
who opposed Perry when he prosecuted the De Lorean case. 
</P>
<P>
 The other contenders are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Nancy M. Brown, 58, a veteran Superior Court judge with a strong reputation 
for independence. She presided over the preliminary hearing in the 1980 Bob's 
Big Boy restaurant murders, in which four people were killed and five were 
wounded in a freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Charles E. Horan, 43, a former prosecutor in the district attorney's major 
narcotics unit, who used to play in a rock 'n' roll band called "Use a Guitar, 
Go to Prison." 
</P>
<P>
 * Jacqueline A. Connor, 42, a former deputy district attorney who started the 
office's sexual assault unit. While supervising judge of the West Los Angeles 
branch of the Municipal Court, she attempted to organize a program to improve 
relations between police officers and people charged with resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 * John W. Ouderkirk, 52, who presided over the trial of Damian Monroe 
Williams, convicted in the beating of trucker Reginald O. Denny on the first 
day of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 * William R. Pounders, 55, who presided over the first McMartin Pre-school 
trial. He was replaced for the second trial after speaking on television about 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 * J.D. Smith, 58, a former police officer, who has been a judge since 1982. 
Last year, after defense lawyers asserted that the district attorney's office 
tampered with witnesses and withheld evidence, Smith agreed to send the "Bryant 
family" drug and murder case to the attorney general's office for prosecution, 
but a state appeals court ruled in March that he had overstepped his authority 
and returned the prosecution to the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 * George W. Trammel III, 57, who has the longest tenure of any of the 
candidates. He started as a Municipal Court judge in 1971, where he declared 
that municipal jury panels discriminated against Latinos, and moved to the 
Superior Court in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the high-publicity criminal trials in the Criminal Courts Building are 
held on the ninth floor because court officials can maintain tighter security 
there than in other parts of the building. The ninth floor was the setting for 
Simpson's preliminary hearing.

TENS OF THOUSANDS FLEEING RWANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of Rwandan refugees, mainly emaciated Hutu women and 
children, began crossing into eastern Zaire on Wednesday as rebel Tutsis 
intensified their advance against the remnants of Rwanda's government. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid agencies in Goma said the refugees had trekked into a game park to the 
north of the town Wednesday at a rate of 10,000 people an hour and many more 
were still coming."It's simply overwhelming," an aid worker told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in 
Goma said as many as 100,000 had crossed the only frontier still controlled by 
Rwanda's rump government. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalists returning from the area estimated 150,000 refugees had crossed 
into impoverished Zaire, taking over fields and gardens and cutting down trees. 
Local Zairians were taking flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Local authorities said they feared as many as 500,000 refugees, fleeing a 
3-month-old civil war in Rwanda, would cross into Zaire in the next few days. 
Most of the refugees are members of Rwanda's majority Hutu tribe, whose 
government troops and militia have killed hundreds of thousands of Tutsis in a 
campaign of genocide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front is set to form a government. Prime 
Minister-designate Faustin Twagiramungu is expected to arrive today in the 
capital, Kigali.

IDEA OF SEOUL CONDOLENCES FOR KIM IGNITES AN UPROAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The mere idea that South Korean President Kim Young Sam might express 
condolences to North Korea on the death of leader Kim Il Sung -- as President 
Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama did -- sent shock waves 
through mainstream society here. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the National Assembly members who made the suggestion 
apologized, one after another, while the opposition Democratic Party disavowed 
itself from the proposals for the fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
 The uproar emphasized how far from reconciliation the two halves of a nation 
with 4,300 years of history remain after 49 years of division and a bloody war 
launched by Kim Il Sung that killed more than 1.1 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Rep. Lee Bu Young, a deputy leader of the opposition party, asked 
the South Korean unification minister if the government would dispatch a 
mission to Kim Il Sung's funeral Sunday and express its condolences. Three 
other opposition legislators followed with similar questions. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a storm of protest phone calls to the party's headquarters, Lee on 
Wednesday issued a statement saying that he had not intended to suggest 
"mourning for Kim Il Sung's death." 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather, by showing our generosity and intent to seek reconciliation, my 
questions aimed to have South Korea take the initiative in promoting 
South-North dialogue," he said. "It is a strategic necessity to contact the new 
government in the North as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mourning for Kim Il Sung may lead to the theory that is often heard to 
justify the Korean War as a national liberation war," ruling Democratic Liberal 
Party spokesman Park Bum Jin said. "I don't think our people will accept this 
distortion of history." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the government never considered offering condolences. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Democratic Liberal Party representatives also have criticized 
Clinton's condolences, as have members of the U.S. Republican Party. More than 
50,000 Americans died in the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama, meanwhile, was expected to face sharp questions about his message of 
condolence when he visits Seoul on July 23-24. His Socialist Party has long 
favored North Korea over South Korea and maintained friendly ties with Kim Il 
Sung's Korean Workers' Party.

JUMPIN' JUPITER -- IS THIS THE END OF THE WORLD?; ASTRONOMY: WE MAY NOT SEE

 Planetary bombardment can be a humbling experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually unnoticed between the Three Tenors concert on Saturday and O.J. 
Simpson's scheduled arraignment on July 22, a chorus of comets will pummel 
Jupiter with the force of a million H-bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, you're probably wondering: What's in it for me? 
</P>
<P>
 If you're an astronomer, it will be a once-in-a-lifetime chance to glimpse the 
kind of cataclysm that might have wiped out the dinosaurs and paved the way for 
human life. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the scores of interstellar looky-loos hoping for a piece of the cosmic 
action, it may be a disappointment. For sheer entertainment value, say several 
veteran astronomers, the Home Shopping Network may be more promising. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be about as spectacular as pricking an apple with a needle," said 
Gibson Reaves, USC astronomy professor emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this dour forecast -- one shared by the majority of serious stargazers 
-- a bustling comet subculture has burgeoned in recent months. It's like some 
surreal cafe in the deep backwaters of space where Internet junkies meet 
religious mystics, armchair space travelers shake hands with their sci-fi 
heroes and an 11-year-old boy convinces a South Dakota community that doom is 
not at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 These people don't want to know the odds, that the chances of catching the 
fury of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet are indeed dim. 
</P>
<P>
 Jupiter, while not quite billions and billions of miles from Earth, is hardly 
a weekend drive away. The comet will hit Jove's dark side, out of the sight of 
even the mighty Hubble Space Telescope. To catch a live shot, earthbound 
astronomers must rely on the odd chance that a fireball will reflect off one of 
Jupiter's moons. And because of a faulty antenna, the Galileo space probe, 
which is in a perfect spot to view the festivities, will not transmit pictures 
of the 5 1/2-day crash until August, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, some data suggest that the 20-odd cometary fragments may break up 
before impact with Jupiter's turbulent atmosphere. By that time, some 
scientists say, the comets could be reduced to celestial dust bunnies. 
</P>
<P>
 But that hasn't stopped people "who know the situation" from buying telescopes 
in droves, said Nick Patel of Scope City in Costa Mesa. And John Mosley, a 
Griffith Observatory astronomer, continues to be bombarded by strange 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone asked me today what kind of eye protection he should wear," Mosley 
said. "People have asked what kind of telescope filter should they use. Those 
people are off by some 30 orders of magnitude." 
</P>
<P>
 For non-scientists, that's "about a godzillian." 
</P>
<P>
 The electronic superhighway has been jammed with pet theories about the event 
as well as invitations to comet parties around the globe. As one traveler, 
identified only as "Mingtoy," explained: "It would be pretty cool if something 
spectacular happened out there in my lifetime. I'm not getting any younger." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a seduction scene from a 1940s movie, the thrill for many comet-watchers 
lies in what's left to the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Few people understand that as well as Larry Niven, the science fiction legend 
whose "Lucifer's Hammer" has become a focal point for discussion in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In that novel, co-written by Jerry Pournelle, Niven envisioned an Earth under 
attack from comets hurtling through space. Now, like scores of amateur 
astronomers watching Shoemaker-Levy, Niven is thinking in "what ifs." What if, 
for instance, the comet is not a string of 20 fragments, but one chunk the size 
of a moon? 
</P>
<P>
 It would, he muses, fire the planet to an unimaginable temperature, emitting 
enough heat to warm one of Jupiter's moons and possibly facilitate human life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can picture it," he said. "A colony on a moon of red-hot Jupiter, so 
visually arresting with that great big, gaudy red thing flying around. Your 
grandmother could literally float in the gravitational pull of (the moon) 
Ganymede. Give her swimming fins and a hang glider and she could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I am much too busy to write such a book, but its a neatsy idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Here on the home planet, the Jupiter rendezvous has caused some very real 
Angst in the ultra-orthodox Lubavitch community, still reeling from the death 
last month of its New York City spiritual leader, Rebbe Menachem Mendel 
Schneerson. 
</P>
<P>
 Believing the rebbe to be the Messiah, many followers have eagerly embraced 
stories linking the comet to an obscure medieval prophecy in the Zohar, a book 
of Jewish mysticism. 
</P>
<P>
 They believe the work says that the coming of the Messiah will be presaged by 
a bombardment of Jupiter. A tract refers to a "cosmic pillar" of fire hitting 
an eastern planet "shining in all its colors," which will announce the savior's 
arrival. And to be sure, the cometary bombardments on July 21 will mark 40 days 
since Schneerson's death -- the 40 days after which, according to messianic 
lore, the savior will rise from the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if one accepts the validity of the Zohar, said Judaic studies professor 
Elliot Wolfson of New York University, "it's a stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Zohar references were noticeably absent from the weekly taped message 
on the sect's toll-free Messiah hot line -- (800) 4-MOSHIACH -- Rabbi Yosef 
Mishulovin of Los Angeles acknowledged that the prophecy has prompted "a lot of 
talk." His own feelings are ambivalent: "If it happens, it happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, when great things happen in space, fantasy and reality often 
mingle.  
</P>
<P>
 For Ted Daniels, the event has been a virtual field day. As curator of 
"Millenium Watch," a clearinghouse of revelation and news of the weird, Daniels 
has been flooded with comet-related stories. Predictions range from Judgment 
Day doom to harmonic convergence. But the jewel came from Paul Shockley, who 
wrote to Daniels' quarterly newsletter from Olympia, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 The comet crash, Shockley writes, is really a cover-up for the detonation 
aboard the Galileo of a plutonium bomb, which would turn Jupiter into another 
sun. What look to be comets, he continues, are really alien ships intent on 
monkeying with the Hubble Space Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I see," Daniels said, as he finished the letter. "It's a preemptive 
strike in a space war." 
</P>
<P>
 In some corners of the world, such news is not taken lightly. Take, for 
example, the following report on America On-Line from a South Dakota Indian 
reservation with limited access to news. 
</P>
<P>
 An alarmed writer, identified only as "Wolfmed," said: "Students came into 
class and claimed that an asteroid was going to impact with Jupiter and destroy 
the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Enlightenment came in the form of one Marshall Fowler, who described himself 
as "a fifth-grade student at Abel Elementary School in Sarasota, Fla." Reports 
of the Earth's demise, he said, were premature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe there is anything to worry about," he said. "It hasn't even 
been in the media."

BEAUTY BY THE YARD; ACCESSORIES FOR THE GARDEN ARE GETTING ARTSIER AND BIGGER 
-- MUCH BIGGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Say the words yard art and property values plummet. For many, they connote 
cast-iron lawn jockeys and ceramic sombrero-wearers in a siesta pose, both 
terribly passe and politically incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 The decorated yard got a bad reputation when overzealous practitioners refused 
to stop with just one gewgaw and filled their landscapes with bunnies, burros 
and wishing wells. Excess gave the movement a bad name, and in the '60s these 
tchotchkes joined Elvis on velvet in the kitsch closet of the art world. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything even slightly reeking of the stench of yard art was relegated for 
several decades to the rear aisles of garden shops. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Pucci prints and boomerang-shaped tables can come around again, so can 
yard art. It's back in a '90s kind of culturally sensitive, environmentally 
considerate and, in some cases, quite whimsical way. 
</P>
<P>
 Landscape designers call this new incarnation the "garden ornament" (probably 
looks classier on the invoice), and they are using large, stately, often pricey 
pieces in some of the finest back yards in town. And in the two- or 
three-figure realm, stores that specialize in garden supplies are dragging 
their decorative bird feeders, fountains and ceramic bovines up front, within 
sight of the cash registers. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden art is being reintroduced because it adds drama, texture and color. It 
can be colossally extravagant or incredibly modest. It can be the focal point 
or a hidden treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most notable aspects of the new yard art is its scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Landscape architect Mia Lehrer of Lehrer Architects and BLS Design in Los 
Angeles has decorated yards with urns that stand taller than an NBA forward, 
and stone balls the size of weather balloons. "The sense of scale has changed a 
lot," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, the new outdoor art is combined with water and lighting to perform a 
dual function. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pacific Palisades back yard of Charles Eglee and Ninkey Dalton, 
landscape architect Robert Steiner placed a ceramic pot pond-side and plumbed 
it for a fountain. Glazed a brilliant orange, the pot matches the slippery koi 
that circle beneath. 
</P>
<P>
 And Los Angeles architect Mark Rios of Rios Associates designed massive stone 
urns with portals of light for a Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
 Rios has also created outdoor furniture that borders on the sculptural, such 
as a long, undulating bright yellow bench for a large garden with a huge 
expanse of lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our product design came about because of deficiencies in the 
marketplace. Garden furniture was boring," says Rios, who is making more of the 
caterpillar benches to keep up with demand. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the custom-made pieces are more humble. For another client's vegetable 
garden, Rios created a bean pole shaped like an oil derrick. On top of the 
derrick twirls a metal carrot-shaped wind vane, and on top of the carrot is a 
spigot capable of watering the entire garden. 
</P>
<P>
 But such fanciful pieces are rare. Few, it seems, have the nerve to decorate 
their lawns with bowling balls instead of specimen plants, as record producer 
Allie Willis has done in Studio City. Or to turn their front yards into shrines 
to Snow White, as Robert Cohen, a senior vice president of Paramount Pictures 
who lives in Venice, has done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snow White, of course, represents the eventual and inevitable triumph of love 
over evil, always so important an object lesson to hold onto when dealing with 
Hollywood agents," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 One proponent of the nothing-is-sacred approach is Jay Griffith. The yard 
surrounding his Venice landscape design office is littered with treasures just 
waiting for the right home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a roiling, boiling cesspool of garden ornament," Griffith says proudly 
of his collection. Among the prized possessions is a three-dimensional gold 
arrow the size of a subcompact car and a shed-sized Aladdin's lamp from a movie 
theater. Both are wired for lights -- again, dual-purpose yard art. 
</P>
<P>
 For his own garden, Griffith is creating a life-sized rendition of the Mad 
Hatter's tea party. In the back yard of his neighbors, graphic designers 
Charles Bennett and Kathleen Cornell, Griffith fashioned a 20-foot-tall stage. 
Iron beams support curtains made of pleated wire netting with a swag of brass 
screen. Bougainvillea climbs the wings. Rolling around the lawn is a disco 
mirror ball. And off to the east, in a shady corner of the palm court, is a 
treasure chest that hints of a pirate's plunder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For yard-art enthusiasts who prefer to do their own decorating, contemporary 
versions of classic garden ornaments can be had at retail stores. And large but 
simply shaped fountains, bells and gongs by Washington state artist Tom Torrens 
are sold at Armstrong's, the Home and Garden Place in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always liked doing things for outdoor use. I like the functional 
overtones of adding sound, and therefore I do a lot of ringing devices, bells 
and gongs," says Torrens, once a gallery-represented sculptor. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking his work from the galleries and placing it in the back yard proved to 
be lucrative. "It opened up a wide range of markets when we went from the 
gallery, which was austere and intimidating to the more public aspect of yard 
art. With the added functionalism, the pieces were no longer considered fine 
art, but moved closer to a craft." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a stigma attached to outdoor artworks, which may explain why the 
retail market is lacking in well-designed pieces. And, who knows, in a few 
years, today's oversized urns may join Elvis in the closet, or bob for years in 
Griffith's cesspool. But for now, they are having a glorious moment in the sun.

FIRST PERSON: THE PERFECT PLACE FOR AN IMPERFECT SOCCER 'STAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was on the soccer field, playing alongside some of the top figures in the 
game: 
</P>
<P>
 Dreadlocked U.S. World Cup speedster Cobi Jones taking the ball up field . . . 
his teammate, star goalie Tony Meola, shouting encouragement to me from the 
sidelines . . . former New York Cosmos star Shep Messing behind me, tending my 
team's goal . . . George Best beside me, waiting for a pass. 
</P>
<P>
 George Best. The jet-setting Irishman who in the '70s and early '80s was 
probably second only to Pele in terms of international football (that's soccer 
to us) fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones . . . Meola . . . Best. 
</P>
<P>
 This must be one serious case of World Cup delirium. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait. If this was a dream, I'd probably play brilliantly in it. 
</P>
<P>
 I stunk. 
</P>
<P>
 This was no dream. I really was playing alongside these guys, as well as 
alongside rockers Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy of the Cult, ex-Sex Pistols Steve 
Jones and Paul Cooke, "Quantum Leap's" Scott Bakula, "Acapulco Heat's" Alison 
Armitage, rappers Tone Loc and Cypress Hill's B-Real. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion was last Saturday's "Rocker Soccer" match at East L.A. College, a 
benefit for the T.J. Martell Foundation for Leukemia, Cancer and AIDS Research. 
The music industry charity -- having previously put together benefit softball, 
bowling, hockey and other celeb sporting matches -- this summer tapped into 
soccermania. 
</P>
<P>
 What you'll see on ESPN2's hourlong special about the game will probably be a 
little silly, though entertaining. (It'll air eight times, starting Saturday). 
</P>
<P>
 In the tradition of the MTV "Rock 'n' Jock" softball games, some wacky rules 
were devised to raise the game's TV-Q. At one point, Blues Saraceno, the 
guitarist for the band Poison, was flashed a red card for a penalty (a red card 
to Blues, get it?), but instead of being booted from the game had to spend the 
next five minutes playing in a straitjacket. (Just watch the show; maybe it 
will make sense there.) 
</P>
<P>
 But the spirit on the field was genuine and impressive. Veterans and novices 
alike -- people drawn from fields generally known for prima dons and donnas -- 
had flocked to the 10 or so practices held in the weeks before the game, which 
was run by three young soccer talents -- Steven Schwartzbart, Hilton Goring and 
Jeff Cole -- who generously gave their time. 
</P>
<P>
 The soccer wasn't bad. The English rockers, a broadcaster from Mexico, a 
German or two, former Hungarian women's soccer star Kati Simek -- pretty much 
everyone from somewhere other than the United States -- had grown up with the 
sport. And even a bunch of the U.S. natives had years of American Youth Soccer 
Organization experience behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 And me? 
</P>
<P>
 I opened my big mouth. I happened to be talking to Linda Archer, one of the 
event's organizers, and happened to mention that I'd grown up playing soccer, 
attending a small school in Santa Barbara. She happened to mention that they'd 
love to have me play. I happened to respond that it had been 20 years since I'd 
last played. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like riding a bicycle," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Right. Well, riding a bicycle is how I wrecked my knee the last time I tried a 
foolhardy athletic endeavor -- an attempted trip across the United States in 
the 1976 "Bikecentennial." 
</P>
<P>
 This time it was my ankle, sprained about half an hour into the first practice 
I attended. I missed all subsequent practices, but a couple of days on crutches 
is about the best upper-body workout you can get. 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of people bring speed, skill and strength to the soccer field. Thanks 
to my twist of fate, I had something better: an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 I had several excuses come game time. Because I have neither contacts nor 
geeky sports goggles and had to play without my glasses, I couldn't see. My 
two-decade layoff was longer than Meola had been playing the game. And the 
shoes they gave me were half a size too small. 
</P>
<P>
 And, oh yeah, I was never any good to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 But there I was when the opening whistle blew, stationed at the natural 
position I'd trained for throughout my youth. I was sitting on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty minutes later, though, coach Schwartzbart tossed me into the game in my 
least natural position. As a left-footer who always played on the offensive 
line, where else should I be but on the right-side defense? 
</P>
<P>
 As I watched the World Cup games on TV, I was awed by the poetry, the finesse, 
the timing, the ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 As I played on the field, I remarked on the intensity, the breathlessness, the 
pain, the humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke, playing to my left, furrowed his brow dubiously as he saw me take my 
place. I squinted downfield, myopically trying to pick out the ball in the blur 
of red and white jerseys.  
</P>
<P>
 Just as I saw it, I saw it headed in my direction, propelled by a very fast, 
healthy young man. I set my feet and steeled my will. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Which turned out to be the wrong thing to do. This guy pushed the ball just 
out of reach to my left, breezed by me on the right and -- while I stood 
flat-footed -- drove toward the goal, leaving Cooke to sprint over and save my 
can, preventing a sure point against us. 
</P>
<P>
 But next time the ball came my way -- with Cooke yelling at me, "Go to it!" -- 
I did just that, forcing a bad pass as I charged at the oncoming player. It 
wasn't exactly a sliding tackle to prevent a goal, but it was something. Next 
time I went to it even harder, and next time after that I used my body a little 
to force someone away from the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt part of a team, part of the game. It made no difference who won the 
game (although my team won). 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, I even touched the ball once.

BY DESIGN; HAT TRICKS; ELISA BALLESTAS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE WOMEN WHO LOOKS 
GREAT IN ANY HAT. HER IDEAS CAN HELP OTHERS DO THE SAME.

 Hats can be a sore subject. Every time designers declare that the "hat is 
back," many of us groan and think how nice it would be to wear one well. Truth 
is, few women do. Bad examples abound -- witness the occasional attempts by 
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 But women such as Elisa Ballestas give us hope, as Jacqueline Kennedy in her 
pillbox and Audrey Hepburn in her wide-as-a-doorway chapeau once did. A hat 
lover for 30 years, since age 7, Ballestas imported hats briefly several years 
ago from her native Colombia. Now, the Westlake Village resident is not a 
businesswoman but rather a student at Santa Monica College. 
</P>
<P>
 While others think of hats as superfluous and antiquated bits of costuming, 
she revolves her wardrobe around a collection of 60 or so boaters and berets, 
cloches and creased crown felts. Ballestas says she wears hats 80% of the time, 
to weddings, funerals, bar mitzvahs, church services, horse races, garden 
parties -- even to class. 
</P>
<P>
 Doing so gives her, and any other wearer, instant status, she says. "People 
assume you're somebody. Cars even drive slower in the next lane." 
</P>
<P>
 But even if she didn't turn heads, Ballestas would wear hats for the fun of 
it. "Clothing has been so boring" for the last few years, she says, but 
millinery is always changing. "Designers like Eric Javits are making hats that 
are affordable and wearable." (Other labels in her collection include Oscar de 
la Renta, Kokin, David Cohen and the local Ariane Millinery.) 
</P>
<P>
 In Ballestas' mind, the only thing that doesn't pair well with a hat is 
timidity. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be more self-assured to wear a hat," she says. "The moment you 
don't care what people think about you is the moment you've arrived." Where to 
Find a Good Hat

BY DESIGN; AVOIDING THOSE BAD HAT DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN SAJBEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pulling off a high-fashion hat requires a certain attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call for personality. You have to keep your chin up and your head 
movements have to flow from your shoulders," says Elisa Ballestas, who has vast 
experience in these matters. "If you wear an outrageous hat, you arrive a few 
minutes late. You don't want to be seated when other people are coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who know little about hats -- and don't have the guts to make a 
dramatic entrance -- Ballestas offers the following advice: The Do's 
</P>
<P>
 * Start with a basic shape, preferably one with a small to medium brim. "A big 
brim will scare you to death." Wear that hat for several months before trying a 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Choose your first hat to coordinate with your current wardrobe." It might 
be romantic, tailored, classic, vintage or outrageous. "Lots of women see a 
great hat, buy it and find they don't have anything to wear with it." 
</P>
<P>
 * Start experimenting now with a great summer basic: a medium-brim straw hat 
in a neutral or natural color. In winter, try a beret with casual clothes. 
(Winter suits require serious hats.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Master the try-on technique. Place the front of the hat on the forehead, 
with the brim about two inches above the eyebrows, then rock it back on the 
head. Tilt it a little to find the best angle for your face. "You don't have to 
wear the hat the way it was designed." 
</P>
<P>
 * Expect to pay $100 for a good hat. Some designer styles cost $300 or more. 
But don't overlook street fairs and flea markets, where fun or funky hats can 
be had for $20. 
</P>
<P>
 * Choose an evening hat in velvet or with such decorative details as sequins, 
feathers or net. "Otherwise you're saying one thing on your head and another on 
your body." The Don'ts 
</P>
<P>
 * "Wear a large-brim straw hat at night. It doesn't go because a large brim 
calls for sun." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Send mixed messages." A flowered hat paired with a fitted suit, for 
example. "A flowered hat needs a sun dress or a flowing dress." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Show your hair while wearing a hat." The lone modern exception is the 
beret, which can be worn with long and loose hair. For other styles, tuck hair 
in, bangs and all, or pull it back into a low bun or ponytail. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allow jewelry to overwhelm. Earrings should be small and inconspicuous. 
Necklaces should be as understated as a long strand of pearls or small gold 
choker. MAUREEN SAJBEL

PUTTIN' ON THE DOG

<P>
 When it comes to jockeying for position in the political American Kennel Club 
hierarchy, it's a dog-eat-dog world. Never underestimate the ingenuity of 
professional groomers when it comes to turning Muffy and Fluffy into Madonna 
and Fabio.Keep in mind that the use of many of the following products in a show 
ring is considered cheating, and most are not recommended for amateur 
beauticians. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpha Kerry Bath Oil: Mixed with conditioner to moisturize coats. Saturate dog 
and blow-dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Avon Skin So Soft: For warding off fleas and ticks. (Don't use it if you are 
showing your dog -- it's much too oily.) 
</P>
<P>
 Clairol hair color: For touching up a dog's coat. Use a semi-permanent color, 
because permanent dye will turn a dog's hair brown or orange in the sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Clown makeup: To enhance poodle faces, available at theatrical, magic and 
costume shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Deli paper: The type used to wrap submarine sandwiches -- to keep outer ears 
clean. Some use plastic bags, but hair breathes better with paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyeliner: For making eyes look as big as water bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabrege Grand Finale Hair Spray: It's everywhere at dog shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder With Cornstarch: For whitening dog's coat. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsford's Corn Starch: For blotting oil from coats and for whitening. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybelline Great Lash Mascara: For darkening a muzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Stewart's Bluing: For use on white poodles. 
</P>
<P>
 Niagara Spray Sizing: Sprayed on the hocks of collies, Belgian Tervurens and 
other hairy herding dogs to make hair stand out. KATHIE JENKINS

FROM PLAIN POOCHES TO TOP DOGS; THINK THESE SHOWSTOPPERS WAKE UP LOOKIN' GOOD?

 King, black and big-chested, tugs at the bib around his neck. His nose is 
dripping, and the runoff threatens to ruin his coat before he re-enters the 
show ring. The 110-pound bouvier suddenly sits up, looks daggers at a stranger, 
snorts and flops back down on his grooming table. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the surrounding shady park, Irish setters in do-rags, Afghans in 
snoods and chows that take after Don King sit patiently in chin straps for 
their final touch-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 These beauties and dozens more are being shampooed, cream-rinsed, blow-dried, 
hair-sprayed and powdered into world-class creatures for the Kennel Club of 
Pasadena's recent California Classics show. Some dogs will go through just 
about anything, even wear hair extensions, to get the judges to notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, only a small percentage of the 52.5 million dogs in America would 
put up with such a routine. Fussing over almost every last one was a 
professional handler -- a dog jockey who makes a living creating winners. Rich 
backers often foot the bills -- it can cost $100,000 a year or more to campaign 
a dog on the show circuit -- in return for the trophies, fame and possible 
future stud fees.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's an ego thing," says exhibitor-groomer Andrew V. Castro of Claremont. 
"It's a contest about my dog's prettier than yours." 
</P>
<P>
 Those unfamiliar with the workings of the thousands of AKC all-breed and 
specialty shows held each year can't imagine the spraying, peroxiding and 
powdering that goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to stand too close to the collie people," one exhibitor 
cautions. "You'll cough from all the chalk (used to whiten their coats)." 
</P>
<P>
 But even dogs without perfect pedigrees, and their owners, can benefit from 
the beauty secrets of champions. Before you know it, a hang-dog doggy can be 
transformed into a mutt that looks like a million. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the beauty of the show dog circuit is skin deep -- "Yes," judges say, 
"even corgis are beautiful" -- there's probably no better place to start the 
metamorphosis than with a shampoo and a trim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go to dog shows every weekend to see what's out there, the trends," says 
Castro, who just returned from the prestigious Poodle Nationals in 
Pennsylvania. "In the '50s and '60s, poodles had tremendous coats. Now, the 
cuts are shorter and tighter, to show more leg." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro -- the owner of a boxer, seven Maltese and eight poodles -- says a good 
haircut can help camouflage imperfections. "Grooming is an optical illusion," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The right hair-care regimen can also do wonders for a dog's dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Krebs, who shows her Labrador retrievers -- Tugs, Gus and Jet -- says 
some Lab owners trim around the toes and throat to give their short-haired 
pooches more definition. "My youngest is too leggy and scrawny," she says, 
adding that judges like Labs to look like Rottweilers. "I'm always trying to 
figure out ways to build up his coat so he looks beefier." Krebs relies on 
texturizing shampoos, sprays and blow-drying to add bulk to her dog.  
</P>
<P>
 An Alaskan malamute breeder from Arizona whose dogs always show up in enviably 
thick coats had everyone wondering her secret. "Turns out they are house dogs, 
and she sets the air conditioning at 50 degrees," Krebs says. "Her electric 
bills are huge." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If time were money, the keepers of cocker spaniels might be spending even 
more. Blow-drying alone takes about three hours, says Stephanie Archuleta, a 
Lancaster breeder and handler. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go to any dog show, you can automatically pick out a total novice by 
how they groom their dogs," she says. "I feel real bad for them because judges 
don't look twice. How could they? Here's a dog all crinkled and wrinkled versus 
full and fluffy." To achieve the latter, she starts with sopping wet spaniels. 
"It's all hand brushing," she says, "from the tip of their nose to the tip of 
their tail." 
</P>
<P>
 Archuleta also brushes and combs her darlings every day, not only to stimulate 
hair growth but also to establish a meaningful relationship. "Some people will 
say, 'My dog hates to be brushed,' " she says. "I'll ask, 'How often do you do 
it?' And they say, 'When I see a tangle.' Well, I'd hate it too."  
</P>
<P>
 Louise McCann, handler and owner of three coarse-haired bouvier des Flandres, 
mists their coats with water daily and uses a lanolin conditioner on the dogs' 
faces, stomachs and legs twice a week to maintain their coats, which can't get 
enough moisture, moisture, moisture. 
</P>
<P>
 Troublesome, too, are the long, silky Afghan coats. El Cajon residents 
Rosemary and Bruce Sutton, who have been breeding and showing champions for 25 
years, designed a line of products for hairy hounds. Sutton warns against using 
human shampoo on critters. "A dog's pH balance and a human's are totally 
different, so it's better to use a good dog shampoo," she says, adding that she 
once worked as a hairdresser with Vidal Sassoon. "So that's where my hair 
knowledge -- and probably fetish -- came from." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Afghans are known as the "dumb blondes" of the dog world (the recent 
book "The Intelligence of Dogs" rated them dead last), Sutton defends the 
breed. "They are keen hunters and there's nothing froufrou about them. They 
just happen to be beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 That said, Sutton touts the snood as a fashion accessory for the glamorous 
creatures. It keeps hair out of dog food and helps prevent hair breakage. She 
also recommends using hair clips to keep the full belly hair off the ground, 
and wrapping deli paper, secured with rubber bands, around the ears to keep 
them clean. Hot oil treatments, cream rinse, corn starch (for blotting oily 
hair), Avon Skin So Soft (for fleas and ticks) and a meaty diet ("what feeds 
hair is blood," she says) make for a shiny coat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To stay in shape, Afghans and other breeds work out on the Jog-a-Dog, the 
canine kingdom's answer to a StairMaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Archuleta's pampered spaniels, on the other hand, are definitely not Susan 
Powter types. The only insanity they want stopped is their 3 a.m. wake-up call 
for dog shows. They demand their beauty sleep. "Twenty minutes in the back yard 
and they look at me as if to ask, 'Mom, can we go?' " Archuleta says. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of stage makeup also varies from breed to breed. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro recommends using clown makeup for pink-faced poodles: first a cream, 
then a powder. And then, maybe, a little eyeliner. "It makes the cutest little 
China doll face. You just have to make sure most of it is rubbed off because 
when the judge goes over (touches) the animal, he'd better not get any on his 
hands. You can be disqualified for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there's a fine line between accepting a dog for what it is and 
tampering with Mother Nature. But no one seems to agree on exactly where the 
line should be drawn. Despite the objections of animal rights activists, for 
example, the AKC allows ear cropping and tail docking. Yet it forbids the use 
of hair spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Shipp, a Beverly Hills veterinarian who specializes in animal 
dentistry (yes, some dogs wear braces) declines to do cosmetic dentistry. Any 
reputable vet would, he says. "One guy wanted four gold fangs put on his Dobie 
(Doberman pinscher), just because he wanted his dog to look different. I said, 
'No. We won't do it just for show.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One of the world's 27 board-certified veterinary dentists, Shipp says a dog's 
teeth should be brushed daily. "Nice sparkling teeth," he says, "is a good 
beauty secret." 
</P>
<P>
 As an AKC judge for 28 years, Harry Smith of Durham, N.C., has seen and heard 
just about everything: dogs with implants, dogs with hair extensions, dogs with 
nose tattoos to fill in blotches. "Most of it is illegal," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he doesn't think a little hair spray and corn starch are all that bad. 
"I don't diligently search it out. I treat (the issue) like makeup and hair 
spray on a lady. I would hate to see a woman's hair drooping down around her 
shoulders and her makeup bad -- so some of it, if it's not done to extremes, is 
not reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean he won't disqualify a phony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually search for implants on dogs whose ears are tipped to make sure they 
aren't weighted down with lead," he says. On some dogs, such as collies, the 
top of the ear should naturally tip forward. "But I haven't found any yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of implants, it seems another judge came across an odd case involving 
a dog with three testicles. Turned out the animal had only one, so his owner 
paid for cosmetic surgery. Then, the dog's missing testicle dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that," Smith says, "is something I would catch."

DRESSING UP THE YARD ON A BUDGET

 Local landscape designers offer the following suggestions to gardeners who 
want to dabble in ornamentation without making a huge financial commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Robert Steiner, of the Venice firm Griffith and Steiner, says the broken 
pieces of statues damaged in the Northridge earthquake can be used to great 
effect as a back-yard ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 He also takes square chunks of recycled concrete and piles them in a tower to 
support large vases and statuary. Concrete blocks can also be stacked to make 
supporting columns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not expensive to cut concrete, and you'd be amazed at the great things 
you can make with a pedestal and a pot if you elevate it above the bed." 
</P>
<P>
 * Mark Rios finds the easiest way to cut corners is on the "hardscaping" 
(driveways, walkways, terraces). 
</P>
<P>
 "Hardscaping is expensive. You can spend anywhere from $4 to $20 a square 
foot, depending on if it's concrete or some nice stone," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do a lot of gravel. It's really cheap. Has a nice crunchy sound. It 
accepts litter for a nice mottled effect. You can drive on it. It's softer and 
better for the environment, water goes through it. We've done a lot of gravel 
gardens." 
</P>
<P>
 * Mia Lehrer recommends stone balls and large pots, which offer the scale of 
sculpture without the price. She also likes to scour resale shops and Sunday 
flea markets for such affordable garden ornaments as old birdhouses and bird 
baths. GAILE ROBINSON

WORLD CUP USA 1994; COMMENTARY; WITH THE UNITED STATES' STAGE SET, BORA MISSES 
HIS CUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As we get close to the end of World Cup '94, a month of flag-waving and 
star-gazing over lots of people with only one name, let's flap the Stars and 
Stripes and discuss Bora. 
</P>
<P>
 Bora is not Pele. Nor is he Romario, Bebeto, Maradona, Alexi, Roberto or 
Leonardo. 
</P>
<P>
 He is Bora Milutinovic, coach of the U.S. soccer team that went to the round 
of 16 before being beaten by Bebeto and leveled by Leonardo. Bora is known only 
as Bora, mostly because having one name in soccer is a mark of singular 
stature. Also, sportswriters got tired of having to look up the spelling of 
Milutinovic. 
</P>
<P>
 Bora is much celebrated in our country. At the end of his team's 1-0 loss to 
Brazil at Stanford Stadium, television announcers gushed and gloated: What a 
wonderful thing it was for the good ol' USA to have even gotten this far. What 
a moral victory for us to hold Brazil to one goal. What a great step forward 
for soccer in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 What a lot of baloney. 
</P>
<P>
 Let it be said here that Bora blew it. 
</P>
<P>
 The dynamics of the game were as follows: Soccer was finally getting its due 
in the press and in the public. The United States' victory over Colombia was a 
national wake-up call. People were talking soccer in the men's room and the 
board room. The bizarre death of Andres Escobar, while a shocking turn-off, 
nevertheless further focused public attention on the emotional and psychotic 
grip this sport has on billions of people. And, perhaps most important for 
those who badly want soccer to be a permanent, best-selling entree on America's 
sports menu, the Brazil game would clearly attract the largest U.S. television 
audience ever for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a moment to be seized, an opportunity to be taken, a chance that 
demanded risk rather than routine. 
</P>
<P>
 So Bora played defense. Bora went the safe route, with a game plan that played 
not to win, but rather not to lose. Bora played for the fluke, the Brazilian 
mistake early that would give the United States a penalty and a lead it could 
cling to; or enough defense to somehow get into the crapshoot they call penalty 
kicks, where frequently the luckiest team -- rather than the best -- will win. 
</P>
<P>
 Bora's chances of beating Brazil were more none than slim. Nobody expected him 
to. Everybody was generally pleased that he had done what he always does with 
whatever World Cup team he happens to be coaching -- take it one notch above 
the expectation and then pack his bags and ride away as a hero, heading for 
another country, another World Cup and another soccer quick fix. Bora is a 
master of the patch, caulk and quick touch-up around the window frames. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. game against Brazil, played on the Fourth of July, needed some 
fireworks. It needed to be 3-2 or 4-2. It needed lots of runs by the U.S. team 
-- lots of chances, crosses, near misses, flying headers, posts hit. Winning 
wasn't really an issue here. It wasn't going to happen. There just wasn't 
another Andres Escobar mistake in the cards for Uncle Sam soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 So why not go down with guns blazing, instead of going through the entire game 
with only four shots on goal? Why not give those millions watching on TV in the 
United States -- a vast majority actually caring about this for the first time 
in their lives -- a hell of a show? Why not turn Eric Wynalda and Ernie Stewart 
loose? Why not let Thomas Dooley play like Italy's Dino Baggio, who is allowed 
to roam and penetrate from the midfield? 
</P>
<P>
 While the Fourth of July truly could have been the trigger for a soccer 
explosion in this country, that may happen, anyway. It appears that Alan 
Rothenberg and his people have built a solid foundation for soccer interest 
here, with their beautifully organized and run World Cup '94. But 90 minutes of 
excitement against Brazil, rather than 90 of falling back on defense and 
watching Brazil hit the post, would have enhanced greatly what Rothenberg has 
begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Bora was in control of a moment when big picture counted more than little, 
when marketing his sport was the most important thing, because winning wasn't a 
viable option. But Bora blew it. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be interesting to see what happens now, when the flags stop waving and 
Bebeto and Romario and their friends go off somewhere in search of a second 
name. It will be interesting to see if Bora stays on, or is asked to stay on, 
to head the U.S. program. His charm, charisma, knowledge of the international 
game and delightful fake broken English could make him an ongoing celebrity on 
the U.S. sports scene. 
</P>
<P>
 My guess is that he'll go back to Mexico, which is furious with his friend 
Miguel Mejia Baron; which has an established talent pool; which cares about 
little else in sports; which is very free with the peso for things like this 
and which probably can make the quarterfinals of World Cup '98 with just one 
quick coat.

WORLD CUP USA 1994; THE BEST AND THE WORST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OOO BABY, BABY: You've seen athletes mug for the camera with a "Hi Mom" or 
two? Well, the Brazilians provided the dance highlight of the World Cup with a 
tribute to star forward Bebeto's newborn son, Mattheus. In a shuffle that would 
make Smokey Robinson and the Miracles proud, Bebeto, Romario and Mazinho 
celebrated a goal against the Netherlands by doing a cradle-rocking motion with 
their arms. It was reminiscent of a step you might learn at Arthur's, you know, 
that Murray, guy. 
</P>
<P>
 AMERICAN CUISINE: There is a vending machine inside the press center that 
pumps out hot pizza, egg rolls and chicken wings. It has drawn oohs and ahhs 
from foreign writers (calling them journalists might be a stretch), many of 
whom think this is state of the art in American fast food. The pizza is dreary 
frozen-food caliber, selling for $2 an item or $5 on media expense accounts. 
Still, the quality hasn't stopped the foreign writers from making pilgrimages 
to the "Hot Choice" machine and pouring dollar bills into it. 
</P>
<P>
 GREAT GOAL, I'LL GIVE YOU A COUNTRY: Saudi Arabia was truely one of the 
biggest surprises of the tournament. It was listed as having a 500-to-1 chance 
of winning the World Cup, the longest odds of any of the 24 finalists. With 
such success, comes perks. After it qualified for the finals, one of the head 
guys gave each player a $100,000 Mercedes. For advancing to the round of 16, 
players were given a Volvo. Wait a minute, aren't we going backward? With that 
logic, if it won the final game, the players would have all received Yugos. 
</P>
<P>
 SOCCERSPEAK: Soccer has clearly brought a new topic to daily conversations. 
People in elevators, airports and hotel lobbies are all swept up in World Cup 
excitement. In fact, one of the great ways to meet new people and strike up a 
friendship is by saying, so: "Did you think Saudi Arabia should have started Al 
Daeyea, Al Sadik or Al Helwah in goal against Morocco?" Works every time. 
</P>
<P>
 QUICK, CALL THE BOARD OF HEALTH: The time-honored practice of exchanging 
jerseys at the end of a game is one of the sport's most endearing traditions. 
It sure beats hockey's forced congratulatory handshakes at the end of a playoff 
series. But can you imagine taking a sweat-soaked jersey to the dry cleaner for 
a sprucing up job? Imagine the cost. Imagine the smell. Maybe the handshake is 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 ANDRES CANTOOOOOOOOR: If there is one enduring star of the World Cup, it is 
Andres Cantor, the man who calls "Gooooooaaaallllll" after every 
gooooooaaaallllll for Spanish language Univision. Cantor, a graduate of USC, is 
even rumored to replace the aging Tom Kelly, football television play-by-play 
voice of the Trojans. Think what a call he would make when he says, "Mercy 
Nuuuuurrrssssseeee." 
</P>
<P>
 ANOTHER BRICK IN THE . . .: It's not as historical as the one that used to be 
in Berlin, or as old as the one in China but soccer's "wall" is indeed 
memorable. No where in sports does man's innermost fears come to light than on 
this play. C'mon, we know that you know that you understand what we're talking 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 BEAUTY SCHOOL DROPOUT: What would happen if you cross the coiffeurs of 
Colombia's Carlos Valderama and Bulgaria's Iordan Letchkov? Fabio at age 50, 
perhaps. Or maybe something American International pictures would have made a 
movie about. By the way, you get extra bonus points if you can name in which 
the movie the song "Beauty School Dropout" appeared. (Hint: Look under your 
car.) 
</P>
<P>
 LOOK MA, NO ARTIFICIAL TURF: The were two agronomy rages: The grass grown for 
use indoors at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich. and the circular cut at Soldier 
Field in Chicago. We think Chicago's feat the more impressive. Its bull's-eye 
like appearance made all the other stadiums green with envy. 
</P>
<P>
 BEST BEER SALES: Ireland versus Italy in New York. And this was just before 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 DO YOU BELIEVE IN MIRACOLOS?: Roberto Baggio, with his rat-tail haircut 
flowing in the wind, is the heart and soul of the Italian team. In the second 
round he scored in the final minutes of regulation and in overtime to beat 
Nigeria and he turned the same trick in the quarterfinals to beat Spain. As 
Baggio goes, so go the Italians. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOAL DUST TWINS: How would you like to have Jim Brown and Gale Sayers in 
the same backfield? Magic and Michael in the same backcourt? Brazil has a Dream 
Team of its own in Romario and Bebeto. Or is that Bebeto and Romario. One ball 
might not be enough for them, but they make do awfully well. And they can 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
 NOT LIKE RIDING A BIKE: It would have been the most spectacular goal of the 
tournament. Marcelo Balboa was facing away from the goal against Colombia, but 
his bicycle kick went just wide. If not for TV replays, he could tell his 
grandchildren that he made it. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTHING BUT NYET: All the big scorers came through this month. But Baggio, 
Klinsmann, Romario, Bebeto, Bergkamp, Hagic, Stoitchkov and Batistuta couldn't 
match the accomplishment of Russia's Oleg Salenko on June 28 against Cameroon. 
Salenko became a one-man Big Red Scoring Machine with five goals. Of course, 
the Cameroonians might have been rolling over, since they had gone weeks 
without pay, but there have been plenty of other mismatches in the 64-year 
history of the World Cup and no one had ever done this. 
</P>
<P>
 BEST LATTE: Stanford Stadium has an espresso booth outside the press center 
that serves espresso, cappuccino, cafe latte and cafe mocha. Not bad, too. 
Apparently just the thing to wash down those cheeseburgers, fries and oversized 
M&M chocolate-chip cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 BEST POSTGAME CELEBRATION: After defeating Belgium, the Saudi Arabian team 
gathered in their locker room to weep and pray. 
</P>
<P>
 BEST POSTGAME CELEBRATION AFTER THE FIRST ROUND: Upon beating Germany in the 
quarterfinals, the Bulgarians passed around a bottle of whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
 TRUTH IN ADVERTISING*: Armadillo Willy's, a barbecue restaurant chain in the 
Bay Area, ran newspaper ads featuring "touts" from soccer luminaries. Two 
blurbs from the ad: "I've come from Brazil just to taste Real Texas BBQ!" 
signed Carlos Alberto Parreira*, Brazil Team Head Coach. Also, "Armadillo 
Willy's is the best BBQ Joint this side of the Amazon!" signed Pele* In the 
small print at the bottom "* Not exactly from the 'horse's mouth.' " 
</P>
<P>
 BEST IMPROVISER: After the back of their goal collapsed in a second-round game 
against Bulgaria, Mexican goalkeeper Jorge Campos tried to convince the referee 
to continue play with one side of the net held up by a nearby microphone stand. 
The referee eventually replaced the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 BEST OHHHHHHHS: When Bulgaria's Trifon Ivanov received a sharply kicked ball 
between the legs in the quarterfinal against Germany, forcing him to leave the 
game on a stretcher, more than 70,000 people "ohhhed" not once, but twice at 
the replays. When Ivanov finally limped back on to the field, every man and boy 
in the stands applauded. 
</P>
<P>
 ESCOBAR REACTION: Watching fans unfurl a banner honoring murdered Colombian 
defender Andres Escobar and hearing them begin an impromptu chant of 
"Es-co-bar!"

WORLD CUP USA 1994; THE BEST AND THE WORST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 WORST IMPROVISERS: Looking for something to wave, the Dutch fans decided upon 
giant inflatable orange hammers. 
</P>
<P>
 YEAH, AND VAN DAMME SHOULD HAVE AN OSCAR: In performances that belonged on the 
Midwest dinner theater circuit, players repeatedly flopped like fish on a dock 
in attempts to induce a foul call against an opponent. The dives usually didn't 
play with referees, and they were embarrassing. If we want bad acting, we'll 
watch "Saved by the Bell" reruns. 
</P>
<P>
 ON A CLEAR DAY, YOU CAN SEE ROW 42: For the Argentina-Romania game at the Rose 
Bowl, the smog was so bad that it was impossible to see the San Gabriel 
mountains from seats inside the stadium. For U.S.-Romania, with on-field 
temperature reaching 120 degrees, the smog nearly wiped out the Romanian 
players, who scored early and labored to hold on, 1-0. Gheorghe Hagi gasped: "I 
don't remember such a heat." Oh, come on, Gheorghe, AQMD would probably call it 
a little late-afternoon haze. 
</P>
<P>
 SPOTLIGHT READERS WILL UNDERSTAND: Esteemed Times columnist Mike Downey, 
usually a rather positive person, found five things wrong with this World Cup: 
1 -- Opponents 10, Greeks 0; 2 -- The referee's call that fleeced Belgium; 3 -- 
Diana Ross kicking a ball at the opening ceremony; 4 -- "Best and Worst" lists 
about the World Cup; 5 -- Simon Barnes of the Times of London. 
</P>
<P>
 IT WAS HOT IN JUNE AND JULY, WHAT'S NEW?: It doesn't take a meteorological 
wizard to tell you that if you play a game in the United States in the middle 
of summer in the middle of the day, it's going to be hot. What's the surprise? 
The teams didn't know Chicago would be hot in June? Or it would be hot at noon 
in Orlando? Or that the Rose Bowl is one of the best places on the planet on 
Jan. 1 and one of the worst on July 1? 
</P>
<P>
 HOW 'BOUT THEM COWBOYS!: Dallas has a lot of soccer lovers, as proven by its 
successful annual youth tournament, one of the largest in the world. But unlike 
the rest of the venues, and most of the country as a whole, those Texans who 
didn't already like the sport failed to embrace the event as an international 
festival. They had the worst record for selling tickets and got their nose out 
of joint when it was continually pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 WORST SHOES: Ok, so pointy bright red submarines make for ugly shoes. But they 
at least have character and an element of uniqueness. Think you can get these 
at Beverly Center? Our problem was that every soccer player wore black cleats. 
No white. No blue. All black. Don't they know image is everything? 
</P>
<P>
 WHO NEEDS HEALTH CARE?: One of the most baffling aspects of the tournament has 
been players writhing on the ground before being carried off on a stretcher, 
only to return a few moments later at full speed. Could there be something else 
at work here? Are World Cup teams blessed with a faith healer on every bench? 
Perhaps. Then again, just maybe the players are exaggerating their injuries to 
catch their breath or trick the referee into giving a yellow or red card. Naw, 
that couldn't happen in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SHOW COULD HAVE USED SOME COMMERCIALS: As good as Andres Cantor has been 
calling games for Univision, the ABC and ESPN crews have been dreadfully dull. 
Jim McKay couldn't get into the spirit of things. We would also criticize his 
analyst, Desmond Armstrong, for smiling too much and being upbeat, but because 
he's doing a cartoon for us (Cobi's Offside) we won't say anything. The 
play-by-play people did not know what they were talking about, and the 
commentators were equally feeble. And besides, Roger Twibell almost ran down a 
Times reporter in a Palo Alto parking lot. That's reason enough to make the 
worst list. 
</P>
<P>
 OH, MEXICO: You don't miss three penalty kicks in the round of 16 at the World 
Cup. And you don't, like Alberto Garcia Aspe, mis-hit a ball so badly it flies 
over the crossbar. Even we know that. 
</P>
<P>
 WORST BEER SALES: Saudi Arabia versus Morocco in New York. Vendors say fans 
from these two Muslim nations were Anheuser-Busch's worst nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 WORST HAT: The cardboard fez worn by fans of Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 WORST KISSERS: The Saudi Arabian team members, who kissed their hometown 
journalists after victories. 
</P>
<P>
 INDOMITABLE MEANS NO-PAY, NO-PLAY: After its World Cup performance in 1990, 
Cameroon was one of the teams everyone was looking forward to watching. But 
after tying semifinalist Sweden and losing, 3-0, to semifinalist Brazil (see, 
those weren't as bad as you thought), the Lions went in the tank against 
Russia, losing, 6-1, and giving up a World Cup-record five goals to Pistol Oleg 
Salenko. Sure, they hadn't been paid in weeks, and the goalkeeper was thrown 
off the team for insubordination, but this embarrassment even caused one Times 
staffer to rescind his request for a Cameroon jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MOTHER OF ALL HEAD COLDS: Argentina's Diego Maradona was suspended from 
the tournament after he tested positive for five kinds of ephedrine, a drug 
used in nasal sprays to treat colds, asthma and hay fever. There seems to be no 
record kept for the all-time worst head cold or allergy attack, but we figure, 
given the amount of medication Maradona was taking, that his was among the 
worst ever. However, there is a record for sneezing. Donna Griffiths of 
Pershore, England, started sneezing on Jan. 13, 1981 and stopped on Sept. 16, 
1983. It is unknown how many times Maradona sneezed. 
</P>
<P>
 WE HATED EVITA ANYWAY: Argentina has no heart. It's that simple. After the 
suspension of Maradona, Argentina simply gave up. First it lost its final 
first-round game, 2-0, to Bulgaria, then lost to Romania, 3-2, in the round of 
16. We don't cry for you, Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 THEY COULDN'T WIN WITH ZEUS AT SWEEPER: Worst team? Well, let's put it this 
way: You could probably put 11 guys from any Greek restaurant in L.A. on the 
field and they would do better than this national team. Argentina 4, Greece 0. 
Bulgaria 4, Greece 0. Nigeria 2, Greece 0. That's 10-nil, kids. How did the 
Greeks get here in the first place? They had to beat out Iceland, Hungary and 
Luxembourg in European qualifying. Not exactly the Group of Death. 
</P>
<P>
 CHEAP SHOT? NO, THAT'S TWO WORDS: When Brazil's Leonardo made like Bill 
Laimbeer and cleared some space with an elbow, it virtually ended the World Cup 
for the United States and literally ended it for Tab Ramos, who suffered a 
concussion and a broken bone above his ear. After watching "the beautiful game" 
of Brazil, this was an ugly moment.

WORLD CUP USA 1994; COMMENTARY; BEHIND THE SCENES, NOT EVERYTHING HAS BEEN A 
SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years ago, a wink on the World Cup time line, West Germany won the Cup 
and returned in triumph to a country that began to clamor for something else. 
They had won the World Cup, now they wanted the World Cup . 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, it was hardly a secret that the American organizational efforts, 
begun in 1988 after FIFA had awarded the United States the 1994 World Cup 
finals, had been sluggish at best. The one contract landed by the organizers -- 
a TV deal -- had been rejected by FIFA. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a real concern that the United States, which had been so successful 
with the 1984 Olympic Games and other major events, would fail to adequately 
organize the World Cup. Other countries were suggested as alternates. Something 
had to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 With FIFA working behind the scenes, Los Angeles attorney Alan Rothenberg was 
elected president of the U.S. Soccer Federation and became head of the World 
Cup Organizing Committee. He impressed FIFA with his energy and sophistication 
and promised to put on the best World Cup ever and leave a legacy for soccer in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 With 50 games having been played in nine U.S. cities, after a record heat wave 
and record attendance, how will the organization of this World Cup be judged? 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans, who so coveted the event four years ago, appear pleased. Egidius 
Braun, president of the German soccer federation, had nothing but praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sensation," he said. "It will be very difficult for any other country 
in the world to do it the same way in the future. It can't be better." 
</P>
<P>
 From the perspective of the participating teams, the tournament will be viewed 
as one of the best. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated economic impact of the World Cup in the United States is $4 
billion, with a projected $623 million generated in Los Angeles. Rothenberg has 
estimated that the World Cup, whose budget has never been disclosed, will 
generate a $20-million profit. 
</P>
<P>
 By most accounts, the organization of the World Cup has been excellent. The 
biggest potential nightmare -- hooliganism -- was averted when England failed 
to qualify. Security, although present at a level most American sports fans 
find uncomfortable, has been effective and successful in heading off problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about fans' overzealous celebrations outside the stadiums haven't 
been borne out, either, even though Americans seem to have caught World Cup 
fever to a degree that few would have predicted. Attendance is at an all-time 
high and the nearly full stands are a welcome departure from the sparse crowds 
in Italy in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Also unlike Italy, no new stadiums had to be built. If the nine World Cup 
stadiums aren't specifically soccer-friendly, they are more than adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Memories inexorably linked to this World Cup are of the murder, in his own 
country, of Colombian player Andres Escobar, and of the incredible heat that 
rendered playing conditions inhumane through much of the first round. Neither 
factor was under the control of World Cup organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 But behind the festive scenes, there have been some problems. Sponsors, fans, 
the media and others report awful interaction with World Cup officials, who are 
perceived as arrogant and greedy. They represent the United States to the rest 
of the world and are charged with maintaining any interest the World Cup 
generates. 
</P>
<P>
 A legacy of ill will? 
</P>
<P>
 Nye Lavalle, chairman of the Dallas-based Sports Marketing Group, told the San 
Jose Mercury News that the World Cup organizers' abrasive style will not soon 
be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have burned bridges beyond recognition," he said. "A lot of people don't 
want to work with them anymore. When you start alienating key constituencies, 
how much support can you get for your efforts in the future?" 
</P>
<P>
 Among the problems: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tickets.  
</P>
<P>
 Easily the most widespread ill will has been generated by the botched handling 
of some of the World Cup tickets.  
</P>
<P>
 The first ticket offering was to the "soccer family," including fans who had 
written or called World Cup seeking tickets. They were offered tickets at a 
discount, as many as 10 strips. A deadline date was announced and the 
prospective buyers were told all orders would be processed, that it would not 
be a matter of first come, first served. 
</P>
<P>
 But the World Cup Organizing Committee vastly underestimated demand, and the 
program quickly became oversubscribed. The promise that all orders would be 
honored was not kept. It was first come, first served. Rothenberg's response 
was that this indicated interest in the games and was the kind of problem that 
the World Cup wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 There were many more. The high-end Premiere Ticket program was mishandled, and 
at one point orders worth more than $40 million were backlogged. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was time, in early June, to send tickets to the fans, that was bungled 
too. Some never received their tickets. Some asked for tickets to games in 
Chicago and got tickets to games in Detroit. Some asked for two seats together 
and got one on one side of the stadium, one on the other. The most common 
complaint was from fans who had bought Category I tickets and found themselves 
behind the goals. 
</P>
<P>
 In at least one case, legal action has been taken. A class-action lawsuit in 
Chicago is seeking a multimillion-dollar judgment from the WCOC on behalf of 
fans around the country who believe they were ripped off. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the final indignity. Travel agents and tour operators, who paid a 
20% surcharge for tickets and a licensing fee, looked on in horror as World Cup 
flooded the market with cheap tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sponsors.  
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of events the size of the World Cup pay millions of dollars for the 
right to use the official logo and reach a vast audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Most companies believe the money they spend on the event also buys them a 
certain deference from the World Cup organizers -- or, at least, the sense that 
they too are "on the World Cup team." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say that domestic sponsors signed by the WCOC and international 
sponsors, who made their deals with FIFA's marketing agent, are annoyed with 
what is described as the WCOC's arrogant and abrasive attitude in dealing with 
company higher-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Some World Cup sponsors are angry not only with the organizing committee but 
with each other. No company spokesman was willing to speak on the record, but 
McDonald's and electronics giant JVC are particularly miffed. Both 
contractually agreed to supply a certain number of meals and televisions to 
WCOC, and in both cases the organizing committee went back and asked for more. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of two other sponsors, MasterCard and Sprint, a lawsuit included 
the WCOC. MasterCard paid about $20 million to be the official credit card, 
then Sprint paid about $10 million to be the official telephone charge card. 
MasterCard believed the same rights had been sold twice. A U.S. District judge 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire World Cup promotional effort benefited from the performance of the 
U.S. team. No one loves a bandwagon more than the American public, unless it's 
the American media. The excitement generated by the U.S. team's advance to the 
second round propelled the World Cup into living rooms and bars where the sport 
had never been considered. 
</P>
<P>
 What promotional effort was made by World Cup? Some sponsors have griped that 
rather than spending the millions it takes to promote its own event, the WCOC 
instead piggy-backed off the advertising and marketing campaigns of its 
sponsors and relied on them to raise public awareness. The World Cup newspaper 
advertising that did run was provided on a trade-out basis with major 
newspapers that were regional sponsors, such as the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 * Accommodations.  
</P>
<P>
 There has been price gouging by the World Cup Accommodation Bureau, the 
contractor awarded the right to sell hotel packages to fans and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 There also was a problem with overbooking. About 50% of the rooms blocked for 
World Cup were released back to the hotels when it became clear that tourism 
surrounding the event was not going to be at the level projected by World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, hotels complained that the Accommodation Bureau was charging 
guests rates that were far too high. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like greed and smells like greed," said Roland Baumann, general 
manager of the Hyatt Regency Crystal City, 10 miles from Washington's RFK 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 * Broken promises.  
</P>
<P>
 The WCOC has stated, admirably, that among its goals were educational programs 
for children and outreach to minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickerson Gardens was to have been an example of minority outreach. Rothenberg 
and other World Cup dignitaries were present and available for the photo 
opportunity when the WCOC and Rebuild L.A. announced a major plan to install a 
soccer field and lights at the Watts housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 Work would begin immediately, Rothenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Was anyone at the WCOC embarrassed when, a year and a half later, the same 
World Cup group arranged a different photo opportunity at Nickerson Gardens, 
all the while standing next to the muddy and pockmarked field that had never 
been upgraded? 
</P>
<P>
 Community organizers have complained about lack of outreach from the World 
Cup, which is perceived to have a natural constituency in many ethic 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 One local leader on an L.A. radio program recently asked World Cup's managing 
director, Elizabeth Primrose-Smith, why the WCOC has failed to work with some 
community groups. Primrose-Smith responded that the WCOC was a nonprofit 
organization and, as such, employed a limited staff. They would like to get to 
every worthy group, she said, but there would have to be priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 True, but if World Cup was strapped and had no money for community work, why 
was there $5 million available to "lend" to a for-profit company for the 
formation of the proposed professional soccer league? 
</P>
<P>
 Where's the priority there?

WORLD CUP USA 1994; THE STANDARD IS SET; FRENCH RAVE ABOUT '94 AS THEY PREPARE 
TO PLAY HOST IN '98 
</P>

<P>
 We had hamburgers; they'll probably have baguettes. 
</P>
<P>
 We had nachos with cheese; they'll probably have escargots and garlic butter. 
</P>
<P>
 We drank Diet Coke; they prefer red wine. 
</P>
<P>
 We had the New Jersey swamplands; they have the Champs Elysees. 
</P>
<P>
 We made our visitors suffer through the stifling heat and humidity of midday 
games; they'll start games in the late afternoon or cool of the evening, giving 
everyone time for sightseeing in the morning and enjoying the splendors of the 
Arc de Triomphe and Eiffel Tower at night. 
</P>
<P>
 But we had American ingenuity, which has enabled officials of the 1994 World 
Cup to put on a show that is already being held up as the standard for future 
tournaments. Can they top that? 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of France '98, the committee charged with organizing the next 
tournament, have been studying every aspect of World Cup '94 closely to learn 
what to do -- and what not to do -- when their country plays host to soccer's 
biggest event. The 10-member committee, which is co-chaired by Michel Platini, 
a former international and World Cup star player, has sent delegates to absorb 
the atmosphere and watch the games at every venue. 
</P>
<P>
 They have examined and analyzed every facet of the massive operation and have 
spoken at length with World Cup '94 executives, and their verdict is in: 
</P>
<P>
 Tres bien fait.  
</P>
<P>
 Very well done. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be difficult for us to do better than the U.S.," said Gerard Ernault, 
director of communications and special events for France '98. "It will be a 
challenge for us. We have been very impressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernault has visited Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco and the Rose Bowl and was 
in Pasadena for Wednesday's semifinal between Brazil and Sweden. He and his 
fellow committee members gathered last week in Dallas to share their 
observations and attend a seminar run by Scott LeTellier, the chief operating 
officer of World Cup '94, who gave them an extensive look at what went into the 
planning and execution of the monthlong tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernault said he and his colleagues came away unanimous in their raves about 
how well U.S. organizers have pulled off this enormous undertaking, as well as 
how warmly Americans have embraced the tournament. Ernault marvels at how 
smoothly everything has gone, including factors the World Cup committee could 
not control. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a great competition, first thing," Ernault said. "It is a good 
competition because there are very large stadiums and they are very full. They 
are large, and they are full of spectators and they are under the sun. It is a 
very pleasant ambience. The games are very good. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is also less violence than in Italy in 1990 or in Mexico in 1986. What 
we saw on the TV was also very good, and I think it is good for the people to 
see such a very good competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Second, I believe it is also a good organization from World Cup '94, because 
it was a difficult thing to do. We were very impressed when we learned about 
the extent and complexity of what had to be done and what they have done. It 
(the U.S.) does not have the experience of soccer culture, and it has done a 
very good job." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a job France '98 will try to do as well, but under different 
circumstances and with its own flair. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of entrants will be expanded to 32 teams from 24, which will create 
more scheduling and logistic problems. However, Ernault believes the increase 
in contestants will make the World Cup a more representative competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be the first time so many teams have participated. It will be the 
most universal World Cup ever, in 1998," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And while there's no official theme to World Cup '94, Ernault said France '98 
will celebrate the World Cup's past, present and its future, with an emphasis 
on its French heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be the last competition of the century," he said, "and symbolically, 
for us, it's very important because the World Cup was created by a French 
person, Jules Rimet, at the beginning of the century. And it was Jules Rimet 
who created FIFA." 
</P>
<P>
 Some differences will arise of necessity. Crowds will be smaller than they 
were at games here, perhaps changing the ambience that Ernault so greatly 
admired. "We, unfortunately, do not have such large stadiums as you have," he 
said. "Our stadiums hold about 40,000 people." 
</P>
<P>
 Stadiums and host cities for 1998 have yet to be chosen, but Ernault said two 
stadiums in Paris will be used and that the games will be spread over eight to 
10 cities. Nine U.S. cities hosted games, which led to some travel problems. 
However, France is about one-seventeenth the size of the United States and 
travel between cities is likely to be shorter and less complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting times for the games in France will be more hospitable than the 12:30 
p.m. and 1 p.m. kickoffs scheduled here in venues such as Orlando, Fla.; New 
Jersey; Palo Alto; Washington, D.C.; and Boston. Those midday starts were 
forced on players to ensure telecasts were aired in prime time in Europe, and 
players and coaches complained they couldn't perform at their best in such 
heat. Those early starts won't be necessary for games played in Europe. Some 
games probably will start at 4 or 5 p.m. and some at 8 or 9 p.m., when the heat 
of the day has dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that might go unchanged, however, is the mixed zone, that 
hand-to-microphone combat area where reporters fight one another to get 
interviews with players. Ernault said he and his colleagues simply don't know 
of a better system to implement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have only hear rumors about it," he said. "I believe the idea is not so 
bad, but maybe it has been not so well applied."

WORLD CUP USA 1994; A VERY GOOD YEAR; VINTAGE '94 HAS HAD FULL STADIUMS, 
WELL-PLAYED GAMES -- EVERYTHING BUT A SUPERTEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a fine wine, the World Cup requires a little aging before it can truly be 
enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to analyze what was good or bad about a tournament still in progress 
serves little purpose. Impressions gathered over the course of a month need 
time to mature. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, what seemed meaningful at the time might be regarded as meaningless, 
and events that appeared inconsequential might take on added significance. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is possible to tell a good year from a bad almost immediately, and 
already it is clear that 1994 has been a vintage World Cup, one that will be 
enjoyed in retrospect for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 That, at least, is the early consensus of the experts, those writers whose 
World Cup experience is counted, not in years but in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the field, I think it's been one of the best for quite a long time and 
certainly far better than in 1990," said author, playwright and journalist 
Brian Glanville, who has covered all 10 tournaments since 1958 and whose book, 
"The History of the World Cup," is widely regarded as the definitive text on 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "The football has been much more open and immensely more entertaining than 
1990, which was horrific. Then, you really felt the end of the World Cup was 
nigh. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time, in a curious way, I think the tournament is going to be won 
by default because I don't see any great teams, as evidenced by the fact that a 
team like Bulgaria, with all due respect to it, can get as far as the 
semifinals; and so can a team like Italy, which isn't a patch on the Italian 
teams of, say, 1978 and less still of 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any great players, either, with the possible exception of 
Romario. It's a very diminished Brazil. . . . But when you've got a player like 
Romario, anything is possible. He can win any game for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Maranhao, executive editor of Vega, a weekly news magazine in Sao 
Paulo, Brazil, first attended a World Cup in West Germany in 1974. This 
tournament, he said compares favorably to most that he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of the soccer, I think it's a very good World Cup with some very 
brilliant matches, like Bulgaria-Germany, like Brazil-Holland, like 
Romania-Argentina," he said. "But you don't have at the moment a new king of 
football. This is bad. But it's better than Italy and, in my opinion, better 
also than Mexico in 1986, but not as good as Spain in 1982." 
</P>
<P>
 What has impressed Maranhao has been the fans. "I think this is the most 
beautiful World Cup I have seen in terms of the participation of the public," 
he said. "The stadiums are always full. They are not full with people who came 
from Germany or Brazil, but with Americans. This is because the U.S.A. is a 
country of great ethnic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the match that most impressed me in this way was Ireland-Italy here 
in New Jersey. Most people supposed the Italians would fill the stadium, but 
there were about 70% or 75% of Irish fans who didn't come from Ireland. This is 
possible only in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based columnist Paul Gardner, author of "The Simplest Game" and a 
writer who has covered six World Cup tournaments, was one of many who doubted 
whether the United States could produce a proper World Cup atmosphere. He too 
has been pleasantly surprised by the fervor and involvement of American fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The atmosphere in the stadiums has been fantastic," Gardner said. "Going into 
one of the stadiums, you could be in Rio or Milan or anywhere. There's been a 
lot of cheering, a lot of flavor, a lot of excitement and passion inside the 
stadiums and immediately around the stadiums. The party atmosphere has been 
terrific." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason, of course, is that the quality of the soccer has been better than 
in quite some time. The success of the tournament always was going to depend on 
the attitude of the players, and they have come through, despite the appalling 
temperatures at some games.

 "I think it's been utterly disgraceful that players have been obliged to play 
in this heat," said Glanville, switching to his curmudgeonly mode. "I think 
they (the players) have been totally heroic. It's wonderful the way they've 
resisted physically. They are absolutely phenomenal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was disgraceful to choose Orlando (as a World Cup venue), knowing that 
they'd have to play at midday when it was going to be filthy hot and vilely 
humid. And the (Pontiac) Silverdome was always a stupid idea. 
Pseudo-innovation, I suppose. The only thing you could say for it was that it 
wasn't any worse than playing outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a disaster without air conditioning, and it was perverse to have to grow 
the grass in California and bring it out there. And for what? So they played 
indoors? Well, OK. Now let's forget about indoors." 
</P>
<P>
 As uncomfortable and trying as the heat and humidity were, there were other 
factors that disturbed some World Cup reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think overall it has been a good World Cup," said Andres Cavelier, 
correspondent for El Tiempo in Bogota, Colombia, "but the nine venues are 
located too far away from each other, and it's difficult and expensive for the 
journalists and for the fans to go to all of these places and to get a feel for 
a real World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other than that, the U.S. has shown the world that it could organize the 
World Cup. Four or five years ago, we were talking about taking the World Cup 
away from the U.S. I was skeptical, as most (overseas) people were. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most of the articles that we wrote in the last six months or a year 
were very critical of everything concerning soccer in the United States. We 
believed that the World Cup would not be as enjoyable and as much fun as others 
were, and that America wasn't ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the United States was ready and, with the help of a few long-overdue rule 
changes, the tournament caught the public's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 David Miller, of the Times of London, has covered each of the tournaments 
since Sweden '58 and believes that USA '94 ranks among the more enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the tournament has been encouraging in a whole lot of ways," he said. 
"First, I think it's been encouraging for football. Belatedly, FIFA has tried 
to take steps to encourage inventive and creative play. This has resulted in 
some criticism of overreaction by referees, too many yellow cards and so on, 
(but) I think a swing of the pendulum was essential. 
</P>
<P>
 "With one or two exceptions, we've had 20 years or more of defensive football 
at the expense of entertaining, spectacular football, which is the kind of 
thing that people want to see, that they pay money to come and watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had defensive football killing this and getting away with it. Illegal 
tackling, illegal shirt-pulling and so on. Many, many kinds of subtle, 
specialist fouls . . . and referees not responding. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most World Cup matches that I've seen, say in the last six World Cups -- 
having seen 10 -- I would have said without hesitation that there should have 
been at least one penalty in every match, sometimes two or three. And in most 
matches at least one person should have been sent off, if the referee was 
interpreting the laws as they are written. That is, you get sent off for a 
seriously aggressive foul or, much more important and more subtle, and it's 
within the laws, you get sent off for persistent fouling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's persistent fouling that kills the game. Your little niggling trips, 
pulls, obstructions and so on. All you're doing is trying to stop the other 
side playing. This is what's gone on for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, we've got the pendulum going the other way, and a few people are 
screaming, notably, of course, the coaches, who don't like it because it's 
making life tough for them and they're going to have to think a bit harder. But 
I'm glad to see the pendulum going that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been more exciting games than there were in Italy, that's for 
sure," he said. "We've had more goals. We have had more excitement. It would 
have been difficult to have had less. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the FIFA rule changes have had something to do with that. Maybe the 
tackle-from-behind rule has put fear in defenders that maybe they shouldn't 
just mow people down from behind -- although, as far as I can see, the referees 
are not sending people off for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offside rule change has clearly helped. We've seen goals scored, 
particularly Spain's first goal against Switzerland and Brazil's second goal 
against Sweden, where players in a passive offside position were not called. 
Play was allowed to flow. That's a huge plus, without a doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the referees have been a bit overenthusiastic. Maybe we've had too 
many yellow cards in some games. But on the whole I think that's been fairly 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, a good tournament on the field. An exceptional tournament? No. Frankly, 
among the teams that are left I don't see an exceptional team. I really don't. 
That doesn't mean we can't have an exciting game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if Brazil is involved, we will."

 Wrong information -- An article and an accompanying headline in Wednesday's 
edition incorrectly reported that officials of the Moorpark Boys & Girls Club 
told a Moorpark City Council committee that the club has debts of 
$55,000.According to Antoinette I. Carbone-Sarcinella, the club's executive 
director, the club does not have a projected deficit of $25,000, as reported. 
Instead, she said, there is only a possible shortfall of $2,600 this fiscal 
year. The club also owes $30,000 in back taxes, she said, but is working to pay 
that back.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: PICO RIVERA; CITY EMPLOYEES WILL GET 5% PAY INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City employees will receive a 5% salary increase for the first time in three 
years in the 1994-95 budget passed by the City Council last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the fourth year, no funds were allocated for residential street 
repairs.And $150,000 will be cut from parks and recreation services, meaning 
staff will work shorter hours at local parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The $22.7-million budget provides $5.2 million for services from the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department. It pays for 38 deputies, including two 
motorcycle officers who began patrolling last March. The budget for last fiscal 
year provided $5 million for police services. 
</P>
<P>
 One-third of the $14.6-million general fund goes to police services, said Vice 
Mayor Garth G. Gardner. "There isn't a lot left," he said. "We're a poor city." 
</P>
<P>
 Street repairs are usually financed by gasoline taxes, which have been 
diverted into the general fund. Federal funds are available for work on 
thoroughfares, but the city needs $6.6 million for repairs on smaller streets, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four unfilled full-time city jobs have been slashed.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; STATE ASKED TO BE ALLY IN CURING ILLS OF ALLEYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crime, transients and traffic are growing problems in the sprawling network of 
alleys behind many Long Beach homes, and the City Council decided last week to 
appeal to the state for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Alan S. Lowenthal said the California Vehicle Code prevents cities 
from changing alleys, including closing them off or adding lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, at Lowenthal's request, the council unanimously voted to pass a 
resolution asking the State Legislature to allow such changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenthal said he constantly receives reports of scavengers making noise as 
they search for recyclables, of graffiti and crime problems and motorists using 
alleys as shortcuts.  
</P>
<P>
 Blocking the alleys at strategic points to control traffic but allow access to 
residents and trash service might be one solution, Lowenthal said. But any 
local measures to solve the problems would be a waste of time if Long Beach 
could not implement the changes, he said.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; OFFICIALS NAME MANAGER FOR QUEENSWAY PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Paternoster, director of planning and building, will manage the 
$557-million plan to remake the city's waterfront, city officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Paternoster has overseen preparation of the massive project, known as the 
Queensway Bay Plan, since its conception two years ago.As project manager, he 
will be responsible for coordinating the financing, construction, marketing, 
permits and other aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal calls for a redevelopment of 310 acres of downtown waterfront 
land, mostly on an old landfill where the Shoreline Aquatic Park and lagoon are 
located. The lagoon would be dredged to accommodate ships, and the new harbor 
would be surrounded with shops, restaurants, hotels and an aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager James C. Hankla appointed Eugene Zeller, superintendent of 
building and safety, to be acting director of planning and building in 
Paternoster's absence.

OWNERS OF AILING SHORELINE VILLAGE CONSIDER FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY; FINANCING: 
INVESTORS HAVE 35 DAYS TO PAY $430,000 IN OVERDUE RENT. CITY IS NEGOTIATING FOR 
A SETTLEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A decline in tourism and the closure of one of Shoreline Village's anchor 
restaurants last year have led owners of the downtown waterfront shopping and 
dining complex to consider filing for bankruptcy, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoreline Village Associates, a group of investors that leases the property 
from the city of Long Beach, owes about $430,000 to the city for nine months' 
rent. It also is behind on loan payments to another creditor, said general 
partner Michael Lapin, but he would not disclose any details. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach City Manager James C. Hankla said the city sent the group a default 
notice on July 7, which gives the investors 35 days to make the rent payments. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Hankla said city officials are negotiating with the group for a 
possible settlement. He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to be supportive," Hankla said. "They are good operators who got 
caught up in a cash-flow problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The investors may seek protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy 
laws if an agreement with the city cannot be reached, Lapin said. The group 
negotiated a 50-year lease with the city when Shoreline Village opened in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his group does not keep figures on tourism at Shoreline Village, 
Lapin said, sales have dropped there since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The development, a 60,000-square-foot complex with 30 outlets near the foot of 
Pine Avenue, now has three vacant shops, more than any time in its 10-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Lapin blamed construction at the Long Beach Convention Center and the state's 
recession for declining sales at the shops. And, he said, his group could not 
recover financially after a key tenant, the Mardi Gras restaurant and night 
club, closed its doors last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mardi Gras -- along with Parker's Lighthouse restaurant -- were anchor 
tenants at each end of Shoreline Village. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mardi Gras was usually packed with customers until closing time, Lapin 
said, but its parent corporation, International Onion Inc., had severe 
financial problems and eventually went out of business. The company also owned 
the now-defunct Red Onion restaurant chain. 
</P>
<P>
 When it closed, the Mardi Gras was 10 months behind on its rent payments, 
Lapin said, and several more months passed before a new tenant, the Cantina 
Tiburon restaurant, was found, Lapin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marj Rankine, owner of the Scottish Heritage Center gift shop at Shoreline 
Village, said that the expansion that closed down the Convention Center for two 
years hurt her sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hit us very badly," she said. "The business conventioneer is a very big 
part of our customer base." 
</P>
<P>
 Rankine said she is looking forward to October, when conventions will resume 
with a three-day League of California Cities conference. Officials expect more 
than 2,500 to attend. Convention Center officials said the expansion will allow 
larger conferences and more tourists to help the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can literally look at my sales receipts to see when there were big 
conventions in town," Rankine said. "The village is suffering now, but the 
future does look brighter." 
</P>
<P>
 Shoreline Village is a key component of a waterfront redevelopment project 
called the Queensway Bay Plan, which proposes adding more shops, restaurants, 
hotels and an aquarium in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Queensway project manager Robert Paternoster said Shoreline Village's 
financial problems "certainly aren't going to help the plan, but hopefully they 
won't have an adverse effect either." 
</P>
<P>
 Paternoster said the overall waterfront expansion and the now-completed 
renovations of the Convention Center will boost tourism. "The (complex) is 
still viable," he said.

BOUNCING BACK; ORPHANED BY GUNFIRE, FLORA VALDEZ IS TRIUMPHING OVER THE TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN PATERNO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flora Valdez's comfortable life was shattered in 1991, a few weeks before her 
sophomore year of high school, when her mother and stepfather were gunned down 
outside an apartment building in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, who until then had been the object of doting parents who plied 
her with plenty of clothes, pocket money and other amenities, suddenly found 
herself penniless and without a home. She and two older sisters -- Veronica, 19 
at the time, and Rozio, 18 -- were evicted from their Buena Park apartment and 
had to split up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to have everything I wanted," she said. "Then one day I woke up and my 
parents were gone and I'm Cinderella mopping floors at Kentucky Fried Chicken." 
</P>
<P>
 But she persevered. Valdez went to live with friends in Cerritos, took a 
full-time job and continued to attend school. She graduated recently from Tracy 
High School, a continuation school in Cerritos. She had an A average. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez, 18, is the first in her family to earn a high school degree and 
credits her late mother, Altagracia Felix, with providing the inspiration to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to cry night and day, asking myself, 'Why did they die? Why do I have 
to stay up late mopping floors, get up early to go to school, iron my own 
clothes?' And then I remembered what my mom always told us. 'Go to school and 
learn.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I never understood why until the day they died," Valdez said. "Then I 
realized education was the key, the only way to get out of mopping floors and 
cleaning for other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Felix, 38, and her husband, Javier Contreras, 46, were shot at close range 
Aug. 25, 1991, by a man with an assault rifle as they dropped off a friend at 
an apartment building in Buena Park. Two men, Francisco Soria Patino and Juan 
Soria Lopez, have been charged with murder, but they apparently fled to Mexico, 
said Buena Park Police Lt. Mike Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras, a chef, had been convicted previously of selling drugs to 
undercover police officers and had spent some time in jail. But the slayings 
most likely were motivated by jealousy, Schwartz said. Felix earlier had 
reportedly spurned the advances of one of the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 After her parents were slain, Valdez dropped out of school for three months. 
Most of her time was consumed with funeral arrangements, the police 
investigation and the constant search for money. Valdez and her sisters had to 
borrow money to bury their parents in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez became so distraught at one point that she was hospitalized. "I only 
had one thing on my mind, that they were gone, gone forever," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 She says that Schwartz, the Buena Park officer, is one of the people who 
encouraged her to continue with school. Schwartz first met Valdez when he told 
her of her parents' deaths. He kept in touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept telling her, 'I realize it's hard, but focus on school. Get your 
education and get beyond this.' I'm real proud of her," said Schwartz, who 
attended Valdez's graduation. "It's easy to help her. She's a sweet kid." 
</P>
<P>
 At her graduation, Valdez received several awards, including a savings bond 
from the local Optimist Club and a $250 scholarship from the Buena Park Police 
Department. Since then, she has moved into an apartment in Fullerton with her 
sister Rozio, now 21, who is married and has a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez, who has been working at a Pep Boys store in Anaheim the past two 
years, is considering a career in medicine, aviation or teaching, she said. She 
plans to join the Air Force or attend community college in the fall.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm gonna make it," she said. "You only have one chance at life."

8 TOLD TO PAY CLEANUP BILL AT TOXIC SITE; ENVIRONMENT: EPA DETERMINES THAT 
COMPANIES DUMPED DANGEROUS CHEMICALS AT SANTA FE SPRINGS FACILITY. COSTS AT 
LANDFILL TOTAL MORE THAN $10 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. WAGNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Environmental Protection Agency says eight companies are largely 
responsible for dumping dangerous chemicals at a 43-acre site in Santa Fe 
Springs, and has demanded that they help pay cleanup costs estimated at more 
than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies are Mobil Oil Corp., Chevron USA Inc., Dresser Industries, 
Unical International, Santa Fe Energy Resources, FMC Corp. and two Santa Fe 
Springs firms, Dia-log Co. and Powerine Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies either owned the site at one time or dumped toxic substances 
there, EPA officials said. The site has been contaminated with such chemicals 
as arsenic, benzene, benzopyrene and polychlorinated biphenyls -- all suspected 
of causing cancer or brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for five of the firms have denied responsibility or said their 
involvement was minimal. Officials for Mobil, Unical and FMC were unavailable 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies failed to meet a recent deadline set by the EPA for submitting a 
cleanup plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of now there has been no agreement to do anything," said attorney Ed 
Renwick, representing Dia-log. The company, which services parts for oil wells 
and pipes, owned the site from 1942-47, said spokesman John Kelton. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency officials estimate the cost of cleaning up the landfill and monitoring 
the site for the next 30 years will total $5.2 million. The EPA also wants the 
companies to pay another $5 million to cover costs that the agency already has 
incurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The site at Santa Fe Springs and Los Nietos Roads is surrounded by businesses, 
vacant warehouses and parking lots. St. Paul High School is just north of the 
dump. 
</P>
<P>
 The dump began operations in the mid-1920s and was used to store sludge and 
other wastes generated by oil drilling. It also served as a receptacle for 
industrial wastes until it was closed in 1964.  
</P>
<P>
 Waste Disposal Inc. owned the site from the late 1940s until it was closed, 
but the company no longer exists and its owners are dead, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA has announced plans to seal most of the weed-covered site with plastic 
sheeting covered by asphalt. The area would be vented to release gases, and 
monitored for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parts of the site may be covered, however, with soil and vegetation, said 
Rusty Harris-Bishop, EPA project manager. During public hearings last year on 
various cleanup proposals, some citizens complained that it would not be 
attractive to cap the entire site with asphalt. He said the agency hopes to 
begin work on cleaning up the site in early 1996 and that the project would 
take about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The dump has been designated a Superfund site, making it eligible for federal 
cleanup funds. But the EPA seeks to require parties allegedly responsible for 
contamination to pay cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials said they have not decided what action to take against the eight 
companies who missed the deadline for filing cleanup plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But spokesmen for many of the businesses questioned whether they should be on 
the EPA list. 
</P>
<P>
 Dia-log, one of the local companies, may have dumped trash, concrete or 
drilling fluids at the site, but the quantities were minimal, spokesman Kelton 
insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron records indicate that the company never used the site, spokesman John 
Wolff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Reott, attorney for Powerine, said the company did not dump toxic 
substances.  
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we can tell Powerine didn't dump any chemicals," he said. "It never 
owned the site and never dumped any of the substances there that are 
responsible for the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Powerine may have dumped some office trash there, but I don't think that's a 
basis for liability," Reott added. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA's Harris-Bishop said, however, that two Waste Disposal documents indicated 
six of the companies -- Mobil, Unical, Dresser, Chevron, FMC and Powerine -- 
had been dumping wastes at the site before 1953. The companies were listed in 
two Waste Disposal applications seeking permission from the county to allow 
dumping 24 hours a day and to dump sludges from acetylene manufacturing at the 
site.  
</P>
<P>
 Waste Disposal "should know better than anyone who they were dealing with," 
Harris-Bishop said.

HARWOOD SAYS HE MAY LEAVE LONG BEACH

<TEXT>
<P>
 Councilman Warren Harwood, whose 12-year stint representing North Long Beach 
will end next week, has put his house up for sale and is living in Ventura 
County, at least for the summer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harwood said he is taking a vacation with his wife and two children in a 
relative's home, but would not give the name of the city.He said he has not 
decided whether he will return to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Harwood, who recently lost his bid for a fourth term, said he left after 
neighbors harassed him and his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Harwood blamed Jerry Shultz, a sheriff's deputy who defeated him in the July 7 
elections, for a negative campaign that caused him and his children to be the 
targets of insults in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz, who is scheduled to take over the 9th District seat on Tuesday, said 
his criticisms of Harwood during the campaign were valid. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're a political figure, you've got to withstand some criticism," 
Shultz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The clincher in his decision to sell his home, Harwood said, was a party for 
Shultz held by neighbors in a front yard across the street from him on June 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "They rubbed our noses in it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harwood attended the party and watched as a process server informed Shultz 
that he was named as the defendant in a libel suit -- filed by Harwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in Long Beach Superior Court, charges that Shultz libeled 
Harwood during the campaign and should pay up to $1 million in damages. Among 
other charges, Harwood alleges that Shultz distributed campaign literature that 
implied the councilman was racist. 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz called the lawsuit frivolous, and said he plans to file a countersuit.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HUNTINGTON PARK; POLICE RAIDS TARGET SELLERS OF ILLEGAL IDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A two-week police stakeout of a busy corner in the Pacific Boulevard business 
district has led to 29 arrests in a crackdown on the city's burgeoning trade in 
illegal identification documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Police videotaped sidewalk hawkers of $100 kits of illegal documents. Police 
raided a pharmacy June 9 in the 6900 block of Pacific Boulevard and a nearby 
bar said to be a hangout for illegal-document traders and made the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real good raid," said Officer Danny Dominguez, who videotaped hours 
of foot traffic in front of the pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also recovered a laminating machine, photo equipment and fraudulent 
California driver's licenses and resident alien, Social Security and state 
identification cards. That evidence is in the hands of the district attorney's 
office, which is attempting to lift fingerprints from them, said Lt. Carl 
Heintz of the Huntington Park Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five of those arrested, believed to be low-level workers in the trade, 
were deported to Mexico by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The 
remaining four, police said, were managing the voluminous trade and will be 
held for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park police said that the INS considers the local fake document 
trade to be second only to Los Angeles in the county.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is sold here," said Dominguez, adding that local sellers are so 
aggressive that they once tried selling to city employees and got into a 
dispute when employees turned them down. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief William Reed said the city would like to rid itself of the 
under-the-counter trade. "It is a big business. No doubt about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez, a six-year officer assigned to bike patrol along the boulevard, 
said that eradication is difficult because police suspect the illegal cards are 
printed in Mexico and shipped to Huntington Park, where they are distributed to 
individual rings of sellers who pass them on to the street-level dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Those dealers, in turn, have sellers who solicit customers on the street and 
bring them to an "office" where pictures are made and cards are laminated. Most 
document traders can produce a kit in about 30 minutes, police said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CERRITOS; ARTS CENTER ATTENDANCE RISES FROM '93 SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paid attendance during the first full season at the Cerritos Center for the 
Performing Arts averaged 81% capacity, up two points from the abbreviated 1993 
inaugural season, center officials announced last week. The center's season 
ended in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Center General Manager Victor Gotesman said he was pleased with the new 
numbers, given that paid attendance rates for new performing-arts facilities 
typically decline as the venue's newness wears off. Gotesman attributed the 
slight rise largely to second-year programming as well as to audiences' 
increased familiarity with the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of sold-out shows during the latest season jumped to 61%, seven 
points better than the center's five-month debut season, he added. Cerritos 
tallied 103 performances during the season that opened last August. Among the 
most popular attractions were Whitney Houston, George Benson, Paul Anka and the 
Vienna Boys Choir. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket revenue for the season totaled roughly $4 million, Gotesman said. For 
the 1994-95 year, the city of Cerritos, which owns and operates the center, has 
approved a budget of $8.4 million, up $600,000 from the previous year. The City 
Council, as it has annually, allotted $2 million in programming subsidies and 
another $2 million for operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Center officials reported that about 30% of 159,946 available tickets have 
been sold for the coming season, starting Sept. 16. The figure exceeds the 
number of advance tickets sold by the same time last year, said center 
marketing director Walter Morlock. It brings current ticket revenues to $2.1 
million toward this year's goal of $5 million in advance sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased," Morlock said. "We're shooting to be at 50% of our total 
ticket revenue goal by the end of this month." 
</P>
<P>
 The lineup for next season includes Bill Cosby, Liza Minnelli, Tony Bennett, 
Johnny Cash, Shirley MacLaine and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. ZAN DUBIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; NAVY GIVES UP LAND FOR COMMUNITY USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans for a new high school, a job training center and a homeless facility on 
101 acres of land at the Navy's Cabrillo and Savannah housing projects in west 
Long Beach have crossed another hurdle.  
</P>
<P>
 As part of a plan developed by the city of Long Beach and community groups, 
Navy officials turned over all but 30 acres of the property last week to other 
federal agencies, which will either run programs on the land or transfer 
ownership to local groups. City officials expect the remaining 30 acres to be 
released within a month to make room for a research park to be run by Cal State 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined project is expected to be worth up to $150 million, said Jerry 
Miller, manager of the city's economic development bureau.  
</P>
<P>
 The first agency expected to begin construction is the U.S. Department of 
Labor, which plans to run a Job Corps project on 17 acres. It plans to provide 
housing and vocational training for up to 300 poor youths by the fall of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Department of Education got 62 acres, which will be turned over to 
the Long Beach Unified School District for the proposed West Side High School 
and a future middle school. Architects are working on plans for the high 
school, and state funds have been set aside to begin demolition of family 
housing units on the site. However, state money has not been allocated to build 
the school. The proposed 2,500-student school is needed to keep up with the 
district's growing student population, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also under the plan, Christian Outreach Appeal, a nonprofit organization, will 
work with the Los Angeles Mission to open 200 apartments for homeless people 
over three to five years. The facility will occupy 22 acres of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week planners representing the four organizations met to discuss how they 
could cooperate in developing the property. Proposals ranged from sharing 
telecommunication equipment to coordinating security and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy housing project has remained unused since 1991, due to Defense 
Department cutbacks. Navy spokesmen said Long Beach's plan to use the property 
was approved because it involved various community interests.  
</P>
<P>
 The university research park proposal has taken longer for the Navy to 
approve, city and university officials said, because it requires consideration 
under new federal provisions that allow private companies to lease former naval 
land. Although the university will provide some of the staff and buildings, 
corporations will be invited to build testing sites in the park.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; TENTATIVE BUDGET CUTS TEACHING JOBS, CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach City College trustees have approved a tentative budget that holds 
the line on student fees but calls for cuts in teacher positions and a slight 
reduction in classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The $54.3-million budget for the 1994-95 school year would eliminate about 50 
teaching and staff positions that have been vacant since the 1992-93 school 
year.The college hired temporary instructors last year to fill most of the 
vacant teaching positions and kept most of the other jobs open.  
</P>
<P>
 A decision on class cuts is not expected until August or September. Officials 
said some course sections probably will be eliminated, rather than entire 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking, registration and health fees at the 23,000-student college remain 
unchanged. State community college officials set tuition rates but plan no 
increases, according to a spokesman in the state office. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees are expected to approve the budget in September. Last year's 
final budget was $55.8 million. The community colleges' fiscal year begins in 
July, but trustees delay final budget action until the new state budget is 
signed. JOHN D. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS: MONTEBELLO; HOMES GET TRASH CANS FOR NEW RECYCLING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City employees began passing out plastic containers to residents this week for 
a recycling program expected to begin by Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the city's 11,000 houses are being given red 14-gallon containers 
for newspapers and blue 18-gallon containers for bottles and cans.City workers 
are also handing out "yard waste" stickers for people to affix on containers of 
grass and trimmings. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, residents will put out the sorted recyclables on their 
regular trash-pickup day. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will be funded by a recently approved increase in local garbage 
fees from $10.61 to $12.63 a month. The fees will pay for the $330,000 
recycling program and for higher rates for dumping trash in landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 The trash will be picked up by Athens Disposal Co., which has provided 
curb-side garbage removal for Montebello since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 The recycling program was mandated by state law, which designates recycling as 
a method for cities to reduce trash rates 25% from 1990 to 1995.

<P>
 The speed limit on a stretch of Bloomfield Avenue from 166th Street to Alondra 
Boulevard will be reduced to 40 m.p.h. from 45 m.p.h. on Aug. 7 in response to 
residents' complaints that fast-moving trucks are making too much noise as they 
rumble through the neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 The stretch is a truck route that bisects the city's industrial area, making 
it a busy thoroughfare for vehicles traveling toward Santa Fe Springs, said 
Public Works Director Vince Brar. The speed limit is 40 m.p.h. along the rest 
of Bloomfield in the city, he said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MAYWOOD; OFFICER WINS AWARD FOR RECOVERY OF STOLEN CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While patrolling city streets, Officer Sean Richardson once bet his partner $5 
that the car they had just passed was stolen. Within 20 seconds, they had run a 
license plate check and Richardson was $5 richer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt it," he said later. The driver of the stolen car "just gave me 
that look." 
</P>
<P>
 The two-year officer's gut feelings have served him well 29 times in the past 
year: He recently won the 10851 Award from the Southern California Automobile 
Club and the California Highway Patrol. (The state penal code designation for a 
stolen car is 10851.) The award is given to police officers who recover at 
least 12 stolen cars in a 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to think it is my skill," Richardson said. "But there is 
probably some luck involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson's success rate is impressive given that he works in one of the 
smallest cities in the state. Of his 29 recoveries, 23 had been stolen, parked 
and abandoned, and six were "rolling recoveries." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson has developed a technique that has earned him a reputation as a car 
thief's worst enemy. "I have what I call mind tricks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While on patrol, he looks for American-made cars that are popular with thieves 
and easiest to steal. He will drive up next to the passenger window and look in 
at the ignition to see if it has been punched, and, at the same time, glance at 
the driver's expression, which is usually a giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, he'll drop back well behind the car and turn on his flashing lights. If 
the driver runs, it's most likely stolen. If the driver doesn't attempt to 
escape, Richardson will often take the next turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said an auto owner's best defense is a security system with a 
homing device. Most police cruisers are equipped to receive signals from such 
devices, which make it simple to locate a stolen car. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no perfect defense against a good thief, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a criminal wants your car, he will get it." BOB ELSTON

COVER STORY; CHANGE IS IN THE AIR; INFLUX OF CITY HALL NEWCOMERS MAKES LONG 
BEACH POLITICS TOUGH TO PREDICT -- WHICH IS JUST FINE WITH COUNCIL'S 1ST 
LATINO, JENNY OROPEZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the past few weeks, city officials, pundits and amateur prognosticators 
around Long Beach City Hall have been engaging in an age-old ritual that marks 
an imminent change in government: trying to figure out which way the political 
wind is blowing. 
</P>
<P>
 With a new mayor and three new council members coming aboard next week -- the 
largest influx of new blood at the top in 40 years -- the Long Beach City 
Council figures to have not just a new cast of characters but a new collective 
personality. Depending on whom you talk to, there's going to be a new bedrock 
majority of conservatives on the nine-member council, a 4-4 
liberal-conservative split (with one council member or another being a swing 
vote) or a pattern of shifting alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's one thing that just about everybody seems to agree on. Jenny 
Oropeza, the newly elected councilwoman from District 1, the first Latino to 
sit on the council and a Bill Clinton delegate to the 1992 Democratic National 
Convention, will be firmly in the liberal camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Oropeza could hardly wait to brush away that label. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's fair to put people in slots," she said testily. 
</P>
<P>
 Oropeza, 36, is an animated woman who seems to send out wisps of energy when 
she enters a room, like a locomotive coming into a station. 
</P>
<P>
 Since she won a runoff election last month, Oropeza has been sounding a lot 
more like a community-oriented pragmatist than a classic liberal. In fact, her 
first pronouncements as a soon-to-be-sworn-in councilwoman could have been 
pages from a conservative handbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Oropeza wants the city to be more business-friendly -- offering big 
corporations juicy incentives to relocate in Long Beach, for example. She wants 
urban blight reduced in her downtown district. She wants more cops on the beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't put myself in any (voting) bloc," she said. "I like to call myself a 
law-and-order person. It really depends on the issue as to where I fit on the 
liberal-conservative spectrum." 
</P>
<P>
 From the sound of it, the new Long Beach City Council could be remarkably hard 
to figure. Oropeza, Councilmen-elect Mike Donelon and Jerry Shultz and 
Mayor-elect Beverly O'Neill -- all of whom will be sworn in Tuesday -- seem 
willing to confound expectations of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy who becomes part of a three-man 
"cop squad" on the council -- joining Les Robbins, another deputy sheriff, and 
Douglas S. Drummond, a retired Long Beach police officer -- says he feels 
comfortable with the conservative label that most observers place on him. 
</P>
<P>
 But he draws the line at supporting "privatization," saving tax dollars by 
hiring companies to replace city departments, one of the rallying calls of 
fiscal conservatives in Southern California since the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of negatives to it," Shultz said. "You hire people for low 
wages who don't necessarily have the professional expertise." 
</P>
<P>
 Donelon warns that those who expect him to be part of a conservative 
juggernaut may be deeply disappointed. "I'm a political moderate," he insists. 
"People have tried to cubbyhole me. More than anything, I find that offensive." 
</P>
<P>
 A general contractor with distinctly pro-business proclivities, Donelon 
nevertheless won't support efforts to cut social service programs in order to 
beef up public safety. "We can't afford to cut youth programs or libraries to 
hire more cops," he said. "I'll always be a die-hard supporter of 
neighborhoods. That's my first priority." 
</P>
<P>
 And Mayor-elect O'Neill, a registered Democrat, talks with all the fervor of 
George Bush about making life easier for businesses and cutting back on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Oropeza -- who made history as the first Latino elected to the Long Beach 
Unified School District Board of Education -- is just as determined as the rest 
to resist doctrinaire disputes. At least in the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 But her task in serving her majority-Latino district may be the hardest facing 
any council member. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60% of the families in her district speak a language other than 
English at home, and almost a third of the population lives below the poverty 
level. More than half of Oropeza's constituents have not finished high school. 
Housing in District 1 is among the oldest, most crowded and dilapidated in the 
city, with 52% of it built before 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the district includes the choice Pine Avenue restaurant and movie 
theater area, it also contains the lackluster Long Beach Plaza, a downtown 
shopping mall that, after two years, has yet to find a replacement for the 
vacant Buffum's department store outlet at the mall's southern end. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Oropeza's credentials as a Latina elected official may be of 
little political value in District 1. The district lines, encompassing a 
population that is 56% Latino, were drawn four years ago specifically to 
increase opportunities for Latino candidates. But according to a study 
commissioned by Oropeza, only about 10% of the registered voters are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, Oropeza's ethnic background could be a liability, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It places an additional burden on me, not only to represent the district but 
to represent that perspective," she said. "I think everybody's going to be 
watching and evaluating me, especially in the early months. I know there are 
people who will be thinking not that I'm well-educated, articulate or 
intelligent, but that I'm Hispanic." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Oropeza comes to the council with a satchel full of ideas -- programs 
that she thinks will help her constituents -- and a determination to help bring 
a new era of good will to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 She wants to prod the Parks, Recreation and Marine Department into building a 
long-discussed park on Golden Avenue, between Broadway and 6th Street, in her 
greenery-starved district. She has plans to liven up the shopping mall, 
providing greater access to Pine Avenue and its upscale diners. 
</P>
<P>
 She also backs efforts to attract more commercial passenger flights to Long 
Beach Airport, bringing jobs to her constituents. One study said that each 
daily commercial flight creates 92 jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the council, traditionally dominated by white males, have called it 
a do-nothing body that has failed to meaningfully attack a host of urban woes 
or to respond to Long Beach's increasingly diverse population. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old City Council, it was people looking out for their own interests," 
Oropeza said. "I hope there will be a more global, citywide perspective now." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the audience during a recent council meeting, Oropeza, in a red 
suit, provided a marked contrast to the gray-haired, middle-aged men in jackets 
and ties who have until now dominated the council. 
</P>
<P>
 But her origins are far from glamorous. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Montebello, the oldest of the three children of Victor and Sharon 
Oropeza, Jenny Oropeza remembers the "rough spots" of being raised in a 
working-class family. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't Ozzie and Harriet at all," she says now. "Luxuries? There were no 
luxuries." 
</P>
<P>
 After her parents divorced when Jenny was 12, Sharon Oropeza and the three 
children moved to a tiny apartment, where all four shared a bedroom. "I slept 
in the same bed with my mother all through high school," Jenny Oropeza said. 
"There just wasn't room for another bed in the room." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, an escrow agent, says she had few indications that her oldest 
daughter was headed toward a life of public service, except that Jenny and her 
younger sister, Lynne, had a flair for performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were forever putting on shows and charging the neighbors money to come 
and see them," Sharon Oropeza said. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilwoman-elect remembers being fascinated as a fifth-grader with 
Robert F. Kennedy when he was running for president in 1968. "He came in a 
caravan through Montebello, and I did some leafletting for him. I felt as if I 
were contributing to a great man." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's death a few weeks later was devastating, she said. "It was like 
somebody in the family died." 
</P>
<P>
 The charismatic former U.S. attorney general is still one of her heroes, 
Oropeza said. "I read his books whenever I need inspiration," she said. "He had 
a great heart, which so many leaders lack today. You have to be budget-wise and 
pragmatic, but you also need a great heart." 
</P>
<P>
 But Oropeza wasn't "bitten by the political bug" until she got to Cal State 
Long Beach in the late 1970s, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a business administration major, Oropeza said, she was "headed toward the 
corporate world, making the big bucks in some skyscraper in Downtown Los 
Angeles," until she got involved in a movement to keep the state from raising 
tuition at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 She went on to get deeply involved in student government, becoming the first 
person to serve two terms as student body president, before graduating in 1981. 
She was also appointed by then-Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. to a one-year 
term as a student trustee on the Cal State University board.  
</P>
<P>
 While in college she married fellow student Tom Mullins, who now runs a 
freight-forwarding business in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation, Oropeza became a volunteer in Democratic Party politics. She 
worked on Tom Bradley's failed gubernatorial campaign in 1982 before landing a 
job as an aide to Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon (D-Montebello). 
</P>
<P>
 She worked with Calderon, now a state senator, for four years while immersing 
herself in Long Beach politics. She became a leader in a 1984 effort to have 
school board members elected as representatives of geographical districts 
rather than as at-large candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas at-large elections usually favor white candidates, district elections 
give ethnic enclaves a greater say in the outcome, Oropeza said. "In 100 years, 
there had never been a person of color on the board of education," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district-election initiative got on the ballot that year, but it was 
defeated. In 1986, a similar measure was approved by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Oropeza had hooked up with Carmen Ornela-Perez, chairman of the Long 
Beach Harbor Commission and Oropeza's "adviser and role model." Ornela-Perez, a 
former deputy to then-County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and former vice chairman 
of the Democratic National Committee, soon had her youthful protege immersed in 
party committee assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had tremendous tenacity," Ornela-Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oropeza served as a member of the site selection committee for the 1992 
Democratic National Convention. She attended her party's convention as a 
Michael Dukakis delegate in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first stab at running for office was in 1986, when she was part of a 
crowded field in the District 1 council election before it was redistricted to 
include more Latinos. Evan Anderson Braude eventually won the seat in a runoff. 
Oropeza came in fourth out of 14. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, with district representation finally in place, Oropeza was elected to 
the school board to a two-year term (staggered with other districts under the 
new system), representing a largely minority district in the western part of 
the city. She ran again, without opposition, in 1990. During six years on the 
board, she served two one-year terms as president. 
</P>
<P>
 The frequent rap against Oropeza, particularly among community organizations 
from her own district, is that she's an "ivory-tower politician" who is using 
local elections as a springboard to higher office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jenny's on a career political path," said Dianne McNinch, a veteran community 
activist whom Oropeza defeated in the runoff last month. "I fully expect that 
in four years, she'll be running for the (state) Assembly or for Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Westside school groups chide Oropeza for failing to visit their schools while 
she was a school board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Gonzalez, one of the people who spearheaded an award-winning drive last 
year to spruce up the Thomas A. Edison Elementary School on Maine Avenue, 
recalls the night her group was honored with a banquet by the Long Beach 
Chamber of Commerce.  
</P>
<P>
 "The principal and the superintendent were there," said Gonzalez, who was 
personally awarded a key to the city. "Dianne McNinch was there. But our school 
board member (Oropeza) didn't come. It changes my opinion of her." 
</P>
<P>
 Oropeza accepts the criticism graciously. "The truth of the matter is that I 
didn't spend as much time in the schools as some of my colleagues," she said. 
"But I was more involved with some of the inside, nitty-gritty stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 While some of her colleagues were visiting schools, Oropeza said, she was 
trying to establish programs to bring more bilingual teachers into the Long 
Beach schools and to provide support services for gay and lesbian students. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does Oropeza apologize for being ambitious. "Somebody who's not ambitious 
doesn't really care about accomplishing a lot of things," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She notes that there are term limits in Long Beach, limiting a new council 
member's length of service to eight years. "Right now, I'm planning on serving 
two terms," she said, though she does not rule out running for higher office. 
"Never say never," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next year or so, the City Council must deal with major fiscal hurdles, 
daunting problems of street crime and a lethargic local economy. Despite the 
pronouncements of independence by various council members, it remains to be 
seen how this newly disparate group of men and women will assert itself on the 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a danger that the council could become more contentious than the one 
we had," said local political consultant Jeff Adler. 
</P>
<P>
 The first order of business Tuesday, after the new members are sworn in, 
should be to select a new vice mayor. Knowledgeable observers will watch the 
vote as a possible harbinger of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a symbolic post, not really important at all," Adler said. "But it will 
signify early on where the votes are." 
</P>
<P>
 If Drummond, the ex-police officer from Belmont Shore who has expressed an 
interest in the job, gets the post, it could mean that the conservative 
majority is kicking in, Adler said. If Doris Topsy-Elvord, an African American 
councilwoman who is frequently cited as a potential swing vote, is chosen, it 
could signify more moderate forces at work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 How will Oropeza vote? She's not saying.

SPORTS; ALLICE'S WONDERLAND; LONG BEACH CITY TRACK COACH SAYS TIMING WAS RIGHT 
TO ACCEPT USC JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Allice has nothing but reverence for the position of track and field coach 
at USC, a factor that prompted the Long Beach City College coach of 16 years to 
accept the job with the Trojans last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a student, athlete and a young coach, this was the pinnacle of the 
profession," Allice said. "The tradition is like a 'Who's Who's' book. The 
people who have been here are etched in stone. It's an honor for a person to 
head this program at some time during their career." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was far from an easy choice for Allice, who was invited to apply at USC 
three times in the past 11 years by Trojan administrators and also turned down 
job offers from Arizona State, UC Santa Barbara, Long Beach State and Cal State 
Los Angeles to stay at Long Beach the last 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't take the opportunity this time, maybe three or four years down 
the road, I would wonder what I could have done," Allice said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Long Beach, he was practically unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cerritos resident guided the Long Beach men to 11 state titles and 14 
Southern California regional championships. The Vikings placed no lower than 
second in either the state or regional meets. Long Beach also won 16 
consecutive conference titles and amassed a 78-1 dual meet record during that 
span. 
</P>
<P>
 Ensuring future success at Long Beach was Allice's main priority before 
leaving. Sprint coach Jim Richardson was appointed head coach at Allice's 
request. He also met privately with each of his assistant coaches to ensure 
they would remain for at least one more season at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, Allice, who interviewed for the men's track position at USC in 1984 
and 1990, needed more than a week to make a choice that he called "the biggest 
career decision and challenge" in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was torn between going to USC and staying at Long Beach," said Joe 
Lanning, 67, who coached Allice at Long Beach in 1959-60 and has been an 
assistant under his former athlete since 1979. "He was leaving a lot of things 
he felt comfortable and happy with. He was concerned things kept rolling and 
expressed to me to make sure that the program remained intact." 
</P>
<P>
 At USC, Allice will serve as director of the recently consolidated men's and 
women's track teams, overseeing scholarships, budgets, recruiting, fund raising 
and other administrative duties. Men's Coach Jim Bush and women's Coach Barbara 
Edmonson will remain on staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I handled all the administrative end of (the track program at) Long Beach and 
did all the recruiting," Allice said. "The amount of money we have to raise 
here is a new dip in the water but I didn't come (to USC) to be just an 
administrator, I am going to coach as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Allice, however, has been doing little coaching or fund raising in the past 
two weeks. He is teaching summer school classes at Long Beach and most of his 
time at USC is spent trying to acquaint himself with NCAA regulations and 
university policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am dealing with stringent academic standards and that will be a big 
adjustment," Allice said. "It's not like a junior college where all you need is 
a pulse and fast-twitch muscle." 
</P>
<P>
 And it is unlikely that the teams at USC will approach the size of the squads 
Allice had at Long Beach, which usually numbered about 70 athletes. Trojan 
teams in the past have been small with an emphasis in the sprints. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always believed in balance and I believed in numbers," Allice said. "A lot 
of the emphasis here has been in certain areas, but I believe sprints, jumps, 
throws, distances. . . . everything is important to have a real and true track 
and field program. I might find out at this institution that this might not 
lend itself to be balanced but that's something I have to learn for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Allice faced a similar situation coaching at Long Beach State from 1974-78, 
where he once held the school 440-yard record of 49.2 seconds. But the Long 
Beach Poly High and Long Beach City College alumnus managed to guide the 49ers 
to a seventh-place finish in the 1976 NCAA meet. Long Beach, a team with only 
three full scholarships, also ranked among the top 13 dual-meet teams in the 
nation by Track & Field News Magazine four times in Allice's five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He has 12 men's and 16 women's track scholarships at his disposal at USC, but 
Allice, who also coached at Cal Poly Pomona and Long Beach Poly, Long Beach 
Wilson and Compton high schools, will encourage walk-ons and plans to recruit 
athletes from the football team. He also plans to uphold his longstanding 
policy of allowing any athlete to compete regardless of ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never turn anybody away," Allice said. "Anybody can be part of my program. 
I will do the same here. The only problem is there aren't many people who are 
going to spend $18,000 a year to go to school unless their parents are in a 
different tax bracket. I've had to use creativity wherever I've been. Who 
knows? I might have to start taking out ads in the Daily Trojan."

OPINION; A PLAN TO REEL IN TOURISTS TO LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its soon-to-open $100-million convention center, Long Beach will be 
embarking on a serious advertising campaign to sell our city as a 
convention-oriented community. 
</P>
<P>
 From current news reports, Long Beach convention officials think our city has 
very little to offer in the way of entertainment or outside activities for 
locals or out-of-town visitors and conventioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 If Long Beach is going to invest for the future, we need a sensible 
revenue-producing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not good business to hold a convention in Long Beach, then have the 
participants and their families spend their money at Disneyland, Universal 
Studios or Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, with its unmatched spectacular view of the ocean, white sandy 
beaches, its walking and bicycle path, has a decided advantage over landlocked 
convention-seeking cities. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 77-year resident of Long Beach, I have seen our fishing facilities go 
through various cycles of success and, because of port expansion, near failure. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as one of the many thousands of avid Long Beach fishermen, I would like 
to offer a suggestion to help our sagging economy. 
</P>
<P>
 This plan centers on the use of the closed, sand-clogged small-craft launching 
facility at Golden Shores. We should relocate, at the Harbor Department's 
expense, the present Sportfishing Landing at 555 W. Pico Blvd., under their 
jurisdiction, to this location with its ample parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the present landing's profitability, it is being forced out of 
existence by the critically needed expansion of Hanjin Shipping Container 
Storage, the oil pipeline excavation and the mile-long, never-ending, 
dangerous, trailer-loaded trains and trucks that periodically block the 
entrances to the landing. This parking area was originally supposed to be 
reserved for fishermen and restaurant patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the past Harbor Department Commission's ill-advised closing of the 
once popular Pierpoint Fishing Landing and entertainment center, it has been 
imperative, due to needed port expansion, to relocate to a location with more 
accessible parking. 
</P>
<P>
 If a solution to our sportfishing facilities is not found, Long Beach, along 
with losing our Navy Shipyard to San Diego, will soon be replaced by San Diego 
as the sportfishing capital. This would enhance their economy, and further 
devastate Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 To dispel any fears the city officials may have that my proposal is just 
another money-losing idea fastened on to the already burdened Long Beach 
taxpayer, consider this: In the United States last year, there were 51.2 
million active licensed fishermen. In California they spent $4.2 billion and 
created 70,350 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 TOM MURPHY, Long Beach  
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, an avid fisherman and former restaurateur, presented this speech, 
which has been edited for space, to the Long Beach City Council and again to 
the Long Beach Harbor Commission.

PICNIC PERFECT; A WHERE AND WHAT GUIDE TO EATING OUT -- ANTS OPTIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for the Times Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You don't need a wicker basket, barbecue grill or lazy afternoon to enjoy a 
summery picnic. Most of Orange County is prime terrain for outdoor eating. 
Unlimited food choices and interesting locations make informal picnicking an 
easy alternative to dining in, anytime. 
</P>
<P>
 These five possibilities go one step beyond peanut butter sandwiches, ants and 
that favorite grassy hill. Use them as hints to plan picnics on your own, and 
remember to put a daub of sun block on the more sensitive spots. Urban  
</P>
<P>
 The setting: 
</P>
<P>
 If you're feeling solitary, how about a quintessentially Pacific Rim picnic of 
Japanese bento eaten in the lush, strangely compelling California Scenario 
sculpture garden? This Japanese rock garden is sandwiched between the El Torito 
Grill and Bank of the West buildings in the South Coast Plaza area. It is the 
creation of famed Japanese American sculptor Isamu Noguchi. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, it would be considered shitsurei -- a rudeness -- to eat lunch in a 
formal garden such as this. But this is America, and no one seems to mind. Grab 
a bench and unpack your lunch. You'll sit behind a white concrete wall, 40 feet 
high, shielded from the outside world. Cascading waters turn traffic noises 
beyond the wall into relaxing white noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The motif is a jigsaw of contrasting elements: solitary, irregular rock masses 
jutting from a sandstone floor, flowering cacti on a dome shaped knoll, a 
stainless steel fountain surrounded by Rockville granite, a 30-foot waterfall, 
a redwood path called Forest Walk. Eating here is uplifting, almost spiritual. 
It's also ideal for reading or meditation. 
</P>
<P>
 The grub: 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese bento are nearly perfect for neat, efficient and delicious outdoor 
eating. These small, square lunch boxes are a national passion in Japan, eaten 
in train stations on park benches and at sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebisu Market in Fountain Valley is a favorite local purveyor of Japanese bento 
and snack foods. It sells a wide variety that includes unagi (eel), mixed sushi 
bento, onigiri (savory filled rice triangles) and assorted donburi (large rice 
bowls with tasty toppings). 
</P>
<P>
 For me, one unagi bento and a small package of onigiri make a good lunch. This 
particular bento is a small, bubble-top plastic container filled with rice, 
Japanese pickles and tender, delicious sea eel, glazed with a sweet salty brown 
sauce that seeps down and flavors the rice, all the way to the bottom of the 
container. 
</P>
<P>
 You can get wooden chopsticks from the front counter at Ebisu Market at no 
charge, but you won't need them for the onigiri, Japanese finger food. These 
onigiri come in three flavors: salted plum, smoked salmon and burdock root. If 
you can handle dessert, stop by Bon Marche French Pastry, next to the market, 
and take along a slice of their creamy cheesecake and a cup of their fresh 
brewed coffee.

 Newport's Cliff Drive Park is far from the madding crowd, in this case the 
relentless stream of tourists and fun-seekers a mile or so below on the ever 
busy Balboa Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport can be overbearing in the summer, but this lovely, sunny spot is 
perfect for a quiet lunch for two. Indeed, it is almost too quiet. The park 
extends over two levels, layered with dense shrubbery toward the bottom, nearly 
bare by the picnic area at the top. 
</P>
<P>
 The park's lower level has rather sophisticated slides and other childlike 
diversions. The picnic area employs traditional, wooden tables -- peeling paint 
and all. Look for it where Cliff Drive curves around toward Santa Ana Street. 
Despite spare facilities, a distinct lack of shade and a partially obstructed 
ocean view, there's a lot to like up here. You'll find grills and a water 
fountain adjacent to the tables, plus some lovely Newport homes in view. 
</P>
<P>
 The only distraction might be the twittering of a bird or the occasional roar 
of an engine as a car whooshes around the curve of Cliff Drive nearest to where 
you are sitting. To get to Cliff Drive Park, turn east on Riverside, opposite 
the China Palace restaurant on Pacific Coast Highway, and make a left on Cliff, 
following until the park comes into view.

 Farmer's Market at Atrium Court is certainly Orange County's snazziest indoor 
market, overflowing with boutique snacks, terrific cold cuts and cheeses and 
beautifully stacked fresh produce. 
</P>
<P>
 A companion and I filled a picnic basket with bread, cold cuts, cheese, 
composed salads and fruit for a very reasonable price, spread it out simply in 
the park and feasted. We started with the incredible, crusty baguette from 
Nancy Silverton's La Brea Bakery, adding a quarter pound each of white meat 
turkey breast, San Daniele prosciutto and smoked mozzarella. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmer's Market sells composed salads for $3.79 per pound, packed in 
bubble-top plastic containers. We chose simply: half red potato salad, half the 
market's creamy homemade Caesar. A few Nicoise olives, French cornichon pickles 
and bottled sodas later, we had ourselves a magnificent outdoor lunch. Dessert 
was a half-pound of cold, crisp, Rainier cherries -- luscious, sweet yellow red 
cherries from the state of Washington. Next time, I'll try building a meal 
around Silverton's pungent olive bread, a few of the market's rich pates and 
the amazing white peaches available in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmer's Market at Atrium Court, 401 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach. 
(714) 760-0403. Open 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
Sunday.

minutes. Aquatic

 Who among us doesn't crave an occasional meal on the beach, even when the 
coastline is wall to wall with surfer boys and beach bunnies? 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't like a big crowd, head for the county extremes, sleepy San 
Clemente or underappreciated Seal Beach. Seal, unlike neighbors Huntington 
Beach (to the south) and Long Beach (to the north,) is rarely busy, even on hot 
summer Saturdays. The stretch of beach just north of the pier is possibly the 
least overrun of all our beaches. Locals aim to keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor yourself by a long stone jetty at the northern end, from which Long 
Beach Marina-based pleasure craft head out onto open ocean. Next to it, and 
near the corner of Ocean Avenue and First Street, is a long, soft stretch of 
white sand, just past a public parking lot (which closes at 6 p.m.). At low 
tide, there should be well over 300 yards of beach from the public parking 
area, where the sand starts, to the water's edge. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll sit somewhere in between sea birds and avid windsurfers. Sunsets can be 
especially spectacular -- ruddy, glowing red, infused with calm. The only mild 
drawback is an occasionally gusty wind. To counter that, park your blanket on 
the leeward side of one of the beach's many lifeguard towers. 
</P>

<P>
 "Let us pack your picnic basket," says a sign in the window of Belmont Shore's 
Shenandoah Cafe. Indeed, you should. 
</P>
<P>
 This resolutely American cafe, open 11 years, specializes in regional American 
foods and does so in grand style. Proprietors Rick and Jill Wilson serve 
anything from Louisiana-style chicken gumbo to Dakota pork loin, a specialty of 
Sioux Falls, S.D. Furthermore, the accompaniments -- yeasty rolls, apple 
fritters and great lumpy mashed potatoes with country gravy -- are divine. 
</P>
<P>
 The cafe won't really pack your basket, though. Order dinner to go, and they 
will pack up their food in plastic boxes, which leak if you are not careful. My 
wife and I went for two of the better dishes Shenandoah prepares, country fried 
pork chops and Texas-style beef brisket. The pork is center cut and makes a 
perfect match for these mashed potatoes. The flaky, remarkably lean brisket is 
cut into thin strips, blackened slightly by grill marks. 
</P>
<P>
 You could almost make a meal on the delicious breads included. The yeast rolls 
are the soft, old-fashioned type, slightly sweet, while the apple fritters are 
round, dusted with sugar and properly doughy. You'll get a big salad with fat 
croutons and ranch dressing as part of the deal, plus a choice of side dishes: 
spicy rice, sauteed veggies or smoky beans. For dessert, try the German butter 
cake, a pudding-like confection drizzled with apricot puree. 
</P>
<P>
 Shenandoah Cafe, 4722 East 2nd St., Belmont Shore (Long Beach). (310) 434- 
3469. Open for dinner only, 5 to 10 p.m. daily.

<P>
 Picnic for two: about $30. Approximate driving time between the two spots: 10 
minutes. Entertaining  
</P>
<P>
 The setting: 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre is Orange County's version of the Hollywood Bowl 
-- with better picnic grounds. But it should be noted that picnicking is only 
allowed at the venue when classical music is on the bill, not when rock 
concerts are featured. The Pacific Symphony Orchestra's seventh summer season 
at Irvine Meadows continues with concerts through Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 After purchasing event tickets, a must before entering the grounds, you 
encounter a long, snaky road leading up to the stadium, nearly all of which is 
bordered by green lawns and grassy knolls. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll have plenty of competition, but don't panic; it is not necessary to 
jump on the first spot you find. I prefer to picnic as close to the stadium as 
I can get, especially if I do not bring my own drinks. (Drinks are sold near 
the stadium, but the concessions do not provide covers, making it dicey to 
carry them long distances back to your blanket.) 
</P>
<P>
 The best area is up near the top, a wonderful grassy lawn surrounded by a food 
court area with stalls for Ruby's, Del Taco and California Pizza Kitchen. The 
one problem with this spot is that often it is cordoned off and unavailable. In 
that case, areas just below the upper lawn make good alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 If you prefer to picnic inside the stadium, head for the lawn area above the 
fixed seats, where as many as 4,582 people can find a spot to lounge on 
blankets they bring. No chairs are allowed up there, but seating is on an 
incline, so you should be able to see the stage -- with a pair of binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
 Rules here state that no alcoholic beverages, bottles or coolers may be 
brought inside the stadium, but the rules relax somewhat with regard to what 
you may bring onto the grounds. If you do take drinks in a cooler, plan to 
carry the cooler back to the car before entering the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates open for picnicking at 6 p.m., with Pacific Symphony concerts beginning 
at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I've long been a fan of Richard Jones Pit Barbecue, because I love their 
pressure-smoked, hickory-flavored meats. The Fountain Valley store is the 
closest of the three local ones (others are in Fullerton and Anaheim Hills) to 
Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. They wrap their meats in foil before putting them 
in snap-top plastic boxes, ensuring that they will be hot and juicy when you 
are ready to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 You can feed a family of six on two of Richard Jones' family packs. Each rib 
pack combines two pounds of fall-off-the-bone-tender baby backs, two pint side 
dishes and six hunks of chewy sourdough bread. The chicken pack gives you a 
whole chicken plus the same extras. They throw in napkins, barbecue sauce and 
utensils. We added six ears of buttered corn, also foil-wrapped, and they were 
crisp and sweet when unpacked. 
</P>
<P>
 The meats are terrific, shot through with the unmistakable taste of hickory, 
and side dishes like a finely chopped slaw and saucy beans can't be faulted. 
Desserts can be ordered a la carte at around $3.25 apiece, and include a fudgy 
chocolate layer cake, a spicy, fresh tasting peach cobbler and creamy 
cheesecake with a thick, graham cracker crust. 
</P>

 Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, 808 Irvine Center Drive, Irvine. (714) 855-6111.

 How about a back-country picnic in a beautiful, little-known regional park? If 
that prospect appeals to you, Santiago Oaks Regional Park has to be perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that this 350-acre park has been open to the public since 
1976, it remains one of our least known, most dramatic regional parks. The park 
is a prime bird-watching location, with more than 130 species ranging from 
herons to owls, and there is abundant wildlife in the more remote regions. The 
lower portion is dominated by majestic live oak trees, a grove of which frames 
the shaded picnic area. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are a hiker, there are plenty of hiking and self-guided nature trails 
to explore here. If you are not, count yourself lucky; the picnic area is a 
robust, one-minute walk from the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll pass a grove of fragrant orange trees and a pretty gazebo, then cut 
through a clearing. The barbecue area has swings for children, 35 tables and 
six barbecue pits. As fire danger tends to be high here during summer months, 
this is the only area of the park where it is permissible to barbecue. You'll 
also want to watch your fingers. Santiago Oaks Regional Park has a thriving 
community of poison oak. 
</P>
<P>
 The grub: 
</P>
<P>
 Mattern Sausage is a European deli less than five miles from the park. It is 
operated by Willi and Anni Mattern, sausage makers extraordinaire, and it is 
simply a great place to stock up on items for a sophisticated picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 Two couples intent on an old-fashioned weenie roast can try the Mattern's 
bratwurst, bockwurst or spicy Hungarian sausage, all of which are well suited 
to a charcoal fire. Bratwurst is a grainy sausage made from pork, veal and 
spices, and it browns up crisp on an outdoor fire. Bockwurst are more delicate, 
white sausages, mostly veal, with a mild flavor. Wilder palates should cotton 
to Hungarian sausage, a red sausage that literally spits out garlic and paprika 
when grilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompany these meats with some of Mrs. Mattern's homemade German potato 
salad, her sweet pungent sauerkraut and some German rolls, crustier than 
ordinary French rolls. (She sold more than 1,000 of these rolls on Fourth of 
July weekend, she says.) The deli sells Hausfrauenart German pickles, in the 
jar, for $2.95, and terrific spicy mustard from Kuhne, also imported from 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Two pounds of sausage should yield eight links. There's also Weihenstephan 
German beer, world renowned and great ice cold on a hot summer day -- but those 
will have to stay in a cooler locked in the trunk of your car. Intoxicants of 
any kind are forbidden in all county parks, a lamented, but understandable, 
rule of nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago Oaks Regional Park, 2145 N. Windes Drive, Orange. (714) 538-4400. 
Open 7 a.m. to sunset daily. Parking: $2 per vehicle.  
</P>
<P>
 Mattern Sausage Inc., 4327 E. Chapman Ave, Orange. (714) 639-6563. Open 9 a.m. 
to 3 p.m. Monday through Thursday, till 6 p.m. Friday and Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 Picnic for four: about $22 (without beer). Approximate driving time between 
the two spots: 10 minutes.

STONE TEMPLE PIRATES?; CRITICS SAY STP MIMICS EVERYONE FROM PEARL JAM TO 
ZEPPELIN, BUT NO ONE DENIES THEY'RE A HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm, Mike Boehm covers pop music for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Selling records has never been a problem for Stone Temple Pilots. But the 
band, which has ties (albeit tenuous ones) to the Orange County music scene, 
has been less successful when it comes to ducking the verbal brickbats of 
critics and some of its musical brethren. 
</P>
<P>
 When it played at Irvine Meadows last year on the KROQ "Weenie Roast" bill, 
STP was the obvious crowd favorite. But that didn't prevent the band from 
getting razzed from the same stage by another act on the bill -- the Posies, 
who lampooned STP for its undeniable appropriation of the bankable Seattle 
grunge-rock sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Another fuss broke out last year when Stone Temple Pilots' debut release, 
"Core," was voted album of the year at the San Diego Music Awards. Grass-roots 
rockers on the San Diego scene questioned STP's right to be considered a local 
band, and they didn't seem at all eager to welcome the hot new band as a 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The abuse continues in Pavement's "Range Life," one of the most widely heard 
songs from one of the year's most critically adored bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone Temple Pilots, they're elegant bachelors.  
</P>
<P>
 They're foxy to me, are they foxy to you?  
</P>
<P>
 Another line from the same song hints at why Stone Temple Pilots have suffered 
such a chilly reception in the hippest alternative-rock circles: "Hey, you 
gotta pay your dues before you pay the rent." 
</P>
<P>
 STP, which returns to Irvine Meadows on Saturday, didn't go through the 
alternative-rock boot camp of independent label releases, hard-mileage touring 
in smelly vans, and long-haul cultivation of a grass-roots following. Band 
members Scott Weiland (the singer who hails from Huntington Beach), Robert and 
Dean DeLeo and Eric Kretz did knock about on the O.C., L.A. and San Diego club 
scenes, under the name Mighty Joe Young. But a large sum in mandatory dues went 
unpaid when STP quickly landed a major label deal with Atlantic Records and saw 
"Core" turn into an instant success (the album has sold more than 3 million 
copies). 
</P>
<P>
 With its canny redeploying of sounds and attitudes previously heard on 
successful albums by the Seattle bands Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Alice in 
Chains, STP was an easy target for charges of musical theft. What may have 
truly rankled alternative rock purists was the fact that "Core" stood as 
irrefutable proof that grunge rock was no longer alternative at all, but merely 
the new arena rock. Proponents had hailed grunge as a raw, adventurous, 
rebellious departure (in fact, with Nirvana as the shining exception, it more 
often was a dull, monolithic and dauntingly inarticulate recycling of Led 
Zeppelin and Black Sabbath riffs and Doors-like darkness). With Stone Temple 
Pilots cloning the most accessible elements of grunge with lucrative results, 
grunge admirers could no longer deny that the music had turned into a 
recyclable formula. "Core" inadvertently announced that this episode in musical 
rebellion was over. Stone Temple Pilots got rich, but they also got ridiculed 
as the bearer of the bad news that grunge was a spent force. 
</P>
<P>
 Now STP is back with its second album, "Purple," which debuted at No. 1 on the 
Billboard chart. The Pearl Jam and Soundgarden mimicry is downplayed; instead, 
Zeppelin-derived mystery and grandeur are more pronounced, and the stylistic 
borrowings are more omnivorous ("Lounge Fly," for instance, is an episodic song 
that echoes darkly psychedelic Beatles, rap-happy Red Hot Chili Peppers and Led 
Zeppelin in its acoustic folk-Druid mystical mode). 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a form of rock-for-the-masses that may not be original or 
insightful (STP's lyrics are as vague as they come; the general emotional 
thrust typically allows for a glint of hopefulness embedded in the mandatory 
'90s-rock ditch of dejection), but it is admirably crafted. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone Temple Pilots have an ear for hooky riffs and melodies, and their 
palette of sounds and range of dynamics are broad enough to hold interest even 
when you have no idea what the band is driving at. As arena rock goes, it beats 
the heck out of the Bryan Adamses, Journeys and Def Leppards of the past. The 
grunge-alternative rebellion may be over, but it did leave us with a better 
form of mass-appeal, big-gesture rock than we had before. 
</P>
<P>
 The truly alternative spark in modern rock was lit during the pre-grunge 
1980s, and it lives on in Meat Puppets and Redd Kross, two veteran bands that 
turn up on STP's under card at Irvine (also appearing is Rust, a young, 
grunge-influenced band from San Diego; Wiskey Biscuit, a promising Orange 
County band previously announced as the fourth act on the bill, will not play 
at Irvine, but will appear with Stone Temple Pilots, Meat Puppets and Redd 
Kross at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Meat Puppets have paid enormous dues. From 1982 through 1990, the Arizona trio 
released album after album on the independent SST label. It signed with the 
majors at last in 1991, and this year's "Too High to Die" finally has exposed 
Meat Puppets to a wider audience (the album recently reached No. 62 on the 
Billboard chart; a guest appearance by band members Curt and Cris Kirkwood on 
Nirvana's "MTV Unplugged" session didn't hurt). Success has not been paid for 
with artistic compromise; the band's hallmarks remain its dream-state lyrics, 
homespun harmonies and picturesque guitar journeys that convey a sense of 
magical, excursionary motion through wide-open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Redd Kross, which hails from the Beach Boys' hometown of Hawthorne, can even 
claim seniority over the Meat Puppets. The band members were in their teens 
when they debuted in 1980. Like both Stone Temple Pilots and Meat Puppets, Redd 
Kross has a brotherly connection, with singer Jeff McDonald and bassist Steven 
McDonald having anchored the band from the beginning. Redd Kross' signature 
style, much evident on its latest album, "Phase-shifter," combines an obsession 
with pop culture as a song subject, a sweet tooth for juicy, Beatles-inspired 
harmonies and melodies, and a taste for the aggressive guitar buzz of punk and 
psychedelic rock.

 The flagship band of New Orleans R&B is one of the bright spots in the Orange 
County Fair's ho-hum musical lineup. The Nevilles bring their funky stuff to 
the Pacific Amphitheatre on Friday, July 15. Admission to the 8 p.m. show is 
free to fair-goers. (714) 708-3247. IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO: ADRIAN BELEW 
</P>
<P>
 Belew's distinctive guitar distortions have led to sideman credits with David 
Bowie and others, and he is preparing to resume his slot in the reformed King 
Crimson. But this show will focus on his own pop-loving stuff. Belew plays at 
the Coach House on today, July 14. (714) 496-8930. IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO: LEE 
ROCKER'S BIG BLUE 
</P>
<P>
 The Stray Cats bassist emerges as a front man for the first time, with the 
emphasis not on rockabilly, but on barroom blues and R&B. The trio, which has 
just released its debut album on Black Top Records, plays at the Coach House on 
Friday, July 15. (714) 496-8930.

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: SLIM GAILLARD, "THE LEGENDARY MCVOUTY" (1941-46); HEP  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This British release presents a collection of early '40s radio transcriptions 
from the king of the hepcats. Vocalist-guitarist Gaillard couldn't be denied by 
jazz critics of the day -- though many would have preferred to -- due to his 
work with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, but it's through his persona as a 
jive-talking, loose-throated singer of bop novelties that he is best 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaillard created a nonsensical dialect he called "Vout" and employed it 
liberally throughout such songs as "Voutoreene," "Yep Roc Heresi" and the 
absurd "African Jive." Listening to these bizarre snippets of sublime wartime 
surrealism today demonstrates that Gaillard, an unabashed entertainer who 
relished the raw silliness for which detractors panned him, actually was ahead 
of his time. 
</P>
<P>
 These hypnotic, stream-of-consciousness song-sketches can legitimately be 
compared to the formless experimentation of Ornette Coleman, Frank Zappa and 
others, although Gaillard's work is purposefully artless and performed strictly 
for fun. The extended take here on "Avocado Seed Soup Symphony" boggles the 
mind with its unrestrained senselessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Abetted on these swinging tracks by the likes of Tiny Brown, Slam Stewart, 
Dodo Marmarosa, Chico Hamilton and others, the rhythm intoxicates as much as 
the laughter. BUDDY SEIGAL

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: DAN PENN, "DO RIGHT MAN"; SIRE  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a safe bet that at least one of the '60s soul hits written by Penn was 
echoing through John Hiatt's head when he wrote "Memphis in the Meantime," 
which includes a plea for a dose of Penn's brand of classic R & B: "One more 
heartfelt steel guitar chord, girl it's gonna do me in / I need to hear some 
trumpet and saxophone, you know, sound as sweet as sin." 
</P>
<P>
 That's probably a yearning Penn feels every now and then in his home in 
Nashville, Tenn., too. Although Penn's name may not ring a bell, his songs 
certainly should. They've been recorded by Aretha Franklin ("Do Right Woman Do 
Right Man"), James & Bobby Purify ("I'm Your Puppet"), Linda Ronstadt ("The 
Dark End of the Street"), the Box Tops ("Cry Like a Baby") and many others.

 Penn has recorded versions of his music, but only sporadically -- it's been 21 
years since his last album. For this one, he set up shop in Alabama's famed 
Muscle Shoals studios and enlisted such top session players as organist Spooner 
Oldham (also Penn's longtime songwriting partner), guitarists Reggie Young and 
Jimmy Johnson and, of course, those sweet-as-sin Muscle Shoals horns. 
</P>
<P>
 As a vocalist, Penn sounds an awful lot like Eric Clapton, though his dusky 
voice is slightly heartier. And while he won't make you forget the original 
versions of his most famous compositions, his own perspective on them is every 
bit as valid. He brings a more melancholy edge to "I'm Your Puppet" and a 
plaintive cry to "Do Right Woman. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Zero Willpower," one of several less-famous songs here, he sings "I leave 
myself wide open / I'm a door that you walk through" in a way that perfectly 
captures the tune's vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 The '60s soul feel of the production as a whole feels timeless, never dated. 
Let's just hope it's not another 21 years before we hear from Penn again. RANDY 
LEWIS

WANNA DANCE?: IT'S LAVA AT FIRST SIGHT FOR THE COLLEGE CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 To prove its worth, a nightclub doesn't have to happen in a fabulous place, be 
staffed with slick employees or charge exorbitant prices for admission, drinks 
or billiards. Case in point is the Lava Room at Costa Mesa's Newport Station 
every Monday night, a molten good time based on a very basic formula. 
</P>
<P>
 The location is nothing to rave about, but it has all the necessary elements: 
two bars, a good-sized parquet dance floor, a couple of coin-operated pool 
tables, colored lights, a mirrored ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Station, which has long been rented out to club promoters, also 
offers video games and a blackjack table that charges $5 for "$1,200" worth of 
chips; play for the thrill, not for any financial returns. There's nothing 
particularly intriguing about the place; then again, there's nothing exactly 
tacky about it either. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoter D.I. Productions (headed by David Seals, who gave life to Roxbury 
South on Wednesdays last summer) didn't go all out decorating the club, as many 
promoters do to personalize their once-a-week gigs. 
</P>
<P>
 Seals does install a lava lamp effect of swirling colored lights that shimmer 
on the outside wall and inside on a nine-foot screen near the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are the skateboard and surf videos rolling throughout the night on 
several monitors and on a large silver screen overlooking the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the name is not new, just a derivation of the trendy Lava Lounge in 
Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 Other ingredients that are neither innovative nor progressive include go-go 
dancers and the tunes. But deejay Mark Moreno's selection of punk, alternative, 
funk and disco are at least choice dance favorites. Tracks from the Beastie 
Boys to Parliament/Funkadelic get the 300 to 450 patrons who attend here weekly 
groovin'. 
</P>
<P>
 Also key is the cost. The cover is only $5, and patrons can bring a friend in 
for free before 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this, the place doesn't get crowded until well after the 11th hour. It 
takes folks until then to loosen up and hit the floor en masse, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Bar specials are $1 drafts, $2 domestic beers (a bottle of Bud is the popular 
accouterment for the night) and well drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal sweetens the inexpensive night further by featuring live bands, both 
local acts of the grunge, punk and funk variety and better-known artists such 
as the Gap Band (scheduled for sometime in August, though an exact date hasn't 
been set). 
</P>
<P>
 It's the right combination of all these parts that makes the month-old Lava 
Room such a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a couple of other local haunts attract this many hip patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Dress is casual, but very cool. These are the college-age kids who frequent 
alternative-wear boutiques, not the mall, so it's no real surprise that they'd 
latch onto this seemingly unremarkable spot.

...AND HE TOOK IT SITTING DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes, the less you know, the better. 
</P>
<P>
 When my editor asked me to try the new Ejection Seat attraction at the Orange 
County Fair, I agreed without hesitation, then pretty much forgot about it. It 
was a hectic week, so I never got time to read the press materials.  
</P>
<P>
 The morning of the demonstration, I woke up bleary after a late night of work 
and drove straight to the fair. The only thing I knew about the ride was that 
it was billed as a "reverse bungee jump," a description that, though vaguely 
ominous, brought no particular image to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 As I walked to the meeting point, workers all over the fairgrounds were 
getting ready for the fair's official opening the next day. Two tall towers, 
looking like the twin masts of a sailing ship, were visible in the distance, 
and it soon became obvious they were my destination. 
</P>
<P>
 A small knot of people was waiting when I arrived, fashionably late, and 
someone asked cheerfully if I had been able to sleep the night before. I smiled 
and shook my head. Everyone clearly expected me to be terrified, and I thought 
it only sporting to play along. Don't think I'm boasting -- I can get plenty 
scared if I have the time -- but I just hadn't thought about it much. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I looked up and took it all in. Hanging from the two towers were long elastic 
cords, like those used for bungee-jumping, which were attached at ground level 
to a pair of padded seats protected by a circular metal bar. I sat down and was 
strapped in beside Peter Kockelman, the ride's designer, who casually began 
giving me some numbers: towers, 125 feet high; riders go 30 feet over top of 
towers; acceleration from launch, zero to as much as 65 m.p.h., 
instantaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, I got a knot in my stomach. Perhaps I hadn't thought this 
through properly. But by this time it was far too late to do anything but 
pretend nonchalance. 
</P>
<P>
 The seats, attached to the ground with a hook, began rocking and straining as 
the elastic bands were tightened with winches. I was told to cross my ankles 
and hold on to the straps. Kockelman kept talking calmly, as if we were sitting 
on a park bench. 
</P>
<P>
 All at once, and before I really expected it, we were launched straight into 
the air like a rock in a slingshot (the difference, of course, is that we 
remained tied to the elastic). I was told later that riders experience three to 
four Gs of force -- seven is the most a person can endure -- and I felt all of 
it. But the most exhilarating part came as we reached the top of our arc and 
floated, weightless, for just a moment, before plummeting again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The seats can rotate freely on their horizontal axis, and do. The first time 
we screamed down to Earth, we were going down headfirst. I shouted a few 
obscenities and then laughed like an idiot, gripping the steel supports as we 
came to the bottom and shot up again. And again and again, as we bounced 
numerous times. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, the bounces got smaller and my stomach settled back into something 
close to its usual position. Because the elastic cords absorb the force of each 
bounce, the ride is fast but never jarring, and near the end, the sensation is 
one of floating gently up and down. Then it was over and we were lowered to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 With preparation and all, the attraction takes about three minutes, although 
the actual "ride" is probably less than a minute. I'd say it's enough, however; 
I was offered a solo trip, but with legs slightly wobbly and a tiny touch of 
queasiness, I politely declined (solo riders rise considerably faster than two 
riders together, because of the weight difference). 
</P>
<P>
 It is a thrill, to be sure. The question for fair-goers is one of price: How 
much are they willing to pay for a quick adrenaline rush, albeit a memorable 
one? The cost of the Ejection Seat is $40 for a solo rider, $60 for two. Steep, 
but reports from the first days of the fair said business was brisk. 
</P>
<P>
 Before I left, I asked to watch someone else take the ride, and if anything, 
it looks even worse than it actually feels. It occurred to me that I had missed 
part of the "fun" of the ride, the anticipation.  
</P>
<P>
 The Ejection Seat (there are several, some traveling to fairs and some at 
permanent sites) is a product of Bungee Adventures, a Bay Area-based company 
that was the first to offer commercial bungee-jumping, Kockelman says.  
</P>
<P>
 Kockelman designed the Ejection Seat as a way of making the "bungee 
experience" relatively risk-free, and at the same time bringing it to big 
crowds of potential customers at fairs and other events. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an important difference: Bungee-jumping requires that extra act of 
faith, that deliberate step into the abyss. But for a more controlled, still 
exhilarating taste of that free-falling sensation, the Ejection Seat remains at 
the fair until July 24.

DO IT!: CAMP PENDLETON RUN OFFERS ADVENTURES IN MUDDERHOOD

<P>
 Runners have it pretty good in Southern California, where dry conditions are 
the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Folks looking for the exception have a chance to tackle a perfectly -- and 
intentionally -- dreadful course Saturday in Camp Pendleton. The base's 
first-ever 10K Mud Run is an obstacle course around Lake O'Neill, just north of 
Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants, including a contingent of Marines, will negotiate muddy trails 
and roads, sometimes steep. They'll scale fences and cross rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for a final touch, they will belly-crawl through a pit of water and mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Runners can leave their ultralight running shoes and nylon shorts at home. 
Everyone is required to wear boots and long pants for this one, as a matter of 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mud Run is primarily an event for six-member teams (military and 
civilian), and winners will be determined by the time of the fifth-fastest 
runner on each team. Individuals also can participate, however, and 
registration will be open on race day. The event is similar to the popular one 
held in years past at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Folks looking for a more conventional event can choose the sixth annual 
Huntington Beach Pier Run on Sunday. The scenic 5K course starts at the 
Huntington Beach Pier and follows the bike path through Blufftop Park. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 runners are expected for the event. For the first time, the 
men's and women's runs will begin separately (the men start at 7:30 a.m., the 
women at 8:30 a.m.). Walkers as well as runners are invited to take part, and 
participants are to arrive early to ensure a parking space (registration begins 
at 6 a.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 After the race, participants can stick around for an awards ceremony that 
features goodies from a variety of vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 What: 10K Mud Run. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Saturday, July 16, 10 a.m. (registration opens at 8 a.m.; race course 
information will be given at 9:45 a.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Lake O'Neill, Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: From the San Diego (5) Freeway, take the Camp Pendleton exit 
north of Oceanside and enter through the main gate. Continue along Vandergrift 
road for 9.5 miles to a traffic light and turn left onto Santa Margarita Road. 
Turn right just before the lake for parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $84 for a six-member team, $20 for individuals (includes 
T-shirt). 
</P>

 Where to call: (619) 725-6836.

</P>
<P>

HEAD 'EM UP, MOVE 'EM OUT . . . RIGHT DOWN FAIRVIEW ROAD

 The Orange County Fairgrounds will stage a cattle drive on Friday that has a 
better driver-to-drivee ratio than most school car-pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning at 10 a.m., some 125 riders will guide 250 Brahma crossbreeds from 
their holding pens at Costa Mesa High School to their temporary quarters in the 
fairground's main arena."Rental cattle" from a Brawley cattle broker, the 
animals will be used in the world championship team penning events on Saturday 
and Sunday at the fair, according to spokeswoman Georgia Cluver. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair officials recruited members of the 4-H and FFA youth groups and the 
Cowboy Lawyers Assn., as well as local politicians and others, to participate 
in the drive, a new event that ties in with the 1994 fair's "Saddle Up for Fun" 
theme, Culver said. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive route runs for about a mile along Fairview Road roughly between 
Adams Street and Fair Drive, beginning at the high school's farm area and 
turning in at the fairgrounds' Princeton gate. Once on the fairgrounds, the 
animals will be driven past the carnival and into the arena. The whole affair 
should last about one hour, Culver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep a few questions in mind when choosing a particular grass: Is it right for 
your climate? For best viewing, visitors should enter the fairgound's main lot 
on Fair Drive and follow the signs to a special parking area. The lot opens at 
7 a.m. Parking is $3, but on that day, vehicles with horse-type names (Bronco, 
Pinto, Mustang -- you get the idea) park free. CORINNE FLOCKEN

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: A COLLIE'S BEST FRIEND, 'LASSIE COME HOME' IS LOYAL TO 
GENRE 
</P>

By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every now and then we'll hear about a pet that overcomes the impossible to get 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, lost in the Rockies, the loyal hound fashions skis from tree 
branches, hot-wires a snowmobile parked near an isolated cabin, makes it to the 
freeway then hitches a ride back to a worried owner sitting forlornly by the 
water bowl. That sort of thing. 
</P>
<P>
 One wonders if these apocryphal tales came before or after "Lassie Come Home," 
the 1943 MGM flick starring a resourceful collie separated from her loving pal, 
a 14-year-old played by Roddy McDowall. In the movie, which continues Golden 
West College's "Outdoor Family Film Festival" Friday night, Lassie faces 
hardship upon hardship before they're reunited. 
</P>
<P>
 No makeshift skis are needed, but the challenges are enough to impress even 
the most ardent dog worshipers. Lassie displays amazing pluck and ingenuity as 
she growls down robbers, dogcatchers, storms and rivers to return to grieving 
Joe, a boy who knows a good canine when he sees one.  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, "Lassie Come Home" is straightforward hokum, but as pure-hearted as it is 
emotionally sappy. Besides, the picture -- like any good family entertainment 
-- offers all the proper morals of a child-oriented fable. Devotion, love, 
responsibility, bravery, gumption, they're all there, in big, sentimental 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lassie Come Home" also puts the youthful McDowall and a remarkably appealing 
Elizabeth Taylor (she was 11 in this, her movie debut) in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 They both fly over the top, but who cares? They're only kids, and both know 
how to work a scene better than the hammiest grown-up. McDowall had practice, 
starring in "My Friend Flicka" earlier in 1943. Taylor went on the next year to 
play the horse-infatuated heroine in "National Velvet. 
</P>
<P>
 Up next for the series is "Tom Thumb." The 1958 movie screens July 22 in the 
campus amphitheater, as do the rest of the program's films. Russ Tamblyn stars 
as the tiny Tom in this re-creation of the Grimm fairy tale. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 29, the recent release "Beethoven's 2nd" is scheduled. This film about 
a couple of Saint Bernards, their puppies and the family that digs them stars 
Charles Grodin and Bonnie Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thumbelina" is offered Aug. 5. Another recent release, this animated feature 
tells the story of a bite-size dancer born to normal-size parents. Celebrity 
voices include John Hurt and Gilbert Gottfried. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 12, "Snowball Express" checks in. The 1972 comedy stars Dean Jones as 
a guy who tries to turn a dilapidated hotel into a booming ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
 The series ends Aug. 19 with Disney's 1964 classic "Mary Poppins," featuring 
Julie Andrews as the magical singing nanny. 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Lassie Come Home." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Friday, July 15, at dusk (between 8 and 8:30 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The Golden West College amphitheater, 15744 Golden West St., Huntington 
Beach.

 Teen-agers who like to see the underdog come out on top like this movie, some 
crying and sniffing along with the adults in this poignant role for Tom Hanks.

<P>
 "I thought it was cool to see a guy who supposedly is sub-ordinary become 
extraordinary," said Peter Goff, 13. "Everybody thought lesser of him, but he 
became better than them." 
</P>
<P>
 Gump's improbable life story is told in voice-over in the movie, as an older 
and reminiscing Gump sits on a bus bench relating his adventures to anyone who 
sits next to him. Peter's favorite part was when Gump pulls out a Fortune 
magazine with himself on the cover, proving to a skeptic he did, indeed, make 
millions in the shrimping business. (The movie is also a big success, taking in 
an impressive $32 million in its first five days.)

 "It was sad. It was good. You felt for the character," said Molly Curtin, 14. 
"I could kind of identify with him. It was kind of realistic, but then in a 
sense, it isn't. Could that many things actually happen to one person?" 
</P>
<P>
 No way. 
</P>
<P>
 But the techniques used by director Robert Zemeckis to insert Hanks into 
historical footage of real events did manage to convey a sense of history to 
youngsters about the period we have just left behind: the war in Vietnam, the 
bloody, rainy reality of the soldiers and the drug-laced reality of the 
protesters, the assassinations of a President and a presidential hopeful.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the war scenes could easily be too explosive and gruesome for younger 
children. Gump's sweetheart is an incest victim and drug addict.  
</P>
<P>
 Some said the references were too oblique and the movie too long. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Morines, 7, was so bored she couldn't even remember the most boring 
parts.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it's really a movie for kids," said Sarah Goff, 16. "I was 
walking out and heard one kid saying to her mom, 'What were they talking 
about?' "  
</P>
<P>
 Some teens said they understood one scene in which Gump phones in a burglary 
in progress he witnesses while staying at the the Watergate Hotel. Others said 
they had to have it explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Wong said she didn't understand who the U.S. soldiers in Vietnam were 
talking about when they said they had to chase "Charlie" -- the all-purpose 
phrase used for the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah wondered whether the movie portrayed some historical events or people 
too lightly. In one scene, Gump appears on a Dick Cavett show with John Lennon, 
who asks the host, what if there was no religion, no possessions, too? Cavett 
replies, "It's hard to imagine."  
</P>
<P>
 When President Johnson asks to see Gump's war wound, he pulls down his pants 
to show him. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngsters agreed the acting was splendid, particularly Robin Wright as 
Gump's sweetheart Jenny and Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan. And especially Hanks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was excellent," Sarah said. "It had to be difficult. A lot of 
people would get angry if you portrayed a person who was retarded in a 
disrespectful way. He'd get in a lot of trouble for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his slow, Southern accent, his straight-backed conservative manner, 
Hanks never gave the impression he was acting, Sarah said. "He was Forrest 
Gump."

NEWSBITES: OWNERS OF FORMER ZUNI GRILL HITCH THEIR WAGON TO FAMILY-ORIENTED 
IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Creating trends is one thing; bucking them is another. And restaurateur David 
Wilhelm's chic Zuni Grill concept just didn't work in family-oriented Irvine. 
So upscale Zuni is out, down-home Saddlerock Ranch is in -- complete with a 
Buckaroo Menu for the little ones. The restaurant opened last week at the 
Crossroads shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Zuni Grill, Saddlerock Ranch is operated by West Coast Restaurant 
Ventures, which once employed Wilhelm as director of operations. Wilhelm 
stepped down from that post in January but remains a stockholder. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporation considers Saddlerock Ranch an extension of its working 
800-acre ranch in Malibu of the same name, and the restaurant is decorated 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Older cowpokes might try Uncle Arnie's meatloaf, farm-ranched catfish or a 
fried chicken recipe "as old as the hills."  
</P>
<P>
 Meals range from $5.29 to $11.99 and include all-you-can-eat salad and two 
side dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buckaroo Menu, at $2.95, includes a side dish, a sundae and a coloring mat 
and crayons. Open 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, till 11 p.m. 
Friday and Saturday.

 A tasting of different fois gras, whole duck or goose livers considered one of 
the glories of French cuisine, and fois gras terrines will take place Wednesday 
at the Robert Mondavi Wine & Food Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 James Drakeford of Aristoff Caviar will be the host, and attendees will also 
be able to sample various varietals from the Vichon, Byron and Robert Mondavi 
wineries to determine which pairings they like best. (Hint: The French prefer 
dessert wines with their fois gras.) Cost of the tasting is $45. 
</P>
<P>
 On a less esoteric note, the center will offer its popular seminar in basic 
wine tasting skills on Tuesday. Participants will explore how components of 
wine affect appearance, taste and aroma. The $25 seminar includes a pasta 
reception and sampling of at least seven wines; attendees are requested to go 
easy on perfumes and after-shaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Both events begin at 7 p.m.

 Le Meridien in Newport Beach will hold a poolside party from 5 to 7:30 this 
evening to celebrate French independence day, or Bastille Day. Admission is 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 Food stations scattered around the third-floor pool deck will feature regional 
French appetizers. Wines include Burgundy, Bordeaux and Beaujolais varieties; 
French beer and champagne will be served. And there will be a selection of 
pastries.

THREE CHEERS FOR TWO RESTAURANTS, ONE CHEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

weekly for the Times Orange County.

<P>
 When I heard Tony Bagatta was involved with Brio and Brio Mare, my 
expectations soared. Anybody lucky enough to have experienced the long-gone 
Newport Beach restaurant Bagatta can recall some of the highest-quality Italian 
cooking ever enjoyed in this county. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagatta has a knack for attracting talented chefs, and he's found another one 
in Umberto Rubelli, who serves as executive chef for both restaurants. However, 
one chef can't be in two places at the same time, so you find a certain 
unevenness in the cuisine here. 
</P>
<P>
 Brio is a lovely garden restaurant in a Monarch Beach mini-mall. If you sit on 
the patio, the scents of sage and rosemary will be your unofficial companions. 
The South County dressed-up crowd prefers the sleek, modern dining room, 
perhaps because it's closer to the guitarist -- or because they like to watch 
the show in the open kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't mind an occasional glimpse of condos and sports cars beyond the 
herbs and sunflowers, the patio is a real pleasure spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Brio's menu offers few great surprises, but the cooking is serious, and often 
rich. Fried calamari is served with a grainy, spicy tomato sauce. The terrific 
Caesar salad shows that this kitchen is not afraid to use an anchovy or three. 
</P>
<P>
 The pizzas, of the thin-crusted Italo-modern persuasion, are cooked in an 
oak-fired brick oven. The savory pizza quattro stagioni has different toppings 
on each quadrant: mushrooms, prosciutto, artichoke hearts and olives. A pizza 
pescatore is loaded with shrimp, scallops, calamari and clams. It would be 
wonderful, but the toppings stiffen up bit in the oven. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastas are cooked al dente at both Brio restaurants, without fear or favor. 
Fettuccine ragu is excellent (the meat sauce is rich and delicious), but it 
loses a couple of points because the noodles clump up in the bowl. Mezzaluna al 
salmone is spectacular crescent-shaped ravioli stuffed with a dense, flavorful 
salmon mixture. It comes with a fine dill-cream sauce. Bagatta has always 
favored luxury, which translates to heavily sauced entrees and creamy desserts. 
One evening the special was a veal T-bone with mushroom sauce -- a fine, though 
overcooked, veal chop with a wonderful mushroom reduction. Scampi Provencale 
are large prawns in a lavish cream sauce infused with saffron and sprinkled 
with garlic, bread crumbs and herbs.  
</P>
<P>
 For dessert, try zucotto , a dome-shaped, cream-filled Italian confection made 
with sponge cake, almonds, amaretto and chocolate. Here it's the best dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brio Mare, Brio's sister restaurant in downtown Laguna, is all but identical, 
foodwise. Atmosphere -- now that's another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, this room labored under the weighty name The Place Across the 
Street From the Hotel Laguna. Owners Bagatta, Enzo Scognamiglio and Nino 
Chirico have heavily redone the previous "cosmic cafe," though they have left 
some of architect Robert Michelsen's more eccentric appointments, such as the 
astrological symbols on the walls and the celestially themed mobiles.  
</P>
<P>
 This is a visually stunning room: brick and rustic wood, a gorgeous floor 
tiled in gray slate. The walls are adorned with modern art and the best tables 
hang out over the PCH sidewalk. The people-watching is fabulous. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for pizza, because there isn't any. As compensation, the menu 
offers a couple of pastas you cannot get at Brio. Spaghetti integrale relies on 
whole-wheat spaghetti and a mushroom, sage, garlic and chopped tomato topping. 
Rigatoni rustica is a thicker noodle sauteed with spinach, sun-dried tomatoes 
and sweet Italian sausage. 
</P>
<P>
 The antipasti can be hit-or-miss. The bruschetta -- toasted bread, chopped 
tomato, basil, garlic and roasted bell pepper -- makes a satisfying snack. 
Prosciutto and melon suffer from dry ham and unripe melon. 
</P>
<P>
 Main courses are meaty and rich. There is galetto , a Cornish hen flattened, 
grilled and brushed with butter and rosemary. Medaglioni di maiale is 
medallions of pork broiled and served with an overpowering sauce based on 
mustard seed. Lighter appetites can take refuge in trota salmonata -- baby 
salmon (or, if you prefer, salmon trout) sauteed with lemon and white wine, on 
a bed of baby greens -- or spiedino di pesce spada , broiled swordfish served 
over brown rice. Ask for your swordfish moist in the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiramisu is identical to the one at Brio, lots of ladyfingers sandwiching 
a stiff mascarpone cream. Torta di formaggio and torta di cioccolato e noci are 
unique to Brio Mare and worth ordering. The former is a light, tart cheesecake 
with a fresh cream glaze. The latter is a rich suspension of fudgy cake and 
chopped nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Brio and Brio Mare are high-end moderate. Antipasti are $4.95 to $6.95. Pizzas 
are $7.50 to $9.25. Pastas are $7.95 to $11.95. Entrees are $10.95 to $15.95. *

PARKER'S PLACE: A WRITER GETS TO SEE THE WORLD, FROM HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. JEFFERSON PARKER, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of 
every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last night I dreamed that one of my living heroes, writer Thomas McGuane, 
called me out of the blue to say he loved my work and to offer me a job 
teaching with him in the prestigious writing program at the University of 
Missouri. Even dreaming, I knew this situation to be preposterous because Mr. 
McGuane lives in Montana, has probably never read a word I've written, and not 
only does not teach but is an unapologetic critic of writing programs 
everywhere. Still, I was agog that Mr. McGuane had called, and told him I was 
interested in the job just so we could keep talking for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 We made plans for me to visit him, tour the campus and hammer out the 
specifics of my contract. Seconds later, in that wonderful fast forward of 
dreams, I was right there on the campus, walking around with Mr. McGuane (he 
asked me to call him Tom) and so elevated by his company that I neglected to 
tell him I had no intention at all of taking the job. 
</P>
<P>
 On the opening day of the term I was still here in Orange County, doing my 
usual, not having notified McGuane nor anybody at the University of Missouri 
that I wouldn't be there. In one of those little codas you get at the end of a 
dream, I looked back on the episode, feeling wonderful about developing a 
relationship with the great McGuane, hoping he'd invite me bird hunting this 
fall, and quite happy to have gotten out of a job that sounded kind of tedious. 
</P>
<P>
 I was jolted from this dream about 5 a.m., which is when the Times delivery 
person comes up my driveway and the dogs explode into a frenzy of mock alarm -- 
barking, shrieking, stampeding around the deck -- until the paper hits the 
ground, after which they hustle back to their doghouses for a quick five-hour 
nap before rising, bleary-eyed and groaning, to greet the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in bed, I got to thinking about the Missouri job, and if McGuane would 
ever talk to me again for standing him up like that. More importantly, I 
started to ponder the larger meaning of the dream, which was this: Jeff, you 
are free to do just about anything in the world you want; you can live anywhere 
you choose; you can pursue any interests you might have because you are a 
widower without children and gainfully employed in work that can be done just 
about anywhere on Earth or, for that matter, in a space station. 
</P>
<P>
 I immediately began thinking about places I might like to live. 
</P>
<P>
 First I thought about Aspen, Colo., because I visited there 20 years ago and 
thought it was really great. I pictured myself ripping down the slopes on a 
snowboard, hurtling through the invigorating alpine air and flying through an 
open window only to land directly in the study of my rustic, snow-covered cabin 
and begin another chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I can't ski, let alone snowboard, and to be honest, I hate snow except in 
pictures, so the fantasy began to lose its luster pretty quickly. Friends and 
People magazine have informed me over the years about the terrible decline of 
the place and I seriously wondered whether I should leave California to live 
with so many self-obsessed loonies from Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Next was Key West, a place I visited about six years ago and thought was cool. 
I pictured myself in the town of Earnest Hemingway, Tennessee Williams, Wallace 
Stevens, Phil Caputo and, of course Thomas McGuane. I would drink where they 
drank, fish where they fished, eat where they ate and just generally inhale the 
robust literary breeze that blows across this tiny island in the stream. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I thought about all the tourists -- the place makes Laguna Beach at 
festival time look deserted -- the punishing heat and humidity, and the fact 
that Jimmy Buffett's for-profit smile seems to be all over the town. It also 
bothered me immensely that the place has no supply of fresh water (it has to be 
trucked down A1A from points north) and that, according to some kind of study 
done years ago, Floridians have the lowest IQs in the republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Next I thought about moving to Los Angeles. There I would be, smack-dab in the 
middle of the city that spawned the great detective fiction of Raymond 
Chandler, surrounded by those mean streets he wrote about, immersed in a city 
synonymous with the California Dream. The Lakers. The Dodgers. Malibu, 
downtown, Chinatown, Beverly Hills, Watts. Hollywood and Vine; Florence and 
Normandie. Dylan, Jack, Warren and Annette. Yes, a metropolitan giant in every 
sense of the word: size, influence, populousness, vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 But why would I want to live there when I live an hour away by car and still 
avoid the place like the plague? Why not just mount excursions into the city, 
enjoying what it has to offer, then escape back to the (slightly) cleaner air, 
(barely) diminished congestion and (minimally) more affordable rent to be found 
right here in Orange County? Still figuring in the McGuane factor, I recalled 
that the only time I actually met the man outside a dream was in Los Angeles, 
to which I'd driven from Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 I pondered Paris, which I find romantic; Fiji, which I find beautiful; Costa 
Rica, which I find exciting; Northern California, which I find relaxing; New 
York, which I find terrifying; New Orleans, which I find inspiring; Washington, 
D.C., which I find fascinating, and Paradise Valley, Mont., which I've never 
found at all but is where Thomas McGuane is supposed to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally I just gave up, feeling as dazed by limitless possibilities as a 
Russian expatriate in his first Price Club. I realized that in order to move 
I'd have to pack, fill out change-of-address forms and find a new dentist. If I 
moved, I'd have to say goodby to the odd county I grew up in, have buried loved 
ones in, have adored and despised, inhabited and been inhabited by for almost 
an entire lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Stick it out for a while, I told myself. Home is where you launch your dreams.

3-HOUR TOUR: YOU CAN FIND A-FAIR AMOUNT OF WHIMSY AT LAGUNA BEACH FESTIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Art used to be such a personal thing. Now it's summer fun for the masses, and 
in Laguna Beach, it seems there's a festival for every palate. The Sawdust 
Festival even has a fish taco stand. Wahoo! 
</P>
<P>
 10:30 to noon: The Sawdust Festival built its reputation on quirkiness, and 
while it's clear after 26 years that "quirky" is commercially viable here, that 
doesn't make it any less delightful. 
</P>
<P>
 You can find that whimsical birdhouse of your dreams, ceramic toothbrush 
holders also suitable for chopsticks, and "dysfunctional teapots." Also check 
out ceramic masks with one eyebrow and with hair made from tennis-racket 
strings ($150), kiln-melted "slumped glass" chess sets ($250) and koa wood 
rocking chairs ($4,000). 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Don Caruso makes scrimshaw -- etchings on ivory. "No new ivory," 
explained the artist's wife, Marsha Caruso. "Most is prehistoric ivory from 
Alaska, from fossil woolly mammoth or walrus." He's carved walruses on walrus 
tusks, mammoths on mammoth tusks, a humpback whale on petrified whalebone and a 
shark on a tooth "from a very large shark, millions of years old." 
</P>
<P>
 Toe-tally Shakespeare offers toe rings, thumb rings and "half rings" for 
middle joints by Patches Cunningham. Are toe rings the latest symbol for going 
steady? "So old it's new again," said booth attendant John Bates. "This was my 
engagement ring; my wife gave it to me 11 or so years ago. I only take it off 
to prove they do come off." 
</P>
<P>
 Painter Julita Jones' "Fleamarket" has dogs falling out of the sky, Bob Bonn's 
New West Art includes "Cactus Cat." Douglas Miller is working on Birthday 
Painting No. 15, "The Naughtiest Thing You've Ever Done," in which festival 
visitors share the naughtiest thing they've ever done and he writes it on the 
canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 A formula determines Miller's placement of peoples' birthdays, names and 
comments: "12/12? 12 plus 12 is 24 divided by 4, no remainder, corners 1, 2, 3, 
12 by 12 inches in corner 4, that's about right. . . ." He thereupon recorded 
in tiny letters the naughtiest thing I've ever done. He's also done favorite 
pet stories. "The Naughtiest . . . " has 2,000 names so far; completed 
paintings have 7,000. In 24 years at the festival, he's used 80,000 names. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission to the Sawdust Festival is $5; seniors, $4; children under 12 get in 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon to 12:30: Wahoo's Fish Tacos, Deb's Deli and Sawdust Saloon anchor one 
end of the Sawdust Festival grounds. Wahoo's offers California-Mexican cuisine. 
Soft tacos are $1.75, burritos $3.75; both are available with blackened fish, 
and both come surfer style -- "like surfers buy them from street vendors in 
Baja," explained Brazilian-born manager Wing Lam. "Soft tortillas instead of 
hard, grilled fish instead of fried, no-lard black beans instead of refried, 
white rice instead of that red-orange stuff, and no heavy sauce. High protein, 
low fat. When we go to Mexico to surf, we sit next to those taco stands and eat 
about 20 of 'em." Slake that thirst with the rice drink called horchata.  
</P>
<P>
 12:30 to 1:30: Down the road, a wire sculpture of the Eiffel Tower welcomes 
you to Art-A-Fair; nearby is a sign in German that says " Wilkommen ." The fair 
must be international in scope. 
</P>
<P>
 Floral fare is typical, but by no means universal. Gourds by Michael offers 
painted gourds and free gourd seeds. Fanciful furniture includes rustic work in 
wood by David Lee Sullenger and Sculpchairs by Herzel Maymon -- who also brings 
you alligators with snail shells on their backs running with canes -- made from 
almost anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Underwater subjects include Robin Knilans' "In Your Face" papier-mache acrylic 
polymer works such as "Eels Go to Cozumel" ($1,500). A mermaid with prominent 
nipples and nails graces a surfboard from Michael Brindley; his geometrically 
shaped canvases feature underwater and outer space scenes -- together, as in 
dolphins swimming past planets. 
</P>
<P>
 Framing her collage paintings in .34-gauge aluminum lends Gloria Rossi's works 
the feel of icons. "It didn't start out that way, although I will admit that 
I'm a spiritual person," Rossi said. Of one work she said, "That's our dark 
side. Just a tiger with its tongue sticking out, but it really worked. I'm into 
the human condition, and I've lived, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 So little cottages and country gardens aren't all you'll find at Art-A-Fair, 
but sometimes you'll wish they were. Roger Humphries' "The Volunteer" ($500), 
for example, depicts a fireman -- er, firewoman -- breasts bared, wearing a 
fireman's coat and hat and lace undies. 
</P>
<P>
 In William Wooten's booth, near his dance musculature series, hangs a poem by 
Sir Walter Raleigh: The artist uses honest paint / To represent things as they 
ain't / He then asks money for the time / It took to perpetrate the crime.  
</P>
<P>
 Admission to Art-A-Fair is $3.50; seniors, $2.50; children under 12 get in 
free. (Discount hours: Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., free; Sunday 
through Thursday, 5 to 9 p.m., $1.)

MEDIA WORLD IN MOTION; ALL EYES ON CBS . . .; AFTER LOSING QVC, IT MAY BE NEXT 
ON THE AUCTION BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Like a midair explosion, the scuttled merger plan of QVC Inc. and CBS Inc. has 
sent both companies spinning into play. Analysts on Wednesday said CBS could 
fetch more than $4 billion, while QVC might sell for nearly $3 billion if more 
than one bidder materializes. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS formally confirmed Wednesday that it will not pursue QVC in the wake of a 
surprise $2.2-billion bid from Comcast Corp. for the home shopping channel. But 
industry executives agreed that CBS is on the auction block, having tipped its 
hand last month by agreeing to a QVC merger and new management. Analysts said 
the most logical bidders include Walt Disney Co. and Turner Broadcasting Co., 
or perhaps a group led by QVC Chairman Barry Diller. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC, for its part, said it will negotiate with Comcast and "explore 
alternatives in order to maximize shareholder value." There was a flurry of 
speculation that other bidders may emerge from the ranks of cable TV companies 
or telephone firms eager to acquire programming. A source in the QVC camp would 
not rule out a bid from Diller himself, because the QVC chairman wants to run 
his own company. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some onlookers were fascinated by the speed with which CBS Chairman 
Laurence A. Tisch abandoned the QVC deal Tuesday night, within hours of the 
discovery of Comcast's rival bid. By early Wednesday, the CBS board had even 
adopted a different plan, announcing that it would buy back 22% of CBS' own 
stock for $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of fighting for QVC, the CBS chairman "ran for the door and went right 
through it," marveled one top Hollywood executive, who speculated that tension 
must have crept into the dealings between Tisch and Diller. He also said the 
71-year-old Tisch may have been feeling some seller's remorse about giving up 
his chief executive's job to Diller. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, however, opinion quickly swung to Tisch's defense, as analysts 
applauded the stock repurchase plan at $325 per share. Analysts explained that 
the action will buoy the CBS stock price while the company awaits overtures 
from bidders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tisch has been handling the stock brilliantly. He may not be an expert in 
programming, but he understands Wall Street," said John Tinker, an analyst with 
Furman Selz. "He's making the right moves; he's keeping the stock up." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS shares rose $8 to $308 on the New York Stock Exchange, while QVC soared $6 
to $42 in Nasdaq trading. After falling as low as $14.125, Comcast's stock 
recovered slightly after company executives explained their bid to more than 
100 institutional investors in a conference call. Comcast shares closed at 
$15.125, down $1.50 from the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
 The business world was stunned by Comcast's surprise bid for QVC late Tuesday 
because Comcast -- a founding shareholder of QVC -- had wooed Diller for the 
job of running the shopping network and had unflinchingly backed his 
unsuccessful $10-billion bid for Paramount Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 But in separate interviews, both Diller and Comcast President Brian Roberts 
offered the same account of their frank talks in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Diller "said to us all along, 'If you don't like CBS, you can make a bid for 
the whole company,' " Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The QVC chairman concurred. "You bet I did. . . . I have no (reason) to be 
angry with them," Diller said. 
</P>
<P>
 By that token, the QVC board meeting Wednesday was described as a civilized, 
one-hour-and-15-minute affair conducted at the Manhattan law offices of 
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. Afterward, one source said QVC and Comcast were 
already tackling a merger agreement that could be signed within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 As reported, Comcast has offered to pay $44 a share to QVC's shareholders, but 
the company told analysts it would be willing to change the structure of the 
deal, perhaps offering stock instead of cash to certain shareholders, such as 
John Malone's Liberty Media, who want to avoid a big tax bill on their profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The CBS move prompted analysts to immediately increase their per-share 
earnings projections because the company's equity base will shrink as a result 
of the buyback. Still -- if CBS is worth $360 per share, as some analysts say 
-- the company could still reap a premium price for the remaining shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to sell, you may as well bring the value up for the guys who 
remain," one institutional investor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tisch-controlled Loews Corp. said Wednesday that it will tender its CBS 
shares, fulfilling Wall Street's expectation that Tisch is committed to taking 
some cash out of the company at this time. Comcast Corp. at a Glance
