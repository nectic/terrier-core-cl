 SWEET TALK: Congressional leaders often find fault with the United Nations. 
Some grow impatient with its painstaking efforts to reach agreement among 
nations before acting. . . . Tonight, Michael Stopford will offer a different 
view at a meeting of the county's World Affairs Council in Camarillo. As 
director of the United Nations Information Center, Stopford is the U. N.'s 
liaison to Congress. "Congress constantly has some peeve with something we are 
doing," he said. The subject of his talk: "Peacekeeping and the Limits of 
Intervention."

 MIDAS TOUCH: Golden Systems Inc. doesn't have the technical prowess of some 
start-up computer companies. But the Simi Valley-based firm has carved its 
niche making computer power supplies, undercutting the prices of rivals in 
Taiwan and Hong Kong (Valley Business, Page 4). . . . Jay Tandon gets the 
credit. He's the company's president and a member of a family from India. 
Golden Systems does all its manufacturing there, using some of the lowest-cost 
technically skilled labor in the world.

 TOURIST TRAP: Before the turn of the century, descriptive writings of New York 
journalist Charles Nordhoff lured Easterners to the Ojai Valley. . . . A 
century later, Ojai continues to draw tourists -- a matter that enrages some 
locals and enriches others. Now, city leaders want to raise the town's bed tax 
to defray the cost of policing its streets (B1). But some city leaders fear 
that price hikes may discourage tourism. So they suggest marketing the town, 
sort of. . . . They want to entice tourist dollars, without becoming overrun by 
tourist hordes. 
</P>
<P>
 AIR APPARENT: Those occasional days of unhealthful air, like Simi Valley had 
over the weekend, would come to an end under a federal plan to crack down on 
polluters. But the Environmental Protection Agency's plan would cripple some 
businesses in the county, industry leaders say. So business boosters released 
their own plan Monday (B1). . . . Highlights: Fees on motorists who drive the 
most, and fewer regulations on pesticides.

 Potential PBS Cuts: In a move to cut costs, WNET-TV, the PBS station in New 
York, is considering closing the in-house production studio where both the 
"MacNeil/Lehrer" and "Charlie Rose" shows are produced. William F. Baker, the 
station president, said that closing the studio was one of several "operating 
efficiencies" being considered by the station. Both shows would be produced 
elsewhere if WNET closes its studio.

 * Tracking a Serial Killer: Actor Stephen Rea ("The Crying Game") will star as 
a real-life Russian detective who spent eight years hunting down notorious 
Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo in a movie for cable's HBO. Based on 
Robert Cullen's book, "The Killer Department," the film "Citizen X" will 
chronicle Detective Viktor Burakov's obsession with apprehending a man 
suspected of 52 murders -- and the enormous resistance Burakov encountered from 
the Soviet bureaucracy and state-controlled press that kept the public from 
learning the truth about the case. Production is scheduled to start in Europe 
in September.

 * Quality Picks: CBS' "Picket Fences" leads the nominees for the 10th annual 
Quality Awards voted on by members of the Virginia-based advocacy group Viewers 
for Quality Television. The series was nominated for eight awards, including 
best "quality drama," along with ABC's "NYPD Blue," CBS' "Northern Exposure" 
and NBC's "Law & Order" and "Homicide: Life on the Street." In the comedy 
category, nods went to NBC's "Frasier," "Seinfeld" and "Mad About You"; CBS' 
"Murphy Brown" and ABC's "Grace Under Fire." "Picket Fences' " closest 
competitors for the awards, which will be presented in Hollywood on Sept. 24, 
are "NYPD Blue" and "Northern Exposure," which each received six nominations, 
and "Murphy Brown, which got five. ART

 Overseas Recruit: One of several worrisome vacancies in high-profile American 
art museum leadership has been filled by an Englishman. Malcolm Austin Rogers, 
deputy director of London's National Portrait Gallery, has been named director 
of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. A specialist in 16th- to early 18th-Century 
portraiture who has raised funds and served as chief operating officer for the 
London institution, Rogers will succeed Alan Shestack, who left the Boston 
museum last December to become deputy director of the National Gallery of Art 
in Washington. Rogers' appointment ends a nine-month search in Boston, but new 
directors have yet to be found for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and New 
York's Museum of Modern Art. POP/ROCK

 'Lounging' in the Astrodome: Virgin records will premiere the Rolling Stones' 
new "Voodoo Lounge" album before an estimated crowd of 30,000 at the Houston 
Astrodome tonight, immediately after the Houston Astros-Cincinnati Reds 
baseball game. The album -- the band's first recorded for Virgin -- hits stores 
on July 12 with a worldwide tour to follow. In Los Angeles, Sunset Boulevard's 
Tower Records will host a listening party on July 11 from 10 p.m. to midnight, 
with a tattoo artist and tiki torches providing a "Voodoo Lounge" atmosphere in 
the store's parking lot. The store will then offer midnight sales of the new 
record. . . . Meanwhile, Virgin has served a cease and desist order against 
Wichita radio station KRZZ, which the record company says was airing a poorly 
recorded copy of four songs from "Voodoo Lounge."

 * Ticketmaster News: A New York judge has issued a summary judgment in a 
class-action lawsuit against Ticketmaster, which in effect, dismisses charges 
against the Los Angeles-based ticket giant of antitrust violations and unfair 
business practices in that case. Ticketmaster resolved a similar claim two 
months ago in California by agreeing to give away $1.5 million worth of tickets 
to charity groups and paying $750,000 in legal fees. Class-action lawsuits in 
seven other states remain pending against the corporation, whose chairman, 
Fredrick Rosen, will testify Thursday at a hearing on Capitol Hill to explore 
anti-competitive practices in the ticket distribution industry. QUICK TAKES

artist formerly known as Prince onstage to sing the Wonder classic "Maybe Your 
Baby" during a two-hour concert Sunday night at the symbol man's downtown club 
Glam Slam. Mavis Staples also joined the singer for "I'll Take You There." All 
three had appeared earlier that night at the VH-1 Honors, televised from the 
nearby Shrine Auditorium. . . . Chris Douridas has decided to remain as host of 
"Morning Becomes Eclectic" on KCRW-FM (89.9). He was expected to leave the 
station when KLIT-FM (101.9) changes to an adult alternative format later this 
week. . . . Cable's Showtime launches a new Wednesday-night programming block

DANCE REVIEW; 'RYUKYU' CELEBRATES OKINAWAN CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although a number of speeches at the Wadsworth Theater on Sunday defined 
"Rhythm of Ryukyu" as an introduction to the performing arts of Okinawa for the 
people of Los Angeles, this three-hour program of traditional music and dance 
largely duplicated what two other visiting ensembles had presented at the Japan 
America Theatre in 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 To a non-specialist, the extraordinary complement of musicians may have been 
the most distinctive element of the performance (a benefit for the UCLA Asian 
American Studies Center). In the opening "Kagiyadefu" ensemble alone, the 
playing of some 30 sanshin men and koto women -- augmented by solo flute and 
drum -- established a bright, detailed and slightly astringent context for the 
men's rich choral singing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet, flowing and refined, this group vocalism remained prominent even in 
dance accompaniments requiring far fewer instruments. And none proved more 
deeply sensuous than "Muramigui." 
</P>
<P>
 Okinawan culture boasts glittering court, vibrant folk and flamboyant martial 
arts traditions -- plus costuming that can be a show in itself. On Sunday, the 
fierce, charismatic Eiko Miyazato courted danger in a karate showpiece 
involving scythes on ropes. Whirling them over his shoulders, under his legs, 
behind his back and around his neck, he embodied an extreme of Ryukyu 
extroversion. 
</P>
<P>
 The influence of karate on Okinawan folk dance dominated bold solos by Mieko 
Higa and Yoshinobu Oyakawa. In contrast, the elegant Takeyoshi Higa could make 
the smallest shifts of pose and the simplest walking steps into compelling 
movement statements during two artful solos: the lively, warm "Hatoma-Bushi" 
and the severe, martial "Zei No Odori." 
</P>
<P>
 Tatsuko Inamine most often represented the ultimate in female classical purity 
on the program, but women's artistry also shone in the moonstruck quartet 
"Hamachidori" and "Yotsudake," in which both choreography and performance 
remained subordinate to the dancers' ravishing red-and-gold kimonos and 
gigantic flower hats. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen members of Nancy Nakaya's school offered a living example of Asian 
American studies in their exciting Obon Festival dance-and-drum guest segment. 
And the company invited the whole audience onstage at the end of the 
performance to learn Okinawan dance firsthand.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; BOSTON'S SPORE SHORTENS ITS JABBERJAW SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spore, an obscure, Sonic Youth-inspired garage band from Boston, played a show 
on Sunday at Jabberjaw that indeed sounded as if the band were in a garage, the 
instruments simulating the thick revving of a rusty V8 and the players facing 
the kind of technical problems playing in a garage presents. 
</P>
<P>
 The quartet was an hour late after breaking down in the desert heat en route 
to L.A., and had to stop the set after only a few songs because the hastily 
assembled equipment was shocking the musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs the band was able to play through between jolts of voltage conveyed 
its frustration in noisy outbursts of feedback and sporadic, unpredictable 
beats. Singer and bassist Ayal Naor traded screams with guitarist Mona Elliot, 
while the intensely loud music smothered their wails in masses of distortion. 
</P>
<P>
 An audience of 19 people stood along the small club's chipped walls, leaving a 
huge space in the middle of the room for the clamor to bounce around in. The 
dense songs, which frequently bled into one another, stopped for quieter 
moments, then erupted again in messy discordance. 
</P>
<P>
 While it wasn't the most incredible show to watch, at least it was stripped 
down and honest. LORRAINE ALI

 Hitting a note high enough to shatter your wallet: Michael Modes of Hollywood 
notes that ads for the coming Carreras-Domingo-Pavarotti concert at Dodger 
Stadium refer to the event as "Three Tenors." But, he adds, inasmuch as the 
cheapest ticket for the July 16 hootenanny costs a mere $310, "it should be 
called 'Three C-Notes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you'll be able to buy nachos by the chip: We haven't heard how much 
other items will cost for the Three C-Notes. But we do know that a $310 general 
admission price is about 50 times as high as a comparable seat for a Dodger 
game. A similar increase for the concessions would yield these prices that 
night at Dodger Stadium: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dodger Dog: $125 each. 
</P>
<P>
 * Peanuts (double-bagger): $62.50. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beer (16 oz.): $175. 
</P>
<P>
 * Popcorn (32 oz.): $100. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crackerjacks: $62.50. 
</P>
<P>
 * Malt: $87.50. 
</P>
<P>
 * Soft drinks: $75 (16 oz.), $87.50 (20 oz.), $200 (32 oz.). 
</P>
<P>
 * Nachos: $125 (regular), $187.50 (super).  
</P>
<P>
 * Pretzel: (soft), $75. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parking: $200 (per car), $550 (per bus). 
</P>

 Maybe we have it all wrong though. Maybe the advertised ticket prices of $310, 
$512 and $1,012 are really in lira.

 Taps: After the U.S. team's 1-0 defeat by Romania on Sunday, local partisans 
were naturally downcast. There was no sign of the motorist in a shiny blue 
hatchback who had cruised up and down Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena after the 
Americans' previous win over Colombia. He had attracted some attention because, 
while driving, he would lean out his window every now and then to play "The 
Star-Spangled Banner" -- on his trumpet.

 The Chinese, of course, long ago mastered the art of barbarian management. "Do 
not entertain their requests," Qing Emperor Xianfeng instructed his officials 
in the last century. "If you take special pains to control them rigidly and 
check them courteously, how far will these barbarians' cunning get them?" 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to Emperor Xianfeng's question -- to judge from the recent state of 
Chinese-American relations -- seems to be "Not far."

HOW BEST TO REMEMBER STONEWALL; PASS A BILL IN CONGRESS TO CURB WORKPLACE 
DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today marks the 25th anniversary of one of the most extraordinary events in 
American civil rights history. Early on the morning of June 28, 1969, an 
unlikely collection of drag queens and street hustlers brought the simmering 
gay rights movement to a boil by fighting back when the New York Police 
Department raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village. 
</P>
<P>
 What a difference 25 years makes. No longer an invisible, cowering minority, 
tens of thousands of homosexuals paraded proudly in New York Sunday to mark the 
Stonewall riot. The very police department that once entrapped homosexuals 
there now actively recruits gay officers. The nation's media scarcely covered 
the 1969 events and, later, largely ignored AIDS, even after thousands had died 
-- but one New York newspaper last week ran a 5,680-word guide for visitors on 
"Things to Do With a Gay Flavor" and editorialized Sunday that "A just society 
must offer the same protections to men in leather and chains as to those who 
wear Brooks Brothers suits." 
</P>
<P>
 All across the country, gay men and lesbians today enjoy a measure of freedom 
and dignity that seemed unthinkable until recently. Yet they still lack many 
basic rights. Twenty-one states still have sodomy laws. Homosexuals still 
cannot serve in the military without keeping their personal lives secret. Just 
recently, a federal judge in Washington state ordered the National Guard to 
reinstate a highly decorated nurse who was expelled because she is a lesbian. 
It is ironic, and infuriating, that the Clinton Justice Department has 
announced it will appeal that order. But this is the same wobbly Administration 
that campaigned on a promise to end the military ban on gays and then adopted 
the hollow "don't-ask, don't-tell" compromise with homophobes in Congress and 
the military. 
</P>
<P>
 A hateful backlash from the political right has emerged in several states. And 
it is telling that even now some politicians still find it acceptable to bash 
gays, as Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) did in a tawdry, ill-informed 
attack the other day in Congress on the budget of the National Endowment for 
the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 And gays themselves are divided. There were actually two marches in New York, 
the official one focused on gaining human rights for homosexuals worldwide and 
an unofficial one trying to steer attention to finding an AIDS cure. And many 
conservative gays are loath to be linked to the more flamboyant ones like those 
who fought back 25 years ago in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But nearly everyone, save the most extreme bigots, can agree that no one 
should be denied employment or promotions because of sexual orientation. Most 
enlightened employers already realize that and value their gay employees. Now a 
bill introduced in Congress, co-sponsored by 30 senators and nearly 100 
representatives, would prohibit most workplace discrimination based on sexual 
orientation. Its passage would be a fitting tribute to the Stonewall legacy.

SCORE ANOTHER ONE FOR THE 'RED TEAM'; PUBLIC/PRIVATE EFFORT, AFTER CONVINCING 
LEGO OF CALIFORNIA'S APPEAL, WINS OVER TACO BELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the end, perhaps the key factor in Taco Bell Corp.'s welcome decision to 
keep its headquarters in California was a super-sweet deal on rent from its 
landlord. But the Legislature's smart moves to make the state friendlier to 
business did play a part, and demonstrated a lovely change in the climate in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The fast-food giant announced Friday that it had decided to stay in Irvine 
rather than move to a Dallas suburb and pocket $10 million in tax breaks there. 
Texas tales of a state with less regulation, cheaper land and no personal 
income tax were alluring, but ultimately unpersuasive. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell's chief executive, John E. Martin, said the high cost of moving and 
the cheap rent in the new lease were more important inducements than 
California's recent reform of workers' compensation and other attempts to keep 
companies from relocating out of state. But he did praise those steps and urged 
lawmakers to provide tax incentives for companies interested in moving to 
California or expanding in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a good idea, and legislation to do that is up for reconsideration next 
month. True, the state is in a fiscal bind; but a compelling argument is that 
new companies and firms that stay generate enough in taxes and revenues to make 
up for the tax dollars spent to appeal to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Taco Bell's decision, the Danish toy maker Lego cited Sacramento's 
actions as one reason it picked the San Diego County community of Carlsbad over 
a Virginia site for a proposed $100-million theme park. Both Lego and Taco Bell 
were wooed by "red teams," ad hoc groups of public and private officials 
dispatched to retain companies already in California and bring in new ones. 
Such full-court presses proved a welcome departure from the indifferent 
attitude of past decades, when too many seemed to believe that year-round 
sunshine, nearby beaches and the magic of the Golden State were all the 
attractions that were needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The state does have genuine delights, as was evident in the glee of Taco 
Bell's 1,000 workers at learning they would be staying. But sun and sand are 
not enough automatically to tilt the scales California's way. That lesson 
appears to have been learned the hard way by state and local government 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 One "red team" member noted that the first phase of Taco Bell's new lease 
expires in 2000 and promised to keep paying attention to the company. That's 
smart. Government cannot provide everything a company wants, of course, but it 
says a lot when it shows businesses they are welcome.

A MAN OF INTEGRITY STAYS FOR THE ELECTION; MEXICO'S SALINAS WAS RIGHT NOT TO 
LET CARPIZO QUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given the traumas Mexico has faced this election year, the minor political 
melodrama that played itself out last weekend in Mexico City might seem 
insignificant. It wasn't. It was a defining moment leading up to Mexico's most 
historic election day since 1910, when a controversial presidential vote set 
off a major revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend crisis began when the popular government minister who will oversee 
Mexico's elections, Jorge Carpizo MacGregor, threatened to resign. In a letter 
to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Interior Minister Carpizo said a 
political party -- which he did not identify -- was making his job so difficult 
it was hard for him to deal with that party in the impartial manner his 
position called for. Salinas refused to accept Carpizo's offer to resign. The 
two men met and on Sunday it was announced that Carpizo would remain. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision was met by acclaim from all the major political parties: 
Salinas' powerful Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the leftist 
Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) and the conservative National Action Party 
(PAN). For all the political differences among them, and for all the personal 
enmity among some of their leaders, Mexico's political factions agree that 
Carpizo is someone they can trust to run a clean election. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers believe that Carpizo's threat to resign was a brilliant 
maneuver to jar political leaders into a sense of reality and responsibility. 
The rhetoric and conduct of the campaign had become increasingly corrosive as 
the Aug. 21 election grew closer. Carpizo, 50, an attorney, was a respected 
human rights advocate when Salinas named him to be his government's first human 
rights ombudsman. He later was attorney general and then became head of the 
Interior Ministry after his predecessor there failed to anticipate the peasant 
revolt that broke out in the southern state of Chiapas Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 There was powerful symbolism in Carpizo's appointment to the Interior 
Ministry. Besides other things, that ministry oversees Mexico's 
often-criticized election system. Among many electoral improvements, from 
campaign spending limits to a new high-tech voting system, Carpizo's 
appointment was the single most visible sign that Salinas really wants 
political, as well as economic, reform. Salinas put a man with a reputation for 
outspoken integrity in charge of the voting. And having an honest election is 
the single most important challenge facing Mexico, notwithstanding the 
unresolved Chiapas rebellion and the controversial probe into the assassination 
of PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two challenges -- and many more -- will be waiting for Mexico's next 
president. But the effectiveness with which the new president can deal with all 
of Mexico's problems will be determined by how openly and honestly he is 
selected. Salinas knows that as well as anyone. For despite all his remarkable 
reforms, Salinas' tenure has been dogged by suspicions that his narrow 
electoral victory as PRI candidate in 1988 was tainted by voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus it is utterly vital -- whoever wins the August vote, be it PRI 
standard-bearer Ernesto Zedillo, the PRD's Cuauhtemoc Cardenas or the PAN's 
Diego Fernandez de Cevallos -- that the victory be clean. Only a president who 
is honestly elected can govern with popular support and international respect. 
Carpizo is the man who will have a great deal to say about whether Mexico's 
next president gets either.

CONGRESS' HEALTH PLAN DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As co-sponsors of the McDermott American Health Security Act, we were very 
disappointed in "Senate Backs Health Bill in Boost to Clinton" (June 19). Your 
writer dismisses passage by the House labor-management subcommittee of 
single-payer health reform legislation as having "little meaning" and having 
"no chance of passing." Together with over 85 of our House colleagues, we 
frankly couldn't disagree more. First of all, the single-payer bill is the only 
health reform bill to be scored by the Congressional Budget Office as being 
deficit neutral, reducing administrative costs by $100 billion and reducing the 
total national health spending by $175 billion by the year 2003. Single-payer 
puts the business of making medical decisions back into the hands of doctors 
and out of the hands of insurance paper pushers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the minds of many Americans, the single-payer approach is the best way to 
achieve true health reform. In drafting the White House proposal, President 
Clinton recognized the value of single-payer by allowing states like California 
the flexibility to create a single-payer system. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, your writer is right about one thing: 90 members of the House 
are not enough to enact single-payer legislation into law. But to characterize 
the subcommittee's action as meaningless is shortsighted: To date, no health 
reform plan has enough support for passage on the floor of the House. As health 
care reform traverses the maze of multi-committee referral, the action of the 
subcommittee reaffirms the commitment to single-payer in the House and fires a 
warning shot across the bow of those who would seek to remove the state 
single-payer option from whatever form of legislation reaches the House floor.

 I have not seen discussion of what I believe to be the crucial issue. There 
are many countries in the world that have national health-care plans and some 
of those plans are more successful than others. Every one of the countries that 
has a successful plan, without exception, has a small, slow-growing population. 
Meanwhile, in the U.S., which has a large population and the fastest growing 
population of any developed country, sentiment for a health care plan increases 
when people think about the need for one and decreases when the huge amount 
that any of the health care alternatives would cost in this country is 
examined.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the consequences of overpopulation and of excessive population growth 
are obvious; traffic congestion for example. Others are not obvious. Health 
care must be added to the latter list. When I say no health plan should be 
established now, it is not because I don't think we need one. Rather, it is 
because our population must be brought under control for there to be any 
prospect of success for a health care plan in this country.

 Jim Borgman's June 17 cartoon is priceless ("Congress hands down its 
prescription for health care reform," Commentary). It does not matter where the 
blame should be spread; when there was no health care reform bill ready for 
debate by mid-February, 13 months into the problem, everybody involved should 
have started over. That means the White House, Congress, the medical community, 
the business community, et al. Can any person in this nation believe that at 
this late date something comprehensible can be cobbled together before Congress 
adjourns?

 1) Do you want the government to pay for all of your health care costs? 
(Ninety percent will answer "yes.") 
</P>
<P>
 2) Do you want to pay for everyone else's health care? (Ninety percent will 
answer "no.")

 Regarding "The Old Man and the Boy: a Father-Son Bond Grows," June 19: What 
heartwarming story! In a wonderful contrast to the daily grind and tragedy that

time, his example in adopting and raising Roy Chung should make us all ashamed 
for not doing more, not only in terms of money, but in terms of 
compassion.Here's to seeing more coverage of this type of "real" news.

 It's almost irrelevant that Graves is black and Chung is Korean, but all the

 Now that the North Koreans have produced a nuclear threat, it is up to 
President Clinton to deal with something that should have been addressed long

PERSPECTIVES ON THE SIMPSON CASE; TRY IT IN COURT, NOT IN THE PRESS; 
PREJUDICIAL MATERIAL LIKE THE 911 TAPES AND CITATION OF ANONYMOUS SOURCES 
COMPROMISES THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY TARLOW, Barry Tarlow, a Los Angeles criminal-defense lawyer, was a 
prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an extraordinary ruling, the supervising judge of the criminal courts 
dismissed the grand jury in thJ. Simpson case because of prejudicial publicity. 
In spite of Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti's self-serving 
disclaimers, he must recognize his responsibility for the events leading to 
this fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti had launched what The Times described as a "media blitzkrieg." In an 
effort to reverse his office's string of losses in a series of high-profile 
cases, he committed himself to first trying this homicide case in the court of 
public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a lifetime of hard work, O. J. Simpson earned the affection and 
admiration of most of the public. This will make it difficult to persuade a 
jury that he committed two murders. Sadly, the prosecution decided that to win 
this case, it had to manipulate opinion through public-relations gimmicks, 
anonymous leaks and character assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it may surprise some, there are ethical rules controlling public 
statements of lawyers, including prosecutors. The American Bar Assn. Model Code 
of Ethics and case law define what is prohibited. A prosecutor should not make 
any statement that "will have a substantial likelihood of prejudicing a 
criminal proceeding." These ethics rules also specifically forbid a prosecutor 
to speak out of court about the accused's character, reputation or prior 
criminal acts; to tell results of tests, or to give an opinion as to guilt or 
innocence, the evidence or the merits of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court has emphasized that such limits on a lawyer's speech are 
necessary to ensure the fair administration of justice. Putting aside questions 
of legal ethics, fundamental principles of fairness and our Constitution 
prevent a prosecutor from interfering with the right of the accused to a fair 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti's media drive to manipulate public opinion in the Simpson case is 
unseemly at best. The excuse that the prosecution is simply answering defense 
comments is not persuasive. First, it is not accurate, and second, it is the 
same "retaliation argument" that a federal judge rejected in January when Bruce 
Cutler, lawyer for New York mob figure John Gotti, was held in criminal 
contempt for public statements he made in that case. 
</P>
<P>
 If we can step back from the sound and fury of the Simpson case and examine 
the conduct of the prosecution team, which includes the police, what we see is 
indeed disturbing. The truth, the presumption of innocence, and O. J. Simpson's 
right to a fair trial by an impartial jury may be among the eventual 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 We have seen an extraordinary amount of widely reported information from 
"anonymous law-enforcement sources." Repeatedly we heard about devastating 
evidence, a bloody ski mask, found in Simpson's house. In court, the 
prosecution was finally forced to admit that "there is no ski mask." These same 
anonymous sources reported that Simpson had his hand inside a bag during the 
entire flight to Chicago. The implication was that it had been severely cut 
during a knife attack on his wife. Now a number of passengers have come forward 
to testify that this bag incident never occurred. The anonymous sources also 
reported that Jill Shively, a grand jury witness, observed Simpson fleeing the 
crime scene in his white Bronco immediately after the killings. Now we hear 
that her testimony is so unworthy of belief that the prosecution will not be 
calling her as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson, Ronald Goldman and O. J. Simpson's right to a fair trial by an 
impartial jury are not the only victims of this sordid affair. The prosecutors 
showed no hesitancy in trashing the fine reputation of Judge Ronald Schoenberg, 
who sentenced Simpson in the 1989 spousal-battery case. Garcetti, in his recent 
media offensive, castigated Schoenberg for refusing to sentence Simpson to 
jail, calling his sentence "a joke." The lawyer who heads the city attorney's 
domestic violence unit announced to the world that they had demanded a 30-day 
jail sentence for Simpson. Prosecutors claimed that despite their vigorous 
objections, Schoenberg, allegedly star-struck, sentenced Simpson to no time in 
jail. Commentators and reporters pilloried the judge. Finally the truth came to 
light: The transcript of the plea and sentencing shows that the prosecution did 
not ask for a 30-day sentence, and specifically agreed that Simpson should 
receive no time in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 As the campaign to trash O. J. Simpson ground on, we were treated to the 
release of the 1989 police battery report and tapes of the 911 calls. 
Transcripts of the calls were conveniently prepared by the police -- who are 
legally agents of the prosecution team -- to assist the media in dissemination 
of this prejudicial information. While ducking for cover by claiming he had no 
advance knowledge, Garcetti finally admitted that David Conn, one of the case 
prosecutors, knew that the material would be released. The police say they 
asked the D.A.'s office to give them a good reason not to release the 911 
tapes, but that "prosecutors supported their release." 
</P>
<P>
 Police and prosecution claim that they believed the tapes would not be 
admissible at a trial. The prosecution certainly knew that these tapes would 
receive extraordinary publicity and that potential jurors would be exposed to 
prejudicial evidence. This charade might help convict Simpson, but it is 
ethically and legally wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 If Simpson committed these crimes, he should be held fully accountable. 
However, these events illustrate a concerted, win-at-any-cost approach by the 
prosecution and law enforcement that prejudices Simpson's right to a fair trial 
by an impartial jury.  
</P>
<P>
 If what we have seen in the past weeks is a preview of how the district 
attorney plans to end his office's losing streak in high-profile cases, it is 
indeed troubling. It appears that the prosecution has misplaced its moral 
compass. If Garcetti wants to ensure that justice is done, he should stop 
trying this case in the press, shut down the "anonymous law-enforcement 
sources" and step into the courtroom to try the O. J. Simpson case himself.

INSECURE WORKERS ARE FODDER FOR FASCISTS; CHANGE: TURBOCHARGED CAPITALISM HAS

 When the sons and daughters of steelworkers or coal miners must become 
software-writers, teachers, lawyers or, for that matter, retail salespeople, 
few of them have reason to complain. But when the same mechanisms of change 
work so fast that steelworkers or coal miners must themselves abandon their 
lifetime work and habits to learn demanding new skills on penalty of chronic 
unemployment, then failure and frustration are the likely results. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, nothing could be more old-fashioned than to worry about the 
travails of steelworkers and coal miners, supposedly obsolete leftovers of the 
industrial working class. So the big news is the dislocation of white-collar 
employment as well. No statistics measure the decline in the security of 
employment in the United States, where the electronification of office work is 
most advanced. But hourly pay statistics do show very clearly the impact of a 
weak demand for white-collar labor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, when U.S. trade union officials were bitterly complaining 
that American workers were being ejected from well-paid industrial employment 
into minimum-wage jobs, the defenders of free-market economics silenced them in 
Wall Street Journal editorials that pointed to the rapid increase in 
"money-sector" jobs in banking, insurance, financial services and real-estate 
offices. That is where the debate ended -- as it turns out, prematurely. By the 
end of 1992, more than 6.8 million Americans were duly employed in the 
financial sector (banking, insurance, finance and real estate), but the average 
wage of the 4.9 million non-supervisory employees among them was $10.14 per 
hour, as compared with $10.98 for production workers in manufacturing. 
Moreover, financial-sector jobs have been notoriously volatile and benefit 
packages can be more stingy than in industrial jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even bigger news is the dislocation of managerial lives. That is the latest 
trend in the United States -- and it is most definitely structural rather than 
cyclical. Now that the dull, safe, old-style corporation (moderate dividends, 
moderate salaries, steady, slow growth) is almost extinct, top managers as a 
class earn very much more than before, rank-and-file managers who can keep 
their jobs earn rather less and it is difficult for those managers who are 
forced out to find any comparable jobs elsewhere. Statistics quantify the 
downward slide of the entire population from which the class of middle managers 
is drawn. The median earnings of all males in the 45-54 age bracket with four 
years of higher education -- some 2 million Americans -- actually peaked in 
1972 at about $55,000 calculated in 1992 dollars. Earnings were stagnant until 
1989, then dived to $41,898 by 1982, falling even more dramatically than 
average earnings of all non-farm workers (see chart). Needless to say, 
individual working lives cannot be dislocated without damaging families, 
elective affiliations and communities -- the entire moss of human relations 
that only can grow over the stones of economic stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it is entirely certain that what has already happened in the United 
States is happening or will happen in every other advanced economy worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In this situation, what do mainstream U.S. Republicans, British Tories and 
their counterparts elsewhere have to offer? Only more free trade and 
globalization, more deregulation and structural change, thus more dislocation 
of lives and social relations. It is only mildly amusing that nowadays the 
standard conservative speech is a two-part affair, in which Part I celebrates 
the virtues of unimpeded competition and dynamic structural change, while Part 
II mourns the decline of the family "values," eroded precisely by the forces 
commended in Part I. 
</P>
<P>
 And what does the left have to offer? Only more redistribution, more public 
assistance and concern for particular groups that can claim victim status, from 
the sublime peak of elderly, handicapped, lesbians of color down to the merely 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus neither the moderate right nor the moderate left even recognizes the 
central problem of our days: the completely unprecedented personal economic 
insecurity of working people, from industrial workers and white-collar clerks 
to medium-high managers. None of them are poor and they therefore cannot 
benefit from the more generous welfare payments that the left is inclined to 
offer. Few are actually unemployed and they are therefore unmoved by promises 
of more growth and more jobs through the magic of the unfettered market: What 
they want is security in the jobs they already have, precisely what unfettered 
markets most threaten.  
</P>
<P>
 And that is the space that remains wide open for a modern fascist party, 
dedicated to the enhancement of the personal economic security of the masses of 
(mainly white-collar) working people. Such a party could be as free of 
anti-Semitism or racism as Mussolini's original was, until the alliance with 
Hitler, because its real stock in trade would be to impose restraints on 
corporate Darwinism, tame trade unions and resist globalization. To many 
Americans this would not sound bad, but remember that the cost would be the 
loss of democratic restraints against the things that fascism became under 
Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 After the appearance of Ross Perot and Vladimir Zhirinovsky on the global 
scene, it is not necessary to be a prophet to recognize the fascist trends 
caused by today's turbocharged capitalism. What is still needed is an 
undemagogic democratic answer, and not the elite consensus that all is well -- 
as indeed it is, for the elite. The Decline of Real Wages Average hourly

PERSPECTIVES ON THE SIMPSON CASE; EVEN IN THE MOST SENSATIONAL L.A. CASES, 
JURORS HAVE SHOWN THEY CAN DECIDE ON EVIDENCE ADMITTED IN COURT.; PRETRIAL 
PUBLICITY ISN'T A HINDRANCE

 The dismissal of the grand jury that was considering an indictment of O.J. 
Simpson has fueled concern as to whether he can receive a fair trial. Countless 
commentators have wondered whether it will be possible to find jurors who have 
not heard of the crime and the media's stories about the rumored evidence 
against Simpson. But this worry fundamentally misconceives what is required for 
a fair trial before an impartial jury. The Constitution does not dictate that 
prospective jurors be unfamiliar with O.J. Simpson, the murders or even the 
purported evidence. Rather, what is required is careful selection to find 12 
individuals who can be trusted to decide solely based on the evidence presented 
in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Los Angeles has had far more than its share of highly 
publicized trials. In each instance, there were widely expressed concerns as to 
whether the defendant could receive a fair trial and avoid a jury that would 
convict based on the pretrial publicity. Among the cases that drew these 
speculations were the McMartin Preschool trials, the two trials of the police 
officers accused of beating Rodney King and the prosecution of Damian Williams 
and Henry Watson for beating Reginald Denny and others. In each instance, the 
press was saturated with stories and rumored evidence, and in the beating 
cases, videotapes of the crimes. Yet the McMartin case resulted in acquittals. 
The first trial of the police officers for beating King ended in an acquittal 
of all four officers and the second trial resulted in two being acquitted. 
Damian Williams and Henry Watson were acquitted of the most serious charges 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
 These experiences, and a long history of juries trying highly publicized 
cases, show that it is possible to find individuals who will decide cases based 
on the evidence presented in court. Studies confirm what trial lawyers know: 
Juries tend to be very conscientious, take their responsibilities very 
seriously and work hard to follow the judge's instructions. As a jury sits in 
court and hears the days and weeks of evidence, the trial proceedings, and not 
the pretrial media stories, dominate its thoughts and perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the criticism of the media for reporting leaked evidence and thereby 
preventing O.J. Simpson from getting a fair trial is misguided. In fact, the 
media's coverage is not only an exercise of its First Amendment freedoms; it 
also can be beneficial. If there had been no leaks of any evidence against 
Simpson, there would be loud cries that he was being persecuted and perhaps 
charges of racism. Even with the rumored evidence linking him to a horrible 
crime, there is substantial sympathy expressed for him. The city is well-served 
by knowing that O.J. Simpson is now in jail because there is evidence against 
him that justified his arrest and his being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are the lawyers on either side to be criticized for using the media to 
present their views. The defense certainly has the right to publicly question 
the strength of the prosecution's case and to try and build sympathy for 
Simpson. But so does the prosecution have the right to remind the public that 
two people were brutally murdered and that there is evidence linking Simpson to 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 At the preliminary hearing that is scheduled to begin on Thursday, everyone 
will learn the evidence that the police and the prosecutors have amassed 
against Simpson. Even if there had not yet been a single leak of evidence, the 
preliminary hearing ensures that everyone will know prior to trial the essence 
of the case against Simpson. All of the rumors and leaks will be irrelevant as 
a judge decides whether there is sufficient evidence to try Simpson for the 
murders. If there is a trial, there is every reason to believe that it will be 
possible to find 12 individuals who will decide based on the facts presented in 
court. That is the fair trial that the Constitution guarantees Simpson and all 
criminal defendants.

REGIONAL OUTLOOK; GERMANY LOOKS EAST FOR LABOR; LOW WAGES IN HUNGARY, POLAND

 On a Monday morning, Lutz Kahlbau leaves his family in Berlin to drive four 
hours east past the old Iron Curtain and on to the former state-run factory 
that he manages for its new owners, the German company Siemens. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahlbau oversees 700 Czech employees turning out electromechanical relays, 
switches and circuit boards for Siemens' European market at about one-twentieth 
the cost of producing these components in Berlin, where Kahlbau often returns 
for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in a happy situation. Because of the growth of our market shares, we 
don't have to kill jobs in Germany," Kahlbau said. "But of course, 
labor-intensive work has a better chance in countries with low labor costs. 
None of our competition is starting new products on the Champs-Elysees. They 
are starting in Thailand and Shanghai." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, like Siemens and thousands of other small and large German firms, are 
investing in post-Communist Eastern Europe, primarily Hungary, Poland and the 
Czech Republic, and provoking an edginess back home familiar to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Korea at Our Front Door," cries a headline in Germany's Stern magazine. "More 
and More Businessmen Migrate," reads another in the daily Frankfurter 
Rundschau. "Our Mexico," business people call neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly one in three German companies intends to transfer part of its 
production outside the country in the next three years, according to a recent 
poll by the Assn. of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce. In the survey of 
more than 10,000 companies in western Germany, the favorite destination was 
Eastern Europe, where Deutsche Bank estimates that 5 million jobs -- equivalent 
to more than 15% of the German work force -- could move in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Like American firms that argued in favor of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement linking the United States with Canada and Mexico, German companies 
cite high domestic labor costs as the main reason for their plans to move 
production across the border. Manufacturers say they must cut costs to remain 
competitive or lose even more German jobs; Eastern Europe is their opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far there is no giant sucking sound of German capital whooshing across 
the border, as might have been expected. 
</P>
<P>
 German investment in Eastern Europe has been tempered by a recession at home 
and the need to develop the former East Germany, where western German firms 
invest about $40 billion a year. And direct investment by German companies 
still totals less than $3 billion and is second to the Americans'. In 1993, for 
instance, Germany invested about $1.10 billion in the East, compared to U.S 
investment of about $1.12 billion, according to Deutsche Bank and the U.S. 
Department of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The German investment is significant, however, given that there was almost 
nothing before 1989, and the upward trend clearly will continue. Germans were 
first off the mark to invest in the former East Bloc after the fall of 
communism in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Production at the Trutnov plant, one of about a dozen that Siemens has in 
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, has grown 15% annually since the 
plant opened under Siemens in 1992. But the company still employs more than 
three times as many people in Berlin as in Trutnov to make electromechanical 
components. 
</P>
<P>
 This may explain why, despite the headlines, German unions do not see as much 
of a threat from cheap foreign labor as did American unions that fought tooth 
and nail against NAFTA. Rather, union leaders agree with manufacturers that it 
is in Germany's interest to strengthen the economies of its eastern neighbors. 
They say estimates of lost jobs do not take into account those created by East 
European countries purchasing German machinery and consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Hans-Georg Wehner of the German Union Federation contends that Deutsche Bank's 
prediction of job losses is part of a scare campaign to push down the high 
wages and benefits that western German workers enjoy -- in some industries, the 
highest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jobs are lost here and there, but you have to see that the volume of 
investment taking place over there is not that big. Overall, it doesn't shake 
us," Wehner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the relatively modest investment has had the positive effect of 
quieting fears in the East and West that Germany would thoroughly dominate 
Eastern Europe. Germany was the logical economic partner for its neighbors in 
the East. Many Poles, Hungarians and Czechs already spoke German. They provided 
cheap labor and potential markets right on Germany's border. And Germans had 
experience there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Germans know the market -- (auto maker Ferdinand) Porsche started his career 
here," said Jan A. Havelka, general manager of the semiautonomous CzechInvest, 
which is charged with attracting foreign investment to the Czech Republic. "At 
the beginning there was reasonable concern about such a powerful economy 
showing such enthusiasm. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "But Germans are not dominating the situation in a way that could be 
politically sensitive," he added. "They are looking east. They know the 
emerging markets from the post-Communist countries could be the big chance of 
the 21st Century. But they have certain disadvantages, like World War II." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Eastern Europeans continue to fear domination by Germans, who occupied 
their countries during the Third Reich. For that reason, German investors in 
the Czech Republic say it suits them just fine that Germans and Americans are 
on an equal footing in that nation, each with about 30% of foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other Eastern Europeans, Czechs generally view German capital guardedly. 
They need it but are wary of becoming too dependent on it -- and on the 
Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road from Siemens' Trutnov plant, about 90 miles northeast of Prague, 
is the Ekvita textile machine manufacturer, a Czech-German joint venture in 
which the German firm Georg Sahm has about 25% of the shares. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we privatized the firm (in September, 1992), I was standing in the yard 
with empty hands," said Jaromir Jelecek, one of the Czech owners. "The bottom 
fell out of the industry, and we had to find a way out of the situation. We 
decided to find a partner. We would have preferred it to be Czech capital, but 
we have to accept it's German. Who came here first when this was empty?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jelecek said Czech owners and managers get along with their German business 
associates well, although "occasionally we find they insist on their way of 
solving a problem even though the Czech way would be better." 
</P>
<P>
 His was a diplomatic assessment of what other Czech business people consider 
to be out-and-out German arrogance. At the nearby Grund-Textil factory, owner 
Grazyne Grundova explained that she and her husband opted to tough out hard 
times rather than take German investors into their bathroom-rug company. 
</P>
<P>
 They rejected offers from large German manufacturers to buy them out or form a 
joint venture with their company, which now boasts 40 employees in the Czech 
Republic and another plant in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to be a 100% Czech firm. We don't need them or their money," 
Grundova said. "To drag in the Germans so they will order you about, no, no, 
no." 
</P>
<P>
 In Prague, the Timo producer of ladies' lingerie chose a middle ground. About 
10% of its production is piecework for the German Felina line, but the Czech 
company turned down a contract from a second large German firm in favor of an 
Italian one. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way we have help with know-how and fashion," said Vladimir Mracek, one 
of the owners. "The problem with the Italians is that for them time is not 
money. There's no organization, no payment. During the summer, no one works. 
But their fashion is really very nice. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the Germans, the business side is very strong. Pure contract. What they 
promised is done. But there are no new ideas there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, thousands of small, medium-sized and large German firms have 
found partners and investment opportunities in the East. The lion's share of 
German investment has gone to Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, where in 
each case at least half the economy is now in private hands. Deutsche Bank 
predicts growth in all three countries this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Czech Republic is considered one of the most stable and hospitable 
environments for foreign investors in Eastern Europe. With a highly educated 
work force and long experience in a broad range of finished industrial 
products, the country has been able to move quickly into export markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign companies are drawn primarily by the low cost of labor -- an average 
of about $250 a month for a full-time industrial worker, compared with $1,562 
in eastern Germany and $2,500 in western Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, Juergen Moellering, of the German-Czech Chamber of Industry and 
Commerce, warns potential investors that labor is only a part of the cost of 
production. Czechs work more hours and take fewer vacations than Germans, but 
their productivity is lower, Moellering says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bureaucracy abounds. An investor starting a business from scratch in the Czech 
Republic may need up to 17 permits, Moellering said, and faces infrastructure 
problems and a shortage of Western-style management. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know of two companies that left because they didn't get a telephone," 
Moellering said. 
</P>
<P>
 But companies like Siemens with long overseas experience view all of this as 
natural. They see the Czech Republic at the center of a vast new market in 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a growing phase" in East European industries, said Trutnov plant 
manager Lutz Kahlbau. "If you want to grow with them, you can do it." Cutting

CULTURE; AFTER LE BRAINSTORMING , FRENCH START WAR ON WORDS; FED UP WITH 
'FRANGLAIS,' PARIS IS IMPOSING PENALTIES FOR NOT USING NATIVE TERMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By day, Prof. Daniel Oster heads a learned team laboring to update the 
official French dictionary, painstakingly building a final barricade against, 
among other things, the march of English words and "Franglais" into French. 
</P>
<P>
 But by night, as Oster digs into the latest edition of the newspaper Le Monde 
in his Paris apartment, his 15-year-old daughter frequently exhorts him to " 
soit cool, Papa. " Be cool, Dad. 
</P>
<P>
 So what does the professional arbiter and gatekeeper of French do? "I don't 
punish her," Oster said, shrugging his shoulders. "She's just saying it because 
the other kids say it. One has to be free to express oneself." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, "this Franglais, this mixture of English and French, is a 
completely artificial language. It's made by disc jockeys, journalists and all 
sorts of media. When I hear someone speaking that way, I know they're just 
being manipulated." 
</P>
<P>
 The French government, for its part, is coolly taking major steps to rid the 
country of some of these dreaded foreign words. The clear, though unnamed, 
target is English, especially that language the French call Americain. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in 19 years, the National Assembly earlier this month 
approved a new law to protect the French language. This one is the toughest 
yet. It will make the use of French obligatory in instruction manuals, legal 
contracts, scientific conferences and all advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalties won't be specified until later, but the Culture Ministry has 
said they will probably include fines of up to $100 per infraction and a 
six-month jail term and $8,500 fine for anyone preventing the law from being 
enforced.  
</P>
<P>
 The new law probably won't change the nature of discourse in the Oster 
household or on the street, where jeans-wearing French youngsters spice their 
language with words such as super (pronounced soo-PAIR), where people in le 
marketing practice le brainstorming in hopes of hitting le jackpot , and where 
politicians give le briefing off the record . 
</P>
<P>
 But it could mean a big change in advertising on billboards, posters, TV and 
radio, where American slogans have been warmly embraced, especially by 
companies going after the youth market. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's, purveyor of le fast food , uses the slogan "Say Cheese." Coca-Cola 
uses "There's Always Coke." For Pepsi, it's "Think Different, Think Pepsi." 
Even the new tunnel under the English Channel (or, if you prefer, La Manche) 
will no longer be Le Shuttle. Instead, it will be La Navette. 
</P>
<P>
 And Nike, the top sports and fitness company in France, is asking its lawyers 
whether it will have to change its slogan "Just Do It." 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't make our life easier, that's for sure," said Stephan Wahlen, Nike's 
advertising manager in Paris. "We've made a lot of attempts to translate 'Just 
Do It.' But it doesn't work. If you had a strict translation, it would kill the 
slogan." 
</P>
<P>
 The new law doesn't ban all English from advertisements, but it requires 
advertisers to offer a suitable French translation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure this is the best way to protect the language," added Wahlen, who 
is French. "We have to live with today's reality, and today's reality is more 
global than the French language." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Jacques Toubon, the government's minister of culture and author of 
the law, insists it is "not an attack on English. It is an attempt to preserve 
this language, this irreplaceable capital. If it is not preserved, it will 
die." 
</P>
<P>
 It is also, he added, part of France's long and until recently successful 
effort to assimilate immigrants into one common culture -- to, in effect, make 
them French. 
</P>
<P>
 Let there be no doubt, the French love their language, and an overwhelming 
majority believe strongly that it is worth protecting. About 110 million 
people, 58 million of them in France, speak French as their main language. And 
50 million others are fluent. 
</P>
<P>
 In French schools, students learn to write their mother tongue properly in 
countless dictees , in which they take dictation from their teachers. But the 
learning doesn't stop there. Hundreds of thousands of adults tune in to an 
annual, nationally televised dictee , a kind of prime-time spelling bee for 
grown-ups, to test their spelling, grammar and ear for the language. 
</P>
<P>
 For 20 years, each government ministry has maintained a "terminology 
committee," whose primary purpose is to find French equivalents for English 
words. The work of those committees led to publication this year of a new 
Dictionary of Official Terms, which lists 3,500 "foreign or improper terms to 
avoid." And it helpfully provides French replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 One no-no is le planning , used even by the French offices of Berlitz, the 
language school. Planification is better, says the tome. E-mail should be 
messagerie electronique , a drive-in cinema is a cine-parc , and air bags are 
les sac gonflables . Fast food should be restauration rapide , and 
brainstorming is le remue-meninges . User-friendly? Try convivialite . 
</P>
<P>
 But, as lexicographer Oster observes: "You can invent words. But whether the 
English word will then disappear, you never know." 
</P>
<P>
 Walking along the streets of Paris, though, one might wonder whether the 
battle for French purity already is lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Many French youths, like young people in the United States, find foreign words 
appealing and, well, tres cool . And plenty of others think government attempts 
to protect the language by law are Draconian, at worst, and humorless, at best. 
As the Sunday Times of London put it recently: "Face it, France, you're the 
shrill nag of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 The new language law and Toubon, its author, have become the butt of many 
jokes, especially from radio stations already chafing under another 
Toubon-inspired law that will require them to devote at least 40% of their 
music air time to French songs beginning in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 A French radio commentator, reporting from the Cannes Film Festival last 
month, helpfully translated the name of the president of the festival jury for 
his listeners. That's how Clint Eastwood became Clint "Bois de l'Est." 
</P>
<P>
 And some disc jockeys have begun referring to Toubon as "Monsieur All Good" -- 
his last name roughly translated into English. 
</P>
<P>
 One might expect Le Figaro, a government-supporting newspaper, to be kinder. 
But in a front-page editorial cartoon on the anniversary of D-day, the 
newspaper showed an American soldier trying to woo a young Frenchwoman, circa 
1944. As the soldier vainly attempted a greeting in French, she interrupted 
him: "Don't be afraid. You can say, 'Hello, baby.' Jacques Toubon is still only 
3 years old!" 
</P>
<P>
 In his defense, Toubon says the newspapers don't represent the French silent 
majority, which he believes supports the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever they think of the new law, though, the French long ago turned debates 
over their language into a kind of national sport. 
</P>
<P>
 A 2-year-old group calling itself the Assn. for the Respect of the French 
Language has 500 volunteer observers who monitor television, radio, newspapers 
and magazines for signs of bad French. When they spot an error in usage, the 
observers fill out a form and send it to the association, which in most cases 
forwards a letter to the offender. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, during commemorations marking the D-day anniversary, 
French President Francois Mitterrand was overheard uttering, "OK, let's go," to 
President Clinton. Le Monde, partly tongue in cheek, suggested the phrase was 
"sacrilege to the Francophone cause." 
</P>
<P>
 The final word on the French language is determined by the Academie Francaise, 
a Left Bank institution founded in 1635 with the sole purpose of raising French 
to the status of Latin and Greek.  
</P>
<P>
 The ninth edition of the academy's dictionary, which will replace the 1935 
edition, is now being created by Oster's team. So far, only one volume has been 
published, from "A" to enzyme , and the academy has finished work up to filon 
(a noun borrowed from Italian that means a vein of minerals). Oster said "it's 
not at all impossible" that the dictionary could be completed by the turn of 
the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the dictionary lists many English words that the academy has 
decided have become part of the French language. Among them are best-seller , 
blazer , blue jean and cowboy . 
</P>
<P>
 But just because French people may use an English word doesn't make it 
acceptable, Oster said. His rule of thumb is that an English word can become 
part of the French language only "if it designates something that is not in 
French." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why, he said, " cool is not in the dictionary. It will never be in the 
dictionary. There are at least 20 French words that describe the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, as Oster sees it, is not that young people use words like cool . 
He doesn't even mind the use of English in newspapers and magazines, just as 
long as the word is set apart from good French by quotation marks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Oster and many in the government fear that Franglais is creating confusion 
among young people, who need to be better educated in proper French and English 
usage. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my daughter has to write an essay in French, she knows she can't use the 
word cool ," Oster said. "But what about the kid who doesn't have the 
knowledge? If we don't tell him, he'll never know. And what will happen then?" 
</P>
<P>
 But can a country really legislate the use of a language? 
</P>
<P>
 "We can, and it's our firm intention to do so," Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur said. "The French language is an essential component of our identity 
and also a major factor in the unity of our country." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Balladur added in a recent interview: "One has to have an open mind 
about this. Words like le weekend are part of the French language now. But you 
shouldn't overdo it. When the precise French word exists, there's no point in 
not using it."

 Both foes and fans of Bangladesh's most controversial author plan to take to

<P>
 Muslim extremists have offered a reward for the assassination of feminist 
writer Taslima Nasrin, in hiding since a court ordered her arrest for offending 
Muslims, who make up about 90% of the country's population. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasrin's crime: giving a newspaper interview in which she called for revision 
of the Koran, the Muslim holy book. The 31-year-old author later claimed she 
was misquoted and that she demanded only an update of Islamic law because, in 
her view, it discriminates against women. 
</P>

 Both fundamentalist and secular, left-leaning organizations have called 
strikes for Thursday, respectively to condemn and to support Nasrin.

 Brazilian authorities Friday will introduce their country's sixth currency

PROFILE; MEXICAN POLITICS' ENDANGERED SPECIES; CARLOS HANK GONZALEZ REPRESENTS 
THE LAST OF A GRAND LINE OF TECHNOCRATS. HIS IMPENDING RETIREMENT HAS SPARKED 
SPECULATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carlos Hank Gonzalez, friends and foes agree, is a rare and endangered species 
in Mexican politics. What they disagree on is exactly which species he is. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics call the 66-year-old agriculture minister a dinosaur, a remnant of an 
age when labor bosses and party hacks ruled the country, throwing bones to the 
faithful and punishing the disloyal. 
</P>
<P>
 Admirers say that in an administration of technocrats, Hank stands out as a 
real politician with an easy smile, ready handshake and compelling baritone. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank's announcement last month -- following a skirmish with the new electoral 
law -- that he will retire from politics in December, at the end of this 
administration, has set off a flurry of speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, Hank has headed one of the country's most cohesive and powerful 
political movements, the Atlacomulco Group, based in the industrial state of 
Mexico just outside the capital. His disciples run the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party and the attorney general's office, which is prosecuting the 
alleged assassin of Luis Donaldo Colosio -- the ruling party's presidential 
candidate until he was shot dead in Tijuana on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank is one of the few Mexican politicians who is also a successful 
businessman. Grupo Hermes, which Hank founded and which is now run by his son, 
Carlos, is one of the largest family businesses in Mexico, with interests in 
transport, manufacturing and telecommunications. His other son, Jorge, runs the 
family's racetrack and off-track gambling business in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hank is one of the richest men in the country, with huge political and 
economic power -- which is something that none of the richest businessmen have 
and something that none of the most powerful politicians have," said a 
politician from his home state. The man insisted that his name not be used 
"because I don't want to spend the next administration in exile."  
</P>
<P>
 Hank inspires the same fear-tinged respect in Mexico today that the late 
President Lyndon B. Johnson enjoyed in Washington. Comparisons between the two 
arise inevitably in conversations about Hank: the same lanky frames, beginnings 
as country schoolteachers, famous ranches and a penchant for wheeling and 
dealing that turned them into wealthy and influential men. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike LBJ, Hank dropped the country-boy manner in favor of cashmere 
suits, elegant wit and a kitchen that rivals that of the presidential 
residence. Another difference is that Hank will almost surely never be 
president: A Mexican law, effective until 2000, when he will be 72, bars 
children of immigrants such as him from the Mexican presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many Mexicans believe that the assassination of Colosio could bring 
Hank almost as much power as the assassination of President John F. Kennedy 
brought Johnson. If Colosio's replacement, Ernesto Zedillo, is elected Aug. 21, 
Hank is widely expected to become the power behind the throne. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Zedillo were to win, he would need the connections Hank has to elements in 
the party that otherwise would not be enthusiastic about a Zedillo presidency," 
said Roderic Camp, a political scientist at Tulane University who has studied 
the relationships within the Mexican elite.  
</P>
<P>
 Hank showed that influence a few days after Zedillo, an economist, was named 
to replace the slain Colosio. In full-page ads in national newspapers and 
magazines, Cabinet ministers from the last four administrations pledged their 
support to the new PRI candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank organized the ads, in a move that caused a political scandal. The 
opposition National Action Party filed a complaint accusing him of violating 
the new federal election laws by using federal employees' time and government 
property to coordinate the signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general decided that there was not enough evidence to prosecute 
Hank, who said that he and six others had paid nearly $70,000 for the ads and 
that employees had volunteered their own time to help out. A few days later, 
Hank announced that he would retire from politics at the end of this 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it soon became clear that the retirement was hardly a defeat. Ignacio 
Pichardo, a longtime Hank confidant, became chairman of the PRI a few days 
later. Hank's right-hand man at the Agriculture Ministry became Zedillo's chief 
of staff. When a new attorney general was chosen, another Hank aide, Humberto 
Benitez, filled the slot. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is really in a strong position now," said Raul Monje, a reporter at the 
independent political magazine Proceso, who covered Hank when he was the 
appointed mayor of Mexico City a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank has a reputation for fighting his way back from political defeats that 
rivals that of the late President Richard Nixon. By all accounts, he learned at 
an early age. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born in 1927 in the village of Tianguistenco near the capital. Growing 
up as the son of a German immigrant in highly nationalistic Mexico was not 
easy. The stigma followed him even though his father, Jorge Hank, a teacher at 
the military college, died in a motorcycle accident when Hank was 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank was a PRI loyalist before he could vote, becoming secretary general of 
his state's Youth Federation when he was 17. His political career really 
started a few years later when he was a teacher in Atlacomulco, cradle of 
Mexico state politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 There he caught the eye of Isidro Fabela, former governor and founder of the 
Atlacomulco Group. The group was most notable for its drive to transform the 
rural state into an industrial force and for its virtual stranglehold on the 
governor's mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Hank moved up through the ranks of the state education 
bureaucracy. He was elected mayor of the state capital, Toluca, in 1955 and 
then served a term in the state legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 He showed his acumen for combining politics and business in the 1960s when he 
held positions of increasing responsibility in the government basic commodities 
company, known as CONASUPO. CONASUPO had problems moving grain. Hank founded 
what by all accounts was a highly efficient trucking company and won CONASUPO 
as a customer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to say that under the legal framework he has done something 
wrong," a home-state politician said of Hank's business dealings. "But it is 
always on the line." 
</P>
<P>
 With a more secure personal economic base, in 1969 Hank became governor of 
Mexico state. Without forgetting his old friends from Atlacomulco, he also 
included members of a rival state political group in his government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Professor Hank succeeded in unifying the two most important political groups 
in local politics," said Miguel Basanez, who coordinated a monograph on the 
political power structure in Mexico state. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as remarkable, during an era of conflict between business and government 
on a national level, Hank maintained excellent relations with industrialists in 
his state. He created industrial parks and encouraged manufacturers to locate 
there. During his term, manufacturing's share of state employment rose from 35% 
to 40%. His own businesses prospered also. 
</P>
<P>
 He recruited bright, young administrators, such as Ignacio Pichardo, who had 
just finished a postgraduate degree at the London School of Economics when Hank 
was elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Unsure of himself, he often tried to seek the governor's advice before making 
a decision, Pichardo recalled. The governor was never available. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did that on purpose, to force me to make a decision and take 
responsibility for it," Pichardo said. "He always said, 'If you are going to 
make a mistake, do it quickly, so that we can fix it quickly.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hank is known as an excellent administrator, who knows how to delegate and how 
to spend money -- lots of money. And that reputation followed him to Mexico 
City when he became mayor in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a real spendthrift," said journalist Monje. "The beat reporters loved 
him when he was mayor. He once took the whole city hall press corps to Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 In his six years as mayor of Mexico City, he got the nickname Genghis Hank as 
he ripped up neighborhood parks, destroyed fountains and moved colonial statues 
to create a system of fast-moving boulevards. Hank also handed out building 
permits at a breakneck pace -- without sufficient planning, some critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank's policies, along with the oil boom, created a spurt of growth for the 
city. But the mayor's prodigal ways got him into constant trouble with Miguel 
de la Madrid, the planning and budget minister, who was charged with keeping 
spending under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Hank, De la Madrid became the next president. The 
free-spending former mayor was thrown into political purgatory for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari revived Hank's career, naming him tourism 
minister in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing that helps to sustain Hank is his extensive network of contacts," 
said Camp. "He is attractive as an ally when you yourself don't have extensive 
networks." Camp estimates that Hank had five to 10 times as many supporters as 
Salinas did when he took office. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank still works hard to keep building that support. He knows how to work a 
room, greeting everyone individually with his famous smile. But he has a 
reputation for being just as tough as he is gracious. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you start to accumulate that much power you can't be soft," said the 
home-state politician. "There is so much involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders at the Agriculture Ministry last year accused him of kidnaping 
and torturing union member Eduardo Hernandez to halt his hunger strike over a 
labor dispute. The accusations were never proven. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank's influence in a possible Zedillo presidential administration is expected 
to be pragmatic. He is most likely to advocate policies that will increase his 
power without much emphasis on ideological concerns, say some observers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through his position, he will be able to affect the careers of the people in 
his political group," Camp said. Zedillo could be expected to choose a good 
portion of his aides from among Hank loyalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank's pledge to retire met with skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may not hold any Cabinet post or public office," said the politician, "but 
the only way he will retire is if they lose the election." Biography

DOING BUSINESS; U.S. GROCER BETS HE CAN CHANGE THE WAY RUSSIANS SHOP; BUT TO 
OPEN A SUPERMARKET HE ALSO HAD TO INVEST IN FARMS, TRUCKING. GIANT VLADIVOSTOK, 
THREE YEARS IN THE PLANNING, WILL BE THE FIRST ONE-STOP SHOPPING VENUE OF ITS 
KIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When a retired New York grocer first ventured here with utopian plans for an 
American-style supermarket, it cost him a night in a Soviet police station. 
This Pacific port city, home of the world's largest naval base, was still 
officially off limits to foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, the Soviet Union is long gone, capitalists are remaking 
Russia, Vladivostok is a wide-open city -- and Dick Schindler, a cheerful, 
persistent man of 65, is about to launch his pioneer project. The supermarket, 
called Giant Vladivostok, is scheduled to open Nov. 12, the first of its kind 
in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Promising an array of 1,500 products, 24 checkout registers and parking for 
500 cars, Giant would look familiar in any American suburb. But to Russians, 
who trudge from one corner store to another -- dismal little specialty outlets 
with names such as Vegetables, Bread and Fish, where you stand in one line to 
pay and another to collect your purchase -- the supermarket is bound to 
bewilder. 
</P>
<P>
 Schindler is gambling that people will get over the shock, realize one-stop 
shopping is easier and cheaper and change the way they buy food. If the 
$18-million Russian-American venture pays off, its partners are ready to expand 
to as many as a score of cities across Siberia and European Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be easy. Russian agriculture is backward and depressed. While 
building the store, Schindler and his partners realized they had no reliable 
means to stock it year-round with quality, low-priced, locally grown food. So 
they invested in a network of local farms, packing plants, dairies and trucks 
to set up a farm-to-grocery channel with no intermediaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a country of traders, but they're all trading with each other and 
adding something to the cost, so the poor consumer pays the penalty," Schindler 
said. "We're going to do it simple. We're going to compete on price." 
</P>
<P>
 The formula has caught on with the Clinton Administration, which is groping 
for new ideas to help Russia's troubled transition to the free market. The U.S. 
Agency for International Development, under criticism for spending too much on 
U.S. consultants in this part of the world, has put up $6 million to improve 
Russian food production for the Giant venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas A. Dine, the official who is reorganizing AID's programs in Eastern 
Europe and the former Soviet Union, visited Vladivostok last month and held up 
Giant as a model. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to help Russians produce more and better goods, in Dine's view, 
is to "prime the pump" by putting small doses of U.S. government aid to work 
for big, fully integrated marketing ventures created in Russia with the help of 
American capitalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to make Russia a consumer-driven society, not production-driven," 
Dine said. "If I only had a Schindler with a profit motive for every project. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Giant is still just a futuristic plan -- little but an unfinished 
concrete shell on a muddy plot at the end of a bumpy, winding road. But by 
Russian standards, the venture has advanced quickly since it was officially 
registered 2 1/2 years ago, overcoming many of the obstacles that discourage 
other investors from trying to produce things here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have come in and been (just) another trader, and in the short term 
it would have been great, but what would we have built?" asks Schindler, who is 
organizing the Russian side of the joint venture. "I've got only a few more 
years left, and I want to build something worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
 Schindler was at his desk on a Sunday, having climbed 10 flights of stairs to 
the office. He has worked all his life in the grocery business, starting as a 
bag boy in Buffalo, N.Y., and rising to president of the Gristedes chain in New 
York. Bored by retirement on the Florida coast, he set out to do business in 
Moscow in August, 1991, just months before the Soviet Union ceased to exist. 
</P>
<P>
 His first obstacle was bureaucracy in the Soviet capital, where he paid bribes 
for business licenses and permits and got nowhere. So he flew to Vladivostok at 
the urging of his partners-to-be, managers of the Soviet Pacific fishing fleet 
to which his company had previously sold food for ships' crews. They helped him 
sell the idea of a supermarket to the local Soviet Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalryba, a Russian fishing company, agreed to contribute two seasons worth of 
fishing rights, which will bring Giant $6 million worth of fish. A firm that 
runs warehouses for the fishing fleet has invested $3 million in land and 
supplies, while two other Russian partners, including a bank, are kicking in 
$2.8 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got more accomplished here in nine days than in a month of waiting around 
in Moscow," Schindler recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned briefly to the United States via Moscow. But, having entered 
Vladivostok without an official permit, he was unable to prove to authorities 
where he had been those nine days, so he spent a night in police custody in 
Moscow, until one of his partners bailed him out. 
</P>
<P>
 Solving that problem was easy compared to the hurdles to come. Schindler 
managed to recruit the cream of the Vladivostok Communist Party elite to help 
run the venture but struggled to break their Soviet habits. "They would look at 
a building and say, 'OK, you need 24 forklifts in there,' because that's what 
it says in the book they used for 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
 One-third of Giant's 91,000 square feet of floor space is for retail shopping. 
The rest -- a wholesale warehouse and food production center -- will 
distinguish it from a typical American supermarket. There will be facilities 
for baking bread, popping corn, canning, juicing, carbonating soft drinks, 
broiling chickens, smoking meats, freezing vegetables and packaging ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar but smaller Giant store is under construction in the nearby city of 
Nakhodka, due to open next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladivostok is one of the most expensive cities in Russia because much of the 
food sold to its 700,000 people carries high transport fees from the United 
States, South Korea, Japan and distant parts of Russia. Giant will buy 60% to 
70% of its food from the local farms it is modernizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with the AID grant and American technicians, Giant is introducing 
better seeds, building greenhouses and storehouses and installing dairy 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not building a store but a food system," said Jarlath Hume, vice 
president of TPC Foods Inc., Schindler's Seattle-based American partner, which 
has 30% of the investment. "The Russian supply side has collapsed. The store is 
the engine that will jump-start it." 
</P>
<P>
 As do all entrepreneurs in Russia, Giant's partners face an obstacle course of 
inflation, bureaucracy and taxes. There is nothing they can do about inflation, 
which has raised supermarket construction costs by 2 1/2 times the original 
estimate and delayed the 18-month project by a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Russian government tried this spring to renege on Giant's tax 
exemption for more than $3 million worth of imported American equipment, 
Schindler flew to Moscow to lobby one of Prime Minister Viktor S. 
Chernomyrdin's top aides. The threatened 23% tax was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you roll over and play dead in Russia, you'll never build anything or 
accomplish anything," Schindler said. "If you fight, you'll find a way." 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate test for Giant will be the Russian consumer, who typically has 
ingrained buying habits and little idea of what a supermarket is. 
</P>
<P>
 At least the economics are encouraging. Vladivostok's fishing fleet and port 
are profitable, sustaining a sizable middle class of seamen and dockworkers. 
One of every two families here has a car. And Schindler figures that Giant will 
save shoppers 20% or more on grocery bills -- a real incentive in a country 
where people spend most of their income on food. 
</P>
<P>
 Much depends on getting consumers to buy new products being grown here just 
for the store. Giant is sponsoring cooking shows on local TV to show Russians 
how, for example, to cook green beans.  
</P>
<P>
 Many Russians find it unbelievable that one company can amass so much food 
under one big roof. "I am sure the whole operation will end up selling cheap 
Chinese garb in this huge building," said Vladivostok journalist Natalya 
Barabash. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Russians see the U.S. food system, they think it is wonderful, but for 
them it is like Disneyland, because they cannot imagine it happening in 
Russia," Bruce W. Krysiak, head of TPC Foods, told a U.S. House of 
Representatives subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 But once Giant opens, he predicted, it will become "a visually compelling 
example in Russia of why a market economy will work."

THE PRESS; CARTOONISTS DRAW THE LINE IN RWANDA

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Savage conflict in Rwanda has transfixed the world for more than two months -- 
and stymied the United Nations.Then last week, France finally won Security 
Council approval to send 2,500 troops to try to stem the warfare -- between 
Hutu-dominated government forces and Tutsi-led rebels -- that has killed 
hundreds of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 France's intervention is not without controversy -- or irony. It has been a 
major supporter and arms supplier of Rwanda's government, helping to put down a 
rebel offensive in 1990. But France insisted that its troops will be impartial, 
with the goal of protecting civilians from further harm.

NATIONAL AGENDA; CIVIC PRIDE BLOOMS IN ERITREA; THE EXTRAORDINARY IS

 "Kefela," the American said as he left the U.S. library on Alula Street for 
the last time, "take care of the books." With that the man was gone, joining 
the exodus of Americans expelled by Ethiopia's Marxist government from the 
northern province of Eritrea nearly 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 No one would have dared imagine how seriously Kefela Kokobu would take those 
words. For single-handedly, and at considerable personal risk, Kefela ensured 
that an entire generation of young Eritreans would be raised on Hemingway 
instead of Mao, would have better access to Jefferson than to Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethiopian officials raged at Kokobu upon finding shelves devoted to O'Hara and 
Fitzgerald and a record cabinet featuring music by the Boston Pops and the 
Harvard Glee Club; they sent him the collected works of Communist authors by 
the box load. Kokobu put three or four of the books on display to appease the 
authorities and packed the rest away in storage. 
</P>
<P>
 Traces of the American presence in Eritrea disappeared fast under the Marxist 
regime that overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie: The U.S. Consulate was taken over 
by the Ethiopian navy, and Kagnew Station, a U.S. army communications facility, 
became a base for the murderous Ethiopian army. But Kokobu's beloved American 
Library remained just a library -- indeed, Asmara's only public library -- 
though operated under the auspices of the local municipality, not the U.S. 
Information Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted my people to be educated, and I did not believe Mao and Lenin could 
provide that learning," said Kokobu, 55, who dumbfounded the returning 
Americans last year by escorting them through a spotless library where every 
volume had been kept safe and even the list of overdue borrowed books was up to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Americans found Kokobu's diligence stunning, they would soon learn 
that in Eritrea -- which just celebrated its first anniversary as Africa's 
newest country -- the extraordinary is commonplace. As one American diplomat 
put it recently: "Eritrea reminds me of what Israel must have felt like in the 
'50s. There is an obsession with a single goal -- to make it work." 
</P>
<P>
 The 3.5 million Eritreans, about evenly divided between Muslims and 
Christians, are keenly aware after winning a 30-year guerrilla war for 
independence that many people are echoing the diplomat's sentiments. They smile 
and give a knowing nod when told that what is happening here doesn't seem very, 
well, African. 
</P>
<P>
 Across a continent where concern for shared well-being often plays little role 
in national life, cities are decaying, social services crumbling, political 
foundations wobbling. But here in Eritrea's 7,000-foot-high capital, a kind of 
new African model is emerging, and common people like Habte Freizghy are 
helping create it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I do not do my job right, if I do not show up for work on time," he said, 
"then Eritrea is worse off because of me." Freizghy is a street sweeper and, 
together with a legion of other elderly men who wield their brooms with unusual 
energy, he has helped make Asmara an immaculate city. His salary is $30 a month 
plus a daily ration of food. 
</P>
<P>
 No beggars are allowed in Asmara; they are sent to a training and schooling 
center outside the city. Western business people are stunned to learn that 
government officials are punctual and do not accept bribes. 
</P>
<P>
 Out by the airport, where minefields have been cleared, men and women work 
side by side tending rows of wheat -- a rare sight in Africa where farm labor 
is usually left to women. A U.S. Embassy briefing packet for visitors contains 
this notation under the heading Security Awareness: "None." There is no fear of 
physical harm or crime anywhere in the country, it says. 
</P>
<P>
 Eritrea's guerrilla army -- 30% of whose combat troops were women -- captured 
Asmara from Ethiopia and its Soviet advisers in May, 1991. But even before the 
celebration died down, Issaias Afewerki, then rebel leader and now president, 
had one last request to make of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF): 
Return to the countryside as unpaid volunteers for two years and build schools, 
repair roads, staff clinics, terrace the hills for farming. 
</P>
<P>
 Though not without grumbling that they already had sacrificed enough and been 
gone from their families too long, the 95,000 soldiers obeyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The odds were stacked against us during the war, and very few thought we 
could succeed," said former combatant Yemane Ghebreab, now a senior party 
official. "But the EPLF united the people because our leaders stayed inside the 
country. They lived the same as the rest. They suffered like the rest. And 
therefore they were sensitive to the sacrifice of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 During the colonial era, the ruling Italians built one of Africa's most 
industrialized colonies in this outpost that resembles the Badlands of South 
Dakota. There were factories, railroads, citrus plantations. Eritrea became an 
important export partner for the Middle East and southern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain took control of Eritrea in 1941. By 1952, Eritreans expected to be 
granted independence, like other European colonies. Instead, they were 
swallowed up by Ethiopia. Regardless of "the point of view of justice," U.S. 
Secretary of State John Foster Dulles told the United Nations at the time, 
America's strategic interests dictated that Eritrea "be linked with our ally, 
Ethiopia." 
</P>
<P>
 Treated by the Ethiopians as colonial subjects, denied equal education and 
jobs, the Eritreans went to war in 1961, first against the emperor, then 
against a cabal of violent Communists. Never before had Africa seen such a 
resourceful, self-reliant band of guerrillas take to the bush. 
</P>
<P>
 With virtually no outside backing, the EPLF and two other rebel groups carved 
factories, schools and offices out of rock caves. Solar panels cooled their 
blood-bank refrigerators. Disposable hypodermic syringes were turned into light 
switches, shards of shrapnel into scythes. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers moved at night and carried blackboards into the trenches, to study by 
candlelight. But even when Ethiopia adopted communism and the Soviet Union 
joined the war against Eritrea, in the late 1970s, Western governments kept 
their distance. The EPLF's rhetoric sounded like it had been written in 
Albania. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true that in the '60s and '70s we, as young fighters, embraced the 
school of Marxism," said Kidane Woldeyesus, head of the Americas section of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "But I think Africa in that era called for that 
kind of radical thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then came the Soviet intervention in '78. Those MIGs tried to wipe us out. I 
mean, really wipe us out! It gave us the opportunity to rethink things. Since 
the '80s, we've clearly stated that we were going to a multi-party, democratic 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, having defeated black Africa's largest army and won Ethiopia's 
blessing to secede, Eritrea observes its first anniversary of independence -- 
formally proclaimed on May 24, 1993 -- with a palpable self-esteem that brings 
thousands of neatly dressed residents onto Liberation Boulevard each evening to 
stroll under palm trees and sip espresso in cafes.  
</P>
<P>
 The Peace Corps is coming back, and U.S. firms are exploring for oil and 
natural gas. The Ethiopian Airlines office now houses Eritrea Airlines, though 
no such company yet exists.  
</P>
<P>
 Daunting tasks remain, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Observation alone will tell you that 30 years of war brought devastating 
suffering," said Saba Issays of the National Union of Eritrean Women. 
Agriculture was crippled by the war, the industrial sector destroyed. Per 
capita income is only $130 a year.  
</P>
<P>
 But Eritreans have only to look across their borders at the economic ruin, 
widespread wars, tribal animosity and official corruption that torment Africa 
to know what the alternative is. In few African countries could anyone say, as 
the Foreign Ministry's Kidane did the other day: "Being newcomers, we have had 
the opportunity to learn from history."

PROFILE; COLOMBIAN TACKLES MALARIA AND SKEPTICS; MAVERICK SCIENTIST HAS HAD TO 
CONVINCE CRITICS WORLDWIDE THAT HIS SYNTHETIC VACCINE CAN DETER THE DEADLY 
DISEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a stately 19th-Century building of marble and gold trim, young Colombian 
scientists are splitting molecules, deciphering DNA and creating chemically 
synthesized proteins in a battle against one of the world's most deadly 
diseases: malaria. 
</P>
<P>
 The wizard directing this project on the grounds of the San Juan de Dios 
Hospital is Dr. Manuel Elkin Patarroyo. The 46-year-old biochemist is 
developing a synthetic vaccine that for the first time could successfully slow 
the spread of the stubborn tropical disease, which kills about 3 million people 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 In tests on more than 20,000 people in Africa, Thailand and Latin America, the 
vaccine is showing promise and, after considerable skepticism, it is finally 
receiving international attention and some acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are no longer dreams," Patarroyo said. "These are facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Patarroyo is director of the Colombian National University's Immunology 
Institute, housed on the edge of the hospital compound. He is refurbishing 
several buildings to create a complex of laboratories where he hopes to produce 
the vaccine in bulk. 
</P>
<P>
 A man of seemingly endless energy -- and confidence -- Patarroyo has become a 
celebrity in his homeland, a violent country known more for drug traffickers 
and car bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 As the vaccine gradually passes scientific muster, Patarroyo is regularly 
solicited for international conferences and is racking up awards the world 
over. For Patarroyo, there is a touch of national pride: This is the first 
vaccine created in a developing country without commercial funding, according 
to the United Nations' Research and Training in Tropical Diseases program. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaria is a treacherous, mosquito-borne disease that causes fevers and severe 
headaches and can recur numerous times. Tens of millions of people come down 
with it every year. 
</P>
<P>
 If final testing, under way now, proves successful, the vaccine could become 
available to the public in a few years at an incredibly cheap price: Patarroyo 
estimates he can give a child the three-dose regimen for less than 50 cents. 
Because malaria is most prevalent and most deadly in the impoverished Third 
World, the implications are far-reaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most remarkable, Patarroyo donated the vaccine patent to the World 
Health Organization for $1, saying it was "Colombia's gift to the world." 
Consequently, he will not profit from its production. 
</P>
<P>
 Patarroyo's road to scientific acceptance has been a long one. 
</P>
<P>
 Reared in a family of doctors and trained in chemistry at Yale and Rockefeller 
universities, Patarroyo says he always dreamed of serving his country in 
science or medicine. He saw his opening during a visit to Colombia's 
malaria-infested Pacific Coast, and from there he began studying the 
composition of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum.  
</P>
<P>
 Most conventional vaccines are produced from the germ that causes the disease. 
A weakened form of the germ is introduced into the body, triggering antibodies 
that fight the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Patarroyo identified proteins carried by the malaria parasite. Then his real 
breakthrough came when he decided he could chemically synthesize those proteins 
en masse and produce the vaccine by attaching the proteins to a carrier 
molecule. 
</P>
<P>
 "Making a chemical vaccine has been considered a breakthrough," he said. "You 
don't have to wait for it to be born in nature, biologically. You make it 
chemically." 
</P>
<P>
 But the unorthodox Patarroyo was seen in the scientific community as a 
maverick, and worse. At first, his work was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 His field tests were seen as sloppy, he was producing the vaccine in his own 
laboratory and not under international standards, and he did not submit his 
data to the scrutiny of fellow investigators. His enthusiastic, showboat style 
turned off a lot of scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 He came under attack for moving too quickly from experimenting with Amazonian 
monkeys to injecting humans -- Colombian soldiers. When the Centers for Disease 
Control in Atlanta sought to reproduce his work in 1990, they did not get the 
same results, compounding the doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Patarroyo made the push for international acceptance. He began to 
bring his work in line with guidelines his colleagues could accept. He had the 
vaccine, which is named SPf66, produced at a San Diego laboratory and then he 
conducted internationally supervised tests on 1,548 Pacific Coast Colombians. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1993, the international medical journal Lancet published the 
results. The trials showed a nearly 40% reduction in the incidence of malaria 
among vaccinated subjects and a 77% reduction in children younger than 4, a 
particularly vulnerable group. In some parts of the world, up to 25% of 
children die from malaria. A 67% reduction was reported in adults over 45. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the 40% rate was lower than what Patarroyo had earlier claimed, 
reaction was positive. The Pan-American Health Organization called the vaccine 
a "potential, fantastic lifesaver." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's got a good vaccine," Dr. Trenton Ruebush, chief of the malaria 
section of the CDC's parasitic disease division, said in a telephone interview. 
"I don't think he has a great vaccine. It's certainly not as good as he wants 
to think. But he's gone a lot further than anyone else. He's clearly far ahead 
of the other groups" developing vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
 The once-skeptical WHO was impressed enough to contract with Patarroyo for 
more tests. Most of the research had been financed by the Colombian government. 
</P>
<P>
 Patarroyo was determined to continue his efforts to perfect the vaccine. A 
central question remained about how effective the vaccine would be in areas 
like sub-Saharan Africa where malaria is endemic. Studies on 600 Tanzanian 
children are seen as a key test, and the United Kingdom's Medical Research 
Council, after first rejecting requests, has approved trials in Gambia. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is suggesting that the vaccine will end malaria. The parasite is known 
for its adaptability and can evolve to become more resistant. But even if only 
half the likely victims of the disease can be protected, hundreds of thousands 
of lives could be saved annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Patarroyo, a slightly built, gregarious man, relishes the attention his work 
is receiving. He has just won the Prince of Asturias award from Spain and the 
Medal of Edinburgh, and in October he will be presented with the Robert Koch 
Prize in Bonn, citing his "pioneering work." 
</P>
<P>
 To visitors, he distributes a page from Parasitology Today with a timeline of 
"Milestones in Parasitology." It begins with Hippocrates and Aristotle in the 
4th and 5th Centuries B.C. discovering worms and the seasonal nature of 
disease, and ends with last year's report of Patarroyo's first large-scale 
successful vaccine trials. 
</P>
<P>
 As for those who doubted, and continue to doubt, Patarroyo says he does not 
begrudge them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is difficult to understand an achievement like this in the middle of 
nowhere and, scientifically, Colombia is the middle of nowhere," he said. "I 
don't blame them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst thing they said was that I was making up lies. They said I was a 
charlatan. But I understand them and I have no negative feelings. Colombia has 
no history of scientific development. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Patarroyo's institute has the busy feel of a bus station, his 60-plus 
white-coated researchers scurrying about with vials of cloned protein segments. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Patarroyo is hiring 40 more researchers and beginning to turn the institute's 
attention to tuberculosis and other infectious diseases that he is convinced 
can be fought with chemically synthesized vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept is that every single vaccine can be made chemically, and with 
each batch you can vaccinate thousands and thousands of people," he said. "That 
is the beauty of it." Biography

ETHNIC DISCORD; PILGRIMAGE OF EGYPT'S COPTS A TEST OF NEW MIDEAST PEACE; AS 
CAIRO DROPS RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL TO ISRAEL, THE CHRISTIAN MINORITY IS LEADING 
THE WAY. BUT THEIR JOURNEYS RISK ANGERING ISLAMIC MILITANTS, AS WELL AS THEIR 
OWN POPE.

 A thin cloud of concrete dust hangs over the reception room of the Israeli 
Embassy here these days. Piles of tiles, ready to be laid, are stacked in a 
hallway. Walls are about to be knocked down, counters replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The bedlam that was the visa application section has been moved 16 floors 
down, to a new office posted, unbelievably, "Israeli Embassy Tourism Office." 
</P>
<P>
 Unbelievable because, during decades of enmity, the conventional wisdom has 
been that Arabs don't do Israel, especially not on tour buses. Even during the 
last 15 years of official peace between Egypt and Israel, the idea of Egyptian 
tourists traveling to Israel was virtually unheard of. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with the signing of a peace agreement between Palestinians and 
Israel, the Egyptian government has quietly dropped restrictions on travel to 
Israel and opened the border stations at Taba and Rafah 24 hours a day. While 
most Egyptians still are not flocking across the frontiers, the Holy Land has 
become a new pilgrimage point for hundreds of Egypt's Coptic Christians, who 
are paving the way toward a warmer peace between Arabs and Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know now that thousands of Copts have visited Jerusalem, and there are no 
restrictions at all from the government any longer," said Antoine Zedhoum, 
publisher of the Coptic weekly newspaper, Al Watani. "When people say it is 
time for full relations with Israel, I say, 'Why not? Why not?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Egyptians crossing the Rafah border into Israel has climbed from 
its usual trickle of about 200 a month last fall, before the new policy took 
effect, to about 500 a month, rising to an estimated 1,000 during the Easter 
season this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptian travel agents say about 80% of their business to Israel is Coptic 
Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 In launching the first wave of Arab tourism to Israel, the Coptic community 
risks further angering Islamic militants, who have laid siege to the community 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The tourists are also going against the edict of the Coptic Christian 
patriarch, Pope Shenouda III. Urging Copts to show solidarity with their Muslim 
compatriots, he ordered Egyptian Christians not to visit Jerusalem until the 
entire issue of Israeli occupation, especially the status of Jerusalem, is 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the Pope's business," shrugged Tais Luka, a retired Coptic 
schoolteacher who made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with a tour group this spring. 
"He said (not) until we take the Al Aqsa mosque (Islam's third holiest shrine, 
in east Jerusalem). Well, could he guarantee that we're going to live up until 
then? Why should we suffer for something that will get us nowhere, and they 
(the Muslims) don't appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt's 5 million Copts have taken a low profile in recent years with the 
growth of militant Islam and an increasing trend toward Islam in the schools, 
in the press and even in the streets, where most women now adopt the loose 
dress and head covering of the Islamic hijab . 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last three years, a new wave of violence has targeted the Copts, 
particularly in the rural villages of Upper Egypt where they are the most 
numerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups of angry Muslim militants, in incidents deplored by Muslim officialdom, 
have burned churches and attacked Coptic shops, often raising shadowy 
allegations about Coptic plots against Muslims and labeling the Copts as 
"unbelievers." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 150 Copts have been killed in the violence. In March, two Coptic 
priests and three other Christians were shot to death outside a monastery in 
southern Egypt.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the anti-Christian violence has abated in recent months as Islamic 
militants have focused their fury on foreign tourists and Egyptian security 
officials, the Coptic community nonetheless is feeling isolated in a society 
that increasingly has turned to conservative Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 Well-known Muslim clerics broadcast anti-Christian messages from the mosques. 
The best jobs usually go to Muslims, and few Copts are allowed to advance to 
the top of their faculties at Egyptian universities, particularly in medical 
fields.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the selection of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, an Egyptian Copt, as secretary 
general of the United Nations in 1991 did not do much to encourage Copts in the 
Egypt's political community, where leaders note that no Copt has ever risen to 
the rank of full minister.  
</P>
<P>
 The Egyptian government, hoping to avoid a rise in Christian militancy, has 
come strongly to the Copts' defense, publicly urging religious harmony and 
emphasizing the message of the equality of all Egyptians. Police guards are now 
posted outside every church in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 Pope Shenouda and most Coptic intellectuals have urged a low-profile response 
to attacks, confident that the government will move to stop the violence and 
fearful that a militant response from the Copts could plunge Egypt into the 
kind of communal misery that destroyed the social fabric of neighboring 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Copts are more intelligent, more patient. Therefore, they lie low against 
the Islamic wave," said prominent Coptic intellectual Milad Hanna, a former 
member of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Luka, one of the first wave of Coptic pilgrims to Israel, said Egyptian 
Christians are visiting the holy sites in Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth in 
part to regain a sense of their own identity as Christians, an identity she 
felt herself losing in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, it really gives you a feeling that there is Christianity, after 
all," she said. "Because living here, the Muslims always say Christ was just 
another prophet. Sometimes they even say, 'You imagined the Crucifixion.' Think 
of it! And you hear that every day, day after day, on the TV, on the radio, in 
the newspaper, and after a while you begin to ask, 'Could it be so?' " 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the Pope's ban on travel to Jerusalem, none of the touring 
Copts has been allowed to take Holy Communion at the Coptic church in 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Copts say the true reason for his ire about Israeli tourism is not the 
Muslims' Al Aqsa mosque but the Copts' own Deir al Sultan monastery in 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 The monastery was the subject of prolonged dispute after Israel refused 
Egyptian requests to enforce a court order ejecting the Ethiopian Coptic church 
from the monastery grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachad Antonius, a Christian sociology professor at American University of 
Cairo, said the wave of Coptic pilgrimages should not be overestimated. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they go there, they go there for purely religious reasons," he said. 
"And the most important thing is they do not establish links with Israeli 
institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 But Israel hopes that will be the next step. The Israeli Embassy has eagerly 
taken visa applications from all comers, Christian and Muslim, and usually 
grants visas to Egyptians within a week. 
</P>
<P>
 For Israelis, Arab tourism is not only an avenue for new economic cooperation 
but a chance to rehabilitate Israel's reputation in the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Egyptian who is going to Israel, for him, he is going to a place that is 
not even existing: The map on the border on the Egyptian side says Palestine, 
not Israel," said Ronnie Porat, Israel's consul in Egypt. "He heard that it's a 
place that's not cheap, a place that is full of soldiers all over the streets. 
He heard that everybody in Israel is addicted to drugs. He heard he's going to 
get AIDS there. . . . The problem is that the barrier is one of knowledge, of 
thinking. It's a matter of burying the stigmas." 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing has taken time for people to get the confidence to go there," 
admitted Osama Wagdi, one of the three major tour operators offering trips to 
Israel. "But there is a big potential. People have not been going there since 
the '60s, and they are millions. A lot of them still have a psychological fear 
of having an Israeli visa in their passports," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you have to look at it another way. In another year, two years, the 
situation will be very normal. Jordanians are already going to Israel; there 
were some Israelis in Qatar two months ago. There's no end to it. We are 
talking about business now and interests between two countries. Forget about 
politics. We are doing business with an Israeli company, and our mutual 
intention is to grow." BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Copts are a native Christian minority of Egypt. They played a leading role in 
early Christianity, founding their movement late in the 3rd Century. Copts 
believe in the unity of the human and divine in Christ's nature, which was 
declared a heresy in 451 when church leaders from Constantinople and Rome 
declared that Christ has two separate natures. After that split, Copts 
established an independent church with its own patriarch and clergy. In 642, 
Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt, and many Copts converted to Islam. Today, about 5 
million Copts live in Egypt; other small Coptic communities are scattered 
throughout the world. Copts speak Arabic, although their language, a version of 
ancient Egyptian, is used in Coptic Orthodox Church services.

MEDIA; TV STATION GIVES PALESTINIANS A VOICE -- BUT NO PICTURE; PALESTINIAN 
BROADCASTING CORP. HAS GREAT DREAMS OF UNIFYING ITS PEOPLE. BUT IT MUST FIRST 
OVERCOME A LACK OF FUNDS AND INTERNAL POWER STRUGGLES.

 In Room 123 on the second floor of the Hisham Palace Hotel, just off Jericho's 
central square, Ali Rayyan switched on the computer, then the video recorder, 
the television monitor, the cassette player and finally the transmitter -- 
Palestinian Television was on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Palestinian flag of red, black, white and green reshaped into a test 
pattern and the popular Lebanese singer Fairuz Rahbani singing from her album 
"Jerusalem in My Heart," Palestinian Television began another day of 
experimental broadcasts from its tiny, makeshift studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope people listen to us for Fairuz's songs because so far we have no 
pictures to offer them," said Rayyan, who was sent by the Palestine Liberation 
Organization to establish an information and media center here as part of the 
autonomous Palestinian government in Jericho and the Gaza Strip. "The pictures 
will come, and soon we hope." 
</P>
<P>
 With promises of equipment and funds from European donors, the Palestinian 
Broadcasting Corp. wants to launch itself with radio and television coverage of 
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's arrival as head of the new Palestinian governing 
council and thus to establish itself as one of the first nation-building 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main aim is to be the voice of the Palestinian people, a nation that has 
been without its own voice up to now," Saman Khoury, deputy chairman of 
Palestinian Broadcasting, said in Jerusalem. "We want to bring together our 
people who have been scattered for so many years. We want to unify our nation. 
We want to articulate its aspirations." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian Broadcasting has plans to match those ambitions. They include a 
$55-million development program, a staff that would grow to 500 or 600 people 
in a few years, a full range of programs for the West Bank and Gaza Strip and 
signals that would carry into Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.  
</P>
<P>
 But Palestinian Broadcasting's start, like that of the Palestinian Authority 
itself, has been far more tentative than assertive, bedeviled with the same 
problems -- weak organization, no ready funds and factional in-fighting -- that 
have hit virtually all the new Palestinian institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are starting at zero -- Palestinians have done nothing in this field by 
themselves -- and we are pulling ourselves up hand over hand," said Bassem abu 
Samaya. As the Jerusalem correspondent for Radio Monte Carlo, he is listened to 
throughout the Middle East and is now helping train a new generation of radio 
journalists. "We have no money -- just promises. We have no studios, no 
equipment -- just some for training. We are really at zero." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian Broadcasting is still negotiating with Israel for television and 
radio frequencies and for permission to broadcast to the West Bank from the old 
Jordanian transmitter in Ramallah, north of Jerusalem. It is also rushing 
construction of its first studios with $3 million in donated equipment. The 
equipment now used in Jericho is all borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ramallah transmitter is the big issue -- once we get that, we'll be on 
the air with three hours of (radio) transmission a day of news, current events, 
educational and social programs and music," Khoury said. "Television is more 
complicated, unfortunately, and it may take two or three months." 
</P>
<P>
 For Arafat's arrival, for which no date has been set, the Palestinians have a 
tentative agreement for coverage with a French television company. 
</P>
<P>
 Political and philosophical issues that go beyond such start-up problems, 
however, also loom large. 
</P>
<P>
 In establishing the Palestinian Broadcasting Corp., Arafat made clear his 
preference for state-run radio and television, as in most other Mideast 
countries, and he has told Palestinian investors wanting to establish 
commercial stations that they would be given licenses -- as long as the 
government holds 51% of the shares. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are willing to operate within national guidelines, but we should be 
allowed to operate commercially, investing our own money, taking the risks and 
keeping the profits," said Hakam Fahoum, whose Jerusalem Media Productions has 
co-produced 47 documentaries over eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Commercial television and radio reinforce political pluralism. They will 
assure access to the media for a diversity of viewpoints, and they are far more 
likely to act as a watchdog on the government and undertake investigative 
reporting. Commercial media also reinforce a free-market economy. A state 
monopoly on the media is absolutely not the way to begin." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Palestinian Broadcasting, though a government agency, hopes to establish 
its independence, deriving a substantial portion of its income from 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say many of the directors and staff being hired by Palestinian 
Broadcasting are, in fact, chosen for their political affiliation and their 
loyalty to Arafat rather than their professionalism, experience and skill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all been political, not professional, from the top down and from the 
very start a year ago," complained Daoud Kuttab, a prominent Palestinian 
journalist who organized some of the early training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of Palestinian broadcast journalists and technicians with experience in 
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Gulf states were among the 1,800 who 
applied for jobs, but only a few have been hired so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Television is one of the plums of the Palestinian autonomy," said a Jerusalem 
businessman who is a potential investor, "and those who won control from Arafat 
are not going to give it up easily." 
</P>
<P>
 The principal target for such criticism is Radwan abu Ayyash, the chairman of 
Palestinian Broadcasting, a journalist by profession but more a politician and 
an Arafat loyalist since he helped lead the intifada , the Palestinian 
rebellion against the Israeli occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Radwan thinks he has been appointed as Arafat's commissar for radio and 
television rather than the chairman of a national institution responsible to 
the people," another senior Palestinian journalist said.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the early problems, there is excitement among the young radio 
journalists training under Abu Samaya in an apartment in East Jerusalem as they 
prepare to "put our Palestinian voice on the air." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to start strong," Abu Samaya said. "We have to be better than other 
radio stations, or the listeners will not tune in. We have to have our own 
voice, our own style, not copy Jordan or Syria or even my station, Monte Carlo. 
Our people will judge us, and judge us severely. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying for professionalism. We don't want slogans. If we do it all 
well, we will gain credibility, and Palestinians will listen to us. If we fail, 
they will just switch us off and listen to another station."

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; VOLUNTEER CAN HELP

 The victories in overcoming the death of a spouse are small: the first time a 
wife is able to dispose of some of her husband's clothes, when a husband is 
able to listen to a tape of his wife's voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each little victory for them becomes a victory of mine," said Doris Fitchett, 
a senior peer counselor for the Family Service Agency in Burbank since it 
started in January of 1993. She was named the agency's outstanding volunteer of 
the year last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitchett got involved in the program after seeing a newspaper ad for 
volunteers over the age of 60. With about 20 years as a physical rehabilitation 
therapist and two years as an alcoholism counselor, she knew that she was good 
with people, a good listener. The program was aimed at helping seniors by 
having fellow seniors help counsel them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel it's easier for a senior to speak to a senior," Fitchett said. 
</P>
<P>
 She feels she has a lot in common with the seniors she helps to cope with a 
loved one's death. A few years ago, she lost both her mother and a son within 
six months of each other, 
</P>
<P>
 "I know how that can just numb you," Fitchett said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a group counselor, she meets at the agency with about seven senior citizens 
-- ranging in age from 65 to 85 -- Monday mornings for about an hour and a 
half. The sessions begin with Fitchett asking each person to talk about the 
previous week. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened when you saw your son?" she asks. "Did you visit the grave this 
week?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the sessions are temporarily sidetracked in shared nostalgia, such 
as remembering what Burbank was like years ago. Often, that leads to memories 
of something the participants did with a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "To lose a spouse at any time is devastating, but seniors have lost so much 
already," Fitchett said.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, she said, seniors may have lost their health, friends or other 
parts of their lives. Even their children may not understand why their parent 
is still grieving months after the death of a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We offer a safe place for them to share their story," Fitchett said. "They 
bond together. I just sit back and let them go." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitchett also does one-on-one counseling. Although she is not a licensed 
therapist, her progress is regularly checked by one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Family Service Agency in Burbank also has other programs to help seniors, 
including home care volunteers, who can be of any age. To volunteer call Nell 
Elerding, senior connections coordinator at the agency, (818) 845-7671. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Presbyterian Hospital's Volunteer Services Department needs volunteers 
to work as receptionists in the intensive care unit, assist the staff with 
general duties, answer phones, and greet new patients and their families. 
Openings are for Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 1 to 5 
p.m. Those interested should call Anne Fastiggi, the hospital's volunteer 
director, at (818) 902-2932. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank is looking for volunteers -- especially 
those who are bilingual -- to work with recuperating or terminally ill patients 
as part of the hospital's Home Health and Hospice Department. Patients in the 
program are from throughout the Los Angeles area. Volunteers are required to 
give four hours a week after the initial 30 hours of training. To apply, call 
(818) 843-5111 ext. 7051. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fred Jordan Mission's sixth annual "Back-to-School Days" event in Downtown 
Los Angeles is expected to feed and clothe more than 7,000 homeless or needy 
children Aug. 16 and 17. Volunteers are needed to help distribute the clothes, 
as well as to sort clothes beforehand. The sorting is ongoing. Each child will 
be given a complete new outfit, a new pair of shoes and some food. To volunteer 
call the mission at (818) 915-1981.

NO SIMPLE ANSWER FOR BUS FARE INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading Henry Chu's story on bus fare increases (June 18), I developed a 
solution to the inequities in bus and rail subsidies. Here's my plan: 
</P>
<P>
 Raise gasoline taxes and use that money to subsidize public transportation for 
those who can't afford a fare hike.Since gasoline-buyers can afford their own 
private transportation, they should also be able to afford the increase in gas 
taxes. Once the gas taxes are high enough so that public transportation is more 
affordable than driving, a significant number of current drivers will switch to 
public transportation, resulting in increased revenues for the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority. Continue to increase gasoline taxes until enough 
people use public transportation to make subsidies unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 After thinking about my plan for a while, I realize it will never work. Here's 
why: 
</P>
<P>
 The middle and upper classes, who can afford the convenience of private 
transportation, can also afford the convenience of political power, since they 
have both the time and the money to wield political influence. Out of their 
generosity and concern for workers in the auto and oil industries, they will 
oppose the increase in gasoline taxes. More significantly, oil companies and 
car manufacturers, which have the financial resources to make direct and 
significant contributions to the campaigns of political candidates, will make 
it difficult for any politician to support my plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh well. So much for a great plan.

BLACK'S BACK, DODGERS LOSE; BASEBALL: IN SECOND START OF SEASON, HE GIVES UP 
ONLY TWO HITS IN SEVEN INNINGS AS THE GIANTS HOLD ON, 3-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Francisco Giants came to Dodger Stadium Monday night on a mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the season hasn't reached the halfway point, there is the possibility 
of a strike and a shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants were 6 1/2 behind the Dodgers in the West and knew they had to win 
the three-game series. A sweep would be wonderful they reasoned, but two 
victories were a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 The first part of the mission was accomplished, largely because of Bud Black, 
a veteran pitcher coming off of the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 The left-hander, 36, in only his second start of the season, pitched seven 
strong innings and the Giants won, 3-2, before 43,281. 
</P>
<P>
 Black, in his first start Wednesday, went a solid six innings. Coming right 
back with two-hit ball for seven innings, he has given Manager Dusty Baker's 
riddled pitching staff a big lift. 
</P>
<P>
 When Delino DeShields opened the eight with a crisp single to left, only the 
Dodgers' third hit of the game, Baker brought in his bullpen ace, Rod Beck. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck staggered to his 14th save, but not before Mike Piazza hit a booming home 
run, a two-run smash that reached the seats in the left field bleachers before 
left fielder Barry Bonds could turn toward the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants, who have not been hitting much all season, didn't batter the 
fences against Tom Candiotti, but a two-run double by Royce Clayton in the 
first inning gave Black a working margin. 
</P>
<P>
 After elbow and knee surgeries last fall and this spring, respectively, Black 
doesn't throw as hard as he once did, but he earned his first victory in nearly 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza had a chance to pull it out for the Dodgers, but with runners on first 
and third in the ninth, he made the final out on a foul pop to first baseman 
Todd Benzinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Baker, who has three pitchers on the disabled list and other pitchers 
hurting: "When Buddy struck out Piazza with the bases loaded in the third 
inning, I thought maybe our luck was changing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's two good outings by Black. What a lift he's given us. If he gets 
DeShields to open the eighth, he would have faced Piazza again. But I couldn't 
wait.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to bring Beck in that early, but we don't have our setup guy, 
Mike Jackson, he's one of those on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was too important a series for us to hold Beck back. We have to win this 
series." 
</P>
<P>
 Black, who was 8-2 and helped get the Giants off to their fast start last 
season, has had a rough time since last August. First, there was elbow surgery 
that finished his 1993 season. When he tried to come back in the spring, a knee 
operation kept him out until last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really feeling pretty good," he said. "But I walked too many to call this 
a good performance. And I certainly wouldn't want to make a living facing Mike 
Piazza with the bases loaded. I got him this time, but you see what he did to 
Rod." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, in the early innings, at least, Candiotti deserved a better fate. 
Although the Giants weren't hitting him hard, the knuckleball veteran found 
himself trailing, 3-0, after three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 With a little sharper fielding by the Dodgers, he could have escaped in both 
the first and third innings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first, the Giants had runners on first and second with one out when 
Matt Williams bounced sharply to the new shortstop, Rafael Bournigal. Instead 
of an inning-ending double play, however, the Dodgers got only a force at 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields, after getting the force, wheeled quickly, but his throw to first 
was in the dirt and Eric Karros couldn't come up with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti walked Dave Martinez to load the bases and give Clayton the chance 
to bat. The shortstop made the most of the opportunity, ripping a two-run 
double down the left field line. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Tom Lasorda, who saw the Dodger lead over Colorado shrink to three 
games and the margin over the Giants to 5 1/2, said the game turned on that 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we didn't make the double play on Williams, that was the game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the third, Bonds, who scored one of the first inning runs after 
drawing a walk, opened with a single and wound up scoring an unearned run. 
Bonds stole second, went to third on a passed ball, and, after a walk, scored 
on a force out.

U.S. WOMEN THRIVE AMID THE GREENERY; WIMBLEDON: GARRISON-JACKSON LEADS THE WAY, 
UPSETTING SECOND-SEEDED SANCHEZ VICARIO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The predominant color at Wimbledon is green. Green grass. Green walls. Green 
scoreboards. Green bleachers. Green everything. 
</P>
<P>
 It's obvious: Someone got a great deal on green paint. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Monday's results in the women's singles, stodgy Wimbledon officials 
might have to add three more colors to their wheel chart. 
</P>
<P>
 Red. 
</P>
<P>
 White. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 13-seeded Zina Garrison-Jackson recorded the upset of the day, defeating 
second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3. That leaves 
Wimbledon without its No. 1- and No. 2-seeded women for the first time since 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Blame the city of Houston. Garrison-Jackson and Lori McNeil, who disposed of 
favorite Steffi Graf last week, learned the game years ago on the public courts 
of Houston's MacGregor Park. Monday they glittered on the very exclusive courts 
of privileged Brits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of upsets during the tournament," Garrison-Jackson said. "I 
figured this could be one." 
</P>
<P>
 Her victory was the biggest, but not the only American highlight of the day. 
Five U.S. women advanced to the quarterfinals, three U.S. men. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Garrison-Jackson's victory over Sanchez Vicario, which took care of 
the player who many believed had the best chance of earning the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 There was unseeded McNeil, who beat unseeded Florencia Labat of Argentina, 7-6 
(7-4), 7-6 (7-4). She plays Latvia's Larisa Neiland in the next round. 
</P>
<P>
 There was unseeded Gigi Fernandez, who defeated Indonesia's Yayuk Basuki, 6-4, 
6-1. Fernandez, who faces Garrison-Jackson, also distinguished herself in the 
area of tennis cat fights. The claw marks are on Czech Jana Novotna. 
</P>
<P>
 There was No. 4 Martina Navratilova, who had an easy time with No. 17 Helena 
Sukova, 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was Lindsay Davenport, the teen-ager from Murrieta Valley High who 
came here with a No. 9 seeding, low expectations and only a little preparation 
time on grass courts. Now she is two matches away from a Wimbledon final, the 
next being against third-seeded Conchita Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since 1985 have at least five American women advanced this far. 
Navratilova? Sure. Garrison-Jackson, a finalist in 1990? Understandable. But 
the rest of them? 
</P>
<P>
 McNeil reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals once before. In 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez made it to the semifinals in 1991, but hadn't advanced past the 
third round since. And Davenport? This is her second Grand Slam event 
quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was actually considering maybe not playing because of my high school 
graduation and after the French (Open) I was a little bit tired," she said. 
"There was like a day -- and I didn't think about it very long -- when I 
thought maybe it wouldn't be the best idea to play here. Then everyone talked 
me into it." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Novotna, she has been a regular quote machine. 
</P>
<P>
 She had this to say about Davenport in the London papers: "She is a very tall, 
very heavy (6 feet 2, 165 pounds) player, but to me it would be easy to play 
her. She's much too big. I don't understand why someone doesn't tell her she 
should lose a few pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 And this on Navratilova: "I think this year it's too much for Martina. 
Everything is much slower. Her will is there, but her body just can't do it 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Word filtered back to Fernandez, who knows Novotna well from their days as 
double partners. She also remembered Novotna's collapse against Graf in last 
year's Wimbledon final. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jana's the biggest choker I've ever seen," she was quoted as saying. "First 
you have to be aware of it, then deal with it, then get over it. It's so 
simple, but she's choked all her life. She's done it in singles and doubles." 
</P>
<P>

7-5, 6-7 (7-0), 4-6, 6-1. C8

 John Daly was disqualified from the Greater Hartford Open for signing an 
incorrect scorecard, the PGA announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The card for Sunday's final round, which was kept by his playing partner, 
Clark Dennis, read that Daly had a three at No. 5, when he actually had a bogey 
four, said Leslie Sinadinos, communications assistant for the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clark wrote down the wrong score, but it's still John's responsibility to 
check the card before he signs it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly signed for a five-over 75 and a 278 total that was worth $11,520 for a 
tie for 22nd.

MORNING BRIEFING: TO HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER, YOUNGEST NAMESAKE IS JUST AL

 Al Unser III, 11-year-old son of Al Jr., the Indianapolis 500 winner, and 
grandson of Al, four-time Indy 500 winner, was called Mini Al when he was 
younger. His father was called Little Al and his grandfather was Big Al. 
</P>
<P>
 When the youngster said he didn't care for Mini Al, the family asked him what 
he wanted to be called. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just Al," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So that's what they call him: Just Al.

 Trivia time: Which school has had the most Rhodes scholars who earned letters

 Numbers game: The number to watch in the American League West is 61, according

 Hungry, anyone? Wimbledon officials expect 23 tons of strawberries to be 
consumed during the current fortnight of tennis. But they didn't say how much 
clotted cream would go along with the traditional snack.

</P>
<P>
 One step ahead: Glenn Robinson and Jason Kidd haven't even been drafted yet -- 
the NBA will divvy up the college talent Wednesday -- but they already have 
signed lucrative pro contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Both signed with the Score Board for autographed memorabilia. Included in the 
deal are trading cards, which are already on the market -- without a team 
affiliation.

 Solid credentials: Country singer Charlie Pride is an avid baseball fan. When 
a friend asked him how he happened to marry his wife, Rozene, he replied: 
</P>
<P>
 "Why shouldn't I marry her? She was smart, beautiful, independent and could 
explain the infield fly rule."

 Greener grass: Remember Rob Deer, who ended a 10-year career in the major 
leagues last year by hitting .210 for the Detroit Tigers and Boston Red Sox?

 He went to Japan, where he is playing for the Hanshin Tigers -- for a reported 
$2.6 million.

<P>
 You tell 'em: If you think Barry Bonds or Charles Barkley are prima donnas, 
how about Romario, Brazil's World Cup star? During a TV interview, he whined 
about his seat assignment on a flight to Los Angeles. Team officials had 
reserved a middle seat for him, between fellow forwards Bebeto and Muller. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted a window seat, and I'll sit next to whomever I want to," he said. "I 
know I'm difficult, but that's because I'm the real thing."

</P>
<P>
 No easy trick: Golf announcer Bobby Clampett, at the United Airlines Houston 
Open, had this to say about the weather: 
</P>
<P>
 "The wind today is inside the players' faces."

 Added hazard: During the LPGA Oldsmobile Classic, Nancy Scranton hit a tee 
shot down the middle of the 18th fairway -- then watched as a squirrel picked 
up the ball and carried it across the fairway into the rough before dropping 
it. 
</P>

NEWSWIRE: DALY DISQUALIFIED FOR SIGNING INCORRECT SCORECARD 
</P>

 John Daly was disqualified from the Greater Hartford Open for signing an 
incorrect scorecard, the PGA announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The card for Sunday's final round, which was kept by his playing partner, 
Clark Dennis, read that Daly had a three at No. 5, when he actually had a bogey 
four, said Leslie Sinadinos, communications assistant for the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clark wrote down the wrong score, but it's still John's responsibility to 
check the card before he signs it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly signed for a five-over-par 75 and a 278 total that was worth $11,520 for 
a tie for 22nd. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly has had a number of scorecard-related problems. He failed to sign cards 
after an 81 in the second round of the 1992 Australian Masters and a 77 in the 
final round of the 1993 Kemper Open, and signed an incorrect card after an 87 
in the second round of the 1991 World Championship in Jamaica. Colleges

 About 500 more minority athletes would graduate under revised academic 
requirements than under NCAA rules adopted five months ago over the protest of 
black educators, a study says. A special committee will present its findings to 
the NCAA Presidents Commission this week and ask that the new standards replace 
Proposition 16, which schools approved at the NCAA convention last January.

 Versatile Steve Hendrickson, who spent the last four seasons with the San 
Diego Chargers, has been signed as an unrestricted free agent by the Raiders. 
Hendickson, 6-feet, 250 pounds, has played running back, tight end and 
linebacker. He started the final 10 games of last season at outside linebacker 
for the Chargers.

A'S STILL ALIVE IN BASEBALL'S SORRIEST DIVISION; ANGELS: OAKLAND ONLY FOUR 
GAMES OUT IN WEST AFTER WINNING, 10-2, FOR 11TH VICTORY IN 13 GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There's no Catfish Hunter or Rollie Fingers, no Dave Stewart or Jose Canseco. 
But can the Oakland A's be far from Dynasty III, the sequel of those Bay Area 
feel-good hits of the summers of '72-'73-'74 and '88-'89-'90? 
</P>
<P>
 In the American League West, where you can play .429 baseball and still be 
only two games out of first place -- see "Angels" in your standings this 
morning -- the A's have made a remarkable return to the race. After trailing by 
12 1/2 games only two weeks ago, they have won 11 of 13 and now are only four 
games behind first-place Texas in baseball's sorriest division. 
</P>
<P>
 How sorry? The Angels were 6 1/2 games behind two weeks ago, are 7-7 since and 
trail by two. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night, the A's beat the Angels, 10-2, in front of 15,141 at the Oakland 
Coliseum, powered by an established star of summers past and a 22-year-old who 
is beginning to live up to the potential that propelled him into the big 
leagues as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickey Henderson made more than a cameo appearance with a single, a double, a 
home run, two runs batted in and three runs . . . in the first three innings. 
And right-hander Todd Van Poppel, the A's first-round draft pick in 1990, 
rebounded from a shaky start to pick up his third victory in his last four 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, (Oakland Manager) Tony LaRussa is probably doing a better job than 
he ever has," Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann said. "Starting like they did and 
now they're right in there. It's easier to keep a club winning than it is to 
pick up one that's scuffling and get them back in the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Granted, the division has something to do with it, but they're playing really 
well. They're on a roll and we didn't do anything to control them. They beat us 
up pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Poppel, whose earned-run average was 16.62 after three starts, is 4-6 
after giving up seven hits and two runs in seven innings Monday night. The 
Angels countered with their own 22-year-old sensation, but Brian Anderson, 
after winning three of his first four starts, has fallen from grace and is 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time he faced Oakland, Anderson lasted only two innings because he 
tried to make a barehanded catch of a ground ball and suffered a broken thumb. 
This time, the rookie left-hander didn't even make it two innings, but the only 
things hurting were his ego and earned-run average. He gave up eight hits and 
five earned runs in 1 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a combination of getting behind in the count and then trying to hit 
spots instead of throwing to spots," Anderson said. "I didn't really get 
through the ball and a lot of the pitches that started out in tight kind of 
faded back across the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had a lot of luck with these guys. At least I came out healthy, 
that's a plus. The only plus." 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared Van Poppel might be in for a long night when the first two batters 
he faced singled and two of the next three flied out to the warning track. 
</P>
<P>
 "Making it through that first inning, that was a big deal," Van Poppel said. 
"That could have been a very big first inning for them, but it turned out to be 
a big plus for us." 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, it turned out to be a short evening for Anderson, who gave up a run 
in the first and four more in the second as the A's sent 10 batters to the 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
 The top four batters in the Oakland lineup -- Henderson, Stan Javier, Geronimo 
Berroa and Ruben Sierra -- all had two RBIs and all but Sierra had an 
extra-base hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my fault," Anderson said. "I made bad pitches and I got what I 
deserved." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but the great thing about this division is you don't always get what 
you deserve. In fact, you might even win a pennant when you deserve last place.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It might not rank with some of the startling developments in sports lately, 
but the Dodgers' demotion of Jose Offerman was unexpected. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, how often does a first-place team send its starting shortstop to the 
minors in midseason? . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 These days, few major league regulars ever worry about job security because 
the talent pool is so thin. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this will send a much-needed message to Offerman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 At 25, he still has a future with the Dodgers, but only if he starts hitting 
ground balls and line drives instead of fly balls, further improves his 
fielding, and gets a new attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Figuring out first-round survivors in the World Cup makes figuring out NFL 
playoff possibilities look like child's play. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It's a lot more fun to root for an underdog, such as the U.S. World Cup team, 
than a heavy favorite, such as the U.S. Olympic basketball team. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 No, World Cup visitors, it usually isn't so hot this time of year in our 
little slice of paradise. The high Sunday in Pasadena was 106. The normal high 
on that date in L.A. is 80. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks, who have the second choice, and the Kings, who have the 
seventh, should be able to select productive players today. But the NHL draft 
is much more of a crapshoot than when the minimum age of draftees was higher. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 It won't bother me if both local NBA teams tap the Pacific 10 Conference for 
their first picks in the draft Wednesday -- California forward Lamond Murray to 
the Clippers and Arizona guard Khalid Reeves to the Lakers. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The most popular horse in Hollywood Park history is Native Diver because of 
what he accomplished in the track's biggest race, the Gold Cup. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The kind of front-runner who usually can't handle the 1 1/4-mile distance, 
Native Diver won the Cup three consecutive times from 1965-67. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On June 1, his jockey, Jerry Lambert, returned to Hollywood Park to ride there 
for the first time since 1986. His mount, Dorothy Fontaine, finished fifth in 
the fifth race, but it was a wonderful day for Lambert. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about Native Diver and it brought back a lot of fond memories," 
said Lambert, 53, who is riding regularly at Los Alamitos. "I only wish I had a 
black horse like that to ride nowadays. At least, I was fortunate that I got to 
ride one like him. Other guys never have and never will." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Lambert took his daughter Lacey, 9, to the paddock garden to see the monument 
that marks the site where Native Diver was buried in 1967. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Lacey had seen pictures of him and heard a lot about him," Lambert said. "But 
now she's getting old enough to realize that he was something very special." . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Native Diver remains the only horse to have won the Gold Cup more than once. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 There will be no repeat winner, either, Saturday when favorite The Wicked 
North takes on a small, but, of course, select field that includes Arcangues, 
Del Mar Dennis and Slew Of Damascus. Best Pal, who has raced recently but is 
being prepared for a return to the track, won a year ago. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Virginia Slims tennis tournament at Manhattan Beach Aug. 8-14 will have 
the hit, Lori McNeil, and miss, Mary Pierce, of Wimbledon. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Where would Tonya Harding be today without Nancy Kerrigan? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A heavyweight boxing prospect to watch is Joel Scott of Albany, N.Y. He is 23, 
6 feet 2, 235 pounds, and the winner of all five of his professional bouts by 
first-round knockouts. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' Pacific Coast League affiliate, Vancouver, won the first-half 
Northern Division title and the Dodgers' club, Albuquerque, tied for the 
Southern Division title. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up to the Angels' Rex Hudler, who likes to chat with the fans in the 
stands during lulls in the action when he is playing the outfield. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Dallas Green was quoted in Newsday on the lackadaisical play of his 
New York Mets: "If they want to strike, let them strike now, walk right out of 
the clubhouse, that's all right with me. But don't bring it out on the field 
and don't bring it to the fans until that time." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the attention is going to Ken Griffey Jr., but Frank Thomas is 
enjoying one of the all-time great first halves. . . . There is no truth to the 
rumor that the winner of the American League West title will refuse an 
invitation to the playoffs.

GERMANS HANG ON TO BEAT SOUTH KOREA; GROUP C: DEFENDING CHAMPIONS BUILD 3-0 
LEAD, SURVIVE HEAT AND SECOND-HALF RALLY IN 3-2 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Germany had so much to prove Monday that maybe, just maybe, it was too much 
for the defending World Cup champions. 
</P>
<P>
 After two mediocre games that had everyone from Bonn to Berlin in a tizzy, 
Germany's players, coaches and federation officials were hoping for a 
breakthrough in their final first-round match against South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 And for 45 minutes the magic returned on a torrid Texas afternoon. Then, 
almost as quickly, it disappeared before 63,988 at the sold out Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany won, 3-2, in one of the World Cup tournament's most entertaining 
games, but it was South Korea receiving most of the accolades after a grueling 
duel in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, Korea rallied from a 3-0 deficit and turned the powerful Germans 
into a team sitting on the precipice.  
</P>
<P>
 "We must admit, we are pretty lucky to have won this game," said Berti Vogts, 
Germany's coach. 
</P>
<P>
 That they were. After taking a commanding lead in the first 37 minutes, the 
Germans collapsed on a day when temperatures reached almost 120 degrees on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty spectators were treated for heat exhaustion, 12 of whom were 
hospitalized and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Germany won the Group C title with the victory, it was feeling the 
heat afterward. The Koreans, who were eliminated after two ties and a loss, 
were frustrated but had reason to be proud. They had rallied to tie Spain in 
the final six minutes, then had tied Bolivia before gaining the soccer world's 
attention Monday with their indomitable spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't anticipate they could play all 45 minutes of the second half," said 
Andreas Brehme, one of the only German defenders who had a satisfactory game. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hwang Sun-nong, who scored his team's first goal in the 52nd minute after 
catching goalkeeper Bodo Illgner out of position, "We became physically 
superior in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 Germany already was getting harsh criticism from the German press before the 
match. And few in the German media were about to let up after the team barely 
held on in the final 30 minutes, when Korea had three solid scoring 
opportunities blocked by Illgner. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I think the players were very intimidated," said Kim Ho, Korea's 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 But then their confidence grew as German players slowed to a jog in the second 
half. In a surprising move, Kim replaced captain and goalkeeper Choi In-young 
with Lee Woon-jae, to start the second half, but the risky move worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first concern was to win," Kim said. "If that means taking out the team 
captain, then I will take out the team captain." 
</P>
<P>
 Once they realized they could attack the German defense, targeting Stefan 
Effenberg, who was playing for the injured Thomas Strunz, Korea became the 
aggressor. It looked like a team of seasoned veterans compared to the all-stars 
from Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got them going with our mistakes," Vogts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was a memorable effort, Korea will leave the United States without 
its first World Cup victory in four appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good chance, and we feel bad," Hwang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as bad as the Germans feel. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a frustrating, fatiguing day despite the play of Juergen Klinsmann, who 
scored two goals, one of them the Cup's best so far. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 12th minute, he took a pass from Thomas Haessler on the right side and, 
with his back to the net, controlled the ball with his right foot. In a 
brilliant move, he then hooked a waist-high left-footed shot inside the goal 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 On Klinsmann's second goal and fourth of the tournament, he controlled a 
looping cross from the right and made a powerful shot. The ball slipped through 
Choi's hands on the way into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Klinsmann was not in a celebratory mood afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not mentally fresh and it was hard for us to pick up speed," he said 
of the second-half collapse.  
</P>
<P>
 Lothar Matthaeus, the team's captain, was more contrite, saying, "We are a 
little bit arrogant so this was the result." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthaeus suffered a cut foot when he bumped into a Korean in the first half, 
but continued playing despite the pain. He clamped the cut during halftime, and 
then continued for a while. But eventually he had to leave, replaced by Andreas 
Moeller. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about coming off the field (at halftime), but I didn't want to," 
Matthaeus said. "(Then) the pain got worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthaeus' wound had to be stitched and his condition has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany won its group title with seven points. Spain finished second with five 
after defeating Bolivia, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory ensured Germany of playing in the single-elimination second-round 
July 2 in Chicago. Whether Germany finds its form is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 It will need to revamp its defense.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were in a huge mess and that will need critical analysis," Vogts said of 
his defense.

 GROUP B at Stanford Stadium, Palo Alto 
</P>
<P>
 CAMEROON vs. RUSSIA 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN2, KSCI (Russian), ESPN (delayed, midnight), Univision (delayed, 
12:15 a.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: Saying he feared his continued presence in the lineup had 
become a distraction to the team, Cameroon's leading goalkeeper and clubhouse 
lawyer, Joseph-Antoine Bell, took himself out of it for today's game, although 
he practiced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But he might have been benched anyway because he did not play well in the 2-2 
tie with Sweden and the 3-0 loss to Brazil. Thomas N'Kono, who was the team's 
regular goalkeeper in the 1990 World Cup, deserved a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the Russians' first two games, both losses, whoever is in goal for 
Cameroon does not figure to face an offensive barrage. They have scored only 
one goal. But in search of a spark, Coach Pavel Sadryin indicated Monday that 
he will put 20-year-old forward Vladimir Beschastnykh into the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Cameroon and Russia are competing for the title of Team Turmoil. 
The Russians came to the United States without four of their best players 
because of a dispute with Sadryin, and although the players who are here have 
worked at forming a tight-knit group, they have been overmatched on the field. 
The Cameroonians can advance with a victory, which should give them incentive 
to put their financial problems with their federation on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: If the Lions' speed doesn't wear down the Russians, the heat will.

WORLD CUP SOCCER '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SPAIN BEATS REMNANTS OF BOLIVIA; GROUP 
C: SOUTH AMERICANS ARE THREE SCORERS SHY OF A FULL TEAM BECAUSE OF SUSPENSIONS 
BUT STILL GET FIRST WORLD CUP GOAL EVER IN LOSING, 3-1.

<P>
 Playing three starters short and way too close to sea level, a pesky Bolivian 
team managed to give Spain fits Monday by breaking through to score its first 
goal in World Cup history. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, though, Bolivians could only look ahead to the long plane ride back up 
to La Paz, the (Two)-Mile High City. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain, chronic World Cup underachievers, took advantage of a penalty kick and 
an injured goalkeeper in a 3-1 victory before 63,089 at Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain advances to the round of 16, where it will playSwitzerland in Washington 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spaniards did not lose a game in Group C -- finishing 1-0-2 -- yet no one 
is holding a breath regarding its title chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain had Boliva surrounded with talent, but somehow managed to make the game 
closer than it deserved to be. Then, in what can only be described as an act of 
foolishness, Spain midfielder Jose Luis Perez Caminero picked up a second 
yellow card in second-half extra time after fouling defender Juan Manuel Pena 
about 50 yards away from the action. 
</P>
<P>
 Caminero? He scored two of Spain's three goals Monday but gets to hand out 
towels during his team's second-round match against the Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain Coach Javier Clemente didn't know whether to thank Caminero or punish 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me I should not have done that," Caminero said of his heart-to-heart 
with Clemente. "It was a dumb play. Obviously, I should have been more 
professional, but I did it and now I'm suspended for the Switzerland game." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sort of undisciplined act that might prove Spain's undoing. The 
Spaniards out-fouled the Bolivians, 30-8. 
</P>
<P>
 How did Spain win? In the first half, it took advantage of a questionable 
penalty call in the Bolivian goal box. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivia's Carlos Borja was cited for fouling Spain's Felipe Minambres. Asked 
later about the call, Bolivian goalkeeper Carlos Leonel Trucco's answer was 
translated into English. 
</P>
<P>
 In a family newspaper, however, it cannot be translated. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 19th minute, Josef Guardiola rammed home the penalty shot, shooting the 
ball straight into the spot vacated by Trucco. 
</P>
<P>
 Guardiola acknowledged that he miss-hit the ball. So what? Spain, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Play dragged on until midway through the second half. Spain, attacking Bolivia 
almost always from the right, blew numerous chances, the best when Caminero hit 
the right post in the 58th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Three minutes later, midfielder Juan Antonio Goikoetxea stormed in from the 
right side. Trucco came out to meet him and repelled the shot, then rolled over 
in pain. A sliding Goikoetxea had left cleat marks below Trucco's left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Limping and in obvious pain, Trucco remained in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 66th minute, Caminero received a nice pass from Sergi Barjuan, left of 
goal, and shot it past a limping Trucco, who came out to cut off the angle. 
</P>
<P>
 Trucco said later he wanted to come out but that his coach, Xavier Azkargorta, 
wanted him to "tough it out." 
</P>
<P>
 As Spain celebrated its sure victory, forgetting it had blown a 2-0 lead 
against South Korea, Bolivia launched an attack a minute later. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Erwin Sanchez, Bolivia's best player not suspended, let a shot fly 
from beyond the penalty arc, the ball deflecting off the leg of Spaniard 
Salvador Gonzalez and into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivia has participated in two previous World Cups and two matches in this 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the 67th minute Monday, it had never scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez said he had hoped to put Bolivia "on the world soccer map." 
</P>
<P>
 He settled for putting Bolivia on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly riled, a nervous Spain again turned its attention on Trucco -- still 
in the game and still limping. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 71st minute, Caminero slipped behind the Bolivian defense, took a chip 
pass from Albert Ferrer and put another goal past Trucco. 
</P>
<P>
 Caminero, grateful as he was, wondered about the Bolivian strategy: 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I do believe Trucco was hit in such a hard way that he lost some of his 
concentration and physical ability. I do believe a goalkeeper in that condition 
should be replaced." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, no lead is safe with Spain. Too little, too late, Bolivia made some 
rushes in the closing minutes. In the 78th minute, forward Jaime Moreno was 
denied when Spain goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta charged from the box and made a 
brilliant save of Moreno's blast. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bolivia was suffering a power shortage because its three top players -- 
Marco Antonio Etcheverry, Julio Baldivieso and Luis Cristaldo -- were serving 
out FIFA suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Azkargorta had strong feelings on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you think I should feel?" he asked, rhetorically. "We only had a very 
few players for the World Cup, then you lose your best three players? How would 
you feel in if you were in my shoes?" 
</P>
<P>
 So, Spain wriggles off another hook and lives to play again. Most believe it 
will not be for long.

 GROUP B at Silverdome, Pontiac, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 BRAZIL vs. SWEDEN 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN, Univision 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: Can any team stop the high-flying Brazilians? Russia and 
Cameroon couldn't, but Sweden might be able to slow them with hard-tackling 
defenders and goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, the task of marking Brazilians more often brings on nightmares. 
They entered as tournament favorites and have not disappointed in victories 
over Russia (2-0) and Cameroon (3-0). Forward Romario has led the way with two 
goals and goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel has been equal to challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 This could have been a matchup of premier forwards, but Sweden's brilliant 
Martin Dahlin, who has scored three times in two games, must sit after 
receiving a second yellow card against Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlin's scoring mate, forward Tomas Brolin, must pick up the slack, and Jonas 
Thern has proved to be an excellent set-up man in the Swedish midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: With six points, Brazil is ensured of advancement. Sweden, in solid 
position with four points, could take the group with an upset but will probably 
take a conservative approach without Dahlin. Four points probably will be 
enough to advance, and Sweden needs to protect its goal differential, plus-two. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil would prefer to win the group and take on a third-place team in Round 
Two, at Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: Expect Sweden to play back and try to keep the score down. A 
scoreless match would not disappoint the Swedes. Brazil, however, doesn't have 
much to lose and will probably come out free and easy for a 2-1 victory to 
enter the knockout round as odds-on favorite for the heavyweight title. CHRIS

 GROUP E at RFK Stadium, Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 ITALY vs. MEXICO 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 9:30 a.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN, Univision 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: The Mexicans were able to shut down Norway and Ireland, 
holding them to one goal each. But what will they do with the potent Italian 
offense? 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Campos, Mexican's goalkeeper, who is known for his brightly colored 
uniforms, can also be his team's scuff mark. Sprinting out 15 yards for a 
crossing pass might work against a slower team, but not against Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders Ramirez Perales and Claudio Suarez will probably mark the Italian 
scoring power of Roberto Baggio and Giuseppe Signori. Baggio has been a 
non-factor because of an Achilles' tendon injury, and Signori has struggled 
with only one assist. 
</P>
<P>
 The game will probably be won at midfield, where Dino Baggio has had a 
splendid tournament for the Italians, as has Mexico's Alberto Garcia Aspe. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Mexican scorer Luis Garcia and Hugo Sanchez -- if he is not benched again 
-- will challenge an Italian defense that does not have suspended goalkeeper 
Gianluca Pagliuca. Replacement Luca Marchegiani is still unproven. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian defense is also missing veteran sweeper Franco Baresi, but that's 
no loss. He might be the most overrated player in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: With all four teams in Group E tied with 1-1 records, the winner of 
this game is ensured a spot in the second round. Because Mexico has one more 
goal than the Italians -- they are equal in goal differential, the first 
tiebreaker, at zero -- it can afford to play for a tie. The Italians must win, 
if only for the safety of Coach Arrigo Sacchi when he returns home. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotion belongs to the Mexicans, who played so well in a 2-1 victory over 
Ireland that they even taunted the Irish. It is not, however, emotion that wins 
these games. It is coolness and intelligent play, both of which are possessed 
in greater amounts by the Italians. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: The game is too important for anybody to take a chance. It will be 
a 1-1 tie. The Mexicans will dance and the Italians will sweat the next two 
days. BILL PLASCHKE

 GROUP E at Giants Stadium, E. Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 IRELAND vs. NORWAY 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 1 p.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN (delayed, 9:30 p.m.), Univision (delayed, 9 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: This will be a lot like an English Premier League game. All 
but two players on the Irish roster play club soccer in England, as do nine of 
the Norwegians, so look for a lot of hard work, a lot of running, a lot of 
close defense, a lot of high passes into the penalty area and a lot of aerial 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Thorstvedt, the Norwegian goalkeeper, is familiar with the Irish players 
and has the sense, the hands and the courage to deny them. The same is true for 
Pat Bonner at the other end. 
</P>
<P>
 Norway has a slight advantage in height, forward Jan Age Fjortoft and 
midfielder Jostein Flo being particularly effective in the air. Ireland 
counters with the experience of defender Paul McGrath. Norway has a nonstop 
midfielder in Erik Mykland, but Ireland counters with a tough midfielder of its 
own in Roy Keane. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Irish Coach Jack Charlton has been banished for this game by FIFA 
because of behavior in Ireland's game against Mexico, but the Irish know what 
they have to do, which is tie at minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 John Aldridge, the Irish striker who scored a late and possibly crucial goal 
against Mexico, said Ireland will have to play as it did in its first game, a 
1-0 victory over Italy, to stand a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ireland plays to its strength, which is in harrying opponents, Norway could 
be thrown off stride. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: This game has tie written all over it because that would give each 
team four points in the group and a probable place in the next round, 
especially if Italy defeats Mexico today in Washington, D.C. Prediction: 1-1, 
but if there's a winner, it will be Norway by a goal. GRAHAME L. JONES

 The victory of the Belgian soccer team on Saturday against long-time rival and 
neighbor Holland, 1-0, reached the front page in all Belgian newspapers Monday, 
as most Belgian dailies do not offer Sunday editions. 
</P>
<P>
 This match was lauded not only for its victory, but also for the great show it 
offered onlookers.Said Michel Platini: "This match was one of the greatest 
contests I ever saw." 
</P>
<P>
 The endurance of the players all through the match, the goal of Philippe 
Albert and the incredible performance of goalkeeper Michel Preud'homme, who 
stopped no less than five shots in very tricky situations, were hugely 
appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory triggered a wave of support in Belgium, with supporters pouring 
out of cafes and public squares where giant outdoor screens had been set up. 
The Grand Place, the main square of the Belgian capital, Brussels (the theater 
of the welcome-back ceremony for the same team when it returned from the 
previous World Cup in Mexico, where it reached the semi-finals), was filled 
with people, singing and waving Belgian flags. About 20,000 Belgians are said 
to have made the trip to Orlando for the match.

 The two faces of USA 94 presented to the world this morning put a different, 
shameful complexion on the finest football showpiece of them all. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand we have Jack Charlton, a grandfather of 59, banished to a seat 
in the stand for his Irish team's group decider tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other, Diego Maradona -- a drug abuser and contract- 
</P>
<P>
 breaker -- hailed as a hero again. . . .

WORLD CUP SOCCER '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SPOTLIGHT; THE JURY IS IN FROM THE

 Under the headline: "Uncle Sam on Course to win his Stars and Stripes!" this 
was written: 
</P>
<P>
 In bars across the land, jokes about Maradona being confused with Madonna have 
been given up, exhausted and passe. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona is no stranger now.A relic to the rest of the world, in America he's 
instant big-time, and he is adoring every moment, mugging for the cameras, 
tumbling in mock anguish, joyfully resurrecting the last of his diminished but 
still compelling talent. 
</P>
<P>
 The faces of Roberto Baggio and Romario and Rai and the wild boyo Jack 
Charlton -- being likened to Bobby Knight, a fanatical chair-throwing 
basketball coach who believes, like the late (Liverpool coach) Bill Shankley, 
that winning is more important than life and death -- flash across the 
television screens. 
</P>
<P>
 It has happened. For how long, how profitably, we cannot yet know, but soccer, 
as portrayed by exotic foreigners and the good ole American boys of the U.S.A. 
team, has finally broken through this last frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 (Soccer) was, we can see clearly now, seeking not so much new business as new 
life and new blood and . . . it is not too soon to give an interim report. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict: sensational.

 La Libre Belgique praised America's soccer know-how by saying "the Americans 
had confirmed during the World Cup that they were the world's best 
competitors." 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again, by beating Colombia, they have shown they consider sports are 
more than entertainment only, and they made it their duty to behave well in an 
event when the national flag had a chance to fly high about the entire planet's 
eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, countries where soccer is considered a national sport consider 
soccer is not and will not be established in "Uncle Sam's country," it said.

 Plucky little United States of America! This gallant little nation battled 
against the odds, defied the might of Switzerland and drew; took on the 
overwhelming superiority of Colombia and, incredibly, won. But despite its 
battling defeat against Romania, this minnow of a country has almost certainly 
qualified for the round of 16; only a series of truly weird events can prevent 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 This will keep home interest in the tournament alive for another week, which 
is some kind of result. America's likely opponents? Brazil or Germany. In one 
sense, a match against the former would be a perfect result for football; if 
watching an increasingly impressive Brazil does not give this country a taste 
for footy, nothing will. But I cannot see America relishing the sight of seeing 
its team overwhelmed by Brazil and the beautiful game. Can America find the 
beauty that lies in defeat, especially in defeat by the overwhelmingly superior 
opponent?

 Gheorghe Hagi, a thespian on and off the field, wore a blank look when he was 
asked about John Harkes' charge in Sunday's game at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 " Que? " 
</P>
<P>
 The question was repeated for Hagi, who speaks Spanish, as well as a 
smattering of English. 
</P>
<P>
 "The referee decided it," Hagi said, shrugging his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, Hagi was asked about causing the yellow card by a new group of 
reporters. But the interpreter refused to translate the question. LISA DILLMAN

 The American dream wilted and all but melted in record World Cup heat (in 
Pasadena) yesterday but defiantly refused to die. 
</P>
<P>
 Team USA lost its unbeaten record to the Great Hagi's gifted Romanians, but 
still it staggered out of the caldron virtually certain to reach the last 16 of 
the finals of '94. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 An overheated, capacity crowd of more than 93,000 kept faith with America's 
new sporting heroes, urging them on to a last 10 minutes of unremitting but 
unrewarded pressure. By restricting this defeat to a single goal they surely 
took out insurance against elimination, even if third-finishing teams in other 
groups equaled their accumulation of four points.

 Translators assigned to help teams and reporters in Orlando have earned 
widespread praise, especially from reporters who have been at other venues and 
found the service wanting. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine van Loon, manager of language services in Orlando, spent four months 
training 35 people from 18 different countries to work at the five games 
scheduled for the Florida Citrus Bowl.Together, they speak 12 languages, but 
none of them is a professional translator. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went through a lot of play-acting, a lot of rehearsals," said van Loon, 
who speaks German, English and French. "It is one thing to know a language, but 
you must also know soccer terms. Many people did not. I was working 14-hour 
days to prepare for this." HELENE ELLIOTT

WIMBLEDON / MEN; TABLOID ACE AGASSI SENT PACKING BY MARTIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tabloid writers wept. Or at least looked as if they wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans stared in disbelief as his white courtesy car, led by a small army of 
London constables, squeezed through Wimbledon's main gate, turned right onto 
Church Road and disappeared quickly out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the people's choice himself looked as if he had been zapped by a stun 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Agassi, beloved hero of the Fleet Street Beasties and London's Clearasil 
generation, was gone. And with him went the questions about body hair, Brooke 
Shields, earrings, long locks and -- egad -- his position on strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there is fellow American Todd Martin, the anti-Agassi who recorded a 
6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (7-0), 4-6, 6-1 victory Monday over Britain's favorite foreigner. 
The whole thing was enough to prompt one London tabloid representative, in 
obvious mourning, to ask Martin if he felt "like the man who shot Bambi?" 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth-seeded Martin had to think a moment about that one. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my eyes," he said, "there aren't too many similarities between Andre and 
Bambi." 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes for Agassi and Martin. For starters, Agassi is headed home, 
Martin to the quarterfinals. Agassi's game isn't made for grass, Martin's loves 
it. Agassi makes big-money TV commercials, Martin watches them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some friends of mine in college called me 'Thumper,' " Martin said hopefully. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes sense. One look at Martin's big serve and you know why. He won the 
telltale Queen's Tournament the week before Wimbledon and beat Pete Sampras, 
the world's No. 1-ranked player, in so doing. Wimbledon officials thought 
enough of his game to seed him sixth, three spots above his tour ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the fortnight began, Wimbledon regulars were warning everyone 
about Martin, 23. Sure enough, Martin beat Grant Stafford in the first round, 
Patrick Kuhnen in the second, Martin Damm in the third and then Agassi, the 
Wimbledon winner in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin-mania? 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the sound of it doesn't add to the flair," Martin said. "It's nice 
to have people rooting for you, but it's also actually nice to play a match 
once in a while when the crowd is not on your side. It's exciting to be 
challenged. That happened today and win or lose, I enjoyed myself." 
</P>
<P>
 It helps when you win the first two sets, which Martin did. The margin allowed 
him to withstand the inevitable Agassi comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi blitzed Martin in the third-set tiebreaker and evened the match in the 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just looked like I was going to run away with it," Agassi said. "I felt 
confident, like I was in control. Then all of sudden he just picked up his 
level of play." 
</P>
<P>
 Picked it up and put it in Agassi's lap. Martin was up, 5-0, before Agassi 
knew what happened. Agassi won the sixth game, but then Martin got the serve 
and, well, you could almost hear the courtesy driver turn the ignition key. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Agassi did his usual shtick. He threw his sweat-stained shirt into 
the crowd, where someone clutched it as if it were the holy shroud. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin pumped his fist, but kept his shirt on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Andre and I are completely different people," he said. "We don't play 
tennis the same, we don't think the same and we just aren't the same. I'm sure 
he's very happy with that and I'm very happy with that. I'm very happy with 
just having my parents scream for me back home. Maybe I don't need 13- or 14 
year-old girls to really get excited." 
</P>
<P>
 Men's Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Pete Sampras overpowered Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic, 6-4, 
6-1, 7-6 (7-5). Sampras had 18 aces, the similarly hard-serving Vacek 14. 
Sampras stopped short of saying he was unbeatable, but then, everyone was 
saying it for him. "I think it will be very difficult to beat him, he's playing 
so well," said Sweden's Christian Bergstrom, who ended American Bryan Shelton's 
run with a 3-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 10-8 victory. "It will be a surprise if he 
doesn't win." . . . Sampras faces fellow American Michael Chang in the 
quarterfinals. The 10th-seeded Chang beat eighth-seeded Sergi Bruguera of 
Spain, 6-4, 7-6 (9-7), 6-0. . . . Fourth-seeded Goran Ivanisevic, eliminated in 
the third round last year, is back in the quarterfinals. He defeated Alexander 
Volkov of Russia, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (8-6), 4-6, 6-2. . . . Jeremy Bates was 
defeated by France's Guy Forget, 2-6, 6-1, 6-3, 6-1. All 18 singles entrants 
from Britain have been eliminated. . . . Seventh-seeded Boris Becker of Germany 
and ninth-seeded Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine were tied at 1-1 in the fifth set 
when their match was stopped because of darkness.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; EXPOS' HILL BUILDS CASE BY BEATING MADDUX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ken Hill wants to be considered among the best. Now the Montreal pitcher has 
the record to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill outpitched Greg Maddux to became the National League's first 11-game 
winner Monday night at Montreal as the Expos beat Atlanta, 7-2, to close on the 
Braves in the National League East. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be up there with the best," said Hill (11-3), who worked 7 1/3 
innings and allowed four hits and six walks and struck out three. "I've worked 
hard to get there, and I don't want to sell myself short. I want to be the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who lasted past the sixth inning for the first time in six outings, was 
locked in a 1-1 game with Maddux until the Expos scored four runs in the 
seventh. Wil Cordero hit a bases-loaded sacrifice fly, and Cliff Floyd broke 
the game open with a three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal, in second place virtually every day since April 26, moved within 1 
1/2 games of Atlanta for the first time since May 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux, the two-time Cy Young Award winner, allowed more than two runs for 
only the fifth time in his last 33 starts. He allowed five runs on nine hits 
over 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Expos' Larry Walker, sitting out his last game of a four-game suspension, 
refused to take part in pregame workouts because the Expos docked him four days 
of salary, roughly $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should I take BP if I'm not getting paid?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Kevin Malone acknowledged Walker intended to defend his 
teammates by charging Pittsburgh's Blas Minor on June 14, "but Larry actually 
let the team down." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, a right fielder who has a small rotator cuff tear, is expected to 
start at first base today. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 7, Cincinnati 6 -- Craig Biggio singled home the winning run in the 
11th inning at Houston to give the Astros a victory in a matchup of the top two 
teams in the National League Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Gonzalez had three hits and two RBIs and Jeff Bagwell hit his 24th home 
run for Houston, which led, 6-2, into the ninth inning before Eddie Taubensee 
and Hal Morris hit two-run homers off John Hudek, who had not allowed a homer 
all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 12, San Diego 7 -- Dante Bichette hit two long home runs, including a 
grand slam in the eighth inning at Denver, and the Rockies had 17 hits in all. 
</P>
<P>
 Bichette tied a club record with five RBIs, and Vinny Castilla and Eric Young 
also homered for the Rockies. Castilla, subbing for the injured Charlie Hayes 
at third base, had four hits -- also tying a club record -- and three runs 
batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego, losing consecutive games for the first time since June 15, left 15 
runners on base. 
</P>
<P>
 David Nied (7-4) improved to 4-0 lifetime against the Padres. He allowed eight 
hits and four runs in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 9, New York 8 -- A ninth-inning error by shortstop Jose Vizcaino 
allowed the winning run to score as the Cardinals, after blowing a six-run lead 
in the seventh inning, rallied to win at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mets, who scored seven runs with two outs in the seventh to take the lead, 
lost their fourth consecutive game and dropped nine games under .500. The 
Cardinals moved a game over .500 for the first time in 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 2, Pittsburgh 1 -- Sammy Sosa's shallow sacrifice fly brought home the 
winning run in the eighth inning at Chicago and helped the Cubs snap the 
Pirates' six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Sosa's pop fly was caught in short center by second baseman Carlos Garcia, 
whose momentum carried him well into the outfield, and Kevin Roberson barely 
beat the throw, which eluded catcher Lance Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
 Cub starter Willie Banks (8-6) retired 20 consecutive hitters at one point and 
got the victory. Randy Myers got the final three outs for his 16th save -- the 
200th of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Ballard (1-1) took the loss, allowing Roberson's leadoff double in the 
eighth inning. Roberson moved to third on Shawon Dunston's sacrifice bunt 
before scoring on Sosa's pop fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 5, Florida 1 -- Shawn Boskie scattered six hits in his first 
complete game in four years, and Jim Eisenreich hit a two-run triple for the 
Phillies at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Boskie (4-4) last pitched a complete game on May 20, 1990, when he was with 
the Chicago Cubs.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; HERSHISER SAYS HE'S BEARING DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It might be that Orel Hershiser is about ready to emerge from his slump. 
Hershiser, who has been hammered lately and is 0-4 in his last six starts, will 
face left-hander Bryan Hickerson in the second game of the series with the 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I've had problems lately, I have worked extra hard on my mechanics 
between starts," Hershiser said. "I may not turn around all of a sudden, but I 
think I'm heading in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants, who have suffered one disaster after another with their pitching, 
are again without their best starter, Bill Swift. Swift, who has a groin 
injury, was supposed to face Hershiser. With Swift hurting, Hickerson, who has 
been in the bullpen the last three weeks, is 2-6. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants have five players on the disabled list, three of them pitchers. 
Mark Portugal might return Saturday, but Kevin Rogers has a blood clot in his 
shoulder and Trevor Wilson, because of shoulder surgery, is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Gott, who had his appendix removed June 9 in Chicago, pitched on the 
sideline before the game. Trainer Bill Buhler said it would be more than a week 
before the relief pitcher is ready to return. DAN HAFNER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; YANKEES' KEY BECOMES FIRST 12-GAME WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even mild-mannered Jimmy Key is starting to get excited about his 11-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Key allowed six hits in eight innings Monday night and became the first 
12-game winner in the majors as the New York Yankees beat the Red Sox, 5-1, at 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Yankees' sixth consecutive victory and Boston's 10th consecutive 
home loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Key (12-1) punched the air in triumph as he walked off the field after snaring 
a one-hop smash by Mike Greenwell to start an inning-ending double play in the 
sixth. The Yankees' lead was 2-0 at the time, and Key had given up one-out 
singles by Mo Vaughn and Andre Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually don't show a lot of emotion, but I thought that was the play of the 
game," Key said. "Mike hits me well. I was just happy I made a good pitch and 
made a good play." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwell's shot was headed up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hit the ball hard, but we hit it at people," Greenwell said. "With a guy 
like Key, he never lets you get in a comfort zone. He never throws you the same 
sequence." 
</P>
<P>
 Key hasn't lost since his second start of the season, a 5-2 defeat by Detroit 
on April 9. He has five of the Yankees' 12 victories in June, and his 11-game 
winning streak is the longest in a season by a Yankee pitcher since Ron Guidry 
won 12 in a row in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had a streak like this where everything falls for me," Key said. 
"Whether I pitch good or bad, I find a way to win and the team finds a way to 
win for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Wickman pitched a perfect ninth inning to preserve the win. Wickman had an 
11-game winning streak for the Yankees that began in 1992 and lasted into 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox matched their second-longest skid at Fenway Park. Boston also lost 
10 in a row at home in 1927, and had a 14-game losing streak at Fenway in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Sele (6-4) allowed four runs on eight hits in 6 2/3 innings for Boston. 
He matched his season-high of nine strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 5, Toronto 1 -- Cal Eldred pitched a six-hitter at Milwaukee for his 
third consecutive complete game and the Brewers handed the Blue Jays their 
ninth consecutive loss. The Blue Jays' skid is their longest since they lost 12 
in a row in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Eldred (9-7), who had three-hitters in his last two starts, has five of the 
Brewers' seven complete games. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 7, Cleveland 6 -- Jeff Tackett, a .215 lifetime batter, led off the 
eighth inning at Cleveland with his first home run in two years and the Orioles 
handed the Indians their third loss in a row after an 18-game home winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Baines hit his 12th home run for Baltimore, which led, 6-1, until the 
Indians scored four runs in the fifth and one in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Bolton (1-1) yielded one run and four hits in 2 2/3 innings to get the 
victory in relief of Ben McDonald, and Lee Smith struck out three in the ninth 
to earn his major league-leading 26th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 2, Minnesota 1 -- Tom Gordon pitched five-hit ball for 7 1/3 
innings at Minneapolis and the Royals scored two unearned runs in the fifth 
inning. Gordon (8-4) matched his season-high with eight strikeouts in winning 
for the fifth time in six decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 11, Seattle 1 -- Tim Belcher allowed two hits in eight innings at 
Seattle and Mickey Tettleton hit a grand slam and drove in five runs as the 
Tigers ended a four-game losing streak and sent the Mariners to their fifth 
loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Belcher (6-8) had a perfect game until second baseman Chris Gomez failed to 
catch a high pop fly in the sixth inning.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; CAREW CALLS TO CONGRATULATE PUCKETT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hitting instructor Rod Carew called Kirby Puckett Sunday night to congratulate 
him after the Minnesota outfielder broke Carew's all-time Twin record for hits. 
Puckett hit a two-run homer in the first inning Sunday and got two more hits to 
total 2,088. Carew had 2,085. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what records are for, for someone to surpass them," Carew said. 
"Certainly, Kirby is deserving. He's put together some pretty good years. I 
told him I'd be calling again when he gets No. 3,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Carew knows he will never be forgotten by the fans of Minneapolis and that 
makes it easy to be charitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go back and people recognize me from my playing days and they're always 
nice," he said. "I played there 12 years and I made a lot of friends. I love 
the atmosphere. It's not too big of a city with too hectic of a pace. It's a 
place you can live. I could see myself going back there some day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Greg Myers, who suffered a bruised left knee Sunday when a foul off 
the bat of Texas' Rusty Greer hit him in an unprotected spot between pads, was 
not in the starting lineup Monday night, but Manager Marcel Lachemann said he 
probably would have given him the night off anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hit me right on the spot where I had the surgery," said Myers, who sat out 
two months after suffering torn cartilage in a plate collision with Boston's 
Mike Greenwell April 23. "It got me pretty good, but I didn't think it would 
have any affect on the surgery. I can play. I can deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chili Davis was a late scratch from Monday's lineup because of tenderness in 
his groin. He suffered the injury scoring from second base in the fourth inning 
Sunday against Texas. Bo Jackson, who replaced him at designated hitter, struck 
out in each of his first three at-bats, every time with a runner in scoring 
position. . . . Right-hander John Dopson underwent an MRI on Monday and was 
diagnosed as having a strained right shoulder. He will be re- evaluated in two 
weeks. . . . Eduardo Perez, in triple-A Vancouver to refine his defensive 
skills at third base, will be sidelined for five or six days after re-injuring 
his left thumb. He originally was hurt diving for a ball and aggravated the 
injury on a check swing Friday night. Perez will go to the Angels' facility in 
Mesa, Ariz., for rehabilitation before rejoining the Canadians. JOHN WEYLER

STABILIZING DOLLAR HELPS STOCKS; DOW GAINS 48.56; MARKETS: TRADERS ALSO RESPOND 
TO A DROP IN COMMODITY PRICES AND INTEREST RATES. BUT SOME ANALYSTS SEE A 
'FLASH RALLY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blue-chip stocks closed sharply higher Monday while bond yields fell, sparked 
by a stabilization in the dollar and by falling commodity prices and interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 48.56 points to 3,685.50, partially 
offsetting last week's declines. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts suggested that the rebound could be short-lived. They cited 
among bearish factors the possibility that the Federal Reserve will hike 
short-term interest rates again in an effort to make the dollar more 
attractive. They also suggested that Monday's rally was merely a reaction to a 
temporarily oversold market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a flash rally," said Douglas Kass, director of institutional equities at 
JW Charles Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 As the stock market opened, the Dow dropped about 25 points in response to the 
dollar's slide in Tokyo to its first close below 100 Japanese yen since World 
War II. Last week, the Dow industrials fell about 140 points over the five 
trading days amid concern that a weak dollar could bring inflation and higher 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But share prices recovered Monday, inching into positive territory and then 
moving sharply higher as first commodity prices fell, bond prices reversed 
course, then the dollar recovered from its lows against the yen and the German 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said relative stability in the dollar encouraged investors to buy 
stocks. Last week, fears that a dollar rescue effort by the Fed might include 
another rise in interest rates drove the stock market sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, investors began to recognize that the dollar's plight might not be as 
serious as initially believed, said Alfred Goldman, director of technical 
market analysis, with A.G. Edwards & Sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stock market has been hammered by major media hype about the dollar," 
Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A weak dollar makes imports more expensive, and that can signal inflation. In 
addition, there is the concern that foreign investors will sell out of U.S. 
markets in search of better returns elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, falling commodity prices helped reinforce the sentiment that 
inflation is not presently an issue, analysts said. Commodities are often 
considered hedges against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knight Ridder Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 futures contracts 
fell 2.21 to 227.77, largely on the heels of losses in grains and precious 
metals. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold fell $6.40 an ounce to $384.70 on the New York Comex. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop in the CRB, considered by some an inflation barometer, touched off a 
retreat in Treasury bond yields, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields, which rose in early trading, reversed course later in the day, 
pushing up bond prices, which move in the opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The bellwether 30-year bond's yield fell to 7.45% from 7.52% on Friday, while 
its price rose 23/32 point, or $7.19 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline in the long-bond's yield was the first in three trading sessions. 
But market players cautioned that trading was light and that the recent 
bearishness among bond investors was far from over. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, investors were in the market shopping for stocks hammered last 
week, analysts said. Among the most sought-after were the technology issues and 
those of companies whose fate is closely tied to the economic cycles, such as 
autos and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock traders concentrated on large capitalization companies, including auto 
makers and other economically sensitive cyclical stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The recently battered Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller company issues 
jumped 8.89 points to 702.68. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in the broader market, advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners 
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 250.11 million shares changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks 
rose 4.51 to 447.31, while the NYSE's composite index rose 1.90 to 246.45. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights on Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Microsoft led the Nasdaq most-active list, up 2 3/8 to 51 7/8, followed by 
Oracle Systems, up 1 1/8 to 37 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks helped fuel the market's upturn. General Motors climbed 1 5/8 to 
52 1/4, Ford jumped 2 to 58 3/4 and Chrysler gained 1 1/8 to 47 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kemper slipped 1/4 to 61 1/8 and Conseco fell 5/8 to 48 5/8 after the two 
signed a merger pact under which Kemper shareholders will receive $67 a share 
in cash and Conseco stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Walt Disney rose 1 1/8 to 43 1/8. Alex. Brown & Sons upgraded the stock to 
strong buy from buy, citing the strength of its new "The Lion King" movie. 
</P>
<P>
 * Carter-Wallace Inc. fell 7/8 to 16 1/2. The company complied with a 1993 
government order to stop selling its Organidin drug for lung ailments following 
studies that suggest the medicine causes cancer in rats. 
</P>
<P>
 * Somatogen Inc. surged 2 3/4 to 9 1/2. Eli Lilly & Co. plans to manufacture 
Somatogen's recombinant DNA-produced blood substitute under a joint venture 
agreement. Lilly rose 3/4 to 57 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index ended with a gain of 51.92 points at 2,239.19.

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; JIMMIE DALE GILMORE CONVERTS THE FORTUNATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This was weird: Here Texas singer-songwriter Jimmie Dale Gilmore is one of the 
most respected, critically lauded and decidedly individualistic performers in 
country music today, and the Taste of Orange County folks perhaps didn't quite 
know who he was. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than put Gilmore on the main stage at night, when thousands more would 
have been in attendance, they stuck him on the small Miller Draft stage in 
front of 170 or so people sweltering in Sunday's blazing afternoon heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it is something of a disservice to categorize Gilmore's rich and varied 
music, it could be called Country and Eastern. Gilmore resided for a time at a 
Hindu ashram, and, though his style reaches back in tradition to Jimmie 
Rodgers, Gilmore's own lyrics and choice of cover songs run toward the 
contemplative and enigmatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the sort of stuff you want to preface, as Taste of Orange County did, 
with an hour's worth of line-dance lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The band's just about ready," the dance instructor announced at one point. 
"C'mon, let's do a tush-pusher ! . . . OK, you grind it, you grind it! . . . 
You take it right . . . left toe! Heel! Heel!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then Gilmore came out with his drum-less, acoustic music and unique high, 
reedy, quavery voice, opening with a moody bit of metaphysical longing as he 
sang: "My love she could never see / That this world's just not real to me / So 
tonight I think I'm gonna go downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 And, you know? It worked. Though it seemed clear that at least half the 
audience was new to his music and primed for some generic tush-pushin' fare, 
Gilmore managed to captivate them, earning two standing ovations. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage was set up at the Irvine Spectrum intersection of Fortune and 
Pacifica streets, and there seemed a serendipity to Gilmore performing under a 
sign that said Fortune. With his high-cheeked, angular face and long lank hair 
the color of a silver Crayola, he looks very much the Southwest mystic. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time he's just plain folk: The concerns in his songs aren't so 
exotic but, rather, the sort of searching questions and reflections that likely 
crop up in all lives, except for the vapid boot-scootin' ones you hear about on 
country radio. 
</P>
<P>
 As the older covers in his set -- from the Rodgers-era "Deep Ellum Blues" to 
Johnny Cash's '50s "I Still Miss Someone" -- attested, depth and doubt are not 
unknown to the country idiom. And those artful qualities certainly don't 
diminish from its ability to serve as entertainment too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore was empathetically accompanied by bassist Lorne Rall and guitarist 
Chris Gage, who further colored some of the songs with mandolin or lap steel 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio rolled out most of the songs like a slow river, but they did achieve 
a posterior propelling rhythm on some numbers, including the '30s-era "Mobile 
Line," Elmore James' "Goodbye Baby" and Gilmore's own instant classic "Dallas," 
a song best known by its Joe Ely rendition in 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early '70s, Ely, Gilmore and songwriter Butch Hancock had a 
now-legendary band called the Flatlanders. Gilmore continues to record 
Hancock's songs, and one of the high points of Sunday's show was "Just a Wave." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a song ideally suited to Gilmore, with a Zen-meets-quantum-physics 
sensibility in its put-down:  
</P>
<P>
 I said I've been your raging river, precious African queen  
</P>
<P>
 I've shown you everything that I've ever seen  
</P>
<P>
 But she knew more than I had taught her  
</P>
<P>
 When she said, babe, you're just a wave, you're not the water. Gilmore offered 
another fine river song in his own "Another Colorado." He also paired two songs 
about midnight, "Rambling Man" and Lucinda Williams' "Howling at Midnight," not 
to leave out the "midnight train" in his stunning version of Hank Williams' 
"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other standouts were his own Spanish-flavored "Chase the Wind" and the encore 
tune, Townes Van Zandt's "Buckskin Stallion Blues," a song he recently recorded 
with Seattle grunge band Mudhoney. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore prefaced the song by announcing how delighted he had been to be a 
Grammy nominee in the contemporary folk category earlier this year. He was glad 
he didn't win, he said, because "Grammy nominee" rolls off the tongue so well. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he's generally regarded as a country artist, he was also pleased to 
have been relegated to the backwater contemporary folk listing. He suggested 
it's actually the biggest category of all, saying, "I figured out 'contemporary 
folk' means all of us, doesn't it?"

A MISS-LEADING ASSUMPTION; DESPITE GENDER GROUPING, BANKAMERICA'S 'RECENT 
PRINTS BY WOMEN ARTISTS' FEATURES PLEASANT WORKS NOT OFTEN SEEN LOCALLY. 
</P>

 "Recent Prints by Women Artists"? How about "Recent Prints by Left-Handed 
Artists"? Or "Recent Prints by Artists Living in States Beginning With an 'N' 
"? 
</P>
<P>
 Unless a curator has some point to make about the imagery or techniques that 
certain female artists may have in common, grouping work by the artists' gender 
is a lazy, ridiculously arbitrary tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawn from BankAmerica's huge art collection, "Recent Prints by Women Artists" 
is at the BankAmerica Gallery in Costa Mesa through July 29. Though the bank 
mounted a show called "5 Guys" last year, at least the male artists shared a 
similar outlook and background, while the eight female artists have little in 
common. 
</P>
<P>
 But this summer promises to be about as slow as they come, and a few of the 
artists (Vija Celmins, Sylvia Plimack Mangold, Susan Rothenberg and Elizabeth 
Murray) are favorites of mine whose work is not often seen in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Celmins, the subject of a memorable retrospective exhibition at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art in Los Angeles last winter, has been making exceptional 
drawings of seemingly banal things for more than two decades. Her prints retain 
the same exquisite control and the same double fascination with nature and the 
act of looking. Her resolutely neutral rendering presents space as 
simultaneously vast and microscopically detailed, crowded and empty. 
</P>
<P>
 In her lithograph "Untitled (Desert Landscape)," the harsh clarity of 
countless small stones illuminated by strong sunlight are at once 
breathtakingly literal and peculiarly abstract. At first glance virtually 
photographic (as befits an image copied -- as is Celmins' practice -- from a 
photograph), the landscape also reads as an all-over pattern of irregular marks 
on paper. Although Celmins never lets you lose sight of the activity of 
drawing, her work magically keeps luring you back to its illusory depths. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Alliance," she availed herself of the rich tonal possibilities of 
mezzotint and aquatint in combination with the velvety line of drypoint. The 
two-part print juxtaposes a workmanlike sketch of a sailing ship with a patch 
of night sky blurry with stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast "nowhere" quality of the sky (and of the unseen ocean that the ship 
will ply) contrasts with the notion of stars as fixed points of guidance for 
the navigator. More fancifully, the multitude of lines representing the ship's 
rigging have an unseen parallel in the constellations of the night sky 
(commonly drawn with lines linking the stars). 
</P>
<P>
 Mangold also works with recognizable imagery, sometimes drawn from the natural 
world. But she, too, invests her ostensible subject matter with a special 
attention to the nature of space and of seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Nut Trees" -- a trio of aquatints all made in October, 1985 -- two bare 
trees with twisted branches are rendered with extreme linear delicacy against 
skies that shift from pink to pale apricot to a lazy swath of blue. Although 
the trees appear to be the same in each print, their branches vary in position 
and shape. 
</P>
<P>
 The disparities between these images are entirely arbitrary; they can't be 
explained away by gusts of wind or shifts of the viewer's position. Mangold 
constantly reminds the viewer of the fictive nature of the work of art, its 
dependence on pictorial formulas and personal interpretation as much as real 
objects and events. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg takes yet another tack with imagery, whittling down her 
vulnerable-seeming figures into ultra-simple shapes charged with a gestural 
urgency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After working in a purely abstract mode, she burst onto the scene in the 
mid-'70s with rudimentary yet iconic images of horses. ("Horses really don't 
mean anything special to me," she once maddeningly informed an interviewer. "I 
rode them at camp, but that's about it.") 
</P>
<P>
 In Rothenberg's lithograph, "Four Rays Horse," a horse's head is shielded by 
two pairs of slanting lines forming a rough lean-to. Whether this structure is 
meant to be understood literally or as a sort of all-encompassing mood or 
spiritual radiance -- or merely as a visual motif to keep the head "anchored" 
on the flat space of the paper -- is left to the viewer's determination. 
</P>
<P>
 Other figures have also entered Rothenberg's spare universe, giving the 
glancing sexual suggestiveness of her earlier work a sharper flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lithograph "Untitled (Hartford)," a broad-shouldered silhouette with 
one skinny leg fits within a dark, curving enclosure -- a cave-like landscape 
that suggests a woman's private parts. An etching, "Girl/Boy," consists of a 
fetishistic, bone-shaped female figure fitting her upright body into the 
contours of her supine partner; in cartoon fashion, sexual differences are 
delineated only by hairstyle and lip contours. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's buoyant abstractions owe a lot to the swirling immediacy of 
comic-book imagery. Her paintings are often executed on a massive scale that 
lends piquancy to the stray recognizable object from daily life embedded among 
the curving, brightly colored shapes. Her prints are smaller and tend to zero 
in on the workings of a specific visual idea. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Sniff," a lithograph from 1984, an abstracted tall blue creature kneels 
like a cartoon bunny and pokes a curving appendage into a small, egg-shaped 
creature with two ears. The silliness of the gesture, at once intimate, 
intrusive and awkward, is vintage Murray -- as are the generously scaled 
repeated curving shapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisa Chase's landscape woodcuts are filled with simplified, repetitive 
imagery: jagged chunks of earth ("Chasm"), stacks of curlicues representing 
gusts of wind ("Squall") and large, scalloped clouds ("Dawn"). The simple 
appeal of her work comes from its embracing, almost folkloric vision and its 
childlike mixture of literal and fanciful elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Bartlett and Pat Steir were enormously prominent during the '80s, for 
reasons that largely eluded me. (Bartlett's career took off after the 
publication of an extremely positive review from former New York Times chief 
critic John Russell about a decade ago.) 
</P>
<P>
 With a predilection for huge, modular pieces and thin, obvious imagery, 
Bartlett seemed about as full of hot air as some of her male counterparts. A 
woodcut called "Graceland -- State I" shares this banal outlook; at least it 
has only five parts. At her best, in "At Sea, Japan," Bartlett creates a 
decorative effect in an evocation of underwater life as small lozenges and jabs 
of color embedded in transparent veils of color. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Steir's large print "The Tree, After Hiroshige" is a delicate, 
quasi-abstract evocation of tree limbs, sky and the rhythms of the wind. 
(Hiroshige was a major Japanese 19th-Century woodblock print artist, famous for 
his ability to capture intimate views of nature in delicate color harmonies.) 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the other, younger artists in the show, who mostly came of age in the 
1960s -- the "cool" era of Pop and Minimalist art -- Helen Frankenthaler is 
firmly linked with the second-generation Abstract Expressionists. She is known 
for the atmospheric "stain" paintings she began making in the early '50s, in 
which atmospheric washes of color soak into the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also an accomplished printmaker, Frankenthaler studied Japanese woodblock 
prints at the source. According to notes provided by the gallery, she made 
"Cedar Hill" in Kyoto in 1983. A pale wash of blue barely veiling the insistent 
vertical grain of the paper is interrupted by horizontal areas of various 
colors that resemble aborted spills of liquid -- or an abstracted view of an 
autumnal landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleasant as it is to see most of these works, the show would have been more 
valid had the artists not been ghettoized by gender. At least we can be 
grateful that the exhibition was not organized by type of print medium, one of 
the deadlier forms of curatorial diktat , in which attention to the "trees" of 
technique tends to obscure the much more vital "forest" of contemporary ideas 
about art and life. 
</P>

COURT OKS TRIAL OVER LAPD USE OF POLICE DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Clarita Valley man who was mauled by a Los Angeles police dog is 
entitled to a trial on whether the LAPD's policy governing the use of canines 
to seize fleeing or hiding suspects is unconstitutional, a federal appeals 
court in San Francisco ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 2-1 decision, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the order of 
a Los Angeles trial judge who ruled that the LAPD's policy governing use of 
dogs was constitutional and that there was no need for a jury trial on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that nearly six years after Thane Carl Chew was captured by an LAPD 
dog named Volker, he will get a jury trial on whether police use of the dog 
constituted excessive force under the 4th Amendment to the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges were sharply divided on the potential impact that the decision 
might have on police departments and their ability to use dogs. The divisions 
are emblematic of the debate over the severity of crime in the nation and what 
measures must be used to combat it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of fear of lawsuits and liability, this decision may be fatal to 
canine units, and by their demise, the ability of police to combat criminals 
will be seriously hampered," according to a dissent by Judge Stephen S. Trott. 
</P>
<P>
 Trott, a former Los Angeles prosecutor, accused the majority of sending police 
officers "to the jaws of danger," by restricting the ways in which police dogs 
can be used. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judge William A. Norris, one of two in the majority, criticized Trott for 
"inflammatory rhetoric" and his "doomsday prediction" that the decision "will 
prevent the use of all police dogs in all instances." His colleague, Judge 
Stephen Reinhardt, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge Trott grossly mischaracterizes today's holdings with respect to the use 
of excessive force," wrote Reinhardt, former president of the Los Angeles 
Police Commission. "We do not send police dogs to the sidelines. We reverse a 
summary judgment order, so that there may be a full and fair factual trial 
before a jury of 'the People' regarding the practices followed" by the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 All the judges agreed that the case posed fundamental questions about the 4th 
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits illegal searches and 
seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 The case arose out of a 1988 incident when an LAPD officer stopped Chew, now 
31, for a traffic violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Chew, who had three outstanding felony warrants, fled on foot and hid in a 
nearby Pacoima scrap yard. A police perimeter was set up around the scrap yard, 
and helicopter and canine units were called in.  
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Officer Daniel Bunch unleashed a police dog who found Chew crouching 
between two dumpsters. Chew then attempted to surrender and yelled to the 
officer to call off the dog, according to the majority opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the officer did not immediately intercede and the dog bit Chew several 
times, resulting in severe cuts to his left side and forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Chew asserted that he did not offer resistance at any time after he spotted 
the dog and repeatedly begged the officer to restrain his dog, but that Bunch 
instead ordered Volker to attack. Bunch denied that he ordered an attack and 
maintained that when he first saw Chew, the suspect was hitting the dog with a 
pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunch admitted kicking at Chew in an attempt to disarm him and to protect the 
dog. Bunch also acknowledged that he may have kicked Chew in the head, face or 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 After Chew was arrested, he pleaded guilty to receiving stolen property and 
served two years in jail, according to attorney George Denny III. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, Chew sued Officer Bunch, other LAPD personnel, including 
then-Chief Daryl F. Gates, and the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Chew claimed that Bunch violated his right not to be subject to excessive 
force by unreasonably unleashing the dog, which was trained to search and bite. 
He also asserted that Bunch's action was caused by a city policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Chew claimed that regardless of whether Bunch acted reasonably in 
unleashing the dog, the city's policy of training police dogs such as Volker, a 
German shepherd, to apprehend unarmed and non-resistant suspects by biting, 
mauling and seizing them was itself unreasonable and unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Richard Gadbois granted summary judgment in favor of the 
individual defendants other than Bunch on the groundsthat as public officials 
they had immunity. He also granted summary judgment for the city on the grounds 
that Chew failed to demonstrate that a city policy unlawfully caused his 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A federal jury awarded Chew $13,000 against Bunch, but did not specify the 
reasons for its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Chew appealed Gadbois' decision to grant a summary judgment to the other 
defendants, leading to Monday's decision. A summary judgment means that a judge 
has decided that there is no issue worthy of a jury's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges Reinhardt and Norris disagreed with Gadbois, saying there is plenty for 
a jury to consider, including the basic question of whether excessive force was 
used and whether the city's dog policy violated the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Volker bit Chew three times before achieving "an effective hold" on him and 
dragged him between four and 10 feet, the majority opinion noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bunch had good reason to expect that Chew might sustain exactly this type of 
mauling when he released Volker" because of the type of training the dog had 
received, Reinhardt wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinhardt also stressed that the city conceded at trial "the truth of Chew's 
contention that departmental policy authorized seizure of all concealed 
suspects -- resistant or non-resistant, armed or unarmed, violent or nonviolent 
-- by dogs trained to bite hard and hold." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Mary House said she could not comment because she had not 
received the decision yet. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco attorney Ralph Leardo, who argued for the plaintiff on appeal, 
said Monday's decision is quite significant. "This case will have broad 
application because the use of dogs is so prevalent in police work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police departments have not sufficiently taken into account the severity of 
the injuries that are likely to result when these dogs are used," Leardo said.

AN OASIS OF THE PAST; NEIGHBORHOOD: THE UPLIFTERS CLUB BUILT A PACIFIC 
PALISADES GETAWAY FOR ITS FUN-LOVING, INFLUENTIAL MEMBERS. EVEN TODAY, THE 
BAND'S WHIMSICAL LEGACY IS FELT AT THE RANCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It began with Harry Haldeman, a big, jovial Chicagoan with a passion for Cuban 
cigars, hard liquor and good times. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1913, the grandfather of Watergate figure H.R. (Bob) Haldeman became the 
driving force behind an influential band of revelers known as the Uplifters 
Club. Its members bought part of a canyon in Pacific Palisades, christened it 
Uplifters Ranch and built secluded getaways around an elaborate clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half a century after the exclusive men's club was dissolved, its legacy 
is a dreamscape, an odd assortment of three dozen fanciful cottages and lodges 
tucked in a remote canyon near Will Rogers State Historic Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Like sentinels of an earlier age, they are both whimsical and mysterious. A 
few have huge ballrooms. Some are log cabins hauled in from the set of an early 
silent film. Others sport fanciful card parlors and Prohibition-era "basement 
bars." 
</P>
<P>
 Serene, almost magical, the ranch is said to be the last place in town where 
one can find a creek that hasn't been filled, lined with concrete or funneled 
into drainage pipes. Rarer still is a small grove of 70-year-old redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no other place quite like it," says Robert Winter, an architectural 
historian who views the ranch as an oasis in a metropolis quick to demolish its 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 In a corner of Rustic Canyon below where Sunset Boulevard slices past the 
former estate of Will Rogers, the ranch is a lush, almost rural, residential 
sanctuary washed by spring fogs and cool ocean breezes. 
</P>
<P>
 Its centerpiece, the former clubhouse, with its shaded, plaza-like grounds, 
has been a park since 1953 when a wealthy socialite bought it from a Greek 
shipping tycoon and donated it to the city. The tycoon, who had bought the 
clubhouse from the Uplifters, had tried to operate a private racquet club there 
after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The war, growing debts and shifting social attitudes led to the club's demise 
in 1947, closing the book on a playground of the privileged, where the right 
crowd could play polo with Walt Disney and Daryl F. Zanuck or swap yarns with 
Harold Lloyd and Busby Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the ranch remains a haven for writers, actors and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldous Huxley lived and wrote there for a time. Earl Warren spent his summers 
there. At different times, Meryl Streep and Wilt Chamberlain rented the same 
shingled cottage. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the Uplifter descendants, whose dwindling presence has helped 
to preserve the peculiar spirit of the place -- offbeat, intellectual, a bit 
arty. 
</P>
<P>
 They are living links to a generation of flamboyant movers and shakers who, on 
the political side, were usually conservative to the core. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the reaction of one of the (Uplifters') wives in '32 when FDR 
defeated Hoover," recalls 82-year-old Susan French, the daughter of an 
Uplifter. "She just sighed and said, 'Well, maybe someone will shoot him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An offshoot of the Los Angeles Athletic Club, formed in 1880 by businessmen 
and professionals, the Uplifters owed their existence to the gregarious 
Haldeman. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of a plumbing supply company, he came to Los Angeles via San 
Francisco, where some of his friends belonged to the all-male Bohemian Club, 
with its Russian River retreat known for sometimes funky behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The two dozen or so kindred spirits Haldeman recruited from the athletic club 
were drawn from the ranks of the rich, the powerful and the notable: Marco 
Hellman, who owned a string of banks; Sim W. Crabill, an executive of the Times 
Mirror Co., which publishes the Los Angeles Times; Ralph Hamlin, a bicycle 
manufacturer, who was reputed to have owned the first motorcycle west of the 
Rockies; Ernest R. Ball, who joined the group later, author of the tune "When 
Irish Eyes Are Smiling" -- although he had never seen Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 For a name, they turned to L. Frank Baum, author of the Oz books, who is said 
to have pounded back a few before coming up with "The Lofty and Exalted Order 
of Uplifters." 
</P>
<P>
 Its creed: "To uplift art and promote good fellowship." 
</P>
<P>
 But without Prohibition, the ranch might never have existed. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, the Uplifters had held an annual bash, called Hijinx, at 
such spots as Lake Arrowhead and Del Mar. Away from wives and children, they 
drank, cavorted, staged ribald plays and engaged in outdoor sports. 
</P>
<P>
 After the federal ban on booze took effect in 1919, however, they established 
a retreat in Rustic Canyon, below where future member Will Rogers would soon 
buy a sprawling estate. The group bought 120 acres and built a Spanish 
Colonial-style clubhouse with tennis courts, a swimming pool, trapshooting 
range, amphitheater and dormitories. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1922, members began to build weekend and summer getaway cottages and lodges 
on land leased from the club. A club edict specified that they remain rustic 
and be painted either brown, green or gray. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the homes reflect the Uplifters' determination not to let Prohibition 
spoil their fun. 
</P>
<P>
 One, on Latimer Road, has a German beer hall downstairs, complete with kegs 
built into the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Another house, razed in the '50s, had a bar hidden behind a push-button door. 
Angela Lansbury, who once lived there, is said to have used it as a projection 
booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Rare is the neighborhood veteran who hasn't turned up a stash of Uplifter 
liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 Character actor Lloyd Bochner found a dozen bottles of champagne inside a wall 
of his Haldeman Road bungalow while remodeling in the '60s. "The corks had 
dried out considerably," he said. "It tasted like fine old sherry." 
</P>
<P>
 Tipping the bottle at the ranch was never really a problem during Prohibition, 
explained David Brunson, 72, whose father and uncle were Uplifters, "because, 
more likely than not, the leading lights among local law enforcement were part 
of the merrymaking." 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch, said Randy Young, an amateur historian who has co-authored a book 
about Rustic Canyon and the Uplifters, "was meant to be a kind of Utopia." 
</P>
<P>
 It still is. 
</P>
<P>
 Latimer and Haldeman roads -- the principal streets -- are narrow, shady lanes 
with no curbs and only a few street lights, much as they were during the 
Uplifter era. 
</P>
<P>
 The place is so concealed that even police and emergency vehicles have had 
trouble finding it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget the day the man died of a heart attack on the tennis 
court," recalls Wayne Graves, the retired director of the city recreation 
center that occupies the former clubhouse. "You could hear the ambulance going 
up one street after another trying to find us." 
</P>
<P>
 But the isolation is part of its charm. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are fiercely protective of this place for good reason," says Dale 
Norman, a resident of Latimer Road for 24 years. "We love it here." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, neighbors turned back a local government plan to enclose part of 
the creek with concrete. A few years ago, they rose up to prevent movie 
producer Steven Tisch from expanding his property, despite an Uplifter-era 
easement. 
</P>
<P>
 During Watergate, there was a brief push to rename Haldeman Road. Others don't 
like the speed bumps on Latimer Road. The bumps were a '60s response to Rusty 
Hamer, who played Danny Thomas' son on the TV show "Make Room for Daddy," and 
who as a teen-ager liked to lay rubber in his souped-up car. 
</P>
<P>
 The cottages are a blend of the fanciful and the curious. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a fairy-tale bungalow built by early cinematographer Charles Rosher 
that has a room said to have been designed for his lover, actress Anna May 
Wong. 
</P>
<P>
 Hellman, the banker, brought in three log cabins from the set of the 1923 film 
"The Courtship of Miles Standish." One of them, at 38 Haldeman Road, was the 
summer retreat of Earl Warren, former governor and Supreme Court justice, 
during the late '40s and early '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cabins were brought in from Lake Arrowhead and reassembled using code 
numbers you can still see on some of the logs," says Dorothy Cheney, who has 
lived in one for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors still talk about the house on Latimer whose only inhabitant for 
almost two decades was a mannequin named Maude, left behind by good-humored, if 
not eccentric, owners who, after buying the place, moved away and rarely saw 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 A real estate broker who unlocked it in the early '60s found the dust-covered 
Maude on a sofa. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Frank McCoy, a '20s diet king whose nonalcoholic health regimen was 
popular with movie stars, built a hillside lodge at 35 Haldeman Road. It is 
unusual for its circular card room and the 128 steps that lead from the street 
to the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bedroom of the McCoys' (teen-age) daughter is said to have been furnished 
with Rudolph Valentino's former bed," says Francie Allen, who lives there with 
her husband. Allen, an animation artist, uses the room as a studio. 
</P>
<P>
 The house where Emil Ludwig and, later, Aldous Huxley, once lived, was torn 
down in the '50s, and the home of the late Hal Roach has been remodeled beyond 
recognition.

</P>
<P>
 But memories live on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the best place you can imagine for a boy growing up," recalls Ernie 
Ball, 63, a San Luis Obispo guitar string manufacturer. His family moved to the 
ranch during the Depression after the death of his Uplifter grandfather, who 
owned the house at 49 Haldeman Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his pals were the sons of Agnes Christine Johnstone Dazey, who wrote the 
Andy Hardy series. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys played at the stables, flew kites on the polo field, patrolled the 
creek. And in the afternoons they lolled around the clubhouse pool, where 
Johnny Weismuller, a.k.a. Tarzan -- who lived across the street at 2 Latimer -- 
often swam. 
</P>
<P>
 The clubhouse, with its grand ballroom, drinking halls and "library" -- 
actually a poker parlor -- was a year-round adult sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, however, at age 9, Ball received an urgent call from his father to come 
there right away. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering a room filled with men, Ball found his father talking to a cherubic 
figure seated on a stool. "He said to me, 'Son, I want you to meet Babe Ruth.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 French, an actress-artist, has similar memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Lloyd Moultrie, was a lawyer whose clients included many of 
Hollywood's early stars. Some were regular visitors to the family's distinctive 
English-style cottage at 44 Haldeman Road. The first movie she ever saw, a 
silent version of "The Wizard of Oz," was projected against a bedsheet in L. 
Frank Baum's garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't have been more than 3, because I remember toddling up to the 
screen and trying to grab the little dog, Toto," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After living in New York for many years, she returned to the ranch in the 
early '50s, and now lives a few doors away from her childhood home. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something about the place that makes you not want to leave," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 George Rice III would agree. 
</P>
<P>
 The son and nephew of original Uplifters, he has lived in the same Latimer 
Road bungalow for 54 years. 
</P>
<P>
 An octogenarian who prefers not to reveal his exact age, among canyon 
residents he is considered to be the last living Uplifter, having joined not 
long before the club's demise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't meant to be perpetuated forever," he said. "We simply enjoyed each 
other's company."

ANTONOVICH TRIES TO BEAT EDELMAN TO HEAD MTA; POLITICS: WHOEVER CHAIRS TRANSIT 
AGENCY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL ITS AGENDA. ROUTE OF EAST-WEST RAIL LINE IN THE 
VALLEY IS SEEN AS BEING AT STAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich is trying to gain control of the 
county's most powerful transit agency by muscling aside another San Fernando 
Valley supervisor who was in line for the post. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever becomes the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- 
Antonovich or Supervisor Ed Edelman -- will be in a position to control the 
agency's agenda for the next year, including debate over the design and route 
of a proposed east-west rail line in the San Fernando Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 The normal rotation procedure between city and county governments calls for 
Edelman to automatically succeed Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre 
as head of the 14-month-old transportation agency on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 But with Alatorre's backing, Antonovich is attempting to put the matter to a 
vote by the 13-member MTA board on Wednesday, Antonovich's office said Monday. 
It was unclear Monday whether Antonovich could muster the seven votes he needs 
to be elected chairman because several key MTA board members, including Los 
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, said they had not made up their minds yet. 
</P>
<P>
 An Antonovich spokesman said Edelman would make an ineffective leader because 
he is retiring Dec. 5, only five months into the chairman's 12-month term. 
Edelman also has given notice that he will miss several MTA meetings in 
September, said Habib Balian, Antonovich's transportation deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be the chair in absentia," Balian said. "Let's just give him a gold 
watch instead of the chairmanship." 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, who was vacationing in Europe, could not be reached for comment 
Monday. But a spokesman said the supervisor would make the MTA a priority 
during his tenure as chairman, not give it short shrift as Antonovich's staff 
has suggested.  
</P>
<P>
 "It would be inappropriate and unnecessary to change the rules at this time," 
Edelman spokesman Joel Bellman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Bellman added that the MTA voted unanimously in April to choose a county 
supervisor instead of a city appointee to replace Edelman when he retires. 
</P>
<P>
 Several MTA sources said that Zev Yaroslavsky, the longtime Los Angeles city 
councilman elected June 8 to replace Edelman on the County Board of 
Supervisors, would most likely assume the MTA post if Edelman became chairman 
first and then left the job in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky is an alternate member of the MTA board of directors, representing 
the city, and attends many of its meetings. That gives him grounds to argue in 
December that he should replace Edelman because of his experience on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Antonovich is doing is a crass, political power play -- a coup d'etat -- 
that I hope will fail," Yaroslavsky said. "Ed is capable to serve, and I'm 
capable to take his place."  
</P>
<P>
 Several MTA board members said Antonovich covets the post primarily because it 
would give him the clout he needs on key issues, including the alignment of the 
Valley's east-west rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a power play for the east-west line," said one MTA source, who asked not 
to be identified.  
</P>
<P>
 Edelman and Yaroslavsky have been staunch advocates of a plan to build a 
mostly underground rail line that would begin at the Metro Rail terminus in 
North Hollywood and parallel Burbank and Chandler boulevards for 14 miles to 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Antonovich has been pressing a rival proposal for a 16-mile 
elevated rail line down the center of the Ventura Freeway -- possibly a 
monorail -- from Universal City to Woodland Hills. He has argued strongly that 
such a line would be cheaper and quicker to build, and has made it one of his 
key political themes. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials have studied both options and concluded that both are 
feasible. Final cost estimates are expected in August, followed by a decision 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever wins the battle over the chairmanship will be able to control the 
amount of time each side can take when the final debate on the east-west line 
comes to the MTA. The chairman also controls the agenda, deciding when to bring 
an issue to a vote quickly or delay it indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Another advantage is the chairman's influence over valuable contracts, MTA 
sources said, allowing him to sometimes guide them to firms that have 
contributed to the chairman's political campaigns. Alatorre, whose chairmanship 
of the MTA ends Friday, declined to comment on whom he will support to replace 
him, saying only that "the process is being worked on," according to his 
spokeswoman Liz Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan, who sits on the MTA board and has appointed three other members, said 
through a spokeswoman that he needs to talk to other members of the board, 
including Antonovich and Edelman, before he decides how he will vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "He needs to confer with other members to see what the actual issues are," 
said Riordan spokeswoman Noelia Rodriquez. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Councilman Larry Zarian, another MTA board member, said he was put 
off by Antonovich's effort to become chairman but still has not decided how he 
will vote.  
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, I haven't heard from Antonovich," Zarian said. "I need to 
listen to the arguments."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JURY 
EXONERATES LAPD OFFICER IN FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury decided Monday that a Los Angeles police officer did not use excessive 
force when he fatally shot a 22-year-old man during a struggle over a gun.  
</P>
<P>
 The verdict exonerated Officer Daniel Campbell in the Oct. 22, 1990, death of 
Los Angeles resident Anthony Hood.But Gary S. Casselman, who represents Hood's 
family, told U.S. District Judge Matthew Byrne that he may pursue a claim that 
some Police Department policies are flawed and that the city should be held 
liable for Hood's death.  
</P>
<P>
 Casselman said Campbell shot at Hood's mid-body area, with the bullet striking 
Hood in the heart, even though the officer's gun was only half an inch from the 
body. "(Police policy) doesn't tell (officers) that they shouldn't shoot for 
the heart when they (are so close) and can wound a felon," Casselman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne set a July 28 hearing if Casselman decides to pursue a claim against the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury determined unanimously that Campbell did not violate Hood's civil 
rights when he shot the suspect.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; KEY MENENDEZ 
HEARING RESCHEDULED FOR WEDNESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A key hearing in the Menendez brothers' murder trial was postponed until 
Wednesday because of a defense attorney's family emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Bill Weiss did not appear at a hearing Monday before 
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg, and co-counsel Terri Towery 
told Weisberg there had been an accident involving someone in Weiss' family 
over the weekend.At Towery's request, the judge rescheduled the hearing for 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez, 26, and Erik Menendez, 23, remain in County Jail without bail, 
awaiting a retrial in the Aug. 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their parents. At 
their first trial, separate juries deadlocked between murder and lesser 
manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Weisberg is due to fix a date for the brothers' retrial, to 
decide whether the brothers will be tried together or apart, to pick between 
one jury or two if they are tried together, and to decide whether the retrial 
will be held in Van Nuys or another county courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge postponed until July 22 a hearing on a prosecution bid to obtain 
audiotapes from free-lance journalist Robert Rand.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LA PUENTE; GUNMAN SLAIN 
BY DEPUTIES AFTER KILLING 1, WOUNDING 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A gunman opened fire Monday night on a carload of people in La Puente, killing 
one person and wounding three others before Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies tracked him to a nearby neighborhood and shot him to death, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Deputy Rich Erickson said the incident began about 7:30 p.m. when 
deputies noticed a Honda driving erratically in the 13700 block of Amar Road, 
about a block from Bassett High School. 
</P>
<P>
 When the car jumped a curb and stopped, deputies were confronted by three 
bleeding occupants, one of whom was dead at the scene, Erickson said. As 
paramedics transported the car's two other wounded occupants to hospitals, he 
said, several women rushed out of a coin laundry, reporting that they, too, had 
been in the vehicle when the shooting occurred. One of the women was also 
wounded, Erickson said, and told deputies that the gunman fled the scene on 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he said, a homeowner in the 13900 block of Ragus Street called 911 
to report that an armed man was trying to break down her door. Deputies 
responded to the scene and, in the confrontation that ensued, shot and killed 
the suspect, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Names of the wounded and dead were not immediately released.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LANCASTER; STUDENT 
SENTENCED TO CAMP IN POISONING OF TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Littlerock High School student charged with trying to poison a teacher by 
pouring cleaning solution in her soft-drink can pleaded no contest Monday in 
Lancaster Superior Court to one count of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old student, whose name was withheld because of his age, was 
sentenced to three to five months in a county youth camp.He will then be 
returned to his parents and remain on probation at least until he turns 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court referee Eugene E. Siegel also ordered the teen-ager to make 
restitution to the teacher, who was twice hospitalized after the incident, for 
her medical expenses and write her a letter of apology. The youth must also 
avoid all contact with the teacher, maintain at least a C average, maintain 
good attendance in school and obey all laws.  
</P>
<P>
 Siegel handed down the sentence after a brief hearing in which the nature of 
the offense was debated. A prosecutor called the poisoning "a very heinous act" 
whose "consequences are continuing to this day." The defense attorney described 
it as "a practical joke that went sour." 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel pointed out that the youth has the support of his family and no police 
record. "I'm not willing to brand him as a person who can never be 
rehabilitated," Siegel said. But he also told the youth: "If you commit any act 
that hurts someone, you have to pay for it," and warned the teen-ager that he 
will "go away for a long time" if he gets into trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, English teacher Susan Ennis, 32, sat on the far side of the small 
courtroom. She asked Deputy Dist. Atty. David A. Jacobs to read a brief 
statement in which she referred to the poisoning as "a senseless act of 
violence."

PLEADS GUILTY IN MURDER OF WITNESS, 14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old Pomona youth pleaded guilty Monday to the murder of a 
14-year-old witness who was shot in a Pomona alley two years ago, just days 
before the younger boy was to have testified in a gang-related murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In entering the second-degree murder plea in Los Angeles Superior Court, 
Patrick Contreras admitted killing Eduardo Samaniego of Pomona on Aug. 17, 
1992.Samaniego was one of four boys who witnessed the Nov. 10, 1991, 
gang-related shooting death of Luis Lopez, 15, of Pomona. Samaniego was called 
from his house, taken to an alley and slain. 
</P>
<P>
 The other three teen-age witnesses went on to testify against Arthur 
Melendrez, 22, of Chino, who was convicted and sentenced to 35 years to life in 
state prison. Melendrez and Contreras allegedly belong to the same gang.

SNYDER'S PARTNER TO PAY FINE IN CAMPAIGN PROBE; POLITICS: GILBERT ARCHULETTA 
ADMITS DISGUISING ILLEGAL CONTRIBUTIONS, STATE SAYS. HE WILL PAY $16,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The law partner of former Los Angeles Councilman Arthur K. Snyder has 
acknowledged repeatedly laundering illegal campaign contributions and has 
agreed to pay $16,000 in penalties, according to a tentative agreement 
disclosed Monday by state authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Gilbert Archuletta, a onetime City Hall legislative analyst who 
joined Snyder as a lawyer-lobbyist in a Downtown firm, is the latest associate 
of the former Eastside councilman caught up in an unprecedented, three-year 
state and local probe of the workings of political fund raising in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigations, conducted jointly by the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission and the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission, have netted nearly $1 
million in penalties, including the largest fine in U.S. political history for 
campaign donation violations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tentative settlement announced Monday with the FPPC, Archuletta 
acknowledged violating campaign laws on eight occasions by concealing the true 
source of political contributions made to several Los Angeles City Council 
members and county Supervisor Michael Antonovich. Officials said there was no 
evidence that the officials knew the contributions were improper. 
</P>
<P>
 The donations between 1989 and 1991 involved about $5,000, and Archuletta 
acknowledged he was often reimbursed by a source -- not identified in the 
agreement -- with $100 bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Such money laundering is illegal because it circumvents limits on donations 
and conceals "essential information regarding who is supporting or opposing a 
particular candidate," according to the agreement. It can also boost the 
influence of individuals who appear able to sell large numbers of tickets to 
campaign fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Daryl East, the FPPC's chief of enforcement, declined to characterize the 
significance of Archuletta's admissions, or say who investigators believe may 
be behind the money-laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is the investigation is going to continue," East said, adding 
that Archuletta is cooperating with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Several tentacles of the investigations have reached out to Snyder, touching 
relatives, clients and associates. But the colorful and controversial former 
councilman has not been charged, and fiercely denies any link to improper 
contributions, saying investigators are pursuing a vendetta against him. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Mark Geragos, an attorney who represents both Archuletta and 
Snyder, downplayed the settlement, portraying it as a way for Archuletta to 
avoid a lengthy legal fight. "It was a fraction of the cost of (a legal) 
defense," Geragos said. "And it ends two years of harassment of him." 
</P>
<P>
 He denied that Snyder was the source of the cash reimbursement to Archuletta, 
or that the investigations and recent settlements suggest Snyder's law offices, 
Snyder & Archuletta, are at the center of a "web of money-laundering" activity, 
as investigators suggested in court papers three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the Taiwan-based Evergreen shipping firm, managed locally by 
Snyder's brother-in-law, paid the largest U.S. campaign fine on record -- 
nearly $900,000 -- for improperly funneling $172,000 to local and state 
politicians over a four-year period. In that case, investigators identified the 
former councilman's wife, Delia Wu Snyder, as one of several middlemen in the 
scheme. But she has not been formally accused of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, the controller in Snyder's law firm, who officials alleged 
served as a conduit for illegal donations, admitted a series of violations and 
paid $38,000 in penalties, the second largest fine ever for an intermediary. 
</P>
<P>
 The state and city watchdog agencies have also charged Bell Cab Co., a Snyder 
client, with numerous counts of political money laundering that could lead to 
nearly $300,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's settlement, which is expected to be approved by members of the Fair 
Political Practices Commission next week, demonstrates that state and local 
investigators "are not on a vendetta," said Benjamin Bycel, executive director 
of the ethics commission. "Mr. Archuletta took responsibility for it, (agreed 
to) pay a fine, and the investigation continues." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its broader probe of political fund raising in Southern California, 
the FPPC and the ethics panel have also been investigating alleged campaign 
money laundering by former employees of a firm with rights to stage the Los 
Angeles Marathon. William Burke, president of the firm, has denied knowledge of 
illegal contributions.

 A young California condor has died after slamming into a power line north of 
Santa Barbara, the fifth to have a fatal encounter with civilization since the 
program to reintroduce the endangered birds to the wild began in 1992, federal 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-month-old male, known only as No. 89, and another young male condor had 
flown 25 miles from the remote Santa Barbara canyon where they were released in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were spotted Friday morning sitting on a fence next to a back-yard 
swimming pool on El Camino Cielo near California 154, said Marc M. Weitzel, the 
Ventura-based project leader for the Condor Recovery Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists were attempting to flush the birds away from the populated region 
Friday when No. 89 took flight, glided about three-quarters of a mile and 
struck the power line, Weitzel said. But he said the death was not a direct 
result of the effort to scare the birds away. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzel said the death will not change plans to release six to 10 more young 
condors into the Lion Canyon area.

SMOKING DEBATE REACHES BALLOT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A smoking measure sponsored by the Philip Morris tobacco company will be on 
California's Nov. 8 election ballot, state election officials said.Acting 
Secretary of State Tony Miller said the measure had well over the required 
384,974 voter signatures to qualify for the ballot. The initiative would create 
statewide smoking regulations but preempt tougher, local anti-smoking laws. 
Health groups have accused backers of misleading voters.

SUNSHINE CANYON LANDFILL EXPANSION HALTED AFTER 4 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just four days after it began, expansion of the Sunshine Canyon Landfill was 
brought to a halt Monday when a judge ordered the dump's operator to stop work 
on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 In a two-page ruling, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne told 
Browning Ferris Industries Inc. to stop cutting down more than 2,800 oak trees 
-- the first work being done at the site -- as the company readies a wooded 
canyon north of Granada Hills for use as a garbage dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne's order, which stems from a lawsuit filed by opponents trying to stop 
the project, came just four days after Browning Ferris was granted permission 
to start work on the first phase of a 17-million-ton expansion of the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge will decide July 12 whether to make Monday's order permanent and 
reinstate a 1991 stay that was lifted this month. Until then, Browning Ferris 
spokesman Arnie Berghoff said, "we will abide by the law." 
</P>
<P>
 "But we think the lawsuit is literally without merit," he added. "The judge 
issued the restraining order because she really hadn't had a chance to look at 
the issues. We think she will lift it." 
</P>
<P>
 Berghoff did not know how many trees crews had removed before work stopped 
midday Monday, but opponents said more than half of the 2,850 oaks have been 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty vicious," said Rosemary Woodlock, an attorney for the North 
Valley Coalition of Concerned Citizens, which has pressed a variety of legal 
challenges against Browning Ferris. 
</P>
<P>
 Dump opponents protested Friday and Saturday outside the gates of the 
facility, portions of which are in the city of Los Angeles. Only the county 
area would be expanded; city officials oppose the dump expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson said the city will try to enforce an 
order barring Browning Ferris crews from using a small road to the dump. City 
officials argue that Browning Ferris needs a city permit for heavy equipment to 
use the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Violating the order would be a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't obey the law, then somebody will make an arrest and make it 
stick," Bernson said. "I would hope the city would fully enforce the law." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent skirmishes are part of a decade-long fight over the landfill 
between city and county officials as well as between environmentalists and 
Browning Ferris.

IN MEMORY OF A HERO; EAST L.A. MAN IS FOCUS OF PLANNED MONUMENT TO LATINO MEDAL 
WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A military portrait of Eugene Obregon graces the wall of his mother's house in 
Pico Rivera, next to a photo of the ship that bears his name. In the 44 years 
since his death, Henrietta Obregon has attended dedication ceremonies for a 
school, a barracks, an American Legion post and three parks named for her son, 
a Medal of Honor recipient. 
</P>
<P>
 Now William Lansford and Al Flores want to turn the name Eugene Obregon into a 
symbol of civic pride and ethnic unity with a monument that they hope to build 
in his memory in Los Angeles' Pershing Square. 
</P>
<P>
 Lansford and Flores learned of the East Los Angeles soldier a dozen years ago 
while skimming through a history of Latinos in the armed services. The two 
Mexican American veterans of World War II had long dreamed of building a 
memorial to Latino Medal of Honor recipients, and Obregon's story seemed to 
offer a compelling message. 
</P>
<P>
 Obregon, 19, was killed in 1950 during the Korean War, fending off enemy 
troops while trying to save a wounded comrade, Bert Johnson. Seeing Johnson 
fall, he dashed over and dragged him to the side of the road while continuing 
to fire at enemy troops, a Defense Department publication says. 
</P>
<P>
 Obregon was bandaging his friend's wounds when the platoon of enemy soldiers 
advanced on him. Seizing Johnson's carbine, "he placed his own body as a shield 
in front of him and (lay) there firing accurately and effectively into the 
hostile group until he himself was fatally wounded by enemy machine gun fire," 
the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 The monument that Flores and Lansford propose would be 20 feet high, with a 
bronze casting of Obregon guarding the injured Marine, atop a base of Mexican 
volcanic stone bearing the names of the other 37 Latino Medal of Honor 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 To another mother, this testimony to the last moments of her son's life might 
be a bittersweet tribute, but Henrietta Obregon said it evokes only pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, my gosh, that was really something. It's just beautiful," she said about 
the monument's design. "It makes me feel so proud." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores said they hope that the memorial will stir that feeling in others. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the primary (reasons for the monument) is to build esteem for the 
Hispanic community," he said. "Right now, all you read about is shootings and 
drugs, whereas we have heroes that people should be aware about. We have 38 
Hispanic Medal of Honor winners, most of whom gave their lives for the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Valdez, another partner in the project, said, "It will create a bond -- 
that we're all brothers, we're all one race, and there shouldn't be any 
divisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Obregon enlisted with four friends in 1948, straight out of Roosevelt High 
School. Although he was not yet 18, he was so determined to serve that he 
talked his mother into signing his enlistment papers. His sister, Virginia La 
Carra, remembers him as a friendly, popular kid who played baseball and soccer 
and liked to shadowbox and work on cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond between her and her brother ran deep, La Carra said, and she was the 
first to learn of his death. An ominous premonition preceded the dreaded 
telegram. 
</P>
<P>
 She woke up that day feeling inexplicably desolate. It was the morning of a 
cousin's wedding, but La Carra, distraught, refused to join her family for the 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was lying in bed, bawling my eyes out," she said. "No sooner had they left 
when the telegram arrived. . . . When my dad saw it, he passed out. . . . My 
dad took it very, very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Obregon never recovered from the loss of his son, she said. About five 
years later, he died of a heart attack. "He always told me Gene was waiting for 
him," said Henrietta Obregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores and Lansford put the idea for the memorial on hold for years, but last 
fall they formed the Eugene Obregon Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation 
with Valdez and a fourth partner, Armando Pena. They became incorporated and 
are applying for nonprofit status. And they solicited a sheaf of endorsements 
from prominent local politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Walters, whose district encompasses Pershing Square, said they should 
easily gain approval for the monument. She and her staff will help expedite the 
permitting process, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the real challenge will be raising the $1 million that they estimate it 
will take to build it. Their strategies include benefit concerts and corporate 
sponsorships, Lansford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson Rising, an adviser to the memorial foundation and a senior partner at 
McGuire Thomas, a leader in the restoration of Pershing Square, said he does 
not expect them to have any problem obtaining corporate and community funding. 
</P>
<P>
 But Estella Romero, a marketing consultant for Latino and community issues who 
is helping with fund raising, cautioned that raising the money may be an uphill 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I regret to tell you that when it has come to a Latino project, it doesn't 
seem to be as important as other ventures, like the ballet or the 
philharmonic," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to create awareness of the war heroes is reminiscent of the battle 
for recognition that Latino soldiers waged 50 years ago. Determined to prove 
their loyalty, many Latino soldiers won respect by volunteering for the most 
dangerous assignments, Lansford said, and some sacrificed their lives defending 
others, as Obregon did. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of prejudice, especially in the Marine Corps, which was 
lily-white," Lansford said. "In the beginning we had to prove we could stick it 
out, but with all the Medal of Honor winners, through the war, we all became 
friends."

FIXATIONS: CAPTAIN HUFF-AND-PUFF; INVETERATE SMOKER WALT NETSCHERT OF ORANGE 
HAS DESIGNED A FAN-EQUIPPED HELMET TO LET NICOTINE ADDICTS AND THOSE HE HAS 
DUBBED FRESH AIR FREAKS PEACEABLY COEXIST. BUT HE HAS HAD VERY FEW TAKERS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Did you ever have a space helmet as a kid? One you could put on and suddenly 
become invincible, impervious to the forces aligned against you? 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Walt Netschert. Though well into his 60s, he also has a spacey helmet he 
dons when beset by foes. Unlike kids and their imaginary villains, Netschert -- 
though aided by a sense of humor -- is dead serious about feeling oppressed by 
very real villains. 
</P>
<P>
 They are FAFs, the people he calls Fresh Air Freaks. He calls his helmet the 
E-7 Equalizer Ecology Hat, and, like all good super-heroes, has a name for 
himself as well, Captain Huff-and-Puff. He derives his powers from cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Netschert smokes, and has since he was an engineering student in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't start to look smart or be part of a group," he explained. "In my 
junior year, the dean of engineering called me in and said, 'The instructors 
have all been talking about you because you're puzzling to us. Your class 
participation is fine, your homework, reports and lab stuff are super-good, but 
you get a test and you struggle to get a C-minus. Why?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'My head goes faster than my hand.' I'd work a problem through, 
but my hand wouldn't keep up, and I'd have to start over, and it made me 
nervous. He said, 'Well, your head has to have patience for your hand to catch 
up. Try either a glass of wine or a cigarette before a test.' It made all the 
difference in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Had Netschert chosen differently, he might now be trying to market the Ecology 
Wine Hat. But cigarettes it was. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I find them highly beneficial to my way of performing," he said. "With 
tobacco I can settle my nerves down and think methodically and in order, and 
without it what happens then is 15 minutes is OK, but then my thoughts lose 
focus on what's going on, and I start thinking about having a cigarette maybe. 
Then another 15 minutes go by and I start getting a post-nasal drip, that turns 
into tears as big as light bulbs and choking, and it gets worse from there." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years he has found old clients wouldn't hire him if he smoked at 
their facilities. Favorite restaurants would no longer seat him. He can't even 
light up at an Angel game anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 So the engineer turned inventor and made his special hat. A clear plastic 
shield forms an isolation zone in front of the smoker's face, complete with 
ashtray and a clip that will hold either a cigarette or a cigar. As long as the 
smoker keeps his lit cigarette in that zone, and is careful to exhale upward, 
Netschert claims the smoke won't be a problem to anyone else.  
</P>
<P>
 A fan pulls it up and through two filters, and there's even an optional 
perfumed scent packet. The fan is reversible, so the hat can conversely serve 
as an air filter for smoke- or pollen-sensitive persons. It runs on batteries, 
off a wall socket or a car cigarette lighter. Netschert refers to his invention 
as a "peace pipe for the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He's a likable man with a sense of humor broad enough to include his own 
creations. We met in an Anaheim coffee shop, in the smoking section. He 
demonstrated his E-7 hat, and even to a smoke-sensitive dweeb like me, it 
appeared to work. He contentedly puffed away on his long More cigarettes behind 
his plastic shield, accompanied by the whine of the fan, and there was no 
outward-bound smoke or smell to speak of. 
</P>
<P>
 He designed the hat in 1989 while doing an in-house engineering project for 
Disney Imagineering. He had already found a way to smoke on the job, by setting 
up his office in a custodian's closet beneath a stairwell, but he was going 
nuts not being able to smoke at a four-hour weekly meeting. So he devised the 
hat and was then allowed to puff and whir away at the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 So far the only Ecology hats extant are 10 prototypes, some of formed 
cardboard and a couple of plastic. He has been trying to interest investors and 
has charts predicting 250,000 sales of the projected $79.95 hat in its first 
year of manufacture alone. He thinks it's a conservative estimate that one in 
250 of the nation's estimated 42 million smokers will buy one. 
</P>
<P>
 When he exhibited the hat at a 1989 invention exhibition, Netschert says a 
prominent Japanese inventor told him he'd do well with his product in Japan. 
About the only American interest he has received, though, was an invitation to 
appear on "The Tonight Show," which he did in November, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 He has tried to interest domestic manufacturers to no avail, and his appeals 
to the tobacco industry have been similarly ignored. Earlier this month, he 
rented an Anaheim conference room to demonstrate his product and ideas relating 
to it. Despite sending invitations to tobacco company representatives and a 
host of others, the conference "fell right out of bed," with no one showing up. 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks that is because smokers are now vocally outnumbered 4 to 1 in the 
United States, and because the tobacco industry is so busy racking up export 
sales that it has abandoned smokers in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be yet another reason though, one right in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 His hat may work wonderfully, saving smokers from being ostracized and saving 
others from the smoke, but it looks utterly ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 Netschert had a color brochure made featuring his Equalizer Ecology hats, with 
photos of a female model using the hat -- actually a slightly boxier E-5 
prototype -- in a variety of lifelike situations: shopping, dining, working and 
driving. I've shown this brochure to dozens of people now, and each time it has 
inspired incredulity and laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a joke, right?" "It looks like 'Robocop Goes to Ralphs'." "Is this 
the new Cone of Silence, Chief?" were among the responses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the restaurant, I tried on one of Netschert's E-7s, and felt rather like I 
was wearing an In 'N' Out Burger stand on my head. I asked three women at a 
nearby table to tell me, on a scale of one to 10, just how ridiculous I looked, 
and got unanimous 10s. I'll admit to usually getting the same response without 
the hat, but it sure didn't help any. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the generally gracious Johnny Carson told Netschert, "You look very 
silly. You know that, don't you?" 
</P>
<P>
 He does know that, conceding that his hats are "uglier than sin." But so, he 
argues, was the Volkswagen Bug, and people came to love it.  
</P>
<P>
 But Volkswagen didn't have the hurdle of getting folks to wear the Bug on 
their heads. Picture Bogart and Bacall in a romantic clinch with their 
cigarettes. Then picture them in the Equalizer Ecology Hat. Then picture them 
with Volkswagens on their heads. The Volkswagen wins, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Netschert is willing to risk appearing silly if it enables him to make his 
point. He recognizes that there are persons who are genuinely sensitive to 
smoke, "but the majority group of nonsmokers are just the complainers. They 
don't like the thought of people smoking, the sight of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Netschert doesn't encourage others to smoke and says he saw to it that his two 
sons didn't smoke. But he does . He likes to, and feels he has to in order to 
function. And everywhere he turns he sees his preferred pleasure being denied, 
needlessly he feels. 
</P>
<P>
 So he blows smoke in his hat in places where smoking isn't allowed, wearing 
the E-7 in restaurants, malls and even airplanes, without hearing complaints, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His goal is to form Puffin' Posses, where he, under the name Captain 
Huff-and-Puff, and others will target certain no-smoking venues (not, he said, 
ones where smoking is a fire-code violation) by going there en masse and 
lighting up under his hats. If the venues refuse to let them smoke even if the 
hats filter all particulates and odors from the air, then Netschert will 
publicly dub them Fresh Air Freaks. He's even sent invitations to smoking 
celebrities he hopes will join him under the E-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine Clint Eastwood comin' atcha down the street wearing one. Hah!" he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ideal world, if smokers were in the minority in a workplace, they'd 
wear the hats. If nonsmokers were the minority, they'd wear the hats, having 
reversed the fan so it would filter the smoky air. Peace would reign. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Does he worry that by removing some of the social stigma from smoking, he 
might encourage others to smoke? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not the intent at all. It's just to support the rights of smokers. 
Don't make them stand outside where they can't do their work. Don't let them 
get kicked out of a profession as I was, and others are." 
</P>
<P>
 He has yet to develop any smoking-related illnesses, and said that's an 
individual risk. He discounts the risks of second-hand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good gosh, the Good Lord put those killer bones in fish too, and it's up to 
the individual whether they want to eat fish. I know a guy who has ingested a 
couple of decent shots of cyanide and lived though it. I think our maker gave 
us a system that rejects reasonable amounts of impurities, and secondary smoke 
I think is a reasonable amount." 
</P>
<P>
 Some smokers, he thinks, die of broken hearts. Netschert showed a letter he 
had written to an Orange drugstore about a deceased smoker who had staked out a 
spot at the counter for years until the store limited his smoking area. He was 
moved to a distant booth, and he died a month later, Netschert said: 
</P>
<P>
 Good People, I know it broke Tex's heart, his spirit, his self-esteem and 
perhaps even his will to live when he lost his right to smoke at his end-stool 
spot. At that spot it was comfortably natural for him to meet and blend with 
others such as myself and to feel like an equal integral part of society 
instead of being a lonely minority outcast at a remote table. I know that 
lonely squeezed-out feeling as well. In his memory I suggest dedicating the end 
seat to his kind with a little sign on the back: Reserved for Friends of Tex, 
Smokers Only.  
</P>
<P>
 He got no reply. He usually doesn't, he said, and is particularly incensed 
with the cold shoulder his entreaties have gotten from the tobacco industry. He 
thought it would be in the industry's best interest to see his product on the 
market, and to advertise it, for a royalty, on their cigarette cartons. He said 
he may have to turn to Japan to get his product manufactured. "It's so 
politically charged here. Nonsmokers don't want anything to interfere with 
their thinking that it's bad, bad, bad. And they sure don't want to approve of 
someone and their right to smoke. Then the tobacco industry is so content with 
the way they're making bucks with their exports they won't to get embroiled in 
this domestic folderol. So two major block factions stand in the way in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Netschert soldiers on with his remaining Equalizer Ecology 
Hat prototypes -- he sent one to a nephew with allergies and another to a woman 
he saw on Oprah whose smoking was an issue in her custody battle -- hoping to 
win back his place at the table of American life. 
</P>
<P>
 He's finding that without his hats there's scarcely a spot where he can enjoy 
a peaceful puff anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the hospital for hip surgery a while back," he recalled. "It was 3 
a.m. I was the only one in the room, there was no one stirring in the hall, my 
curtain was pulled partway around the bed. 'Now is my time to savor that 
cigarette I brought with me.' I dampened a Kleenex to use as an ashtray, lit up 
and I had four puffs -- they were worthwhile -- and I hear footsteps hastening 
toward me. They can't be coming after me! But sure as hell, from maybe 50 yards 
away this nurse comes in, opens the curtain grabs my cigarette and flushes it 
down the toilet."

 Sailing alone soothes me because the sea is fair, not cruel.It judges only 
your ability. It does not care who or what you are. It does not ask your age, 
color, sex, address, sexual orientation, education or IQ, but only your 
competence. It requires only that you can sail. If you can, you survive. If you 
can't, better stay ashore. That's fair, more fair than most of us experience on 
land. And refreshing.

RSVP; MASKING MERRY ON OPERA PACIFIC'S BEHALF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Knowing that opera buffs have a weakness for theater, colorful costumes and 
great singing, the Opera Pacific Society of Founders offered all of that and 
more at their annual gala, "Music, Masquerade and Merriment." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellie Cortese, widow of the late Ross Cortese, who founded the Leisure World 
retirement villages, opened her contemporary hilltop estate in the Lemon 
Heights area of Santa Ana to about 300 guests for the Mardi Gras-style gala 
Saturday night. The $125-per-person event grossed $60,000 for Opera Pacific in 
Costa Mesa. Paper Faces 
</P>
<P>
 Party-goers, many sporting eye masks color-coordinated to match their summer 
cocktail attire, spent the reception exploring the 12,400-square-foot home and 
listening to the jazz sounds of the Sam Conti Quartet. Many assembled outdoors 
to ogle the 360-degree view and a 14-foot-high marble Venus that presides over 
the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, they wandered from room to room admiring the fine art and lush 
furnishings. Many looked into the guest bathroom, which has walls and ceilings 
covered entirely in smoked mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine having to polish them all," one man said. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the second time Ellie Cortese has hosted the founders' gala. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year I didn't know anybody. I felt like a stranger at my own party," 
Cortese said. "This year I have so many friends. (Opera Pacific) has added 
another dimension to my life." 
</P>
<P>
 To create a mini-Mardi Gras, founders chairwoman Mary Raymond tracked down a 
company in New Orleans and ordered shiny decorations in the official Mardi Gras 
colors -- purple, gold and green. The grounds were festooned with banners and a 
towering jack-in-the-box, and many of the estate's statues sported masks. 
</P>
<P>
 The founders chose a masquerade theme because "we wanted to include all of the 
elements of the arts -- the drama, the music, the masks," said Linda Cassuto 
Mandelbaum, event chairwoman. More Merriment 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner took place outside on the tennis courts, which were transformed into an 
outdoor New Orleans cafe, complete with old-fashioned street lamps, banners and 
tables draped in purple cloths. Small trees with shiny purple, gold and green 
leaves served as centerpieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kang, owner of Five Feet in Laguna Beach, prepared a New Orleans-style 
menu that included a Southern cucumber tomato salad, chicken Creole, sticky 
gumbo, oven-roasted New York steak and, for dessert, a mango Napoleon. 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner, members of Opera Pacific's Overture Company (Brent Luck, Michael 
Daniels, Dyan McKinney and Robin Lee Parkin) performed selections from operas 
and musicals that feature masks, including "Die Fledermaus," "Cats" and 
"Phantom of the Opera." 
</P>
<P>
 Funds raised by the Society of Founders are earmarked for Opera Pacific's 
mainstage season productions and the Apprentice Artists Program. The opera 
company, the 11th largest in the country, will open its ninth season with 
"Aida" in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the guests were honorary chairman Niles Gates (Gates was recovering 
nicely Monday following a fall during the festivities in the Cortese home); 
co-chairwomen Nancy J. Miller and Ellie Faber; David DiChiera, general director 
of Opera Pacific; Irv and Gloria Gellman, president of the guild alliance; 
Ralph and Georgene Smith, David Scott and Gayle Widyolar, Ed and Floss 
Schumacher, Jim and Nora Johnson, Jerry and Maralou Harrington, Eve Foussard, 
Sharon Lesk, Robert and Ladorna Eichenberg, Ted and Mary Jean Simpkins, Robert 
and Maxine Gibson, Dorothy Ellis Hopper, Herb and Milli Wieseneck and Peter and 
Mary Muth. KATHRYN BOLD

INTO THE NIGHT: RSVP; VH-1 TUNES IN A FEW CHARITABLE CAUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Scene: Sunday's first VH-1 Honors at the Shrine Auditorium. A party for 
2,100 followed the 2 1/2-hour live concert. Since VH-1 is the adult 
contemporary sibling of MTV, the party was like an opulent ($200,000-plus would 
be a ballpark figure on cost), 20-year high school reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Honored for their charitable work and performing were Stevie 
Wonder, Bonnie Raitt, Garth Brooks, Michael Bolton, Melissa Etheridge, the Rev. 
Al Green, Kenny G and the former Prince. Presenting, in order to the above, 
were Coretta Scott King, Mavis Staples, James Taylor (perhaps the living 
embodiment of VH-1), Kathy Ireland, Brad Pitt, Danny Glover, Jon Lovitz and 
Kirstie Alley. On hand were MTV execs Tom Freston, John Sykes and Geraldine 
Laybourne. Emcee Ellen DeGeneres said hosting a live award show made her "feel 
like I just bungee jumped and it took 2 1/2 hours to see if the cord would 
snap." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dancing Bimbos Incident: While Raitt performed with Green, two Edie 
Williams wanna-bes jumped onstage and pranced for the cameras. It sullied an 
otherwise ethereal moment. "They were dancing around like sluts," said an 
unamused Raitt backstage. "I didn't feel a lot of sisterhood at that particular 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Audience Review: Most commercial-strewn TV concert tapings are satanic 
aberrations, but this show's swift flow and all-star line-up got raves. Typical 
comments were, "The first awards show I didn't get bored at," and, "Better than 
I thought it would be." 
</P>
<P>
 A Prince by Any Other Name: Now that he goes by a glyph, there's always the 
question of how does one greet "the artist formerly known as Prince," as his 
office refers to him. DeGeneres said she would address him as, "Formerly." A 
member of his entourage said, "We call him 'him.' " A photographer called him 
"the short guy with an attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe They Just Don't Like Long Hair: Is there an organized underground of 
Michael Bolton haters in America? He seemed to be the only honoree who raised 
guests' ire. "He underdresses and oversings," one woman said. "Tell Michael 
Bolton to put on a shirt," said another. "He was like an over-the-hill Fabio."

COURT OKS TRIAL OVER LAPD USE OF DOGS; RULING: IN A FEDERAL APPELLATE DECISION, 
THE CASE OF AN AGUA DULCE MAN WHO WAS MAULED IN PACOIMA WILL GO TO JURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Clarita Valley man who was mauled by a Los Angeles police dog in 
Pacoima is entitled to a trial on whether the LAPD's policy governing the use 
of canines to seize fleeing or hiding suspects is unconstitutional, a federal 
appeals court in San Francisco ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 2-1 decision, the U. S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the order 
of a Los Angeles trial judge who ruled that the LAPD's policy governing use of 
dogs was constitutional and that there was no need for a jury trial on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that nearly six years after Thane Carl Chew of Agua Dulce was 
captured by an LAPD dog named Volker, he will get a jury trial on whether the 
police's use of the dog constituted excessive force under the Fourth Amendment 
to the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges were sharply divided on the potential impact that the decision 
might have on police departments and their ability to use dogs. The divisions 
are emblematic of the debate over the severity of crime in the nation and what 
measures must be used to combat it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of fear of lawsuits and liability, this decision may be fatal to 
canine units, and by their demise, the ability of police to combat criminals 
will be seriously hampered," according to a dissent by Judge Stephen S. Trott. 
</P>
<P>
 Trott, a former Los Angeles prosecutor, accused the majority of sending police 
officers "to the jaws of dangers," by restricting the ways in which police dogs 
can be used. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judge William A. Norris, one of two in the majority, criticized Trott for 
"inflammatory rhetoric" and his "doomsday prediction" that the decision "will 
prevent the use of all police dogs in all instances." His colleague, Judge 
Stephen Reinhardt, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge Trott grossly mischaracterizes today's holdings with respect to the use 
of excessive force," wrote Reinhardt, former president of the Los Angeles 
Police Commission. "We do not send police dogs to the sidelines. We reverse a 
summary judgment order, so that there may be a full and fair factual trial 
before a jury of 'the People' regarding the practices followed" by the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 All the judges agreed that the case posed fundamental questions about the 
Fourth Amendment of the U. S. Constitution, which prohibits illegal searches 
and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 The case arose out of a 1988 daytime incident where an LAPD officer stopped 
Chew, now 31, for a traffic violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Chew, who had three outstanding felony warrants, fled on foot and hid in a 
nearby Pacoima scrap yard. A police perimeter was set up around the scrap yard, 
and helicopter and canine units were called in to search for Chew. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Officer Daniel Bunch unleashed a police dog, who found Chew crouching 
between two metal Dumpsters. Chew then attempted to surrender and yelled to the 
officer to call off the dog, according to the majority opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the officer did not immediately intercede and the dog bit Chew several 
times, resulting in severe lacerations to his left side and forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Chew asserted that he did not offer resistance at any time after he spotted 
the dog and repeatedly begged the officer to restrain his dog, but that Bunch 
instead ordered Volker to attack. For his part, Bunch denied that he ordered an 
attack and maintained that when he first saw Chew, the suspect was hitting the 
dog with a pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunch admitted kicking at Chew in an attempt to disarm him and to protect the 
dog. Bunch also acknowledged that he may have kicked Chew in the head, face or 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 After Chew was arrested, he pleaded guilty to receiving stolen property and 
served two years in jail, according to attorney George Denny III. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, Chew sued Bunch, other LAPD personnel, including then-Chief 
Daryl F. Gates, and the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Chew claimed that Bunch violated his right not to be subject to excessive 
force by unreasonably unleashing the dog, which was trained to search and bite. 
He also asserted that Bunch's action was caused by a city policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Chew claimed that regardless of whether Bunch acted reasonably in 
unleashing the dog, the city's policy of training police dogs such as Volker, a 
German shepherd, to apprehend unarmed and non-resistant suspects by biting, 
mauling and seizing them was itself unreasonable and unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 U. S. District Judge Richard Gadbois granted summary judgment in favor of the 
individual defendants other than Bunch on the ground that as public officials 
they had qualified immunity. He also granted summary judgment for the city on 
the ground that Chew failed to demonstrate that a city policy unlawfully caused 
his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal jury awarded Chew $13,000 against Bunch, but did not specify the 
reasons for its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Chew appealed Gadbois' decision to grant a summary judgment to the other 
defendants, leading to Monday's decision. A summary judgment means that a judge 
has decided that there is no issue worthy of a jury's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges Reinhardt and Norris disagreed with Gadbois, saying there is plenty for 
a jury to consider, including whether excessive force was used and whether the 
city's dog policy violated the U. S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Volker bit Chew three times before achieving "an effective hold" on him and 
dragged him between four and 10 feet in the process, the majority opinion 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bunch had good reason to expect that Chew might sustain exactly this type of 
mauling when he released Volker" because of the type of training the dog had 
received, Reinhardt wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinhardt also stressed that the city conceded at trial "the truth of Chew's 
contention that departmental policy authorized seizure of all concealed 
suspects -- resistant or non-resistant, armed or unarmed, violent or nonviolent 
-- by dogs trained to bite hard and hold." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Mary House said she could not make any detailed comment 
because she had not received the decision yet. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco attorney Ralph Leardo, who argued for the plaintiff on appeal, 
said Monday's decision is quite significant. "This case will have broad 
application because the use of dogs is so prevalent in police work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police departments have not sufficiently taken into account the severity of 
the injuries that are likely to result when these dogs are used," Leardo said. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1992, one month after oral arguments were presented in this 
case, the LAPD changed its dog policy from "search and bite," to "search and 
bark," meaning that a warning is issued before the dog bites. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 changes, made in the aftermath of suits and criticism from the 
Christopher Commission, have had a profound impact, according to Robert F. 
Mann, a Los Angeles attorney who has filed nine suits against the LAPD stemming 
from dog bite incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of dog bite injuries has fallen from over 350 a year to about 30 a 
year," even though the police are using more dogs now, Mann said. "In 1989, 
there were almost 100 hospitalizations" stemming from police dog bites, he 
said. "In 1993, there was not a single hospitalization."

PRINCIPAL APPROVES REHIRING EMBATTLED HIGH SCHOOL COACH; SIMI VALLEY: MIKE 
SCYPHERS WAS ACCUSED OF MISHANDLING THE TEAM'S DISCIPLINE AND FINANCES. BOARD 
WILL DECIDE IF HE RETURNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Scyphers, Simi Valley High's embattled baseball coach, has Principal 
Kathryn Scroggin's approval to return next season despite a rancorous fight 
over allegations that the successful coach mishandled the team's discipline and 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District board will vote on Scroggin's 
recommendation at a closed-door meeting at 6 tonight at City Hall, before the 
regularly scheduled open meeting at 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The board traditionally approves recommendations its principals make, but the 
rehiring of Scyphers is not guaranteed because of the nature of the case, board 
members said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the board will have to review the seriousness of the charges," member 
Debbie Sandland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, who has led the Pioneers to national prominence in his 16 years as 
coach, said Scroggin told him last week that she would ask that his contract be 
renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy the principal has recommended me for hire and hopefully the board 
will see it her way," Scyphers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, 41, was suspended as coach May 3, pending police and district 
investigations into possible financial and disciplinary improprieties. Scyphers 
has admitted that he accepted money for rental of the Simi Valley field in 
violation of district rules. In addition, he violated state high school rules 
when he paid his assistant coaches with rental money without the school's 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has admitted to a traditional team disciplinary practice in which 
players bid small amounts of money for the right to paddle teammates who break 
team rules. The practice violates the state Education Code. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County district attorney absolved Scyphers of criminal wrongdoing 
June 8. The school lifted his suspension the next day, nearly two weeks after 
the end of the high school baseball season. Scyphers missed the team's final 
seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the reinstatement, Scyphers needed Scroggin's recommendation to coach 
next season. All coaches in the district are hired on one-year contracts, and 
Scyphers said Scroggin gave him no indication about his status. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was quite surprised with the recommendation, obviously," Sandland said. 
"I'm very concerned because the paddling is a violation of the Education Code. 
That's what we have to keep focusing on." 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Diane Collins would not comment specifically on the Scyphers 
recommendation, but said she leans toward following the principal's choice in 
such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it is the responsibility of the principal to make those decisions, 
and I usually support the principal," Collins said. "In general, I think you 
hire good people and you respect their decisions that deal directly with their 
(schools)." 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Michael, one of the parents who led a drive to persuade the district to 
reinstate Scyphers, said she was cautiously optimistic about the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't trust (school administrators) anymore," said Michael, whose son, 
Jeff, will be a senior first baseman next season. "It's still up to the board 
to approve him or not. And it's still up to their egos, how badly have they 
been bruised." 
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Tim Nykoluk, who will be a senior, said he had thought that 
school administrators were looking for a reason to fire Scyphers, and he is 
glad that the coach seems on his way back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were basically trying to get him on everything," Nykoluk said. 
"I think it's great (that Scyphers could be back). He's intelligent. He likes 
coaching. He teaches us a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, who said he has lost sleep and 15 pounds because of the stress he's 
suffered since the investigation began, said he has trouble getting too excited 
about the news of Scroggin's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy in one sense," Scyphers said, "and not so happy in another because 
of what my family and I have had to endure in the last few weeks."

DIP IN TEMPERATURES NO REAL RELIEF; HEAT: AS SOME VALLEY READINGS HIT THE 100S, 
RESIDENTS OF A CANOGA PARK COMPLEX PUT UP WITH BROKEN AIR CONDITIONERS AND A 
CLOSED SWIMMING POOL.

<P>
 The fourth straight day of blistering heat baked the San Fernando Valley area 
Monday, sending people everywhere fleeing to the nearest air conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, almost everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Canoga Park apartment complex, about half of the units had working units, 
and half did not. The apartments with that familiar hum were crowded with 
people, while the quiet ones were deserted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked it better in school, because at least it was cool there," said Dago 
Martinez, 13, suffering summer break in one of the units that did not have 
working air-conditioning.

<P>
 Making things worse for the Lanark Street apartment dwellers, the complex's 
swimming pool has been closed for some time because the water was dirty. And, 
because of a plumbing problem, turning on cold water faucets brings only hot 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 Although temperatures had dipped a bit from the weekend, it was still hot 
enough to clear the sidewalks of most everyone except small children and stray 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said the heat wave will continue for at least the rest of the 
week, with heat alerts issued for the San Fernando Valley through Wednesday, 
said National Weather Service meteorologist Bruce Entwistle. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat alerts are issued when the "heat index" -- or the temperature the body 
senses -- reaches 105 to 111 degrees. The index combines temperature, humidity 
levels, intensity of sun and other factors. 
</P>
<P>
 In Woodland Hills, the temperature alone hit 106 degrees, in Van Nuys it rose 
to 99, in Burbank 95, and in the Antelope Valley city of Lancaster, the high 
was a searing 107, according to WeatherData, which provides forecasts to The 
Times. Records for the date were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the Canoga Park complex, Debbie Martel, 32, stood outside her unit 
wondering which was worse -- getting fried under a relentless midday sun, or 
boiling inside an apartment with a broken air conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take four showers a day, I go swimming -- anything to try and stay cool," 
she said. "I just want the thing fixed." 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment manager said everything -- the pool, the cold water supply, the 
air conditioners -- will be fixed as soon as the repair people show up. She 
said she had called them repeatedly, beginning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents, however, didn't seem to mind. Of course, they were the ones 
with the working air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
 A few units down from Martel, Art Garcia, 26, and nearly a dozen of his 
friends had plunked down in Garcia's cool -- almost cold -- apartment to watch 
a World Cup soccer match. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hot, naw, it's not too bad," Garcia said, looking up at his laboring air 
conditioner. "Actually, it's kind of cool. Maybe too cold." 
</P>
<P>
 Being over-chilled was a problem few Valley residents shared, and medical 
experts warned people to take care not to get overheated. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Paul Karis, medical director of the emergency department at Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center, said that long periods of time or strenuous physical 
activity out in the sun can cause heat exhaustion, cramps or heat stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Karis' advice is simple: "Get out of the hot sun and get inside and drink lots 
of fluids like Gatorade or anything balanced that has salts and potassium," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcoholic and caffeinated beverages should be avoided because they cause the 
body to lose fluids more quickly and can cause dehydration, Karis said.

STUDENT, 15, IS SENTENCED IN POISONING; COURTS: THE YOUTH PLEADS NO CONTEST TO 
ASSAULT CHARGE FOR PUTTING CAUSTIC SOLUTION IN TEACHER'S SODA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Littlerock high school student charged with trying to poison a teacher by 
pouring cleaning solution in her soda can pleaded no contest Monday in 
Lancaster Superior Court to one count of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old student, whose name was withheld because of his age, was 
sentenced to spend three to five months in a county youth probation camp. He 
will then be returned to his parents and remain on probation at least until he 
turns 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court referee Eugene E. Siegel also ordered the teen-ager to make 
restitution to the teacher, who was twice hospitalized after the incident, for 
her medical expenses and write her a letter of apology. The youth must also 
avoid all contact with the teacher, maintain at least a C average and good 
attendance in school, and obey all laws. 
</P>
<P>
 A second charge against the teen-ager -- adulterating a beverage -- was 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel handed down the sentence after a brief hearing in which the nature of 
the offense was debated. A prosecutor called the poisoning "a very heinous act" 
whose "consequences are continuing to this day." The defense attorney described 
it as "a practical joke that went sour." 
</P>
<P>
 In handing down the sentence, Siegel pointed out that the youth has the 
support of his family and no prior police record. "I'm not willing to brand him 
as a person who can never be rehabilitated," Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also told the youth: "If you commit any act that hurts someone, you 
have to pay for it." The Juvenile Court official warned the teen-ager that he 
will "go away for a long time" if he gets into trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager did not speak during the hearing except to enter his plea and to 
acknowledge that he was giving up his right to a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 His victim, English teacher Susan Ennis, 32, sat on the other side of the 
small courtroom. She asked Deputy Dist. Atty. David A. Jacobs to read a brief 
statement in which she referred to the poisoning as "a senseless act of 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
 In the hallway after the hearing, the teacher said, "I feel relieved that 
there's some resolution here, and hopefully there will be some rehabilitation 
for this young person." 
</P>
<P>
 The case began on April 7, just as Ennis had finished a lesson on John 
Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men." She took a last swig from her can of Diet Pepsi, 
which had been resting on an overhead projector stand, next to a bottle of 
cleaning solution. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher immediately felt a burning sensation in her throat and began 
vomiting. She was hospitalized for six days after the incident. She returned to 
the hospital later in the month for treatment of pneumonia, which she said was 
related to the poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis said she continues to have health problems linked to the poisoning. She 
said it has also affected her family, causing her three children to have 
nightmares. Her children protest, Ennis said, whenever she orders a soda. 
</P>
<P>
 "My own children are afraid for my life now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis has not been cleared by her physician to return to school. She hopes to 
resume teaching in the fall but has asked to be transferred to a different 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a week after the classroom incident, the 15-year-old student was 
arrested after he confessed to putting some of the cleaning fluid into Ennis' 
soda can. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant's parents made no statements during Monday's hearing. Afterward, 
the youth's attorney, Ronald V. Taylor, said the incident was a misguided 
practical joke that had been blown out of proportion by reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody's made too much of the whole thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs, the prosecutor, disagreed. "We must treat this very seriously," he 
said after the hearing. "If you can't be safe at school, where can you be 
safe?"

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: BOGUS CARDS USED TO ROB ACCOUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sophisticated band of thieves has been cleaning out bank accounts in Simi 
Valley and the San Fernando Valley using camcorders, computers and receipts 
dropped by careless ATM customers, police and federal agents said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bandits park a van or camper within sight of an automated teller machine 
and videotape ATM customers' fingers as they punch in their personal 
identification numbers, according to a report by Simi Valley Police Detective 
Steven DeLamater. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they read the account number off the customer's discarded receipt and 
make a bogus ATM card using a laptop computer and card programmer in the 
vehicle, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, DeLamater reports, they read the customer's code number off the 
videotape and use it and the fake card to steal money from the account. The 
thefts usually are not discovered until the customer's monthly statement 
arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each transaction is worth $200 to $300, depending on the particular bank -- 
they each have a limit on how much you can pull out at a time," Simi Valley 
Police Sgt. Bob Gardner said. Detectives have no solid leads yet, but are 
working with banks to get a look at security camera pictures of people using 
the ATMs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley detectives are working on the cases with the Secret Service, a 
branch of the U. S. Treasury Department that enforces some banking laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't give you an awful lot of information because we do have an open 
case," said Jim Bauer, spokesman for the Secret Service in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Working for the past two months on cases from Riverside to Ventura County, he 
said, "we've made some arrests in schemes like that and anticipate more 
arrests."  
</P>
<P>
 Bauer said the Secret Service is trying to persuade the Treasury Department to 
change the law requiring banks to print customers' account numbers on ATM 
receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should be attentive to -- if they don't want to retain the receipt -- 
at least disposing of it," he added. MACK REED

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: UNIVERSAL CITY; NEW CHILD-CARE CENTER OPENS ON STUDIO LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was not MCA/Universal's latest summer action-thriller that drew film 
executives, movie actors and political types to a Monday reception that 
featured apple juice sip-its and boxes of raisins on tables decorated with 
racially diverse dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it was the opening of a state-of-the-art child-care center to serve 
MCA Inc. employees who need day care for their infants and preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the day care offers what one would expect from a child-care 
center -- albeit a very modern, thoughtfully designed one. 
</P>
<P>
 In the playrooms, there are blocks, crayons and Munchkin-sized kitchen sets. 
But here and there, the fact that the place was built by a show-biz and 
home-entertainment giant becomes apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 A toy cellular phone rests on the counter in the 3-year-olds' play room. 
Computers have been provided so that 4- and 5-year old children can experiment 
with game software. And the circular teachers' lounge is well-appointed with 
trendy '50s style furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best child-care center I have seen in L.A.," declared Los Angeles 
City Council President John Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
 The child-care center, set into a hill on the Universal City Studios lot, was 
built at a cost of about $3.5 million, said Stuart K. Mandel, MCA vice 
president of industrial relations. Janet L. Wood, MCA vice president of human 
resources, and architect Mark Rios said the company undertook the project about 
four years ago, and built the center in nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 The center can take as many as 120 children, and still has slots available for 
preschool-age enrollees, center director Linda Bird-Davies said. Fees are on a 
sliding scale ranging from $85 to $150 a week, depending on the income of the 
parents and the age of the child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would feel safe leaving Lucy here," said Steve Galloway, a music video 
executive with MCA Records, who watched his 16-month-old daughter draw with 
crayons. "The interaction with kids here would be very positive. And I could 
come here for lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 What puts the center on the cutting edge is the way it is tailored to the 
skill levels and needs of different age groups, Bird-Davies explained.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, the waist-high doors separating the toddler play room and an 
administrative area are made of a clear material, so that the youngster can see 
his or her teacher and know what is happening. The "cozy reading area" for 4- 
and 5-year old children includes a tiny couch, a magazine rack and posters 
mounted at thigh-level. 
</P>
<P>
 Brittany Ashton Holmes, 5, a child actor in Universal Pictures' upcoming "The 
Little Rascals," plopped herself into one of the armchairs and put her feet up 
on a dainty ottoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so cute!" she squealed. "I love it." KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; FREE PROGRAM OFFERS QUAKE TIPS TO SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior citizens can get free advice and help in preparing for earthquakes 
under a new program set up by the Valley Storefront Multiservice Center for 
Seniors in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had so many seniors who were so devastated by the earthquake, who lost 
their homes and belongings," said Rena Snyder, a casework supervisor with the 
Valley Storefront, which is run by the Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to go into their homes and help them protect themselves in the 
next one," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new Earthquake Survival Project, the Valley Storefront will send out 
volunteers to visit the homes of seniors and give suggestions about needed 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers also will help them determine the safest places in their residence 
during a quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look around the home and see what can be done for protection -- for 
instance, if a mirror is over the bed, or other things that should be moved to 
a safer area," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the visit, the volunteers will give the seniors an earthquake 
preparedness kit, which includes items such as a flashlight, water and a first 
aid kit. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said it is hoped that the visits will alleviate some of the anxiety 
seniors have felt since the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is open to people 60 and older who live in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 To schedule a visit, call Phyllis Waxman at the Valley Storefront in North 
Hollywood at (818) 984-1380. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; PEACE CORPS WORKERS RECALL MALAWI EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty years ago in a small village in Malawi, Art Weinstein of Granada Hills 
established a health clinic to provide medical care and education to the 
mothers and babies of Namitambo, where the infant mortality rate was alarmingly 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, more than half the babies born in Namitambo died before they reached a 
year old. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein, years later, discovered that the clinic he helped build had become 
a renowned community health center, where medical professionals from all over 
southeastern Africa come to learn how public health care can be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic is one of Weinstein's proudest achievements -- an experience made 
possible through his three-year stay with the Peace Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, when Weinstein was 21, he and a group of 36 young men and women 
headed to Malawi on a mission to combat tuberculosis. Last weekend, these 
volunteers congregated at Cal State Long Beach to reminisce and discuss plans 
for their Friends of Malawi organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Saturday morning, we sat around in a group circle and each person talked 
about our experiences since Peace Corps," Weinstein said. "I told everyone that 
I feel so lucky to have been part of this group and that I've dreamed of 
meeting everyone again." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein said he was especially happy about reuniting with his roommate, whom 
he calls achimwene wanga , or brother of mine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Granada Hills resident decided to join the Peace Corps after President 
John F. Kennedy's assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was that feeling of compassion for the President and a desire to do 
something good for the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein was first sent to Chiradzulu, a mountainous village, where he and 
his Peace Corps partner were responsible for vaccinating and monitoring 1,000 
people for TB. 
</P>
<P>
 As he traveled around Malawi, he noticed that Namitambo was in dire need of a 
baby clinic. He managed to finagle funds from the U. S. Embassy -- a meager 
$2,600 -- to build the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 He originally was scheduled to stay in Malawi for two years, but when he found 
out that the funding for the clinic would be terminated without a Peace Corps 
volunteer there to oversee it, he signed on for another year. "I just couldn't 
walk away from it," Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Weinstein is an attorney for the State Compensation Insurance Fund, 
after spending 17 years in the Los Angeles County Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Peace Corps gave him the opportunity to learn that he had talents 
he never knew he had, in such areas as community work and even architecture. 
Weinstein drew up the blueprints for the Malawi clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Dina, said she is looking forward to visiting Malawi, a trip 
scheduled for 1996, when the couple's youngest son graduates from high school, 
to see all the places Art Weinstein has been talking about for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although proud of her husband's accomplishments in Malawi, she said there has 
been one drawback: "He learned to like powdered milk," she lamented, recalling 
how every five years or so, he buys powdered milk, fixes up a batch and puts it 
in the refrigerator, hoping that no one in the family notices. MAKI BECKER

 A forgery suspect and a Glendale police officer were cut over the weekend when 
the suspect attempted to flee from a Glendale bank by crashing through a locked 
glass door. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorj Tahmaseyan, 24, of Glendale was taken to Thompson Memorial Hospital in 
Burbank after the incident, where he received six stitches on the forehead, 
said police spokesman Chahe Keuroghelian. 
</P>
<P>
 Tahmaseyan's head was cut after shards of glass crashed around him when he 
attempted to break down the door, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Police Agent Keith Soboleski, who was approaching the door, also 
received stitches at Thompson Memorial Hospital for a gash on his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The men were injured about 7:30 p.m. Friday after Tahmaseyan tried to cash a 
stolen $1,200 check using a false driver's license for identification at the 
Bank of America branch, 6400 San Fernando Road, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teller told her supervisor about the suspicious license, and the manager 
called police, Keuroghelian said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Soboleski arrived on the scene, Tahmaseyan tried to escape through the 
door, which the supervisor had locked to signal the close of the bank's 
business day, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tahmaseyan is being held in Glendale City Jail in lieu of $10,000 bail. He was 
booked on suspicion of possessing falsified documents and receiving stolen 
property. JENNIFER OLDHAM

<P>
 A pretrial hearing for a Burbank couple charged with various violations of the 
city animal code stemming from their dogs' attack on a woman as she was taking 
an afternoon stroll is set for July 21 in Burbank Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, Edward Ecock and Andrea Valente, pleaded not guilty Thursday to 
misdemeanor charges of violating the city's leash law, harboring a dangerous 
animal and operating a kennel without a license. 
</P>
<P>
 Two mixed-breed pit bulls owned by the couple mauled Donna J. Smith, an 
employee of the Walt Disney Co., as she walked near the intersection of Parish 
Place and Chandler Boulevard on May 12. Smith required about 80 stitches on her 
face. At the time of the attack, the dogs were being watched by Valente's 
8-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's dogs, Cheyane and Dutch, are being held at the Burbank Animal 
Shelter until a judge rules on their fate. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PRESIDENT OF PIERCE WANTS TO KEEP FARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pierce College should preserve every acre of its farmland, but erect buildings 
and plan commercial projects in other areas of the campus, according to a 
blueprint for the school being developed by Pierce President Mary Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 A rough master plan for the campus will be presented to Los Angeles Community 
College District trustees Wednesday, Lee said, in an effort to discourage 
proposals to sell or lease part of the 200 acres of pasture and crop fields to 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we do something constructive with the land, the temptation will be 
there to sell it," Lee said Monday, after presenting her ideas to Pierce 
faculty and staff representatives. "That land has been considered surplus in 
the past, but as a resource right in the middle of Los Angeles, it is something 
that must be saved." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee envisions about $85 million in campus improvements, including construction 
of a golf driving range, natural history museum, futuristic theater in which 
movies are projected onto a dome, science and agriculture displays and an 
equestrian center and trail. 
</P>
<P>
 No estimates for the potential revenues from such projects have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Buildings for health sciences and student services also are in the works, Lee 
said. Most new structures would be built in place of seldom-used agriculture 
buildings, such as the dairy and chicken coop. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Other priorities include air conditioning for classrooms and resurfacing the 
main parking lot. Funding for the non-commercial projects, Lee said, would be 
solicited from corporations and the state government. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who was appointed president of Pierce in April, told the group it is 
important to develop a master plan for the school, so fund raising is not done 
a piece at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 The main purpose of creating such a plan -- even if it is never finished -- is 
to begin finding ways to increase the popularity and commercial draw of the 
campus, so that "decisions about how to go commercial are not dictated to us," 
Lee said. Developers have floated proposals for turning parts of the farm into 
a golf course or an office complex, but none has been accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with declining enrollments, state budget cuts and a $2-million deficit, 
however, Pierce has begun looking for new revenues. Lee already has met 
informally with Pierce students and government, business and homeowner leaders 
to discuss her ideas for the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 She may have won over local homeowners, who often have been vocal critics of 
proposals to alter the farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to see open space preserved at Pierce, as an oasis," said Robert 
Gross, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization. "Mary Lee seems 
committed to maintaining and strengthening the need for the farm, and the 
community will be very pleased to know that." KURT PITZER

COURT ORDER STOPS CLEARING OF TREES TO MAKE WAY FOR DUMP EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Just four days after it began, expansion of the Sunshine Canyon Landfill was 
brought to an abrupt halt Monday when a judge ordered the dump's operator to 
stop work on the controversial project. 
</P>
<P>
 In a two-page ruling, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne told 
Browning Ferris Industries Inc. to stop cutting down more than 2,800 oak trees 
as it readies a wooded canyon north of Granada Hills for use as a garbage dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne's order -- which stems from a lawsuit filed by dump opponents -- came 
four days after Browning Ferris was granted permission to start the first phase 
of a 17-million-ton expansion. The judge will decide July 12 whether to make 
Monday's order permanent and reinstate a 1991 stay that was lifted earlier this 
month. Until then, Browning Ferris spokesman Arnie Berghoff said, the company 
"will abide by the law." 
</P>
<P>
 "But we think the lawsuit is literally without merit," he added. "The judge 
issued the restraining order because she really hadn't had a chance to look at 
the issues. We think she will lift it." 
</P>
<P>
 Berghoff did not know how many trees had been removed before work stopped at 
midday Monday, but opponents said more than half of the 2,850 oaks had been 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty vicious," said Rosemary Woodlock, an attorney for the North 
Valley Coalition of Concerned Citizens, which has pressed a variety of legal 
challenges against Browning Ferris. 
</P>
<P>
 Dump opponents protested Friday and Saturday outside the gates of the 
facility, portions of which are in both Los Angeles city and county. Only the 
county area would be expanded, and city officials oppose the dump expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson said the city will try to enforce an 
order barring Browning Ferris crews from using a small road in and out of the 
dump. City officials argue that Browning Ferris needs a city permit for heavy 
equipment to use the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Violating the order would be a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't obey the law, then somebody will make an arrest and make it 
stick," Bernson said. "I would hope the city would fully enforce the law." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent skirmishes are part of a decade-long fight over the landfill 
between Los Angeles city and county officials as well as between 
environmentalists and Browning Ferris, one of the nation's largest 
waste-management companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Browning Ferris proposed expanding the dump's capacity by 70 million 
tons. That plan was scaled back to 17 million tons and approved by the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In that same year, the dump ceased operation after its city permit expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials and the North Valley Coalition sued to overturn the 
original approval, claiming the environmental impact report did not adequately 
evaluate the dump's effect on the area. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1992 a judge agreed, telling Browning Ferris it should have included 
information about past health and zoning violations at the dump and should have 
used a county panel of natural resource experts to review the project. 
</P>
<P>
 When those conditions were apparently met, the board again voted to approve 
the expansion. But opponents again took their case to the judge, who agreed 
that the county should allow more public review of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 After the board approved the dump for the third time last November, the judge 
agreed that Browning Ferris and the county had met all his concerns. Earlier 
this month, he lifted a stay that had prevented any work from beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Launching a two-pronged legal challenge, the North Valley Coalition appealed 
that decision and then filed an entirely new lawsuit attacking county actions 
since the first complaint.

JUDGE FACES TRIAL IN MOLESTATION CASE; COURTS: CHARGES HAVE BEEN REDUCED IN 
CASE INVOLVING ATTORNEY WHO SAYS STANLEY SAMUEL FEINSTEIN FONDLED HER IN HIS 
OFFICE. 
</P>

 A trial date was set Monday for a veteran worker's compensation judge on 
misdemeanor charges of sexually molesting an attorney in his Van Nuys chambers, 
after another judge refused to reinstate felony charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Stanley Samuel Feinstein, 61, faces one count each of unlawful touching 
and false imprisonment for allegedly fondling a 40-year-old attorney during a 
March 28 visit to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office originally charged Feinstein with felony counts 
of false imprisonment and sexual battery, but those charges were reduced to 
misdemeanors following a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito on Monday denied a prosecutor's 
bid to reinstate the felony charges and set Aug. 5 as the date for Feinstein's 
trial to start in Los Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Feinstein faces a maximum of a year in jail for each of the 
misdemeanor counts, compared to a maximum four years in prison he would have 
faced on the sexual battery charge and three years on the charge of false 
imprisonment by violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, another judge ruled that the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office could continue to prosecute Feinstein, denying a motion by defense 
attorneys to remove the district attorney's office from the case. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials fired Feinstein from his job last month after he refused to 
cooperate with an internal investigation into the alleged incident. 
</P>
<P>
 During the preliminary hearing, the female attorney testified that Feinstein 
had invited her to his office at the State Office Building in the Van Nuys 
Government Center so that he could tell her the date of a lecture. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman testified that as she was about to leave, Feinstein told her to 
close the door because he had something else to tell her and, after she did, he 
attacked her by slamming her body up against a wall and fondling her.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; OFFICIALS DISCUSS NEED FOR CONTROVERSIAL SEPTIC WASTE DUMP 
SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Harry Sizemore, assistant director of the city Bureau of 
Sanitation, was interviewed by Times staff writer Tracey Kaplan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles aroused furious opposition last year when neighbors 
learned that hundreds of sewage-bearing trucks would be emptying their loads 
into a newly built dumping site for septic tank waste in the Sepulveda Basin, 
home of the San Fernando Valley's largest park. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, city officials delayed the opening of the nearly completed 
$2.3-million facility, which had been built without the intense public scrutiny 
that would have accompanied a full environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners are now putting together a comprehensive environmental report, 
including the impact of opening the Sepulveda Basin facility, as well as a 
study of alternative sites for the project.  
</P>
<P>
 Harry Sizemore, assistant director of the city Bureau of Sanitation, was 
interviewed by Times staff writer Tracey Kaplan regarding the technical side of 
the project. J. P. Ellman, vice president of the Board of Public Works and the 
only Valley resident on the five-member panel, answered policy questions about 
the facility.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What is the purpose of the facility?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: (Sizemore) There are two reasons -- to better monitor what goes into 
our sewage system, which we have to do under the federal Clean Water Act, and 
to get people on septic tanks to pay their fair share for the upkeep of the 
system.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What happens to the septic tank sewage now?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Sizemore) Right now, trucks collect sewage from septic tanks in places 
like Malibu and La Crescenta and put it down seven manholes throughout the city 
that feed into our sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
 There isn't any problem with what's discharged from the residences, with 
household waste. But there have been some pretty celebrated cases of illegal 
dumping of industrial waste and chemicals down the manholes. It's stuff that 
companies pay something like $500 per 42-barrel drum to be hauled to a 
hazardous-waste site. The problem is that anyone can come in the middle of the 
night and dump it down the manholes. We feel it happens. (Ellman) The 
non-sexist term is maintenance hole, not manhole.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: OK, so where are these maintenance holes located?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Sizemore) There's one Downtown, one on the Westside near LAX, one in 
Hollywood and four in the San Fernando Valley -- in North Hollywood, Sun 
Valley, next to Van Nuys Airport and on San Fernando Road. Four of the seven 
are unmonitored at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What sort of chemicals get dumped down the maintenance holes?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Sizemore) Things like cyanide, which is used in the jewelry business; 
chrome; cadmium; and copper, which you find in plating. Most businesses don't 
put anything in except what residences do. But take industrial metal finishers. 
Let's say they put bumpers for an automobile in a chemical bath. After they're 
done, the industry has to concentrate the chemicals to the point where they can 
be hauled off site to be reused or taken to a hazardous-waste landfill.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has the county exceeded the federal limits for any of those chemicals?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Sizemore) No, it's not such a problem that we're in violation of the law. 
Let's put this in perspective. Septic tank sewage only accounts for one-tenth 
of 1% of the entire system flow. Another way to put it is that only 25,000 
people in L.A. are on septic tanks, compared to 660,000 sewer connections. But 
this is the largest uncontrolled flow we have in our system now and we want to 
monitor it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you under pressure from the Environmental Protection Agency to do it?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Sizemore) No, but under the Clean Water Act, we're required to know what 
comes into our system, and this is a big question mark.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What will happen to the sewage at the facility, wherever it is ultimately 
located?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Sizemore) There will be six stalls for the trucks to discharge into. The 
sewage will go into a 60-inch pipe and bypass the Tillman treatment plant there 
at the basin, because it's already solid and Tillman separates water from 
solids. We'll take random samples from special taps as the stuff is discharged, 
then take it to a lab to be tested. We presume no one in their right mind would 
dump hazardous waste there when they could face very stiff penalties, including 
being put out of business, if we catch them.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What would the hours be? And how many trucks would you have a day?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Sizemore) The hours have not been set, but it is presumed we'll have 
extended hours, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. and on Saturday morning. We can do 36 
trucks an hour, or about 150 to 200 trucks a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why make all the trucks travel to the Valley? Isn't L.A . polluted enough?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Sizemore) They are already traveling. It's my understanding that most of 
the waste haulers are already located in the Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: You mentioned making septic-tank users pay their fair share. How will you 
do that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Sizemore) Right now, we only charge the haulers $1,700 a year for a permit 
to operate each truck, and we've issued only about 100 permits. That's only 
$170,000 a year. With the new system, we'll charge the haulers by the gallon, 
about 2.6 cents, or $2.5 million annually. We expect they'll pass that on to 
the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will bills go down as a result for residents and businesses hooked up to 
city sewers?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Sizemore) There will be a need for $2.5 million less. Let's see, if you 
divided $2.5 million by 660,000 customers, that would be $3.60 per year per 
customer.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: So, bills will go down by $3.60 per year?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Sizemore) Well, we haven't had a sewer connection increase for the last 
two years, although the fee has gone up from $8 or $9 in the mid-'80s to about 
$20 today. Maybe the fee won't go down, since there hasn't been an increase in 
awhile, but it won't go up as fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why was Sepulveda Basin chosen as the site of what some local residents 
call a "truck toilet"?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Ellman) For several reasons. The department controls a considerable amount 
of land at the basin because of the Tillman sewage treatment plant. The land 
was free, it's already used for sewage processing and there are department 
personnel there. And I guess we felt it was fairly central, right off 
Interstate 405. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the possibility of sewage spills because of earthquakes or 
flooding?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Ellman) First of all, we had an earthquake in January and the Sylmar quake 
in 1971, and we didn't have any problems. The spills we've had from our sewage 
collection system, for example our wet weather outflows into Ballona Creek, 
have come exclusively from small pipes, about eight inches in diameter. We've 
never had a large sewer block up. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What if the basin is closed because of flooding, as in 1992?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Sizemore) We could reopen the maintenance holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why wasn't there a full EIR done in the first place?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Ellman) Originally, there should have been a full EIR. Like Councilwoman 
Laura Chick, who raised the issue during her campaign, I think a lot of 
questions now being raised would have been answered. They are very valid 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't on the board then, but my understanding is that the Department of 
Public Works went through its environmental review and determined there wasn't 
a need for it because it wasn't a new use of the property, since Tillman was 
there already. There was notice given by the Planning Department that this was 
about to happen. There were two public hearings, at least one of which was in 
the community. I guess just not enough people were aware of what was going on. 
They went through the usual notice procedure and let everyone know within 500 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But hardly anyone lives within 500 feet of the site because the site is 
east of Woodley Avenue, south of Victory, inside the park, right?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Ellman) Yes, that was part of it.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think that the fact that there was no one on the board at the time 
who lived in the Valley played a role in the choice of site or lack of an EIR?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Ellman) It could have been a factor. I may be more aware of the concerns 
because I use the park than someone who doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are some of the issues being explored in the EIR?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Ellman) Before, there was nothing to prevent the trucks from driving down 
Burbank Boulevard or any route they chose. The EIR is looking at different 
designated routes, and there's a possibility that we could put in another 
access road closer to the 405 and get the trucks off Victory Boulevard faster. 
We're also looking at more than 20 alternative sites for the disposal center.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there really any chance that the facility will not open in the basin now 
that it's already been built?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Ellman) I think we need to leave our options open. There's always a 
no-project alternative but, whatever we do, we need to have one controlled and 
monitored facility. There's also the issue of should we have more than one 
facility, so it all wouldn't come to the Valley.

GLENDALE MEN GET 34-YEAR TERMS IN FIREBOMBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men convicted of firebombing a man's home after a fight were sentenced 
Monday to more than 34 years in a federal prison without the possibility of 
parole, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Angel Gomez, 21, and Jorge Lopez Camacho, 19, both of Glendale, stood 
trial last March for firebombing the home of a man who fought with Camacho 
earlier that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez and Camacho accosted four men on the street on Dec. 12, 1993, and 
Camacho beat one of the men badly and stabbed him several times in the head 
with a screwdriver, according to a statement issued by the U.S. Attorney's Los 
Angeles office. One of the others intervened and soundly beat Camacho, 
prosecutors said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gomez followed two of the men to an apartment house in the 1000 block of South 
Mariposa Street. He later met up with Camacho, and the two men siphoned 
gasoline from parked cars into 40-ounce beer bottles to make Molotov cocktails, 
which they hurled through the living room window of the man's apartment, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four people sleeping in the living room, including a 3-month-old infant, 
escaped unharmed before flames gutted the apartment, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Glendale Police officer spotted the two men running from the apartment, 
radioed for help and arrested them.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HEARING ON PIPELINE PLAN HELD; OIL: THE 
$150-MILLION PROJECT WOULD CARRY CRUDE 130 MILES THROUGH THE SANTA CLARITA AND 
SAN FERNANDO VALLEYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first public hearing on plans for a $150-million, 130-mile crude oil 
pipeline through the Santa Clarita and San Fernando valleys was held Monday 
night at Pyramid Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Public Utilities Commission and U.S. Forest Service, which have 
to approve the plans before construction can begin, sponsored the meeting at 
the Vista Del Lago Visitors Center, the first of four hearings scheduled for 
points along the proposed pipeline route from Bakersfield to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from government agencies began by describing the project -- a 
joint venture of Chevron, Texaco and other oil companies -- designed to deliver 
crude oil to refineries in El Segundo and Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil would first travel from the Point Arguello offshore field near Santa 
Barbara via an existing pipeline to the Bakersfield area. 
</P>
<P>
 If the new pipeline is built, it would provide an alternative to oil tanker 
traffic along that coast. By law, all tanker travel along that route is to end 
by Jan. 1, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the meeting, some officials expressed at least limited support for the 
plans. "We tried to stop the whole thing in the beginning," said Santa Clarita 
City Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy. "We wanted it tankered in, but that didn't 
turn out to be safer either." 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of residents from Kern and Los Angeles counties who attended the 
meeting raised concerns about the potential danger caused by a rupture from the 
20-inch underground pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake danger in this area is extreme," said Sally Reed, a member of 
the Sierra Club's Kern Kaweah chapter. "One of these days we're going to know 
that and have oil up and down the Grapevine for months," she warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Saletore, chair of the Santa Clarita Valley chapter of the Sierra Club, 
said before the meeting that the prospect of a pipeline makes her uneasy, 
especially in the wake of a spill from a pipe that ruptured in the Jan. 17 
earthquake, spilling 190,000 gallons of crude oil into the Santa Clara River. 
That spill killed about 700 animals and polluted 17 miles of the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "It concerns me that (the new pipeline) is going to be crossing the river 
there," she said. "Anytime you've got something that's crossing a waterway, 
you've got the potential for real problems. We saw that during the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Modern pipelines use steel and construction techniques that have improved 
significantly since pipes by other companies were installed decades ago, said 
Tom Rooney, an engineer for Pacific Pipeline System Inc., a co-sponsor of the 
project. He said the new pipelines are strong, but flexible, allowing them to 
withstand the shock of earthquakes and other hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the very reason for a new one," he said. "The one that got oil all 
over the place was built back around 1925." 
</P>
<P>
 The new 130-mile pipeline would generally follow The Golden State Freeway 
through the Angeles National Forest to Glendale, where it would turn south 
through Watts before reaching the refineries. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second proposed route for the pipeline. The original route called 
for an entirely new 171-mile pipeline across Ventura and Los Angeles counties 
close to State Highway 126, but that plan was abandoned as too costly after the 
Los Angeles City Council opposed it and the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency raised questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the pipeline is expected to take about 10 months and could be 
completed by the end of 1995 if approved, according to California Public 
Utilities Commission documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional meetings to discuss the project are scheduled today at Aragon 
Elementary School at 1118 Aragon Ave. in Los Angeles, Wednesday at the 
Wilmington Boys & Girls Club at 1444 West Q St., and Thursday at the San 
Fernando City Council Chambers, 117 McNeil St. All meetings begin at 7 p.m.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; AUTOMOBILE CLUB TO REBUILD DAMAGED BUILDING 
</P>

 A multimillion dollar office building open for less than two years has been 
resigned to the scrap pile thanks to the Northridge earthquake and shaken 
confidence in the ability of steel-framed structures to withstand such quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Directors of The Automobile Club of Southern California have voted to demolish 
and rebuild its two-story building along Valencia Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure, open for only 21 months before the quake struck, has had a 
yellow warning tape encircling it since late January. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main concern is safety," said Layna Browdy, corporate communications 
manager for the Automobile Club. "The building you see there is heavily 
damaged." 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about steel-frame buildings and the belief that a new structure is 
stronger than a repaired one also prompted the decision, club officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt, given another earthquake, we could be in danger," said Kelly B. 
Clark, district manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel was once considered excellent protection against temblors, bending but 
not breaking under seismic shaking. But weld connections cracked in the beams 
and columns of at least 90 such buildings during the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these structures were in the San Fernando Valley and the Westside of 
Los Angeles, but Santa Clarita had steel-frame casualties of its own. In 
addition to the Automobile Club, the nearby City Hall was badly damaged as was 
an office building for U.S. Borax. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vertical beams bent and didn't come back how they were supposed to," 
Clark said of the damage to the Valencia building. "They didn't come back 
erect." 
</P>
<P>
 Automobile Club officials would not say how much it cost to build their local, 
16,000-square-feet structure in 1992 or how much they plan to spend to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately following the earthquake, employees of the organization worked out 
of a motor home on a dirt lot. More recently, they have operated out of 
3,000-square-feet of space in a Newhall office building.

SIZZLE IS HERE TO STAY; UTILITIES, FARMERS, PET OWNERS SWEAT FORECAST OF 
CONTINUING HEAT WAVE 
</P>

 As searing heat persists for the sixth straight day today with no relief in 
sight, the electric company is straining to meet demand, farmers are 
frantically watering and air conditioning repair companies are stretching their 
waiting lists.  
</P>
<P>
 So many air conditioners were purring Monday that they created a near record 
demand for power and overburdened electrical transformers, causing scattered 
outages throughout the day and forcing the Southern California Edison Co. to 
place repair crews on standby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody turned on the air conditioners on at the same time," said Edison 
spokesman Criss Brown. At 3 p.m. Monday, the Edison system reached a peak power 
demand of 17,166 megawatts, unpleasantly close to the 18,413 megawatt record 
set Aug. 17, 1992, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 4 p.m. Sunday, 40 transformers had failed in Orange County, causing 400 
homes to lose power for up to four hours while Edison made repairs.  
</P>
<P>
 The inaugural heat wave also prompted many people to turn on air conditioners 
for the first time in months, only to find that they needed repair. When they 
called air conditioning firms for help, they often learned that they could be 
put on a fast-growing waiting list for service later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants (service) right away, but everybody is booked up right now," 
said Russ Bushman at B&P Services in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Some callers displayed creativity, said Gordon Graham, co-owner of Graham 
Brothers in Costa Mesa. "You would be surprised how many people have elderly 
parents or grandmothers coming home from the hospital who need air 
conditioning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meteorologists on Monday could foresee no end to the unseasonably hot weather, 
which they said is more typical in the late summer with the coming of the Santa 
Ana winds. Temperatures reached 95 degrees in El Toro on Monday, meteorologist 
Curtis Brack said, a little cooler than over the weekend because of a high 
cloud layer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a slight reprieve," Brack said. "But we are looking for things to 
warm up three to four degrees in most places (today) and one or two degrees 
more the next day." He said that although there may be a slight cooling by the 
weekend, "there is no major sign of this high pressure system breaking down." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that the hot air was relatively clean. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County is about the only area in the South Coast Air Basin that is not 
choking on smog," said Sam Atwood, spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District. While a first-stage smog alert was called in Los Angeles 
County, air quality in Orange County on Monday was rated "good to moderate," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 People flocked to the coast to enjoy the sea breezes, said Lt. John Blauer, 
lifeguard watch commander at Newport Beach, which had 85,000 people Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 But because of the heat, "people are spending more time in the water and are 
more apt to tire themselves out," he said. And that, combined with riptides, 
required lifeguards to make between 20 and 30 rescues Monday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While soaring temperatures prompted most to take it easy, it added to the work 
of Orange County farmers, several of whom have drastically stepped up 
irrigation to protect heat- and sun-sensitive crops such as green peppers, 
tomatoes and strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been keeping the water running around our fields 24 hours a day since 
Friday," said Alan Reynolds, general manager for Treasure Farms, which 
cultivates 1,200 acres in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The heat also can pose a menace to pets, warned Dr. Richard Evans, chief of 
veterinary services for the Orange County Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said people who pick up stray dogs and cats sometimes put them in 
unventilated boxes that they stash in the back seats or trunks of their cars 
before driving sometimes long distances to the county animal shelter in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, he said, is that the animals arrive suffering from heat stroke. 
Hot Stuff 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's June weather usually hovers between 73 and 75 degrees. While 
no records were broken, the past week has been unseasonably warm, and no relief 
is anticipated for the next several days.

</P>
<P>
 The elderly and young are especially susceptible to heat-related problems, but 
people of all ages should take steps to avoid them: 
</P>
<P>
 Limit activity: Peak heat hours are 2 p.m.-5 p.m.; exercise or work outside 
early in the morning or late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoid hot spots: Surfaces such as asphalt tend to absorb heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Get acclimated: Problems can occur during the first days of a heat wave if you 
don't reduce normal physical activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Be aware: At the first signs of fatigue or lightheadedness, find a cool spot, 
drink water and rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoid dehydration: Drink a variety of noncaffeinated beverages. 
</P>
<P>
 Limit or avoid alcohol: Alcohol depletes body fluids and speeds dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
 Remain cool: Stay in air-conditioned buildings as much as possible. Remember 
children and pets: Never leave them in a car during hot weather. The inside of 
a closed car can reach 130 degrees in 30 minutes.

STATE SENATE OKS BERGESON'S '1-STRIKE' BILL; CRIME: THE MEASURE IS SENT TO THE 
ASSEMBLY ON A 33-0 VOTE. IF ENACTED, IT WOULD SLAP FIRST-TIME CHILD MOLESTERS 
AND SOME RAPISTS WITH SENTENCES OF 25 YEARS TO LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Reacting to election-year public ire over crime, the Senate on Monday night 
unanimously approved an Orange County lawmaker's bill that would slap 
first-time child molesters and some rapists with sentences of 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate voted 33-0 to send the so-called "one-strike" legislation carried 
by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) to the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson began carrying the bill at the behest of Gov. Pete Wilson, who has 
made the rape measure a centerpiece of his election-year fight on crime. She 
portrayed the measure as the strongest effort to deal with sexual predators in 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three strikes is too many -- their first strike should be their last," 
Bergeson said, adding that "it is time to portray rapists and child molesters 
for what they are -- dangerous felons who should not be allowed to repeat their 
crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 When first proposed, the bill called for a blanket sentence of life without 
the possibility of parole for nearly all sex offenses. That tough stance drew 
broad attacks from civil libertarians and other groups, including some district 
attorneys and women's organizations, who said the measure was so harsh it might 
actually hinder prosecutions or prompt rapists to kill their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 After an abortive attempt to push the measure through committee in April, 
Bergeson redrafted the bill to delete all references to sentences of life 
without parole, substituting a penalty of 25 years to life for most serious 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 As now drafted, a rapist or child molester could get the maximum sentence of 
25 years to life only if one of the following circumstances applied: The victim 
was kidnaped; he or she suffered great bodily injury; the rape was committed 
during a burglary; a deadly weapon was used; multiple victims were attacked, or 
the rapist had a previous felony conviction for a sex offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current law, the penalties for various sex crimes range from three to 
eight years in prison, but most prisoners are paroled after serving about half 
their sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson's measure could face tough scrutiny in the Assembly's Public Safety 
Committee, a longtime burial ground for tough anti-crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Her bill also will be competing against one sponsored by Assemblyman Bob Epple 
(D-Cerritos), who chairs the Assembly Public Safety Committee. Epple's measure 
would apply a life sentence only when rape was committed during a kidnaping or 
residential burglary at the same time that a weapon was used or a victim 
suffered great bodily harm.

2 TEENS CALLED 'CRAFTY' KILLERS IN TAY SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The last two teen-agers facing charges in the 1992 New Year's Eve slaying of 
honor student Stuart A. Tay are "crafty young men" trying to blame others for 
their involvement in the brutal murder, a prosecutor told jurors Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park and Kirn Kim, 18, of Fullerton claim they 
were tricked into participating in the slaying and were unaware that a murder 
was planned. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis Rosenblum told jurors that Acosta and 
Kim joined three other teen-agers in planning and carrying out the ambush. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew all along they were going to kill him," Rosenblum told the Orange 
County Superior Court jury. "Their whole goal was to kill Stuart Tay, and 
that's what they did." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution contends that Acosta was first to strike Tay, with a baseball 
bat, while Kim sat in a car nearby, acting as a look out. Tay, 17, of Orange, 
was murdered because the teen-agers feared he would double-cross them during a 
planned robbery of a computer-parts dealer, the prosecution said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys are expected to present their closing arguments today, and 
the jury is expected to begin deliberating Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other teen-agers have already been convicted of murdering Tay. A 
separate jury took just two hours in May to convict Robert Chan, 19, of 
Fullerton, of orchestrating the murder. Mun Bong Kang, 19, of Fullerton, 
pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in May. Both face life in prison without 
parole when sentenced later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Choe, now 18 and also of Fullerton, was the only teen-ager prosecuted 
as a juvenile in Tay's murder. Choe, who pleaded guilty in February, 1993, and 
agreed to testify against his former co-defendants, is expected to be released 
from the California Youth Authority when he turns 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim and Acosta are each charged with first-degree murder and the so-called 
special-circumstance allegation that the attackers were lying in wait. Acosta 
additionally was charged with committing the slaying for financial gain because 
Chan paid him $100. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants attended Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay, a student at Foothill High School in Santa Ana, was lured to Acosta's 
home in Buena Park under the guise of buying a handgun. He was beaten 
unconscious with baseball bats. Rubbing alcohol was poured down his throat, and 
his nose and mouth were then taped shut. He was buried in a shallow grave in 
Acosta's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Denise Gragg presented evidence during the trial that 
Acosta is a mentally disabled youth who was duped into believing he would 
strike Tay in the back of the neck once to scare him -- but not hard enough to 
seriously hurt him -- as part of a prank. Prosecutors and defense attorneys say 
Chan then stepped in and beat the helpless teen-ager unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Allan H. Stokke told jurors that Kim was not a witness to the 
attack and had no idea that a murder was even planned. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosenblum told jurors that Acosta and Kim helped dig Tay's grave the day 
before the slaying and were present during "planning" meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are crafty young men," Rosenblum told the jury.

SAN ONOFRE PLAN GENERATES HEATED DEBATE; UTILITIES: PROPOSAL TO CLOSE PLANT 15 
YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE IS EXPECTED TO DRAW OPPOSITION FROM SCE, LABOR UNION AT 
HEARING TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 State officials seeking the early closure of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating 
Station will present their case at a public hearing here tonight, with fierce 
opposition expected from the utility company that owns the plant and the labor 
union representing its 2,500 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those employees who want to protect their jobs live in South County or 
northern San Diego County. Union officials argue that the plant represents an 
economic benefit of more than $250 million a year to surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, the Utility Workers Union of America has lobbied city councils, 
claiming that closing the plant by 1998 -- 15 years ahead of schedule -- would 
be another crippling blow to an area already ravaged by recession. 
</P>
<P>
 And last week, in a show of support for the union and Southern California 
Edison, which owns the plant, the San Clemente City Council voted to support 
keeping San Onofre open. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's meeting will begin at 7 in the San Clemente City Council chambers. 
Another public hearing is set for 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at Fullerton High School. 
Both hearings will be conducted by an administrative law judge, with a final 
decision by the state Public Utilities Commission expected by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1967, the San Onofre plant now supplies 12% of the power used by 
customers of Southern California Edison, which serves residents throughout the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison owns about 75% of the plant, which features two 
huge domes visible along the coast south of San Clemente. San Diego Gas & 
Electric owns 20%, with utilities in Anaheim and Riverside owning less than 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say the cost of operating the plant is far too high and could easily 
be reduced by turning to alternative energy sources, including solar power, 
natural gas and even agricultural waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could save the ratepayers more than $1 billion over the remaining life of 
the plant," which is scheduled to close in the year 2013, said Robert Kinosian, 
spokesman for the Division of Ratepayer Advocates, a department of the PUC. 
</P>
<P>
 DRA attorney Irene Moosen said the division reports to the PUC commissioner 
but acts solely on behalf of ratepayers at hearings where utility rates are 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinosian's group encountered stiff opposition when the future of San Onofre 
was last discussed, in 1992. The outcome of that round of hearings was the 
closure of Unit 1, the oldest of the plant's three operating reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 "By forcing the closure of Unit 1, we saved ratepayers $130 million a year," 
Kinosian said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Southern California Edison officials argue that merely converting to other 
forms of energy, such as gas-powered facilities, would cost far more than would 
be saved by shutting down San Onofre 15 years early. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials point to the economic damage from the loss of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the jobs involved, such as health physics technician or nuclear 
control operator, would not be transferable to other industries," said Carl 
Wood, business agent for Local 246 of the Utility Workers Union of America. 
"Our annual payroll of $120 million would be gone, wiped out, eliminated," Wood 
said. "You'd have have a half-a-billion-dollar loss in business activity in 
Orange and San Diego counties alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Kinosian counters by saying that millions of dollars in savings would more 
than offset the loss of jobs at San Onofre or the money its workers would spend 
in surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, it would take away from employees at the power plant," he said, "but 
the enormous savings would go to ratepayers, and every other business in the 
region would be dramatically better off because of lower electric bills." 
</P>
<P>
 Units 2 and 3 at San Onofre cost as much as $600 million a year to operate, 
Kinosian said, whereas alternative forms of energy, such as gas-powered plants, 
some of which were mothballed years ago, would account for the savings he 
envisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Wambold, manager of business and finance for Edison's nuclear department, 
said the company plans to show during public hearings that Kinosian's group is 
"way off base" in making such claims. 
</P>
<P>
 In converting to new or different forms of energy, Wambold said, the capital 
outlay attached to start-up costs "manages to defeat Kinosian's argument 
single-handedly." 
</P>
<P>
 The Alliance for Survival, an environmental group based in Santa Ana, plans to 
speak in support of closing the plant early, citing high costs and the ongoing 
risk of a nuclear accident, such as those at the Three Mile Island plant in 
Pennsylvania in 1979 and at the Chernobyl plant in the former Soviet Union in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials for Southern California Edison say the conversion to other forms 
of energy, such as natural gas, would contribute to air pollution. Nuclear 
power, they argue, is free of air pollution.

VALEDICTORIAN SPEAKS HER PIECE 52 YEARS AFTER THE FACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amy Uchimoto Naito finished first in her high school class, but it took 52 
years for her to actually walk the stage in cap and gown and collect her honors 
as valedictorian.  
</P>
<P>
 Less than a month before Naito's scheduled graduation from Armijo High School 
in Fairfield, Calif., in 1942, she and her family were sent to an internment 
camp, as were more than 100,000 people of Japanese ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a century later -- after Naito had finished college, done a stint in the 
Army, borne four children and retired from nearly two decades as an elementary 
school teacher -- Armijo High honored her at this year's graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the troubles and anxiety and turmoil we were going through (in 
1942), the only comfort I had was that I was expecting this diploma with this 
little gold seal (for honor roll), and when I didn't receive it I was very 
devastated," remembered Naito, 69, who lives in Costa Mesa. "That was the one 
thing I was looking forward to. There weren't too many things to look forward 
to -- we knew that evacuation was coming down the road. I was hoping we would 
still be around at least through the graduation ceremony, but that was not to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciate it very much that it is coming to me now." 
</P>
<P>
 Armijo High Principal Rae Lanpheir heard Naito's story earlier this spring 
from a Fairfield man who knows her son and decided immediately to do something 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 After discussions with the students in Armijo's Class of 1994, Lanpheir 
arranged for Naito to speak at the high school's June 10 graduation, an honor 
she'd been denied during her senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she was showered with gifts: two Olympic-style medals for 
academic achievement, a special valedictorian's watch, the 1942 yearbook she 
had never received, an honor sash and the gold seal on her diploma that top 
students earn. The mayor of Fairfield even gave her a key to the city, and some 
members of the Class of '42 were there to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something wrong and it had to be made right," Lanpheir said, 
explaining why he wanted to bring Naito back for graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was awesome beyond belief to know that you've taken 50 years of pain and 
turned that around," he said. "What it has done for this community is to prove 
that we care about people -- it doesn't matter who you are, what color you are, 
what faith you are -- we're interested in the human mind, the human spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Naito, the third of four children of Japanese immigrant parents, was born and 
raised in Fairfield -- then a sleepy village of about 1,300. In May, 1942, 
government officials swooped down in a flourish, Naito recalled, sending her 
family and other Japanese Americans in Fairfield to a so-called evacuation 
center in Turlock, Calif. Eventually, Naito, her father, mother, sister and two 
brothers were transferred to a camp near the Gila River in Arizona, where Naito 
and her family spent about 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten other Japanese American students from her Armijo High class also were sent 
to one of the government's 10 internment camps, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school did send Naito her diploma in 1942, but it did not note her 
academic success. It was not until Lanpheir telephoned a few months ago that 
Naito discovered she had been valedictorian.

 "My parents had always placed a huge premium on education. That was the first 
thing my mother would tell us in the morning, 'Do well at school.' And then the 
first thing she would ask us when we got back was, 'How did you do at school?' 
" recalled Naito, who played basketball, baseball and volleyball and 
represented the Girls' Athletic Society in student government while at Armijo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that I must do that to please my parents as well as myself," she said. 
"So when I did not get the honor I had looked for, I was very, very crushed." 
</P>
<P>
 Naito was able to leave the internment camp along with other high-achieving 
teen-agers through a program that sent Japanese Americans to Midwestern and 
East Coast colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 She attended Boston University and later was trained as an occupational 
therapist in Wisconsin, then served as a second lieutenant in the Women's 
Medical Specialist Corps and worked at a variety of military hospitals. After 
marrying, Naito returned to California in 1960; she taught for 17 years in the 
Cypress School District, retiring in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 As Naito returned to her birthplace for the first time in decades earlier this 
month, a crowd of about 4,000 feted her at graduation with cheers of "Way to 
go, Amy!" and a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, she visited her 98-year-old mother in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took all the awards that I got and showed them to her, and she was very 
impressed," Naito said softly. "I said, 'Mom, do you remember how I felt in 
camp when I did not get my awards?' and she said, 'Yes, you were very 
disappointed.' I said, 'Well, Mom, I guess if one waits long enough, things 
work out in the end.' And she said, 'Yes, that's true.' "

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; CITY REWARDS CENTER FOR WORK BY SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The way Councilman Jeffrey Thomas sees it, when you a need a job done right, 
rely on the city's senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas was referring to a 9-month-old program that has volunteers from the 
Tustin Area Senior Center stuffing and mailing the city's water bills. In 
recognition of their efforts, the council recently approved a $3,800 donation 
to the senior center. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're reliable and they work real hard," Thomas said of the senior 
volunteers. "I think that's a great thing for the city. I wish we would utilize 
seniors more. It saves the city money and helps the city out. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they've gotten the bills out on time, too," Thomas added. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the volunteer mailing program arose after the city experienced 
difficulties with an outside vendor, Finance Director Ronald A. Nault said. But 
since the seniors took over the task in October, there hasn't been a single 
complaint from water customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The senior volunteers take their job quite seriously and are very 
conscientious about their work," he said, adding that the center also benefits 
because of the city donation. 
</P>
<P>
 Recreation Supervisor Randy Westrick estimated that about four or five seniors 
working for six hours are able to mail out 2,000 bills each week. "That's a lot 
of work they do," Westrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Center Director Melissa O'Neal said the volunteer program was initially 
seen as an interim measure "to buy time until we got a new vendor." But the 
volunteer effort will continue indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't think it was going to be so successful," O'Neal said. "It's so easy 
for these people to do, and they do it so well. And they love doing it. They 
really get a kick out of coming." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal said money received by the center for the volunteer work helps offset 
the cost of providing outreach counseling services to seniors suffering from 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The funding also supports a counseling 
group that focuses on the challenges of growing older. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior volunteers organize themselves, O'Neal said, with some working for 
long stretches of time and others working for an hour or so until their hands 
and eyes start to tire.  
</P>
<P>
 "Today they're just slamming," O'Neal said Monday, noting that some of the 
seniors wanted to finish the job early so they could get out of town for the 
Fourth of July weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The water bill mailing program is just one example of how seniors help out in 
Tustin, O'Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The senior center is only possible because of volunteers," she said, pointing 
out that they answer phones, cook food for a nutritional program and visit 
shut-ins. Seniors also donate time to the Tustin Police Department, where they 
help out with record-keeping and work as crossing guards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're terrific," said Councilman Thomas. "I really do." ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; COUNCIL PONDERS FATE OF CHARITIES CENTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight may decide what to do with the Multiservices Center, 
a city-owned building that is home to about two dozen social service groups and 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
 The city loses $65,000 a year operating the center.Some officials have 
suggested closing it and scattering the tenants to other city offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit agencies oppose the idea and say the city is best served by 
clustering its major charities in one location. 
</P>
<P>
 The agencies -- which provide such services as child care, drug-prevention 
classes, temporary housing and family counseling -- pay rents far below market 
rates at the center, which is located on Jamboree Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency officials said that by arranging the groups in one location, the city 
has created a "synergy" that allows clients to get information about the 
various services available in the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council earlier this month asked city budget officials for more 
information on where the agencies would be moved if the council decided to 
close the center. Some city finance commissioners suggested moving the agencies 
to empty offices in City Hall and offices in the maintenance yard. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is not enough city office space for all the charities. Some groups 
would be forced to rent office space elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the operating losses, the Multiservices Center needs earthquake 
retrofitting and $400,000 worth of repairs to the air conditioning system. 
</P>
<P>
 Also this evening, the council will discuss the fate of the Buffalo Ranch. The 
Irvine Co. and Orange County Fair Board are now considering a plan to move 
buildings at the one-time amusement park to the fairgrounds. Some 
preservationists oppose the move, saying the ranch should stay intact. SHELBY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; REVOLUTIONARY WAR DAYS TO BE RELIVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fourth of July celebrants who want to look beyond fireworks can experience the 
Revolutionary War and the 1770s lifestyle when the Southern California 
Community of Colonial Arts sets up a "living history" encampment across from 
Knott's Berry Farm this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 History buffs from around the region will don period dress and demonstrate the 
tools and crafts that helped people survive this country's early years. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors can wander through the encampment free of charge from 9 a.m. to 6 
p.m. Saturday, Sunday and Monday. The camp will be on the grounds of 
Independence Hall across Beach Boulevard from Knott's. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants, who call themselves "historical re-enactors," are steeped in the 
daily minutiae and the trends of the era, according to Vickie Emanuel, a Moreno 
Valley teacher who will play the part of a craftsman's wife and colonial 
schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors are glad to take some time from their weaving, spinning or 
blacksmithing to answer questions about their crafts and their historical 
personas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better than a textbook, because you can see how things were back then," 
Emanuel said. Women, for instance, often were the doctors of the community, she 
said. Actors at the camp will mix the herbs and ointments families used for 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 to 50 colonists are expected to camp on the grounds, muskets at the 
ready. The colonial militia, or Minutemen, frequently did not have uniforms, 
but the actors will wear period dress and be prepared to skirmish with the 
Redcoats. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Henry and other historical re-enactors will also be on hand to inspire 
the Minutemen. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: JUDGE ORDERS RELEASE OF YOUTH OFFENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge issued an order Monday allowing the early release of almost four dozen 
juvenile offenders to ease overcrowding at the county's correctional facilities 
for youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the order by Presiding Juvenile Court Judge Frank F. Fasel, probation 
officials may release 44 prisoners from the Probation Department's three camps: 
the Youth Guidance Center in Santa Ana, the Joplin Youth Center in Trabuco 
Canyon and the Los Pinos Conservation Camp off Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The camps, which have 310 beds, are filled to capacity, while Juvenile Hall -- 
which has 374 beds -- currently houses 418 youths. Recently, administrators 
have brought in cots to handle the overcrowding problem there. 
</P>
<P>
 Youths from Juvenile Hall will be sent to the three camps to open up space 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Juvenile Hall Director Tom Wright said the early releases will begin today, 
adding that only youths incarcerated for probation violations would be 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Once released, they will be placed in a daily supervision program under a 
probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a kind of house arrest," Wright said. "But it's only available to a kid 
who has fully cooperated with the program, like attending classes or being 
involved in a vocational program." 
</P>
<P>
 Overcrowding at the county's youth correctional facilities has plagued 
Probation Department officials as the number of youths arrested for violent 
crimes has soared during the past five years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 To manage the crisis, authorities expanded Juvenile Hall by 60 beds in 1992. 
Officials plan to construct 30 more beds at Juvenile Hall this year, but 
Probation Department officials said that 200 more beds will be needed by the 
year 2000.DAVAN MAHARAJ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; NEW LAW SETS TERMS FOR TATTOO PARLORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has passed an ordinance allowing tattoo businesses in certain 
commercial locations if they meet specific criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Strange, senior planner, said that under the new ordinance, which will 
go into effect late next month, a tattoo business must meet three criteria: 
</P>
<P>
 * Must not be within 200 feet of any lot zoned for residential use; 
</P>
<P>
 * Must not be within 500 feet of any church or school and; 
</P>
<P>
 * Must not be within 1,000 feet of any other adult business, such as a massage 
parlor. 
</P>
<P>
 Strange also said his department has received several calls from people 
wanting to open a tattoo parlor. He said he expects a number of applications 
for a conditional-use permit once the ordinance goes into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also approved a companion ordinance establishing health 
regulations for tattoo parlors.  
</P>
<P>
 The city currently has one tattoo parlor.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HIJACKING ARREST MADE; TRUCK FOUND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police have arrested one man and recovered a new $28,000 truck that had been 
stolen at gunpoint about two days earlier during a test drive from a local auto 
dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Negrete II, 24, of Fullerton, was taken into custody about 4 a.m. 
Sunday on suspicion of grand-theft auto and carrying someone away for the 
purpose of committing a robbery, Westminster Police Sgt. Mark Groh said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster police, after receiving information about the location of the 
stolen GMC truck, made the arrest on the 600 block of Pomona Street in 
Fullerton. Police said the truck, which had been partially stripped, was found 
in a garage at the address where Negrete was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday evening, two men posing as customers walked into Mike McCarthy 
Buick-Subaru-GMC dealership in Westminster and asked salesman Tony Armstrong 
for a test drive. A third man was also with the group, but did not get in the 
truck. The three men had apparently come to the dealership Wednesday and asked 
to test drive the truck, but were asked to come back the next day because the 
business was about to close. 
</P>
<P>
 The test drive lasted about 35 minutes before one of the robbers pointed a gun 
at the salesman and ordered him from the truck. Armstrong was left stranded, 
but uninjured, near Orangethorpe Avenue and Lemon Street in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Friday he felt lucky to have come through the ordeal without getting 
shot, adding that the robbers were fairly polite and said, "Sorry, dude," 
before driving off. ANNA CEKOLA

 The American Lung Assn. has passed out six awards for efforts to cut smog and 
air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Anaheim placed first for its public awareness programs, which 
included anti-pollution poster contests for schoolchildren and ride-sharing 
plans for employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The association also handed out awards for outstanding achievement to 
McDonnell Douglas Aerospace, CalComp, Professional Community Management Inc., 
the Waterfront Hilton Beach Resort and UCI Medical Center for similar 
smog-reduction programs. The winners were among 136 local companies and 
governmental agencies that competed in the clean air contest, said association 
spokeswoman Diane Masseth-Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the awards were to encourage companies and individuals to do their 
part to clean the air. Widespread cooperation is important because statistics 
show that living in Southern California is like being a light smoker in terms 
of its effects on the body. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that often "people don't realize that air affects their health. 
Programs like these help reduce emissions and let people know what to do when 
it is smoggy to help health." 
</P>
<P>
 Association officials honored the winners of its Clean Air Week Corporate 
Competition during an awards ceremony at the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana last 
week. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA; MAN GETS LIFE TERM IN LABOR-LINKED 
KILLING

 A Paramount man was sentenced to life in prison without parole Monday for 
murdering a Rancho Santa Margarita businessman during a labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe Steven Leroy Henry, 35, was shot to death Sept. 24, 1992, 
because his company, which supplied workers to unload tractor-trailers at local 
supermarkets, was doing a better job and squeezing out the competition, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty.Patrick Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Jimenez, 29, was convicted last month of first-degree murder and 
murder-for-hire in the ambush attack. Jimenez admitted driving the gunman to 
the crime scene but told jurors he only did so because his own life was being 
threatened. Jurors, however, rejected that testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 During a sentencing hearing before Orange County Superior Court Judge Kathleen 
E. O'Leary, Henry's wife, Mary, said facing the future would be difficult 
without her "best friend and husband." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing the justice system can do to give me my life back," she 
said, adding that she wanted the judge to hand down the maximum sentence to 
prevent Jimenez from harming anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the prosecutor and defense attorney praised Henry as an innocent victim 
who was wrongly murdered in broad daylight at a Buena Park intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney Gary L. Proctor said his client is also a victim. Proctor 
said it was unfair that the gunman and the man who orchestrated the slaying 
have not been captured and "brought to justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue said authorities are still searching for the two assailants. RENE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 11 ATHLETES RECEIVE $1,500 SCHOLARSHIPS

<P>
 Orange County Sports Celebrities, a nonprofit group, is awarding a $1,500 
college scholarship to each of 11 local high school seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Being honored as "scholar-athletes" are Brian Askew of St. Margaret's 
Episcopal, Romy Christensen of Laguna Hills High, Elizabeth Flores of Magnolia 
High, John Houston of Mater Dei High, Anel Lopez of Century High, George Lopez 
of Orange High and Luis Alejandro Ortiz of Santa Ana High. 
</P>
<P>
 The students were selected on the basis of athletic and academic achievement, 
leadership, community service and financial need. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiving Courage Awards are Tim Johnston of San Clemente High, Jamie Shine of 
El Modena High, Carrie Florgan of Marina High and Darren Wedertz of Santa 
Margarita High. These four students "exhibited exemplary courage and 
determination in overcoming physical adversity," said Bob Callahan, president 
of Orange County Sports Celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being blinded in a 1990 boating accident, Johnston joined his school's 
wrestling team as a sophomore, and won a national championship this spring. He 
plans to try out for the Rancho Santiago College wrestling team this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Shine nearly died after contracting spinal meningitis in 1993. She returned to 
school for her senior year and led her basketball team in scoring and 
rebounding. She was also named top athlete in the Century League. 
</P>
<P>
 Florgan's left leg was amputated just below the knee when she was eight years 
old. She went on to earn three varsity letters as a soccer goalkeeper, and 
helped her team win two CIF Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedertz was hospitalized for a year as he battled leukemia and the effects of 
a head injury suffered during a 1992 football game. His determination to 
recover from leukemia and partial paralysis on his left side has been an 
inspiration to all who know him, said Santa Margarita High athletic director 
Richard Schaaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports Celebrities is a 22-year-old organization that promotes youth sports in 
the county and has donated more than $500,000 in scholarships. A major source 
of the group's funding is an annual banquet honoring well-known sports figures.

 When Bill Hitchcock was a sophomore in high school, his best friend wrote in 
his yearbook: "I hope you get up nerve to ask Marcia what I told you." 
</P>
<P>
 Hitchcock never was brave enough to ask Marcia Bruehl if she liked him back in 
the late 1950s, when they attended Blue Island Community High School on the 
South Side of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did manage to summon the courage to ask her an even more significant 
question 37 years later -- and she said yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitchcock, who now lives in Anaheim, tracked down a phone number for the girl 
he couldn't forget and who was now living in Noblesville, Ind.  
</P>
<P>
 After spending two to five hours on the phone every day for two months, 
Hitchcock and Bruehl, now Marcia Richards, decided they should meet in person. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nervous when she came here, worried that there might not be any 
chemistry between us," Hitchcock said. "To break the ice, I wore a fake nose 
and glasses at the airport to pick her up, and she walked right up to me and 
said 'Hi, Bill.' "  
</P>
<P>
 They are engaged to be married in July.  
</P>
<P>
 Hitchcock's family moved from Chicago to San Clemente after his junior year in 
high school. Despite having a major league crush on Richards, Hitchcock never 
told her he was moving and never said goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just too damn shy," Hitchcock said. "I felt so intimidated by her." 
</P>
<P>
 The two had met while taking a make-up geometry exam. Even though Hitchcock 
thought the 16-year-old daughter of a minister acted interested in him, he 
couldn't really believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was popular, her dad was a respected man in town, and she was a better 
student than me," Hitchcock said. "But most of all, she could drive and I 
couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Their one date together during their sophomore year was a disaster, Hitchcock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally got the nerve to ask her to a high school basketball game," he 
said. "My dad drove us, and when I got in the car I saw my younger brother and 
sister were coming, too. I was humiliated." 
</P>
<P>
 During the game, Hitchcock said, he was too shy to talk much to his date, and 
was tongue-tied when she would attempt conversation. Although he never even 
held her hand, Hitchcock said he never forgot her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remembered that she liked cream soda, and I have never had a cream soda 
since without being reminded if her," Hitchcock said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure his fiancee thinks of him when she drinks cream soda, he sent her 
a case of the beverage when she graduated from Ball State University last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 After the wedding, the two, now both 52, plan to drive to Chicago to re-enact 
a scene he has played over and over in his mind for the last 37 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to walk from the high school to her house," Hitchcock said. "And 
this time, I am going to hold her hand." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; REPORT DOWNGRADES ANCIENT SLIDE THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A geological report released Monday indicates an ancient landslide in the 
fire-damaged Mystic Hills community may be smaller than earlier believed. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was sought by residents skeptical about two previous reports that 
said a tear-shaped ancient landslide exists under about 14 lots where residents 
want to rebuild homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The new report will be discussed at a special meeting of the City Council, at 
6 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The geologist who helped conduct the latest study said Monday he believes that 
small ancient landslides may exist in the northern part of the previously 
defined landslide area, but he could not confirm that the larger landslide 
exists as described by other geologists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel at this point it is probably not a single large landslide as has been 
mapped by Geofirm," said Perry Ehlig, a South Pasadena engineering geologist. 
"There isn't enough information to reach a final conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Ehlig and Bing Yen, an Irvine geotechnical engineer, recommend further studies 
be done to pinpoint the landslide's southern boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 They also recommend that residents whose burned lots are in the northern 
section be allowed to stabilize their lots and rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 A previous 45-day building ban in that area is set to expire today and city 
staff proposes that the ban be extended for 10 1/2 months. That recommendation 
was in place before the latest study was released and City Manager Kenneth C. 
Frank could not be reached Monday to determine if he will modify that position 
in light of the latest findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will also hold a previously scheduled hearing to discuss forming an 
assessment district to help pay for a $1-million re-stabilization project. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, disaster-weary Mystic Hills residents were trying to digest the 
latest news. Within about an hour of the report's release, a dozen property 
owners had stopped by City Hall to pick up a copy. 
</P>
<P>
 One man, who asked that he not be identified, flipped through the study, 
trying to discern how it will affect his future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It says we can rebuild, that's the way I read it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystic Hills residents, especially fire victims, have been upset and 
bewildered by suggestions that their lots might be on unstable ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Geofirm, a consulting company hired by the city, said that two 
dozen properties in that community -- including 14 destroyed in the Oct. 27 
blaze -- were sitting atop an ancient landslide. Geofirm said 38 properties 
could be directly or indirectly affected and recommended a complex plan to 
secure the hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 21, the council held an intense 3 1/2-hour session with Mystic Hills 
residents, many of whom were skeptical that the landslide poses a danger, or 
that it even exists. As a result, the city ordered another study. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the city manager had strongly recommended that residents on 
the affected streets form an assessment district to pay for the $1-million 
stabilization project, with property owners paying varying amounts, depending 
upon how much they would benefit from the project. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; 4TH WEEKEND KILLING BEING INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Homicide and gang detail investigators Monday were searching for a motive in a 
fatal shooting outside an apartment complex Sunday that left one man dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting fatality was the fourth in the county over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the slain man as Guadalupe Salas, 24, of Anaheim. No 
suspects were being held. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers received a report of a shooting at 1251 N. Placentia Ave. about 3:40 
p.m. Sunday and found Salas in front of an apartment complex with a gunshot 
wound in his upper torso, according to Sgt. Steve Rodig. The victim was 
pronounced dead at UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodig said Salas had apparently been quarreling with several people before the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting took place during a weekend marked by violence in the county. Two 
men were slain and two others wounded in separate incidents in Santa Ana on 
Sunday, while police in Orange found an apparent homicide victim shot to death 
at a covered parking lot. Two other men were shot and wounded Saturday in 
unrelated incidents in Garden Grove. ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; 43 ARRESTED IN 2-DAY PROSTITUTION SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police arrested 43 people on prostitution-related charges on Beach Boulevard 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 In what police described as an effort to "target high problem areas as 
identified by citizens in the community," female police officers posing as 
prostitutes arrested 35 men for soliciting on Friday and Saturday between 
Lincoln Avenue and Ball Road. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, eight women were arrested in the same area for soliciting for 
prostitution. Two men were arrested on charges of selling drugs and violation 
of a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 All those arrested had their cars towed and impounded, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the arrests were designed to deal with "the growing prostitution 
problem that has been developing in that area."

CONTRACTING SERVICES TO SAVE ANAHEIM $800,000 THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city will save an estimated $800,000 this year by contracting out services 
that otherwise would be done by city employees, according to a city report on 
privatization released this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings are a result of 18 contracts valued at $2.4 million the city has 
entered into since 1992, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city began privatizing scores of services several years ago in an effort 
to cope with declining revenue. Overall, the city pays some $141 million to 
contractors who provide 359 different services. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen city departments contract services. Human resources, maintenance and 
stadium departments account for nearly half of the city's annual privatization 
budget. The contracts pay for services such as building demolition, computer 
repair and maintenance, legal research and graffiti removal. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest new contract was for $1 million to build a fiber optics 
telecommunications network. City workers had no experience in this field, the 
report stated. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also conceded that privatization has its shortcomings. For example, 
it often requires laying off city workers, harming employee morale. Also, the 
city sometimes loses control over service quality, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the drawbacks, city officials say privatization is a "vital tool" 
in streamlining government costs and they will continue to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue to aggressively scrutinize services for possible 
privatization in the future," City Manager James D. Ruth said. "And we will 
enter into contracts with the private sector where responsible cost cutting and 
improved efficiency is clearly evident."

CONROY WANTS PADDLE OPINION RECONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) is asking the chief attorney for the 
Legislature to reconsider his legal opinion that paddling graffiti vandals as 
punishment for their crimes would be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by the caning in Singapore of an American teen-ager convicted of 
vandalizing cars, Conroy has proposed a bill that calls for juvenile offenders 
guilty of graffiti crimes to receive up to 10 whacks on the buttocks with a 
wooden paddle.The bill, AB 150 X, is scheduled to be heard today before the 
Assembly Committee on Public Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the controversial bill has run into opposition. Legislative Counsel 
Bion Gregory issued an opinion May 31 concluding that the Conroy bill would 
violate the federal and state constitutions, which outlaw cruel and unusual 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Gregory on Monday, Conroy said he disagreed with Gregory's 
legal interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The assemblyman is concerned that the legislative counsel may not have spent 
enough time researching this subject so we had some research done on our own," 
said Pete Conaty, Conroy's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Conaty said the Republican consultant found that strictly monitored paddling 
of juveniles would not necessarily constitute cruel and unusual punishment.

 BEEING DEFENSIVE: Making honey is a tough business these days. The number of 
hives here is down 50% from five years ago. Part of the problem, says Jim 
Ludiker of the Orange County Beekeepers Assn., is competition from overseas 
honey prices. Also, a bad case of mites has cut into local bee populations. . . 
. But there may be an upside: Ludiker says the mites could be a deterrent 
against the Africanized honey bee (the dreaded "killer bees") expected to reach 
California later this year.

recalls the fun of standing in an orange grove on the side of a road and 
throwing an orange into passing convertibles: "They'd always slam on their 
brakes and chase us into the groves. They never caught us, though."

 BETTER TIMES? It's starting to look like old times in the south Orange County 
housing market. Dana Point was typical of the trend last weekend: People 
camping overnight to get on a waiting list for Kaufman and Broad's new 144-unit 
single family home development -- $250,000 and up -- near The Links at Monarch 
Beach golf course. . . . Says city planner Lance Schulte: "We haven't seen that 
kind of activity (in Dana Point) in awhile."

 GOING TRADITIONAL: At the Fred Moiola School in Fountain Valley, some 
eighth-grade students were dressed to the nines for their recent graduation 
ceremony. And some girls' gowns slit up the sides raised many an official 
eyebrow. . . . Now the Fountain Valley School District board wants to bring 
back the traditional graduation gown to Moiola. Trustee Larry Crandall says 
some youths may feel out of place because they cannot afford elaborate clothes: 
"All students should wear the same gown." Hive Dive

COUNTY COALITION DRAFTS ALTERNATIVE TO EPA SMOG PLAN; POLLUTION: STRATEGY WOULD 
IMPOSE FEES ON MOTORISTS WHO DRIVE THE MOST AND PURCHASE CLEANER-RUNNING CARS 
FOR LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A Ventura County coalition of government and business leaders on Monday 
released its version of a plan to clean up Ventura County's smoggy air, a plan 
they say will be effective without devastating the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft plan, released by the Council on Economic Vitality and the Ventura 
County Economic Development Assn., carries fewer economic and social impacts 
than a federally designed program, coalition members say. But they said it 
would reduce as much smog or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition's alternative plan calls for a heavier burden on the average 
driver, emphasizing the need to reduce vehicle emissions by imposing higher car 
registration or other fees for those who drive the most. The plan would 
establish a fund to purchase cleaner-running cars for low-income residents to 
eliminate older, higher-emitting cars from the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Councilwoman Judy Mikels acknowledged that stricter regulation of 
cars is "politically touchy." But cutting down on car emissions, she said, is 
"the most effective and most provable because we know what cars do." Vehicles 
account for half of the county's air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also supports the right of motorists to choose to drive 
higher-polluting cars, but they would be charged an annual fee for the 
privilege of polluting more. 
</P>
<P>
 "This allows individual freedom by requiring accountability for that freedom," 
said Robert E. Paulger, a co-chairman of the economic vitality council and 
spokesman for Procter & Gamble in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also calls for further testing before restrictions are placed on 
pesticides, which are targeted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to 
cut down on smog-producing chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition this week will begin sending out letters soliciting endorsements 
from all areas of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hoping to get wide community support for these proposals," said Marc 
L. Charney, president of the county's economic development association. "And if 
we do, we hope that will help the EPA to accept them" as a replacement for the 
federal plan, Charney said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Ungvarski, environmental scientist with the EPA, said the coalition's 
alternative plan must be reviewed for its technical merit. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we are open to other options, as we've said all along," Ungvarski said. 
"The main idea is that it gets equivalent reductions. So if there is a better 
and cheaper way to do that, we want to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government considers Ventura County to have a "severe" air-quality 
problem, based on ozone, the principal component of smog. 
</P>
<P>
 After Ventura County failed to devise a way to clean up the air to meet health 
standards, the EPA issued its plan in February. The agency gave the county one 
year to come up with a better alternative or the federal plan would take 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing on the federal plan is scheduled July 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Air Pollution Control District is also working on a plan, but the 
draft of that document does not go far enough to meet required reductions in 
pollution by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal plan, which includes far-ranging restrictions that affect 
business, agriculture and industry, has drawn wide criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulger of Procter & Gamble called the federal plan "awesome and overwhelming. 
. . . People do not realize what is going to hit them in February, 1995," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rex Laird, executive director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau, called the 
federal plan "Draconian" and said it would devastate the agricultural economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition said its alternative plan would delay a federal proposal to 
restrict the use of some pesticides because they contain smog-causing 
ingredients. In addition, the oil that many growers use to suffocate pests in 
place of more toxic pesticides would be restricted as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But Laird and others who worked on the coalition plan said that more tests are 
needed before pesticides should be restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 Another federal measure that would potentially affect agriculture would 
restrict the number of stops a large truck could make in the area. The measure 
was intended to promote the use of smaller, less-polluting vehicles within the 
area. But the trucks often make several stops to pick up different commodities 
before heading out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition proposes instead that tougher emission restrictions be placed on 
the trucks themselves, rather than limiting their stops. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition also strongly opposes the federal proposal to require large 
companies, like Procter & Gamble, to reduce pollutants emitted into the air by 
more than 4% a year for five years beginning in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 The reductions are based on emission levels in 1990. But the coalition wants 
businesses to get credit for any reduction in pollutants made since then. The 
federal plan does not make such allowances. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition also wants companies to get credit for reducing emissions by 
converting their company cars to clean fuel. The federal plan requires 
reductions from each source, the manufacturing plants themselves as well as the 
fleets, and does not allow the credits to be interchangeable. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Mount, deputy director of the county's Air Pollution Control District, 
said the coalition's proposed alternative plan has many "good ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 "But it still needs more work before it can be accepted by the EPA," he said. 
In order for any strategy to be acceptable to the federal government, it must 
be adopted as a regulation by the county supervisors so it can be enforced by 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, he said, some of the coalition's ideas, such as imposing higher 
fees on motorists, would require new state law and need a source of funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Mount worked with the Council on Economic Vitality to develop some of the 
alternative proposals. And he commended the group for its efforts. He also 
stressed that the work must continue beyond February, 1995, when the EPA is 
scheduled to adopt its own plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the toughest measures won't be implemented until 2000 or 2001, so 
there is still time to propose alternatives even after the federal plan is 
adopted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA was ordered to prepare the federal plan after the U.S. Supreme Court 
ended a five-year local battle. 
</P>
<P>
 When the EPA approved Ventura County's 1982 Air Quality Management Plan that 
failed to show that the county would reach health standards, the Citizens to 
Preserve the Ojai sued the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1988 settlement produced a court order for the EPA to devise a plan to clean 
up the county's smog. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the federal Clean Air Act was revised in 1990, the EPA claimed that 
the court order was moot. The courts have ruled differently, instructing the 
agency to make sure Ventura County's air meets federal health standards within 
a decade. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will hold a public hearing on its 
proposed new air-pollution control plan on July 20 in the lower plaza assembly 
room, Ventura County Government Center, 800 S. Victoria Ave., Ventura. The 
three sessions of the meeting begin at 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. The public is 
invited to speak on a first-come, first-served basis for up to five minutes. 
Speakers are asked to bring written copies of their comments for the hearing 
officer.

PETITIONS FILED TO REOPEN POLI STREET; TRAFFIC: ROAD BISECTING VENTURA HIGH 
CAMPUS HAS BEEN CLOSED TO CARS DURING SCHOOL HOURS. RESIDENTS ANGERED BY 
CONGESTION SEEK BALLOT MEASURE.

 A group of Ventura residents who oppose the closure of Poli Street turned over 
two petition-filled boxes to the city clerk Monday, hoping they have enough 
valid signatures to qualify the measure for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which calls itself Concerned Citizens of Ventura, has collected 
more than 11,300 signatures. Of those, 8,589 must be from registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're about to drop!" said Jack Biller, one of the group's oldest and most 
steadfast members. "We have worked like the dickens. It's shot a whole year."  
</P>
<P>
 The proposed initiative seeks to reopen Poli Street, a road that bisects the 
Ventura High School campus. The Ventura City Council agreed last August to shut 
off Poli Street to through traffic during school hours, after 150 people 
crowded the council chambers to demand the street closure for safety purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents of homes near the high school have protested against the closure 
because they say it creates congestion on nearby streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, supporters of the proposed ballot measure must wait until each of the 
signatures collected for the initiative has been checked by the county 
elections office. 
</P>
<P>
 If enough signatures are validated, the council will have to vote on July 25 
to place the measure on the November ballot, said City Clerk Barbara Kam. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say they would wait to see if the initiative is going on the 
ballot before launching a counterattack. Even if the measure qualifies, that 
doesn't mean the community will support reopening Poli Street, said Diane 
Harriman, president of the Ventura Unified School District's board of 
directors. "People will sign almost anything that's put in their face," 
Harriman said. "Getting something on the ballot doesn't mean it will pass." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Nicky van Nieuwberg, president of the Ventura High School 
Parent-Student-Teacher Assn., said she is prepared to fight for the peace of 
mind the school community has gained since the street closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students feel really safe right now . . . and the teachers like teaching 
without all the noise," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, school officials and parents worry about the potential for a 
drive-by shooting or other gang violence on Poli Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has not been a drive-by shooting on Poli Street in recent 
memory, two violent incidents near campus in the past five years have triggered 
fears of encroaching gang problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1993, a student was stabbed to death at night a few blocks from 
the campus. In 1989, drive-by gunmen shot a student six times as he walked 
along Main Street two blocks from campus in the middle of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Poli Street parallels Ventura's Main Street from Ventura Avenue on the west to 
just beyond Seaward Avenue on the east. The high school sits a block west of 
Seaward Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 To redirect spillover traffic onto Main Street, the city has installed gates 
at Palomar Avenue and Sunset Drive.

WAKE-UP CALL; PLAN TO RAISE BED TAX SPURS DEBATE ON TOURISM'S COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To pay for the increasing cost of policing Ojai's tourist-trampled streets, 
city leaders want to raise the bed tax on the town's resorts and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 But hotel owners say the increase would eliminate their competitive edge over 
other vacation havens, such as Carmel and Santa Barbara -- unless the city 
starts using public funds to market Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 And that idea has some residents grimacing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marketing the town is a horrible idea for the people who live there," said 
longtime Ojai resident Ken Shelton Jr. "Go visit Cambria or Catalina and 
observe that the places have been taken over by tourists." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, downtown Ojai has bumper-to-bumper traffic on many weekends, 
especially during special events like the annual tennis tournament and music 
festival. Tourists clog the sidewalks and parking spaces disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Market it and you fly straight in the faces of the people who say, 'I can't 
get across Ojai Avenue now ,' " Councilman James Loebl said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a 9% increase in the cost of law enforcement, the city staff has 
proposed raising the bed tax to generate an estimated $170,000. The tax, which 
hasn't been raised in more than a decade, would go to 10% from 8%, effective 
Friday. Ventura, Oxnard, Port Hueneme and Fillmore already have 10% bed taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 But representatives of the hotel-motel industry say the proposed 25% increase 
in Ojai'sbed tax will result in a drop in tourism, which will harm all local 
businesses and diminish the city's sales tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to hurt them," said Bill Howe, a spokesman for the California 
Hotel and Motel Assn. "There is a point where (tourists) are price-sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting a 1991 study on the impact of bed taxes on the lodging industry, Howe 
said: "For every 10% increase in the cost of a rented room, occupancy will fall 
3.1%." 
</P>
<P>
 If Ojai decides to market the community, it will be following the lead of 
Oxnard, which last year raised its bed tax to generate funds for a tourism 
bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry is very supportive of (marketing)," Howe said. "It has generated 
a lot of business." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the wariness of some residents, the idea has started to take root in 
Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff has recommended forming a subcommittee to meet with chamber of 
commerce and lodging officials to discuss a marketing development program. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel owners and chamber members met twice last week to brainstorm ideas for a 
marketing plan. Suggestions included purchasing a computer and mailing-list 
program to collect the names of visitors and hiring someone to notify tourists 
about upcoming events. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking about (attracting more) tourists. . . . We're talking about 
getting back the tourists we'd lose (if a tax increase is approved)," said Don 
Cluff, owner of The Oaks at Ojai, a health spa and resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at quality rather and quantity," Cluff said. "The sense of 
turning (Ojai) into a tourist mecca isn't here. We're not talking about trying 
to turn it into a Disneyland or Solvang." 
</P>
<P>
 In a June 14 letter to the City Council, Chamber President Jeff McComas said 
he would like the city to set aside $25,000 to $50,000 annually to expand 
services at Ojai's visitor center. The center, which houses the chamber's 
office, currently responds to questions about Ojai but does not actively 
promote the area as a tourist destination. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some city leaders first want to see a marketing plan -- and research on 
tourism demographics -- before embarking on any project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it makes sense to look at the idea of marketing Ojai, but we don't 
have a plan yet," City Manager Andrew Belknap said. "I think that the idea of a 
committee to study this has merit." 
</P>
<P>
 Belknap agreed that launching a marketing plan could improve the city's 
finances but added: "I think the real issue is the extent that the council 
wants to entice tourism to Ojai." 
</P>
<P>
 For Councilman Loebl, it's a question of balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have tried for a long period of time to put in equilibrium those two 
conflicting viewpoints so we would have a healthy tourist base and not overrun 
the community," he said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must understand that the community has expressed itself repeatedly as not 
wanting to become another Solvang, with hordes of tourists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over whether to market the small town of barely 8,000 residents is 
ironic, considering Ojai's history. 
</P>
<P>
 The town's original namesake, Charles Nordhoff, was a New York journalist 
whose promotional writings about Southern California in the late 1800s lured 
Easterners to the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been in the last few decades that Ojai's popularity as a peaceful 
mountain sanctuary peppered with boutiques and cafes has resulted in an influx 
of tourists nearly every weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been terrible," Shelton said. "I've lived here now for almost 40 years. 
When I was a child here in the '50s, the arcade sold to locals. Now it's almost 
entirely boutiques and galleries pandering to tourists. I think it's a form of 
community prostitution. (In) places where towns have thrown themselves over to 
tourism, it has been to the detriment of the town." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But some business owners have welcomed the transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here since I was 14, and the only thing that's changed is the shops 
have become more sophisticated," said resident Barbara Bowman, who owns several 
clothing stores in downtown Ojai and wants to see a marketing plan implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are pretty much acclimated to the fact that weekends are busy and 
during the week it's quiet," she said. "It's always been like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Ojai resident Jeff Rains said he was uncertain about the marketing 
idea but added that like his family's 80-year-old department store, Ojai should 
cater first to the people who live there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to change," he said. "But whatever change comes along, we're going to 
change (as) the people want."

INSPIRING THE CHILDREN OF MIGRANT WORKERS; EDUCATION: TEACHERS' ASSISTANTS WITH 
THE MINI CORPS PROGRAM RELY ON THEIR EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELDS TO HELP OTHERS 
EXCEL ACADEMICALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Veronica Magana remembers picking the last strawberries of spring as a child, 
working next to her parents in an Oxnard field. It was hard work but fun, she 
says, mostly because she got to spend so much time with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Cal Lutheran student's memories of a childhood in the migrant farm 
worker culture are not all so sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 As an eighth-grader already eagerly planning for college, she struggled 
constantly to prove to school counselors that she could handle classes taught 
only in English. Just let me try it, she told them. What have I got to lose? 
</P>
<P>
 At 22, Magana still has the same sense of determination, but now she is using 
it to persuade other children of migrant workers that they, too, can go to 
college and become teachers, lawyers or whatever they want. 
</P>
<P>
 Having graduated from Cal Lutheran University in May, Magana is beginning a 
summer job Monday as a teacher's assistant with the state and federally funded 
Mini Corps program. The program is designed to present role models to the 
children of migrant field workers while giving teaching experience to young 
people such as Magana. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're up there, hey, you've got to reach down and help the next person 
coming up the ladder," Magana said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 students from Cal Lutheran, Cal State Northridge and Oxnard College 
are participating in the Mini Corps program this summer. All are bilingual, and 
all have had firsthand experience with migrant education. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil Villasensor, Ventura County coordinator of Mini Corps, said 2,000 to 2,500 
children of migrant workers in the county will attend Mini Corps summer 
sessions this year in Moorpark, Oxnard, Port Hueneme and Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The teaching assistants receive $6 to $7 an hour, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mini Corps student teachers serve as role models at school sites," 
Villasensor said. "They provide motivation to seek higher education and they 
are often better received than other instructional aides because they 
themselves were migrant children." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mini Corps program is about 15 years old and has been operating in Ventura 
for 10 years, Villasensor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Magana is intent on becoming a teacher; she even has the school picked out, 
her former elementary school in Oxnard, Cesar Chavez School. But the Mini Corps 
program is not limited to those who wish to become educators. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirella Escamilla, 20, who will be a senior at Cal Lutheran in the fall, hopes 
eventually to go into public relations or broadcast journalism. But like 
Magana, she will spend her summer at El Rio Elementary School in Oxnard, 
helping children with lessons in English, math, history, science and on getting 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know from personal experience how important it is to have a role model," 
Escamilla said. "That person can be a mentor. Through them you see the 
possibility of your dream coming true." 
</P>
<P>
 Escamilla looked up to her aunt and uncle as a child. They were the first 
members of her family to go to college. Her father -- formerly a celery picker, 
now a foreman for Gold Coast Harvesting in Oxnard -- encouraged her to do well 
in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, college seemed out of reach and too expensive. "I think my father would 
have been happy if I just graduated from high school and didn't join a gang," 
Escamilla said. Her high school counselors suggested Cal Lutheran, which gives 
financial aid to about 80% of its student body. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa Moreno, Cal Lutheran's director of multicultural services and campus 
coordinator for the Mini Corps program, said she tells the student teachers to 
share their experiences with the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I try to focus on with all the students is that it is important to give 
something back," Moreno said. "I want them to share their life experiences, the 
struggles they have all had. The past affects the present, the present affects 
the future. It's important to come full circle." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Magana, that means picking up a book and reading to the children in 
flawless Spanish, then in equally flawless English. For Escamilla that means 
empathizing with children who lose newly gained friends when they move on with 
their parents to a new crop in a new town. She remembers how sad that feeling 
was. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa Perez, a 33-year-old mother of two who will graduate from Cal Lutheran 
next May, has a unique perspective to share as a Mini Corps teaching assistant 
this summer. She remembers being in school and listening to role models tell 
her she had options other than working in the fields next to her father and her 
seven siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never believed them," Perez said. "I remember thinking, 'This person is 
just saying this because they could go to college, because they have a good 
job.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She said she disregarded the speeches about opportunities. But when she 
started picking strawberries at age 14, she began to reconsider and decided she 
had to find other options. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working in the fields is what convinced me," Perez said. "I'm never going 
back there again because I know what it was like."

<P>
 The superintendent of a Riverside County school district has been named the 
new assistant superintendent for educational services at the Ventura County 
schools' office. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Shackleford, currently superintendent of the 4,500-student San Jacinto 
Unified School District, will move into her new position Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 She will replace Steve Kingsford, who has served as assistant superintendent 
for 16 years. He is retiring Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Working under Ventura County schools Supt. Charles Weis, Shackleford will 
oversee the 13 county-run schools that serve 4,000 disabled or troubled 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 She will also supervise the departments in the county schools office that 
offer expertise on everything from curriculum to finance for Ventura County's 
20 local school districts. Her salary will be $80,781. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's going to be great," Weis said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her nine years as superintendent of the San Jacinto district, 
35 miles southeast of Riverside, Shackleford, 51, has worked as an assistant 
superintendent, teacher, principal and math specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 She is completing a doctorate in education at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Shackleford said she looks forward to her new position because 
county schools offices are becoming increasingly important in California 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more, she said, county superintendents are guiding local school 
districts on issues ranging from school violence to curriculum. MAIA DAVIS

<P>
 To keep programs for senior citizens on track, the Ventura County Area Agency 
on Aging has doled out $1.1 million in federal funds, focusing on groups 
providing food or social services. 
</P>
<P>
 Local organizations will use the funds to provide adult day care, delivered 
meals and visiting-nurse services.Other programs receiving money are aimed at 
preventing elder abuse and offering legal counsel to senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest grants went to two meal programs run by the county's social 
services agencies -- Congregate Meals and Home Delivered Meals, which were 
awarded a total of $712,797. The Livingston Memorial Visiting Nurse Assn. 
received $20,000 to provide temporary care for senior citizens while family 
members are away. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate series of grants, the Board of Supervisors divided $55,115 among 
10 nonprofit agencies that will train low-income senior citizens to perform 
community service jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Library, Fillmore Senior Center, St. John's Regional Medical 
Center and HELP of Ojai Inc. were among the groups splitting the money.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: AUDITOR BALLOTS WON'T BE RECOUNTED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County election officials have no intention of granting a recount to a 
candidate who lost his run-off bid by one vote -- unless he pays for it 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura accountant Scott Weiss, who placed third in the race for county 
auditor-controller, asked the county voter registrar's office to recount a 
handful of votes that were discarded by the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 But that would require looking through the entire computer tape, a task that 
could take five days and 32 people, said Bruce Bradley, assistant registrar of 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It costs $10,000," Bradley said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should Mr. Weiss get $10,000 of taxpayers' money, of your money and my 
money? If he wants a recount, he should pay for it himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley plans to ask the County Board of Supervisors to certify election 
results at a meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
 His final tally for the June 7 vote showed appointed Auditor-Controller Thomas 
O. Mahon with 35,561 votes, Richard Morrisset with 17,195 and Weiss with 
17,194. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss had led Morrisset by 75 votes on election night, but lost ground as 
absentee ballots were counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss said 274 ballots were not counted because each of the computerized 
ballot cards had more than one vote punched in in the auditor's race. He argued 
that some of the ballots could actually be valid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not asking for a free recount," Weiss said. "I'm asking them to look at 
the 274 overvotes." 
</P>
<P>
 If not, he said, "they run the risk of invalidating the votes of 17,000 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley said the computer does not separate the faulty ballots, complicating 
any recount effort. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SOMIS; HEARON HONORED FOR HIS VOLUNTEER WORK

<P>
 A former president of Moorpark College has been named volunteer of the year by 
the California affiliate of the American Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 W. Ray Hearon of Somis, chairman of the Ventura County AHA's development 
committee since 1980, was given the award in recognition of his 15 years of 
commitment and service to the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearon, 61, became involved with the American Heart Assn. in 1978. Over the 
years, he has served as fund-raising chairman at both the local and state 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I had done more things than most volunteers, but I was surprised" 
at the honor, Hearon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearon served as president of Moorpark College for 15 years, until 1987. His 
extracurricular work with the AHA was time-consuming, but worthwhile, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started, I did it because a friend asked me," Hearon said. "Then 
I had a heart attack in 1980, so it became personal. I do it because it is 
important and it will help a lot of people." MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CONSTITUENTS SEE ASSEMBLY, SENATE SESSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 50 residents from Ventura County and elsewhere in Assemblyman Jack 
O'Connell's district began two full days of Legislature watching at the state 
Capitol today, where they will study lawmakers in action and catch a glimpse of 
the state budget process now under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to help inform the citizenry about the ins and outs of 
Sacramento," said O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), who met with about a dozen of his 
constituents early Sunday before they left from his Ventura office. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the participants boarded the bus in Santa Barbara and Buellton 
before making their way to the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity to view the legislative process firsthand and even to 
participate if they wish," O'Connell said. During the three-day visit, 
residents will attend a series of seminars about the political process and sit 
in on a meeting of the Senate Natural Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitors will also be in the public gallery while the Assembly and Senate 
discuss what to do about a budget deficit that could top $5 billion, O'Connell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main reason I'm going is to see the Senate in action during the budget 
process," said Wini Hirsch, a retired homemaker from Ojai. "I have pretty 
strong feelings about the budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Terri Grando of Thousand Oaks does not live in O'Connell's district. But she 
was sitting in the front seat of the bus as it left Ventura early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always curious about how a bill gets passed," said Grando, a member of 
the state Democratic Central Committee. "Since it affects everyone, we should 
be well informed about how it works." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Irwin, a retired psychologist from Ojai who obtained his law degree 
three years ago, said he planned to ask O'Connell and others about the recent 
$2.7-billion accounting error disclosed just days after the primary election 
June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a little sum of money that slipped away," he said. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: WESTLAKE; HEARING DATE SETTLED IN SHOOTING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After being assigned to three different courtrooms in the past two weeks, a 
high-profile Westlake shooting case finally found a home Monday -- at least for 
the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 William Huang, John Yi and Oubansack (Andy) Sonethanouphet have been ordered 
tried as adults on criminal charges stemming from a Feb. 4 melee at North Ranch 
Park that left two Westlake High School football players wounded.All three 
suspects were 16 at the time of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But their preliminary hearing was stalled June 16 when defense complaints led 
to the case being bounced to three different courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney John E. Meyers first complained when the case was assigned to 
Acting Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark, who is an elected judge on the 
county's Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers, who represents Huang, said he did not want Clark or another acting 
Superior Court judge, Herbert Curtis III, hearing his client's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But court officials transferred the case from Clark to Curtis anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers then accused Curtis of bias, sending the case to the courtroom of 
Charles W. Campbell, the supervising felony judge. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Campbell put Clark back on the case, ruling that Meyers' original 
motion to disqualify Clark had not been filed in a timely manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the preliminary hearing is set for July 12 before Judge Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Meyers, he said Monday that he has no problem with Clark holding the 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the defendants are ordered to stand trial, Meyers said he wants a duly 
elected Superior Court judge hearing the case, rather than one serving in a 
temporary capacity. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; 'DODGER DAY' TICKETS TO AID DEPOT 
PROJECT 
</P>

<P>
 To raise money for restoring the old Santa Susana Railroad Depot in Simi 
Valley, members of the nonprofit Rancho Simi Foundation will hold the city's 
fourth annual "Dodger Day" on July 9. Tickets must be purchased by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets to the evening game between the Dodgers and the New York Mets are $8, 
with all proceeds going directly into a fund to restore the 1903 building, said 
Bill Funk, organizer of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Funk said members of the foundation recently completed restrooms for the 
facility and hope to next restore the station's freight room and community 
room. He said residents have donated many weekends to the restoration effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a labor of love," Funk said. "We're trying to bring the station back as 
close as we can to its original condition." 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation recently received one prized donation: the original sign from 
the depot, which had been making the rounds of local swap meets before someone 
recognized it and turned it over to the foundation, Funk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Susana Railroad Depot was sold to the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park 
District in 1974 for $1 and moved to Santa Susana Pass Road from its original 
location on Los Angeles Avenue and Tapo Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The park district is using a $250,000 grant to restore the station's exterior. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Funk said the tickets were made available by an anonymous donor within the 
Dodger organization. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, contact Funk at 527-9339, Walt Griffin at (818) 889-2613 
or Supervisor Vicky Howard's office, 582-8010. MARY F. POLS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; CANDIDATES SOUGHT FOR SCHOOL BOARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pleasant Valley School District Trustee Leonard Caligiuri will not seek 
election to a second term in November, he has announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo residents interested in running for his position or one of the other 
two seats up for election this year will have the opportunity to learn more 
about the duties of school trustees at a forum tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms of Trustees Jan McDonald and Val Rains also expire this year. 
McDonald said this week that she has not made up her mind whether to run. Rains 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald, elected in 1990, said she will decide against seeking reelection if 
another candidate emerges who will represent the viewpoint of parents and 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald said she hopes that the November election will have a wider field of 
candidates than the contest two years ago. Pleasant Valley school officials 
were concerned by the low level of interest in the board election in 1992. Only 
three candidates ran for two seats, which were won by Ricardo Amador and Robert 
Rexford. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's forum may help potential candidates decide whether to run, McDonald 
said. The forum will be held from 7 to 8 p.m. in Room 7 at El Rancho Structured 
School, 550 Temple Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps people who are wavering one way or the other will make up their 
minds," she said. MAIA DAVIS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new trolley will clang down the streets of Ventura come Friday, shuttling 
tourists -- and residents, if they choose to hop aboard -- between the harbor, 
the pier and downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday unanimously approved a franchise contract for 
Madison & Associates to operate a gasoline-fueled trolley through March 1.The 
same company operates trolleys in Ojai and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare, which will be good all day, will be $1 for adults, 50 cents for 
senior citizens, and free for children under 5 years of age, residents over 75 
and guests of the hotels whose advertisements will be plastered on the sides of 
the trolley car. 
</P>
<P>
 The trolley service will not cost the city anything, at least initially. The 
operator plans to recoup most of its expenses from the advertising contracts, 
city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the contract expires in March, the city plans to replace the privately 
owned trolley with one it will purchase with the help of a $76,996 federal 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
 The council would then ask for bids for the trolley franchise. The operator 
would then run the business using the city's trolley car. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; COUNTY BOARD BACKS EXPULSION OF STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Education on Monday upheld an Oxnard Elementary 
School District decision to expel a 14-year-old student for bringing a stun gun 
to school. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing the case during an open hearing, the board voted unanimously 
to support the district's decision, saying it had acted rightfully in the 
expulsion proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The eighth-grader at Fremont Intermediate School was suspended March 14 after 
another student got hold of his stun gun and zapped two others on the school 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, who has had 101 detentions and suspensions over the last two years, 
was expelled from the district until January, said Glenn Swiatek, a paralegal 
who represented the student. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview after the hearing, the boy's mother said she was notified of 
only three suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Swiatek said the youth's parents should have been notified that they were 
entitled to meet with school officials before the expulsion hearing. He said 
officials should have explained to the parents why expulsion was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joan Birdt, the attorney representing the district, said a letter was sent 
to the parents the day after their son was suspended in March, notifying them 
of their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's mother said her son had taken the gun to school because he wanted to 
scare some kids who had been harassing him. CHRISTINA LIMA

 Fifteen Oxnard organizations, including the school district, have won awards 
for their waste-reduction efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard School District has recycled 2.3 tons of green waste since April, 
saving about $60 a month on waste-dumping fees, said Hope Stadin, operations 
supervisor for ground maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than taking tree trimmings and yard clippings to a dump, the district 
finds it cheaper to pay the city to haul the green waste to a recycling center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to give attention to business and education institutions that are 
saving landfill space, natural resources and energy," said Jay Duncan, city of 
Oxnard recycling specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Other agencies honored for their waste-reduction programs include: EGNG Rocky 
Flats Inc., Esplanade Mall, Merchants Home Delivery Service Inc., Procter & 
Gamble, St. John's Regional Medical Center, Capistrano's restaurant, Channel 
Islands High School, Future Care, GE Plastics, Hueneme High School, Landspeed 
Production, Martin V. Smith property managers, Oxnard College and Wells Fargo 
Bank. CHRISTINA LIMA

SCYPHERS' REHIRING IS ENDORSED BY PRINCIPAL; SIMI VALLEY: BASEBALL COACH WAS 
ACCUSED OF MISHANDLING HIS TEAM'S DISCIPLINE AND FINANCES. SCHOOL BOARD WILL 
DECIDE WHETHER HE WILL RETURN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Scyphers, Simi Valley High's embattled baseball coach, has Principal 
Kathryn Scroggin's approval to return next season despite a rancorous fight 
over allegations that the successful coach mishandled the team's discipline and 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District board will vote on Scroggin's 
recommendation at a closed-door meeting at 6 tonight at City Hall, before the 
regularly scheduled open meeting at 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The board traditionally approves recommendations its principals make, but the 
rehiring of Scyphers is not guaranteed because of the nature of the case, board 
members said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the board will have to review the seriousness of the charges," member 
Debbie Sandland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, who has led the Pioneers to national prominence in his 16 years as 
coach, said Scroggin told him last week that she would ask that his contract be 
renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy the principal has recommended me for hire and hopefully the board 
will see it her way," Scyphers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, 41, was suspended as coach May 3, pending police and district 
investigations into possible financial and disciplinary improprieties. Scyphers 
has admitted that he accepted money for rental of the Simi Valley field in 
violation of district rules. In addition, he violated state high school rules 
when he paid his assistant coaches with rental money without the school's 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has admitted to a traditional team disciplinary practice in which 
players bid small amounts of money for the right to paddle teammates who break 
team rules. The practice violates the state Education Code. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County district attorney absolved Scyphers of criminal wrongdoing 
June 8. The school lifted his suspension the next day, nearly two weeks after 
the end of the high school baseball season. Scyphers missed the team's final 
seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the reinstatement, Scyphers needed Scroggin's recommendation to coach 
next season. All coaches in the district are hired on one-year contracts, and 
Scyphers said Scroggin gave him no indication about his status. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was quite surprised with the recommendation, obviously," Sandland said. 
"I'm very concerned because the paddling is a violation of the Education Code. 
That's what we have to keep focusing on." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Diane Collins would not comment specifically on the Scyphers 
recommendation, but said she leans toward following the principal's choice in 
such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it is the responsibility of the principal to make those decisions, 
and I usually support the principal," Collins said. "In general, I think you 
hire good people and you respect their decisions that deal directly with their 
(schools)." 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Michael, one of the parents who led a drive to persuade the district to 
reinstate Scyphers, said she was cautiously optimistic about the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't trust (school administrators) anymore," said Michael, whose son, 
Jeff, will be a senior first baseman next season. "It's still up to the board 
to approve him or not. And it's still up to their egos, how badly have they 
been bruised."

STUCK ACCELERATOR BLAMED IN CAMARILLO CAR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 71-year-old Camarillo woman whose car accelerator may have been stuck ran a 
red light at a busy Camarillo intersection during rush-hour Monday morning, 
causing a chain reaction that left five other cars damaged and two other people 
with minor injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo woman, Hazel Yee, was in fair condition at St. John's Pleasant 
Valley Hospital in Camarillo with two broken legs and internal injuries, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 8:40 a.m. as Yee drove her 4-year-old sedan north 
on Ponderosa Drive, Sheriff's Deputy Jim Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 First she went through two stop signs at Adolfo Road and Appian Way, then 
through a red light into the intersection of Ponderosa and Las Posas Road at 
about 45 m.p.h., Wade said. Her car collided with a van driven by Guillermina 
Lopez, 32, of Camarillo. The van spun 180 degrees and hit another car in the 
intersection, Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yee's car continued through the intersection, over a curb and into a parking 
lot, hitting an unoccupied parked car, which traveled 50 feet and smashed into 
two other parked cars, Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like there might have been a problem with the car," Wade said. "She 
said she couldn't stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yee told investigators that she did not have any problems when she last drove 
her car several days ago, Wade said. She was not cited because the accident 
might have been caused by a stuck accelerator, Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez and her passenger, Benita Mercado, were treated at St. John's Pleasant 
Valley Hospital and released. PEGGY Y. LEE

EX-SHERIFF'S OFFICER FACES THEFT CHARGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Ventura County Sheriff's Department supervisor was ordered to stand 
trial on a charge that he stole a firearm from a property room and sold it at 
an Oxnard pawn shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark set a July 11 arraignment for 
Norman A. Wade, who faces a single count of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 During a short preliminary hearing, Sheriff's Sgt. Patrick Buckley testified 
that in 1991 Wade admitted taking the gun from the crime lab to use for 
protection as he drove home. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade, 49, has pleaded not guilty to the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 He headed the Sheriff's Department crime lab but was fired after pleading no 
contest two years ago to stealing a license-plate registration sticker from the 
property room and falsifying registration documents from his own car, Sheriff's 
Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade was found guilty and sentenced to two years probation for that crime.

CITY BUILDING 'BRIDGE' TO YEAR 2064; THOUSAND OAKS: GROUP DEVISES PLAN FOR TIME 
CAPSULE TO BE BURIED OUTSIDE CIVIC ARTS PLAZA. ARTIFACTS MAY INCLUDE KIDS' 
PREDICTIONS FOR THE FUTURE.

<P>
 If our great-grandchildren want to check out a video of this year's Thousand 
Oaks City Council meeting, they just might get a chance -- in the year 2064. 
</P>
<P>
 They might also get to flip through the yellowed pages of a high school 
yearbook from the Class of 1994. Heft a stone from the Civic Arts Plaza 
construction site. Or marvel at the antiquated data in a decades-old science 
textbook. 
</P>
<P>
 All those artifacts of modern-day Thousand Oaks will likely end up in an 
elaborate time capsule called "The Roots of Our Lives," slated for burial in an 
oak-shaded courtyard outside the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the 18 residents who dreamed up the idea will present their 
vision to the Civic Theaters Commission at a 7 p.m. meeting in City Hall. The 
commission has already approved the concept of the capsule. Wednesday's meeting 
will offer the first look at the details. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want it to be like a bridge between generations," said organizer Marion 
Schillo, wife of Councilman Frank Schillo. When the capsule is opened in 2064, 
to celebrate Thousand Oaks' centennial, "it'll remind the (residents) that 
every city is built on the people who were here before," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, assuming the people who live here in 2064 remember to open the 
capsule. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times, capsules are just plain lost," committee member Marge Wilson 
said. "We don't want our capsule to disappear into a hole in the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the Thousand Oaks capsule alive, organizers plan to anoint 50 children 
as guardians. 
</P>
<P>
 These keepers of the capsule will attend the initial ceremony this fall, then 
return in two decades to celebrate the city's 50th anniversary by adding more 
artifacts. At that ceremony, they will select another group of youngsters to 
carry on the tradition at the city's 75th birthday bash. 
</P>
<P>
 A final batch of children will preside over the grand unsealing as Thousand 
Oaks celebrates its 100th year. 
</P>
<P>
 The original capsule and future additions will all be buried in a cement 
vault, which will double as a bench outside the Civic Arts Plaza. A decorated 
stone wall will provide a scenic backdrop, embellished with a copper oak tree 
and a textured mountain ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to highlight it in some way, so in five or 10 years, people 
remember where the heck it is," Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the bench and the plaque and the artifacts will cost about $7,100 -- 
considerably more than the capsule committee's original budget of $5,000. But 
committee members feel confident they'll find the extra funds somewhere, with 
help from the City Council and the Civic Theaters Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, they've been seeking items to include in the capsule, hoping 
to represent all aspects of the Conejo Valley.

CITY MAY TAP CASH RESERVES TO PAY CIVIC ARTS PLAZA BILLS; FINANCES: THOUSAND 
OAKS COULD USE FUNDS EARMARKED FOR THE GOLF COURSE, TREATING WASTE WATER AND 
PROVIDING LIABILITY INSURANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Seeking quick cash to pay construction bills at the Civic Arts Plaza, Thousand 
Oaks council members tonight will consider plucking $13 million from city 
reserves as a stopgap financing measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Director Robert Biery has recommended pulling funds from seven city 
accounts, which are earmarked for programs such as operating the public golf 
course, treating waste water and providing liability insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The council would then replenish the funds, with interest, after selling 
surplus property to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 This maneuvering became necessary when the council decided to wait out the 
recession before auctioning off the former City Hall building at 401 W. 
Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, city leaders had counted on selling the hillside parcel to finance 
the $64-million Civic Arts Plaza. With that sale postponed due to the sagging 
real estate market, they had to look elsewhere for funds. 
</P>
<P>
 So they turned to their own pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Like an individual dipping into his bank account to pay off credit card debt, 
the city can take money from a flush fund to cover a shortfall elsewhere in the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike individuals shuffling money from one pocket to another, the city 
must repay its "internal loans" with interest, to be sure each fund maintains 
the appropriate balance in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the city is both debtor and creditor, the finance director can charge 
lower interest than the prevailing bank rate. The city can also remain flexible 
about the term of the loan, paying off the principal and interest when money 
becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
 To raise enough cash to settle accounts with itself, the city will likely have 
to sell several properties in addition to the former City Hall on Hillcrest 
Drive, Mayor Alex Fiore acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the council could get rid of a passel of undeveloped parcels in 
the Greenwich Village neighborhood near the Moorpark Freeway, Fiore said. Or it 
could sell the 11 acres on the eastern edge of the Civic Arts Plaza to a movie 
theater chain or another private developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever land ends up on the auction block, Fiore said he feels certain the 
city will be able to pay off its internal loans within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing philosophically wrong with borrowing from yourself," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal up for debate tonight, the council would have to nearly 
drain at least one fund and take significant chunks from other accounts to 
cover costs at the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore insisted the city would retain enough cash in each account to cover 
daily needs. "This doesn't create any kind of shortage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And City Manager Grant Brimhall added his own assurance: "There would be no 
reduction in any of the services or functions that flow from these funds as a 
result of the borrowing."  
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski expressed concern that juggling money from one 
fund to another could leave the city shorthanded should an unexpected need 
arise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit would be the asset replacement fund, which pays for updating city 
equipment such as computers, cars and maintenance materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Biery's plan calls for borrowing $4 million from the fund, which had a balance 
of just $4.8 million at the end of last year. Brimhall said the fund has grown 
since last year's budget report, providing an adequate cushion, but he could 
not state the latest account total. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to know, does this affect our other choices, our other spending?" 
Zukowski asked. "I would like to know how these (loans) will impact other areas 
in our city." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will confront that question head-on tonight, as they consider 
two demands on the golf course fund. 
</P>
<P>
 To cover costs for the Civic Arts Plaza, Finance Director Biery has suggested 
borrowing $1 million from the golf course account. That would leave barely 
enough money to cover another proposal up for a council vote tonight -- a 
$2-million project to spiff up the Los Robles Golf Course by replacing the aged 
irrigation system and rebuilding the cramped tee boxes.

VALUE THE TOPSOIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was shocked by a recent proposal to develop city-owned agricultural land 
into privately owned commercial developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura has some of the finest agricultural land in the world.Climate and soil 
conditions are unique here. In Germany, where topsoil is scarce, it is illegal 
to build on or destroy quality topsoil. When will Californians begin to value 
this gift? 
</P>
<P>
 I wish Ventura County's agricultural business could enjoy a renaissance. I 
wish that organically grown produce, and the higher price it brings, could 
revitalize Ventura County's agricultural community. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw raspberries in the market that were sent Federal Express from El 
Salvador. Why can't we produce and ship produce at competitive rates? The 
markets also have red, yellow, orange and purple bell peppers from Holland at 
extravagant prices. Someone in Ventura County is missing out on an excellent 
business opportunity. Why can't we Federal Express our bell peppers around the 
world? 
</P>
<P>
 With the current concern over the excessive use of pesticides, why can't 
Ventura County agriculture set the standard for ecologically wise farming? I 
believe there is a demand for it. 
</P>
<P>
 We must decide if we are going to value our orchards and fields and use them 
wisely, or if we are going to hand them away to developers who will use them 
for private profit.

DEVELOPING ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The proposed sports complex at Kimball and Telephone roads is a community 
effort that requires voice petition support from citizens of Ventura. Ventura's 
large variety of sports programs are administered by volunteers who have the 
dedication to see that our youth have the opportunity to participate in 
athletic activities. This community effort has at least 8,000 children 
participating and 5,000 adult players. 
</P>
<P>
 The city can swap 87 acres of poorer development land on the east end for the 
97 acres. The developer has committed $2 million in development funds, which 
have been dwindling each year. Several organizations have been solicited to 
assist in the development and operation of the facility as a community project 
that stands to benefit a wide range of people. Daily operations may be 
self-financed by these organizations and not subsidized by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 This sports complex provides for manageable growth and should not wait the 10 
to 15 years as proposed by the opposition. Ignorance and apathy to not consider 
development can result in lost opportunities and aging of the current 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 One east-end homeowner, who initiated the opposition, has been quoted in the 
newspaper as saying that he would accept payment of $500,000 for his $300,000 
home in order to stop the opposition. There is an apparent price behind their 
voter initiative with no high ideals of planned community life. The community 
requires the complete facts and motive behind initiatives.

 Thirty years ago Ventura had the look of a community. Then growth without 
planning happened. More and more cookie-cutter houses on tiny lots were built 
on prime agriculture land, along with ugly tilt-up concrete office and light 
industry parks. This was hopscotched through a large area without any vision, 
allowing the richest soil in California to be paved over. I am sickened 
whenever I see it. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently more of the same is on tap, with two or three subdividers pushing 
to take more of the agricultural greenbelt for development. Where are the 
lovely homes on large lots as can be found in Camarillo, Thousand Oaks and 
Ojai? Where are the ordinances to promote beauty? Where is the planning even 
now? For that matter, where is the cultural center in a town the size of 
Ventura?  
</P>
<P>
 Please, let's not have more boring houses crowded onto small lots with all the 
attendant traffic. Save our precious agricultural land until there is some idea 
how the bad planning of the past can be repaired.

UNWELCOME SIGNAL

<TEXT>

 Notice to all parents with cable TV: 
</P>
<P>
 I recently found out about a situation that I consider disturbing and since I 
was able to correct it, I would like to share this with other Conejo Valley 
parents. I found out that it was possible to tune in most of Channel 53 and 
watch a not-very-scrambled pornographic channel (Spice-1) that runs 24 hours a 
day.The picture was similar to a photo negative that once in a while had lines 
which blurred out most of the video but still showed quite a bit of 
pornographic material. The audio part, however, was completely unscrambled and 
every moan, groan and curse word was clearly audible. 
</P>
<P>
 I called Ventura County Cablevision to lodge a formal complaint, at which time 
they told me that they have a "trap" they can install (at no cost) to the 
outside junction box which will block out all audio and video signals of 
unwanted channels from coming into the house. My trap is now installed and it 
does work. 
</P>
<P>
 Since my son told me he found out about the channel from kids at school, it 
was obvious to me that a lot of kids are watching this without their parents' 
knowledge or consent. My hope is that VCC gets so deluged with requests for 
traps that they are forced to upgrade their scrambling technology so that if 
you are not paying for an adult channel, it would be impossible to receive it 
on a systemwide basis and not on a house-by-house basis.

CONSIDER BICYCLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the focus of the "Riders Wanted" article on June 14 was on public 
transit, I object to the statement "Car pools and city buses are currently the 
only option for residents cutting down on car use." 
</P>
<P>
 Has no one considered bikes? 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's not too dangerous. I formerly rode Victoria Avenue (from the beach, 
past the 101 intersection to Ralph's) and currently ride Channel Islands 
Boulevard (Victoria Avenue to C Street). Those are two of the busiest 
intersections of road around. 
</P>
<P>
 Too far? Unless you must go more than 8 to 10 miles from work, figure on 40-50 
minutes maximum (average 12 m.p.h). And it's great exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere to keep the bike? This could be a problem. All I can say is thanks to 
open-minded employers who let us keep our bikes inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring transporting kids or equipment during the commute, probably the most 
prevalent excuse is lethargy. Think about it.

JIM MURRAY: IT'S NOT A GAME, IT'S A RELIGION

<TEXT>
<P>
 Listen, did you ever hear of a World Series War? How about a Super Bowl War? 
The Final Four War? 
</P>
<P>
 Can you imagine the United States marching into Canada because the Toronto 
Blue Jays beat the Phillies or Braves in the World Series? Picture us bombing 
Ottawa because they just won a mere playoff game over, say, Detroit? 
</P>
<P>
 You've heard of the Gulf War, but what if we had a Golf War? What if England 
blockaded our East Coast ports because we'd won the British Open? Opened 
unrestricted submarine warfare on us for a Tennis War if Pete Sampras won 
Wimbledon again?  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's far-fetched. Of course, it won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 But let me tell you of a sport in which it actually did happen -- World Cup 
soccer. It actually started a war. That might be all you have to know about 
World Cup soccer and the passions it arouses. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a game, it's a religion. A holy calling. For God, country and glory. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 1970 when the so-called "Soccer War" complicated life on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 Wars used to be started when archdukes got bombs thrown at them, or subs sank 
ocean liners, or territorial disputes erupted or ideologies clashed.  
</P>
<P>
 This one started over a game. Honduras and El Salvador were trying to qualify 
for the World Cup, when such brawling broke out that it spilled over into 
all-out armed conflict, the Soccer War. Salvadoran troops invaded and after two 
weeks of bloody fighting, 2,000 lay dead and thousands more wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hardly soccer's finest hour, but it was indicative of the feelings that 
run so high in this quadrennial international blood-letting. Let no man think 
World Cup soccer is merely another game, a sporting event, an afternoon in the 
park. It's World War III. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you picture President Clinton pulling the Philadelphia Phillies to one 
side before the World Series and promising them new Mercedes-Benz cars if they 
triumphed and, alternately, threatening to fire the coach if they didn't? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has no compunctions about doing something 
similar. The George Steinbrenner of the Middle East, he fires coaches (and 
players) at will. If his interventions are subject to criticism, well, Saudi 
Arabia is in the World Cup, isn't it? And England isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 You can see the World Cup is not exactly sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccerites don't get paid like their American athletic counterparts. Like 
Americans, they are venturing into the areas of bonuses and other rewards. But, 
in general, Brits earn around $75,000 a year, with bonuses ranging around 
$1,000 per individual achievement and, sometimes, almost double their salaries 
for the equivalent of a league pennant. German players of star quality earn 
around $200,000 a year with incentive bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy pays the highest salaries. There, star players can average $1.5 million. 
Spain has entered the bidding field for central European stars lured out of 
Bulgaria and what's left of Yugoslavia with $2-million contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 In South America, the ante is lower, with players getting no more than $60,000 
a season plus bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In Africa, the players seem to be raised for export only. Hardly a European 
club is without an African or two. Recruitment is easy. The condition of the 
pay scale on the Dark Continent can be seen in the activities of the Cameroon 
squad, which threatened to boycott its game with Brazil last week. (Brazil 
didn't seem to notice whether the Indomitable Lions showed up or not, beating 
them, 3-0, which, in soccer, passes for a landslide.) The Cameroon players were 
mutinous because a government representative who was supposed to show up with a 
satchelful of bonus money for them seemed to have been delayed in transit. 
That, too, is World Cup soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cameroon soccer foundation countered with a demand that the suspected 
clubhouse lawyer in the case, the goalkeeper, Joseph-Antoine Bell, be removed 
from the team. The lack of faith of the Cameroon players in their federation is 
understandable. Its electricity in the recent past has been shut off for 
non-payment of bills. They don't want to be the first team in the history of 
the World Cup (which hit the soccer fields 60 years after Edison's invention) 
to have to practice by candlelight.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, a certain amount of eccentricity is to be expected of a sport whose 
participants regularly hit the ball with their heads. I mean, how'd you like to 
get banged over the head 10 or 15 times a game with a 14- to 16-ounce 
leather-covered (or high-tech plastic-covered) sphere inflated to 13 pounds of 
pressure? Some brain damage is to be expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest mystery to Americans is the lack of scoring, which has degenerated 
from a 5.4 average in the 1954 games to about 2.2 today. My granddaughter, 
Danica Erin, took notice of this for me when she observed the dimensions of the 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems big enough to put a lot of balls in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly. It's eight yards wide by eight feet high. You think Wayne Gretzky 
wouldn't like to have that target to shoot at? Instead of his net, four feet 
high by six feet wide? You would think 20 goals a game would be poured through 
an opening you could drive a car through. But the weekend games produced four 
shutouts and one 2-1 game. Clearly, World Cup needs a World scorer. A Babe 
Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the whole world participates, only six countries have won World Cups 
in the 64 years of its existence. One of them -- Argentina, Brazil, Germany or 
Italy -- figures to win again this year. The two others -- England and Uruguay 
-- aren't even here. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup has many pluses, not the least of which is no TV commercials. Play 
is continuous. No timeouts. Nothing stops the clock. Like that battery rabbit, 
it just keeps going and going. No out-of-bounds stoppages, no endless meetings 
of officials to discuss the rules. None of the ludicrousness of pro basketball, 
in which the last 40 seconds of a game can last up to a half an hour or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The clock keeps moving right through every incident, including that of a 
player lying on the ground, either injured or faking it, and whatever playing 
time is lost is tacked on at the end of the half or the game. In our pro 
football, a phalanx of doctors and trainers scrambles onto the field if a 
player has a cut lip, and the clock stops while a grateful television seizes 
the time to slip in a half dozen or so commercials, network promos or similar 
nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
 It has not yet become the Dodge Truck or the Pizza Hut World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The host country has won five of the 14 Cups. Might not be the way to bet this 
year. These Yankees are not Murderers' Row. 
</P>
<P>
 But these coaches will do anything to win this real World Series, this true 
Super Bowl. In a book on the history of the sport, they tell the story of the 
striker who took too many balls to the head and fell. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a concussion. He doesn't know who he is any more," the coach was 
told. "Good!" he answered. "Tell him he's Pele."

WORLD CUP SOCCER '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; U.S. PLAYERS LEFT IN DARK; RULE: THEY 
SAY THEY WEREN'T TOLD ABOUT CHANGES IN YELLOW CARDING. HARKES CLAIMS HE 
WOULDN'T HAVE PLAYED SUNDAY HAD HE KNOWN. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The coaches and staff of the U.S. World Cup team have apparently never 
understood new FIFA guidelines regarding yellow cards and failed to tell the 
U.S. players that getting two in the first round would lead to a one-game 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem arose after Sunday's game against Romania, when midfielder John 
Harkes received his second yellow card -- a warning about rough or illegal 
play. Soccer's international governing body, FIFA, had announced six months ago 
that single yellow cards would be erased after the first round but that 
multiple yellow cards would be carried over. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkes received his second yellow card in the first half Sunday for 
encroachment. After the game, he and team officials appeared stunned by the 
news that Harkes would be suspended if the United States plays another game. 
Germany's 3-2 victory over South Korea on Monday all but assured the United 
States of playing Brazil or Sweden next Monday at Stanford Stadium. The team 
has not clinched a spot in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Nuttall, general manager of the U.S. team, took responsibility for the 
yellow card mix-up Monday, responding to a question about who was to have told 
the players of rules changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The burden ends right here," Nuttall said. "If the players were misinformed, 
then it's myself and the coaching staff that bear the burden. That's where the 
burden lies." 
</P>
<P>
 Harkes said Monday that if he had known a second yellow card would have meant 
a game suspension, and given the fact that the U.S. team believed it would have 
no trouble gaining a draw against Romania, he would have asked Coach Bora 
Milutinovic to keep him out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. appeal on Harkes' yellow card was rejected by FIFA on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials Sunday and Monday made reference to "confusion" about the rule, 
but the only confusion seemed to be among the U.S. team and staff. FIFA 
announced the rule change at the draw last December and sent letters on Dec. 23 
-- in English -- to all 24 participating federations. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, FIFA clarified the ruling last week when questions arose. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, the news never reached the U.S. team. Obviously upset but guarded, no 
U.S. players Monday were willing to say which team official gave them the wrong 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I came to this team, we were all told the yellow cards canceled after 
the first round," said Alexi Lalas, who was carded in the first round. "It's 
our responsibility as players to know the rules of the tournament we're playing 
in. The fact that John Harkes went out to the field yesterday without the 
correct information is thoroughly embarrassing to all of us. I feel so bad for 
John because he should have been armed with that information, and he wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been trying to prove to the rest of the world that we've gained 
experience and we're so much better at playing soccer. And then we do something 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 After Sunday's game, U.S. officials at first said they would not appeal the 
yellow card, saying there was no traditional avenue to appeal the ruling. They 
later filed an appeal sometime after 9 p.m., about five hours after the game. 
FIFA rules state that protests must be lodged within one hour of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic and other team officials told reporters that Harkes would be 
available to play. The team met after the World Cup roster was finalized at the 
beginning of the month and several topics were discussed, among them rule 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 But, according to the players, they were never given a straight answer 
regarding yellow cards carrying over to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the team have been better informed? 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," Tab Ramos said. "Team officials, without saying any names, told 
us a few days ago that yellow cards were going to get erased. I remember at 
halftime, John was worried about his yellow card and I looked over to him and 
said, 'What are you worried about? There's no problems. You'll be able to play 
the next game, anyway.' We didn't know the rule and I don't think it's our 
fault and I don't think it's John's fault." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Harkes: "It should have been explained to the players. Nothing was ever 
made clear to the players."

NCAA CHANGE DUMB TO SOME; BASKETBALL: NEW RULE THAT ALLOWS UNDERGRADUATES TO 
RETURN TO SCHOOL AFTER TESTING NBA DRAFT STIRS CONTROVERSY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 So, Utah Coach Rick Majerus, tell us how you really feel about the new NCAA 
rule that allows undergraduates to test the NBA draft, but then return to 
school if they're unhappy with the outcome: 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell it was done by the NCAA and not the NBA," said Majerus, a former 
assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks. "Because the NCAA doesn't know what 
the hell it's doing. The ramifications of this rule are mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
 Majerus isn't flying solo on this trip. Mike Tranghese, Big East Conference 
commissioner, calls it "absolutely, in my view, one of the worst rules ever 
adopted." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Reynolds, director of player personnel of the Sacramento Kings, says the 
NCAA "meant well, but they made a bad rule." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Williams, general manager of the Orlando Magic, simply asks, "What did 
this accomplish?" 
</P>
<P>
 Good question. Only six months old and the pet project of highly respected 
North Carolina Coach Dean Smith, no less, NCAA Rule 12.2.4.2.1 has created a 
debate that will rage well beyond Wednesday's NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say the new rule deserves a pat on the back. Critics suggest a slap 
in the face. Coaches and athletic administrators from such powerful conferences 
as the Big Ten, the Big East and the Pacific 10 say they won't be happy until 
the rule is amended or rescinded altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Enacted at last January's NCAA convention, the rule was well- intentioned. In 
short form, it says a player can become available for the NBA draft, with the 
option of regaining his college eligibility within 30 days of the pick. As 
always, there are strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a player is allowed to take advantage of the rule only once 
during his career. He is also allowed to receive negotiating advice from 
parents, legal guardians, coaches, a school's professional sports counseling 
panel and even an agent, but only if that player doesn't hire the agent as his 
official representative. Nor is a player allowed to participate in league- or 
team-sponsored tryouts. To hire an agent or attend a tryout would cost the 
player his NCAA eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "This benefits the guy who doesn't make a good decision, who overestimates his 
value to the NBA," said Jan Hubbard of the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 The perfect example: Sean Higgins, a reserve forward on Michigan's 1989 
national championship team and a starter on a 1990 Wolverine team that finished 
23-8 and was eliminated in the second round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Higgins, the fourth-leading scorer on the team, forfeited his senior season 
when he declared himself eligible for the draft. He was sure he was going to be 
taken in the first round, perhaps even be a lottery pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Higgins was the last player selected in the second round. He lasted a 
little more than one season, was waived by the San Antonio Spurs and now plays 
professionally in Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew, I tried," said Michigan Coach Steve Fisher. "I knew he was making a 
grave mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Had the new rule been in place, Fisher said, Higgins would have returned to 
Michigan and completed his final year of school. But with no such option 
available, Higgins became a casualty of an NBA dream and NCAA inflexibility. 
Maybe that's why Fisher now supports, in a tepid way, the idea of offering 
players another chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thought is good," Fisher said of the new rule. "Why they did it is good. 
Now they need to find a way not to make it so cumbersome." 
</P>
<P>
 The rule gives undergraduates a safety net, but it also creates undeniable 
problems and legal loopholes. And yes, the NCAA's heart might have been in the 
right place, said Orlando's Williams, but where was its mind? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure they thought this all through," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the NCAA contention that the rule benefits the student-athlete. 
According to the NBA, which opposes the rule, the new legislation might do more 
harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, the NBA provided itself with a nifty safety net. While an 
undergraduate can return to school after the draft, there is a price. There, in 
the fine print, is a provision that allows an NBA team to retain the draft 
rights of a player for a full year after his college career is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, say Minnesota junior guard Voshon Lenard, who has declared 
himself eligible for the draft, isn't selected until the 25th pick in the first 
round. Then what? 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new NCAA rule, Lenard could return to Minnesota for his senior 
season, but the NBA team that chooses him would retain his rights until the 
1996 NBA draft. Like it or not, Lenard probably would receive a contract based 
on his place in the 1994 draft, not on his playing status if he signed a year 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Being one of the 54 picks guarantees nothing. Only seven of the 19 players who 
left school early for the 1993 draft are in the NBA. In the two previous 
seasons, 28 undergraduates made themselves available. Only nine are in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, 13 undergraduates have made themselves available for the draft. 
Players such as Purdue junior Glenn Robinson, California sophomore Jason Kidd 
and Connecticut junior Donyell Marshall are all but guaranteed to go in the top 
five. The draft-day fates of Lenard, Louisville's Clifford Rozier and 
Cincinnati's Dontonio Wingfield, who declared after his freshman season, are 
less clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone sees everybody make $10 million, so they think they're going to make 
it," Reynolds said. "Hey, a lot of them should be serious about their school." 
</P>
<P>
 But even if a player decides to return to school, a scholarship might not be 
waiting. What happens if a coach has to decide between offering a place to the 
nation's No. 1 high school recruit, or to a returning letterman who tested the 
draft and wasn't picked? What happens if a coach couldn't wait until the player 
finds out where he'll go in the draft? 
</P>
<P>
 As for loopholes, the rule isn't without its share. The most glaring involves 
free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Majerus said he told Utah freshman forward Keith Van Horn of Diamond Bar to 
declare himself eligible for the draft without claiming the right to return to 
Utah. That way, if Van Horn isn't selected, he will become a true free agent, 
able to make his own deal with any team. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I would do if I were him," Majerus said. "Of course, (the NCAA) 
hasn't considered that at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility exists for other players, including high school seniors and 
college freshmen, to try for free agency -- and right now there's not a thing 
the NCAA and the NBA can do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Also disturbing is this possible scenario: A player is selected in the second 
round and chooses to return to school. Nine months later, as the NCAA 
tournament approaches and it is apparent the player has reached an entirely 
different level of play -- i.e. -- Connecticut's Marshall as a sophomore vs. 
his junior year -- he receives a phone call. The team that drafted him the 
previous June has suffered a series of injuries and is willing to take a 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Sign here and you can be in an NBA uniform tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not good," said John MacLeod, who spent 18 seasons coaching in the NBA 
before accepting the Notre Dame job in 1991. "There's the downside. But do you 
really think that youngster could come right out of college ball and make a 
difference? The adjustment is so different." 
</P>
<P>
 The point is, say critics of the rule, it could happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Listening in amazement to the criticism is New Orleans Athletic Director Ron 
Maestri, who is chairperson of the NCAA Professional Sports Liaison Committee. 
It was the Liaison Committee that first took up the cause 12 years ago of 
giving a player a second chance. It was also the Liaison Committee, said 
Maestri, that supposedly had the support of the coaches for such legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Now this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm shocked," Maestri said. "All of a sudden we're having some 
coaches say, 'I don't know what it's all about.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Maestri disputes almost every point made by those in favor of repealing the 
rule. He said the new rule will not cause a widespread exodus of 
undergraduates, nor will it cripple programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what it will do is this: let all those guys come out and see what 
happens. It might drive those kids back. They'll go back to school and they'll 
stay in school those four years. It will rid them of those delusions of 
grandeur." 
</P>
<P>
 The only possible gray area, he said, involves the role of agents. The NCAA 
rule allows an agent to serve as "an adviser," but how do you prevent the 
adviser from crossing the line? 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be splitting hairs," Maestri said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando's Williams was more blunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "How's (a player) going to figure anything out without an agent?" he asked. "A 
kid's going to come in and hammer out a whole deal? I think not." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches such as Smith, who gave his blessings to Michael Jordan, James Worthy, 
J.R. Reid and Bob McAdoo to leave North Carolina early, and Kansas' Roy 
Williams maintain it isn't that hard for a player to determine his likely 
salary after the draft. Players and salaries are often slotted by NBA teams and 
in most cases the estimated earnings will be equal or up to 10% more than what 
a draftee received the previous year. And as usual, undergraduates can rely on 
their coaches and the NBA players' association to help obtain salary figures. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, Notre Dame's MacLeod said, a player actually has an option 
to return to school. Before, it was NBA or bust. 
</P>
<P>
 Option or no option, commissioners such as Tranghese say they have a mandate 
from their coaches to change the rule. If all goes as planned, Tranghese said, 
a Big East member school will sponsor such legislation in time for the 1995 
NCAA convention next January. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a well-founded idea, but when you try to deal with it in practical 
terms, it just doesn't work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A disappointed Maestri said the Liaison Committee will meet again next month 
in July and plans to review the rule's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been of the opinion that nothing's set in stone," he said. "If we 
find out this is a bad rule, I'm sure our committee would resolve that." 
</P>
<P>
 To listen to the rule's detractors, the sooner, the better.

A DEMOTION FOR OFFERMAN; DODGERS: STARTING SHORTSTOP IS SENT TO ALBUQUERQUE. 
DEFENSIVE SPECIALIST BOURNIGAL IS CALLED UP TO REPLACE HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprising move, the Dodgers sent Jose Offerman to the club's triple-A 
team in Albuquerque on Monday and recalled Rafael Bournigal, the best defensive 
shortstop in the club's farm system. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a gutty move by Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, who has 
long been criticized for handing Offerman the starting shortstop job at the end 
of the 1991 season and staying with him, despite his defensive shortcomings. 
But Claire, who says he has not given up on Offerman, said the move was not 
precipitated by Offerman's defense, which has improved considerably, but by his 
season-long struggles at the plate.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think that a step backward can help in moving forward," Claire said. "There 
are some things that Jose can benefit by with some time that will help him and 
his approach to hitting, and help him be the type of hitter he should be. And 
his fielding also, he has made improvement, but there are some things we talked 
about today that he can work on down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Offerman, who will report to Albuquerque on Thursday, was batting .210 with 
eight doubles, four triples, one home run, 25 runs batted in, two stolen bases, 
38 walks and 38 strikeouts in 243 at-bats. Bournigal, 27, batted .332 at 
Albuquerque, with eight doubles, one home run and 22 RBIs, and struck out nine 
times in 208 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Bournigal made the team in spring training but was sent to Albuquerque shortly 
after the season started. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it will be 10 days or two weeks, you can't predict the future," 
Claire said of the demotion. "I hope Bournigal, just like I hope Jose, can 
contribute to this ballclub. Rafael's strength is certainly his defense, but 
for Jose, this is just part of a story of a career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rafael doesn't have the strength to drive the ball like Jose, but one of his 
assets is that he doesn't strike out much. We got him primarily for his 
defense, that is his game. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you send a player down, they must spend 10 days unless there is an 
injury. You can never predict what will happen, but in Jose we hope he can 
continue to contribute to this club. I don't think there is anybody on this 
team or in the organization who doesn't want Jose to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 During the team's last trip, to San Diego and Houston, Claire began discussing 
the move with Manager Tom Lasorda and his coaches. Offerman, 25, batted .193 in 
April and .213 in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say he was surprised, but he was very professional about it," Claire 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Offerman batted .269 last season with 21 doubles, 62 RBIs, 77 runs, 151 hits 
and 30 stolen bases. But he made 79 errors over the last two seasons and was 
privately criticized for mental lapses in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Offerman bulked up last winter, worked hard on his defense in winter ball and 
came back a steadier fielder. He has committed only eight errors this season, 
compared with 17 after the same number of games last season. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has been frustrated at the plate, and in one game threw a tantrum in 
the dugout after Lasorda asked him to sacrifice with the pitcher on deck. That 
incident, on national TV, brought him under disciplinary action by the club, 
and he was subsequently benched for three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have already passed too (many things) in Los Angeles and I don't know that 
anything that happens is going to affect me anymore," Offerman said at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Claire said that incident had nothing to do with sending Offerman to 
Albuquerque. He also acknowledged that Offerman had survived this long in the 
majors because of his bat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that his bat was working helped him stay," Claire said. "His RBI 
totals were certainly respectable, hitting in the spot he is. But he is a much 
better hitter than what he has shown us. We talked about how he needs to use 
the whole field, hitting it more on the line and utilizing his speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda, who has been without a backup shortstop this season, said the move 
was warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that is best for him right now, for him to go down and get some 
things worked out, " Lasorda said. "He's got to get his batting stroke back and 
he's got to raise his confidence level again." 
</P>
<P>
 Bournigal, who took over at shortstop for the Giants' series, arrived Sunday 
night. He acknowledged that he was excited. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think I'm ready," the 27-year-old native of the Dominican Republic 
said. "I hit over .300 and I think I can help the Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Dodgers expressed surprise that Offerman was sent down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly was unexpected," third baseman Tim Wallach said. "But maybe it 
will help him. Jose is a good kid and he just needs to get settled." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bill Russell said Offerman showed improvement in his fielding, but he 
needs work on his hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Bournigal, Russell said, "Even though he hit at Albuquerque, we didn't 
bring Bournigal here for his bat. He can go get the ball with the best of 
them."

NHL DRAFT; IF OFFER IS RIGHT, DUCKS MIGHT TRADE NO. 2 PICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the second pick of the NHL entry draft today, the Mighty Ducks have a 
chance to get an almost sure-fire future star. 
</P>
<P>
 But anyone who wants to see center Radek Bonk, defenseman Ed Jovanovski or 
goaltender Jamie Storr in a Duck uniform might be a bit uncomfortable to learn 
that General Manager Jack Ferreira was in the Rams' war room for the NFL draft, 
watching as they twice traded their first-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a lesson in how to trade down," said Ferreira, who watched the Rams 
trade from fifth to seventh, then from seventh to 15th and is entertaining 
offers for the NHL's second pick overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether any of the teams eager to move up will come up with a sweet enough 
deal remains to be seen. Ferreira would be inclined to trade the pick only if 
he could get an established young player -- not an older veteran -- and another 
pick no lower than 15th or so. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings, who have finally finished paying for the Wayne Gretzky deal and 
have a first-round pick for the first time since 1990, are looking for a power 
forward or perhaps a goalie with the seventh pick overall, though new General 
Manager Sam McMaster is not averse to trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida, which got the No. 1 pick by choosing to let the Ducks pick ahead of 
it last year, is believed to be leaning toward Jovanovski, a big, hard-hitting 
and versatile defenseman, in part because the Panthers have no particular need 
for a center. Then again, General Manger Bill Torrey hasn't ruled out trading 
his pick. 
</P>
<P>
 If Florida takes Jovanovski, the Ducks will be free to take Bonk, a big, 
skillful Czech who scored 42 goals for Las Vegas in the International League 
after starting the season as the youngest player in league history at 17. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ducks could pass on Bonk and Jovanovski, instead picking Storr, the 
top-rated goalie in the draft. No goalie has ever gone higher than fifth in the 
entry draft, and virtually the only strength the second-year Ducks have is at 
goaltender, with Guy Hebert and Mikhail Shtalenkov. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Ducks like Storr, and Ferreira insists the interest is real, not just 
a ruse to make teams who want Storr think they need to trade for the pick.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the players the Kings are eyeing is Brett Lindros, younger brother of 
Philadelphia's Eric Lindros and something of a wild card. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he doesn't have his brother's scoring skill, Brett Lindros is the 
prototype of the big forward the Kings want. 
</P>
<P>
 The snag is that Lindros is said to be against playing in Los Angeles because 
of family disdain for Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 And people remember what happened when Eric refused to play in Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't necessarily mean the Kings would stay away from Lindros if he's 
available, but others they are looking at include Ryan Smyth, another tough 
forward, and Jeff O'Neill, a smaller forward with tremendous scoring potential. 
Should Storr last until the seventh pick, which is unlikely, McMaster will 
probably grab him.  
</P>
<P>
 Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Only the first two rounds of the draft will be conducted today, the rest of it 
Wednesday. . . . The Kings have named John Perpich, an assistant coach the last 
four seasons with the Washington Capitals, as an assistant to Coach Barry 
Melrose. Ron Salcer, the agent for the Kings' Rob Blake, said there has been a 
"significant drop-off," in the team's most recent contract offer to the 
24-year-old defenseman.

 Carter played only one season in Los Angeles, 1991, but he got into 101 games 
while platooning with fellow catcher Mike Scioscia. The former three-sport 
standout at Sunny Hills High in Fullerton was signed as a free agent the next 
year by Montreal -- where he had begun his career in 1974 -- and retired at the 
end of the 1992 season having caught more games, 2,056, than any other player 
in National League history. Carter, 40, lives in Florida and is the color 
commentator on the Marlins' telecasts.

PARK, 18, CAME OF AGE FAR FROM HOME; HOCKEY: FORMER RANCHO PALOS VERDES 
RESIDENT WHO MOVED TO TORONTO TO PLAY JUNIOR HOCKEY IS EXPECTED TO BE PICKED IN 
NHL DRAFT. 
</P>

<P>
 When the winds gusting off Lake Ontario made his teeth chatter, Richard Park 
knew he wasn't in Rancho Palos Verdes anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first winter, wow! I didn't even know what a winter coat was," he said. 
"Well, maybe that's an exaggeration, but it's pretty much true. I like winter 
now. It's nice to see the change of seasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Park was 13 when he gave up the warmth and comfort of home to play hockey in 
Toronto, hoping to improve his skills in Canada's youth and junior leagues. His 
parents, who had emigrated to the United States from Korea when he was 3, 
didn't approve of their youngest child's plans, but his determination melted 
their opposition. Smiling bravely, they packed him off to Canada, chaperoned by 
their older daughter, Christina. 
</P>
<P>
 The separation was especially wrenching for Jean Park, who helps her husband, 
Paul, in the family's import-export business. Jean speaks little English, but 
her anguish over Richard's departure needed no translation. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was really hurt when Richard was leaving, and she still feels the same 
way," said Claire Park, the middle of the three Park children. "But as long as 
Richard is happy, she's happy." 
</P>
<P>
 For Richard, there was no question. He had to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played at a tournament in Vancouver when I was 13, and the three centers on 
the Blackhawk team were supposed to be the best American players," Park 
recalled. "People were already talking about them playing in the NHL, and I was 
this kid from California, so nobody was talking about me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to this super series and adapted pretty well. But people were still 
talking about those three centermen and I didn't enjoy that, so I decided to 
move and prove to myself, my parents and other people in Toronto that Richard 
Park was going to be a better player than those three. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are those three now? In junior B (the second-best junior level). 
They're not really anything." 
</P>
<P>
 But Park, who turned 18 last month, might be something. 
</P>
<P>
 A center for the Belleville Bulls of the Ontario Hockey League, he was rated 
the 30th-best junior prospect in the NHL entry draft by the league's Central 
Scouting Bureau. He was ranked 10th in the midseason ratings, an honor for any 
player, much less one born in South Korea, raised outside the usual hockey 
circles and modest in stature at 5 feet 11 1/2 and 185 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his first ranking, Frank Bonello, director of Central Scouting, 
called him "a centerman with exceptional ability (whose) size will not hold him 
back. He's got a lot of exceptional talent and a lot of hockey sense." 
</P>
<P>
 His end-of-season rating, however, plunged sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he's considered a second-round pick in today's draft. 
</P>
<P>
 His talent was evident last winter in the world junior tournament in the Czech 
Republic, where he scored three goals and two assists for Team USA in eight 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever he is picked, Park will be the second native of South Korea to be 
drafted, joining defenseman Jim Paek. The Pittsburgh Penguins drafted Paek and 
traded him to the Kings last season. 
</P>
<P>
 For Park to get this far has taken a lot of dedication and concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 His friends usually went surfing and skateboarding after school, but Park, who 
was drawn to hockey after seeing a game during a public figure skating session, 
wasn't tempted. He was at the Olympic Ice Arena in Torrance, working on his 
skating or his passing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I laced up my skates and put on my helmet, no one could distract me," he 
said. "When I get on the ice, that's fun time. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Sundays I'd get up at 5 and skate, go to church from 8 till noon, go back 
to the rink. I'd skate seven to 10 hours on Sundays and during the week skate 
and play . . . It was like pond hockey. I'll never forget those Sunday 
mornings." 
</P>
<P>
 Those hours on the ice refined his skills quickly and he played against 
opponents two or three years older. To progress further, he would have to play 
against the best, and that meant Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't go alone, though. That's where Christina, six years his senior, 
stepped in. She agreed to keep an eye on him, becoming his advocate when the 
Metro Toronto Hockey League kept him off the Young Nats midget team and 
becoming his guardian to give her legal authority to make decisions for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "People didn't like the fact that a California kid came to Toronto to play 
hockey and maybe took the spot of a Canadian kid," said Christina, who is 
studying law at the University of Toronto. "People wrote letters to the MTHL 
and he wasn't able to play the first 20 months. I remember he had tears coming 
out of his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard, but I think that helped him mature, got him tougher and made him 
work hard. He's really a mature kid now." 
</P>
<P>
 Given a chance, Park showed that being from Southern California was as good as 
being from South Porcupine, Canada. He scored 49 goals and had 107 points for 
the Young Nats during the 1991-92 season and was chosen seventh by Belleville 
in the OHL's 1992 draft of midget-level players. He made an effortless jump to 
major junior hockey, scoring 23 goals and 61 points last season and made the 
OHL's all-rookie team. In his first 35 games this season he had 18 goals and 46 
points, but tailed off to finish with 27 goals and 76 points in 59 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had a disadvantage," he said. "I had the support of my parents and 
that was a big plus. A lot of those Canadian kids are pressured into doing 
well. I had the advantage of knowing I had nothing to lose. If I didn't 
succeed, I could still succeed at life. I always thought I had an advantage 
with living." 
</P>
<P>
 He enjoys living in Belleville, a city of about 37,000 located 90 minutes east 
of Toronto. He boards with a local family and has lunch every weekend with 
Christina.

MONTCLAIR PREP'S STEELE TO TAKE SABBATICAL FROM COACHING BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Montclair Prep baseball Coach Walt Steele said Monday that he will take at 
least a two-year sabbatical from his position to pursue a master's degree in 
education at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele will remain head of the math department at Montclair Prep during his 
coaching leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Reece, Montclair Prep's athletic director, said the school is accepting 
applications for the coaching position, but added that P. C. Shaw, a 1987 
Montclair Prep graduate and former Cal State Northridge assistant coach, is a 
leading candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele's leave was expected by the school. He has intended to pursue a 
postgraduate degree for several years, but said he could not tear himself away 
from the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest decision has been when (I would leave)," Steele said. "My wife 
and I have been discussing this every year, but every year, there seems to be a 
reason to stay. If I don't do it this year . . . sooner or later I had to say 
this has to be it." 
</P>
<P>
 Steele, 37, is 131-42-3 in seven seasons at Montclair Prep and coached the 
Mounties to two Southern Section championships. He graduated from Pepperdine 
and played in the Milwaukee Brewers' minor league system. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Montclair Prep has left the door open for his return, Steele said, he 
is interested in coaching at the college level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to maybe move to the college ranks if possible -- if anybody will 
have me," he said.

 Some Yankee scouts had tabbed Repoz, a left-handed outfielder, as the heir to 
Mickey Mantle.He made his debut with New York in 1964, but his hitting proved 
disappointing and he was traded to Kansas City before settling with the Angels 
in 1967. He hit 13 home runs in '68 and 18 in 1970. He left in '72 to start a 
five-year stint in Japan, where he became one of that country's most feared 
batters. Repoz, 53, is plant manager at Fabrica International, a carpet 
manufacturer in Santa Ana.

WORLD CUP SOCCER '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; ANALYSIS; AFTER SECOND-HALF RALLY, 
KOREANS TAKE HOME PRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 What World Cup '94 had been missing until now, it finally found in the 
furnace-like heat of Texas -- an exceptional game that will be talked about for 
years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The final statistics will show that Germany defeated South Korea before a 
sellout crowd of 63,998 at the Cotton Bowl, 3-2. But they will not show the 
drama and the passion, the energy and the emotion that made this the finest 
game of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first 45 minutes, the Germans, led by striker Juergen Klinsmann, the 
baker's son from Stuttgart, gave as comprehensive a display of attacking soccer 
as has been seen in this World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second 45 minutes, South Korea, led by the inspirational play of 
defender Hong Myung-bo, produced the bravest comeback since, well, since it had 
done the same thing against Spain on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 There seemed to be no stopping Germany in the first half. Coach Berti Vogts 
tried yet another new combination, but the inclusion of giant 
defender-turned-midfielder Guido Buchwald was the key change. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchwald, a member of the 1990 World Cup-winning team, is an inspirational 
player, his presence alone lifting his teammates' game and spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 12th minute, Klinsmann scored a superb goal, turning and hitting the 
ball on the volley after receiving a pin-point pass from Thomas Haessler. South 
Korean goalkeeper Choi In-young had no chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight minutes later, Klinsmann was again involved as the Germans went two 
goals ahead. His throw-in found Buchwald, who was tackled and brought to the 
ground but managed to swing a leg at the ball, connect with it perfectly and 
send it spinning against the left post beyond the goalkeeper's dive. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebound was slammed into the net by the onrushing Karlheinz Riedle and 
Germany was on its way. The South Koreans appeared headed for a heavy defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 That impression did not fade, even as the half wore on and the Asian team 
gradually began to mount some promising attacks. The German right flank 
appeared particularly vulnerable and Shin Hong-gi and Kim Joo-sung, both 
blessed with excellent ball skills, began to exploit German right back Stefan 
Effenberg's lack of speed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koreans had found the weak point in the German defense -- Vogts played 
Thomas Strunz in the right back position against Spain with no better success 
-- and Germany's future opponents will have taken note of the weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 They will also have noticed that in this game, Lothar Matthaeus played an 
attacking role, often moving up into the midfield and even into the forward 
line. When he did so, Juergen Kohler dropped back to play sweeper and did so 
quite well. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 37th minute, Klinsmann again received a free kick from Haessler, held 
off a defender who was all over his back and hit a right-footed shot that 
slipped beneath the diving goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3-0, the game appeared over. Surely Germany would send on its substitutes 
in the second half, conserve energy and simply run out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 That might have been Vogts' intent, but it was not the way it worked out. Kim 
Ho, the South Korean coach, had other ideas, no doubt having reminded his team 
about such things as duty and honor and pride, not to mention South Korea's 
hopes of staging the World Cup in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 He also made two critical substitutions. Choi, the luckless goalkeeper, was 
benched, possibly for a long time. Kim also brought his right wing Seo 
Jung-won, he of the blazing speed and blistering shot, on in place of Cho 
Jim-so. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Kim handed the captain's armband to Hong, having taken it from Choi. 
</P>
<P>
 The lecture and the accompanying moves worked. A chip shot from the tireless 
Hwang Sun-nong made the score 3-1 in the 52nd minute, to the delight of the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong was next to pierce the Germans' armor, firing a tremendous shot past 
goalkeeper Bodo Illgner from about 25 yards in the 63rd minute. This got the 
Korean drums in the stands beating a lot louder and the Korean flags waving 
much more enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
 Vogts substituted Andreas Moeller for Matthaeus and cast anxious glances at 
Effenberg, who was being exposed time and again on the right wing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koreans kept coming, pinning the Germans in their own half and trying 
everything to score the third goal that would send them home unbeaten. 
</P>
<P>
 They never got it, but the team's brave performance scored a victory of 
another kind. A victory for the sport.

WORLD CUP SOCCER '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SPOTLIGHT; NO RESPECT FOR IRISH

<P>
 One of the nastier press comments was reported in the Daily Telegraph, quoting 
the Jornal do Brasil of Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
 "The anti-Irish columnist, writing under the pseudonym 'Verissimo,' says the 
Irish look like Norwegians pretending to be Englishmen and give the impression 
of having been selected by the 'HY' method." 
</P>
<P>
 This, he claims, consists of Jack Charlton entering an Irish pub at random, 
looking around at the customers and with the words "Hey, you," picking out 
those who have a "typical soccer player's face, or that of a criminal, or 
preferably a combination of both." 
</P>
<P>
 He then takes them to a nearby field where they start training -- "many with 
their pint of Guinness in their hands."

 The worst World Cup scenario, apart of course from the Republic of Ireland 
going out, would be if the United States failed to qualify for the next stage. 
</P>
<P>
 There were more than 90,000 people in the Rose Bowl to see their new heroes go 
down, 1-0, to Romania, and as my wife Judith pointed out as we watched the 
match: "What's it going to be like if the United States ever becomes interested 
in football?" . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If the Americans really are serious about making "soccer" a big sport over 
here, watch out. They will be turning out 6-foot 7-inch central defenders who 
can run 10 seconds for the 100 meters.

 Although referees have been discussed almost as much as the heat during the 
first two weeks of the World Cup finals, none will be sent home early for poor 
performances, FIFA officials said Monday in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 David Will, chairman of FIFA's refereeing committee, said during a news 
conference that soccer's governing body was slightly disappointed with two 
performances in the first 26 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than two-thirds have received exceptionally high marks from the 
independent referees' inspector," said Will, who declined to name the two 
culprits. 
</P>
<P>
 Some referees are expected to be sent home only after the quarterfinals, when 
fewer officials will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Will also dismissed a botched call during Sunday's Colombia- 
</P>
<P>
 Switzerland match in which Carlos Valderrama elbowed Ciriaco Sforza in the 
face, knocking him down. Colombia scored its first goal shortly after the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Will said the use of television replay was not an option to correct such 
problems. Because FIFA officials are trying to speed up the game, Will said 
using the replay would be "wasting time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Referees' decisions, even controversial decisions, are part of the game, part 
of the excitement." he said. "The referee can't rely on anything but his 
linesman. He must call what he sees." ELLIOTT ALMOND

 The World Cup is now 10 (sic) days old, and still it beguiles. In fact, it 
beguiles so much that it is only right and proper to make the case that it is 
far too good to last.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; GIANTS: STRAWBERRY A NO-LOSE PROPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Francisco Giants won 103 games in their renaissance season of 1993. 
They led the National League in hitting and were second in runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, Manager Dusty Baker was saying Monday night, if his team was winning 
with a similar frequency and hitting with a similar frequency, the Giants 
wouldn't have undertaken the experiment that is Darryl Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, Baker said, what's the gamble? 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances surrounding Monday night's opener of a three-game 
series with the West-leading Dodgers -- a critical series in a potentially 
strike-shortened season -- the Giants were a long way from Baker's maybe: 6 1/2 
games back, 11 under .500, last in the league in hitting and next to last in 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to make excuses, because I don't want our players making any, 
but the reality is that we basically lost 30% of our team," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crippled by injuries that have begun to heal and absent the now-resurgent bat 
of Will Clark, Baker said the season has been akin to a torture chamber at 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Has the torture only begun? Some would cite the signing of Strawberry, coming 
off 2 1/2 years of inactivity prompted by his back injury and drug 
rehabilitation, and suggest as much. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Baker nor hitting instructor Bobby Bonds buy it. They believe 
Strawberry will have a support system he may not have had with the Dodgers. 
They have met with Strawberry -- "the man is right in head and heart," Bonds 
said -- and contend he has recognized his problem and dealt with it. A 
weakness, as Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda has said? 
</P>
<P>
 "That riles me," Bonds said. "Would Lasorda say the same about Mickey Mantle 
because he had a drinking problem? You're talking about people who had problems 
-- illnesses really -- and got them resolved. Dusty and I saw the true Darryl 
Strawberry." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry was signed for the prorated minimum and $7,000 a game. His brother, 
Michael, will live with him in San Francisco, travel with him. A bargain price 
for a potential superstar, said Baker, who has known the Strawberrys since 
Darryl was at Crenshaw High; had warned him before he left the New York Mets of 
the greater pressure and temptations when a player returns to his hometown and 
said he recognizes Strawberry is on a tightrope and is prepared to keep him 
there with even tighter discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darryl gives us a third player (Matt Williams and Barry Bonds being the other 
two) capable of carrying a club," Baker said. "Tommy's comments are only part 
of his motivation. We were all satisfied with the answers he gave us. Darryl 
knows he has a lot to prove." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry is working out at an undisclosed location. He may go on minor 
league rehabilitation during the coming weekend and could be in the Giants 
lineup before the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker has seldom used the same lineup twice. He has had difficulty 1) finding 
a reliable No. 3 hitter to replace Clark -- ostensibly Strawberry's role -- and 
2) difficulty finding healthy bodies. Second baseman Robby Thompson missed 43 
games because of a partial rotator tear and the Giants went 15-28. Five of the 
10 players who have been on the disabled list are still on it, with Willie 
McGee out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Third baseman Williams is leading the league in home runs, but Bonds, still 
battling an elbow spur that affects his power at times, is the only opening day 
regular hitting more than .260. The Giants' .220 average with runners in 
scoring position is last in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing Clark made an impact, but we haven't hit as a unit," hitting 
instructor Bonds said. "Will would have had to hit .700. I mean, the way we've 
hit, we could have had Ruth or Gehrig and still been in this position." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Baker: "If Will had done for us (last year) what he's doing for the 
(Texas) Rangers this year, he'd still be here. Things change in baseball all 
the time. The thing is, we could have won 70% of the games we've lost. We 
haven't been blown out. We just haven't got the two-out hit. We haven't got the 
runner in from third base. If the Dodgers and (Colorado) Rockies had been 
playing better, we could be 12 out. I feel fortunate to be this close, and I'm 
confident we're ready to break loose." 
</P>
<P>
 Confident because the pitching and defense has remained among the league's 
best and a healthier lineup will soon be augmented by an apparently healthier 
Strawberry.

MAGIC BUYS PIECE OF THE ROCK; NEW LAKER EXECUTIVE NOW OWNS ABOUT 5% OF THE TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has been the star. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Now meet Magic Johnson, part owner and vice president of the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal that had been imminent since last week was announced Monday, sources 
saying Johnson will pay between $10 million and $15 million for about 5% of the 
Lakers once the sale is given routine approval by the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he will continue to play with his touring basketball team and 
maintain outside business interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just happy to have whatever that percentage is," he said. "This is just a 
great day for African-American people as well as myself, athletes in general. 
This is what it's all about. Whatever (the percentage) is, it's more than we 
had yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said owner Jerry Buss will still pay him $14.6 million next season 
from a previous contract extension and that this deal is not in lieu of that 
money. They also have talked about going in together to buy a team in another 
sport, and Johnson does not rule out the possibility of some day buying more of 
the Lakers. "We'll sit down and talk about that later down the line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Buss: "I am pleased that Earvin's desire for ownership has been realized 
and welcome him to our management staff. His energy, enthusiasm and love of the 
Lakers cannot but help make our organization stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's responsibilities as vice president will range from continued 
opinions on player matters to working with the marketing department to lure and 
maintain sponsors, to stressing to current Lakers that it is important to have 
a role in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is the second person outside of the Buss family to buy into the 
Buss-owned Lakers. Cable television executive Bill Daniels reportedly also has 
5%.

BOOKS & AUTHORS: 'IN CAHOOTS' CONJURES UP BOY'S KINGDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a Newsweek correspondent in the 1970s, Malcolm Cook MacPherson lived in 
exotic locales around the globe. But no place he's been during the past three 
decades evokes such fond memories for him as growing up in Orange County in the 
'40s and early '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 MacPherson, 50, remembers his family going to the public square dances held 
each year in the giant blimp hangars in Tustin, his mother taking him and his 
two sisters to the beach in Corona del Mar nearly every day during the summer, 
and joining his pals at Saturday matinees at the Gem Theater in Garden Grove, 
where the air would be thick with flattened popcorn boxes flying at the screen 
and the manager would have to stop the movie when the cherry bombs were lit: 
"We went there not for the movie, but for the chaos."  
</P>
<P>
 But most of all, MacPherson remembers the orange groves that flourished near 
his boyhood home in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a kid we used to haunt the orchards -- four or five buddies and a couple 
of dogs -- from June until September," he recalled. "We'd shoot possums with 
slingshots and have orange fights. We wore no shirts and no shoes -- just a 
pair of shorts -- and your feet were like leather at the end of summer." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a bygone Orange County that MacPherson, who now lives in Greensboro, 
N.C., conjures up in his new book, "In Cahoots: A Novel of Southern California, 
1953" (Random House; $21). 
</P>
<P>
 The book grew out of one of MacPherson's most vivid Orange County memories: 
the summer of 1954, when he and his buddies were attracted by the sights and 
sounds of giant bulldozers at work in an Anaheim orange grove, a 20-minute bike 
ride from home. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were plowing up orange trees and stacking them in these enormous 
mountains and setting them on fire," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 As the months went by, MacPherson and his pals watched as Walt Disney's vision 
of a Magic Kingdom -- a wondrous land boasting everything from a 19th-Century 
railroad to a 20th-Century rocket ship -- took shape on the former 160-acre 
orange grove. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was," MacPherson said, "right out of a dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreams -- the kind that have lured millions of Americans to California since 
the Gold Rush -- are at the heart of what Kirkus Reviews calls "an entertaining 
evocation of a sunny world in which poverty never pinches too sharply and 
Disney is treated like royalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Set among the post-World War II suburban tract houses the year before the 
bulldozers, "In Cahoots" tells the tale of a struggling Garden Grove family man 
-- a soda-truck driver named Bud -- who rallies his friends and neighbors 
around his latest get-rich plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bud is a man of vision, a dreamer and a schemer who figures out that Disney is 
secretly planning to build the mother of all amusement parks. If he and his 
friends can only find out where Disney plans to build his "fun park," they can 
buy a small parcel of the land before the deal is finalized, and Disney will be 
forced to buy their controlling portion, thus making them all rich. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, which Publishers Weekly calls a "deceptively light, engaging novel," 
is full of the kind of eccentric characters for which Southern California is 
famous. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a religious fanatic named Roland, a former Hollywood costume designer 
who "wanted to get his feet back on the ground," so he got into shoes: He's a 
Buster Brown shoe salesman in Santa Ana. And there's Bud's brother-in-law 
Milton, who rigs up an elaborate crystal set, wrapping himself in the coils, so 
he can communicate with the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 The family in the novel, not surprisingly, resembles MacPherson's. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Bud, his father was a transplanted New Englander who drove a soda truck. 
MacPherson, of course, is the model for Bud's lovable and strong-willed 
10-year-old son, Callum. ("Callum is Gaelic for Malcolm.") 
</P>
<P>
 "Callum is very curious, and he'd much prefer the kind of zany 
unpredictability of adults in terms of his friends and company than he would 
the company of his own peers," MacPherson said. "For him, nothing is better 
than hanging out with adults when the adults are children, and dreamers are 
children. Not one of those men in the book is older than Callum in many 
respects." 
</P>
<P>
 MacPherson, who views the Orange County of his childhood as being no less than 
"paradise," turned 12 shortly after Disneyland opened in July 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (1955) was a really significant summer for me," he said. "That's why I 
wrote 'In Cahoots.' It was the last summer of my childhood. I grew up pretty 
fast after that." 
</P>
<P>
 One foggy evening in October 1955, he and his parents were driving through an 
Anaheim orange grove when another car ran through an intersection two blocks 
south of Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of his parents were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 MacPherson, who was seriously injured, spent four months in the hospital and 
was not able to attend his parents' funeral. When he got out of the hospital, 
he and his two older sisters, who were home at the time of the accident, went 
to live with family friends in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 MacPherson hasn't lived in Orange County since then, but he returns every five 
years or so to visit his parents' graves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been a place I've gone back to because of them," he said. "The 
memories of that time and place are very strong." 
</P>
<P>
 His novel, he said, "is obviously an evocation of fantasy and dreams and the 
fondness of memories of those days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing stops time nearly so forcefully as the death of two parents when 
you're 12 years old. It freezes the imagination in that era. As it turns out, 
part of the true pleasure of writing 'In Cahoots' was that every day for two 
years I was able to be with the people I was separated from by that" tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 And in creating fictional parents, he said, "there was no chance that they 
could be killed because I controlled them, and you can't beat that kind of 
power." With a chuckle, he added: "That's the novelist's power: the power of 
life and death." 
</P>
<P>
 MacPherson, who still occasionally free-lances for Premiere, Readers Digest 
and other magazines, left Newsweek in 1980 after 11 years. As a general 
assignment reporter, he said, he found that "I was repeating myself." 
</P>
<P>
 As he phased out journalism, he began writing books -- thrillers at first, 
then nonfiction, including "Time Bomb," a history of the atomic bomb, and "The 
Blood of His Servants," a critically acclaimed narrative history of the 
Holocaust based on the experiences of a man who identified and tracked down the 
man who had destroyed his family in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 MacPherson said he prefers writing books -- he's done eight -- to journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, you can pick and chose your subjects, and you can go on to 
whatever length you want," he said. "Journalism is maddening because you can 
only stay with something for a day or two, particularly if you're in general 
assignment like (I was) with Newsweek. It's very superficial, and journalism 
really does not teach you how to write. If you're really practicing serious 
textbook journalism, you have to erase yourself from the writing -- 
emotionally, certainly -- and your presence as an observer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wonderful thing about fiction is you are forced to put yourself into it 
emotionally, and the central presence really is you, your voice." 
</P>
<P>
 It took him a long time, he said, to discover his own voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I did initially, of course, was I ducked behind the the kinds of books 
other people were doing, thrillers. Then I ducked behind narrative histories, 
which is journalism essentially in a book form. All of a sudden I said, 'I 
can't do this any more. I will not write that kind of book. I will write what 
comes out of me, even if it's a crashing failure.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Out of that cry of creative liberation came "In Cahoots." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big risk for me writing with the voice I have," he said. "This book 
represents what I am and who I've been for the last 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
 But writing "In Cahoots," he said, "has opened windows and doors for me in 
terms of whatever books I want to write. I just have this wonderful kind of 
fresh air."  
</P>
<P>
 And as a fiction writer, MacPherson said, he can't imagine leaving the 
Southern California of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an era and a place I want to be in for the rest of my life," he said. 
"It is so rich in people and eccentricity and fantasy and dreams. I mean, 
culturally everything happened in Southern California in the 1950s -- music, 
jazz, the beach culture, the whole culture of the highway, the tract-house 
culture, the new individual: the sort of eccentric, crazy guy." 
</P>
<P>
 MacPherson, in fact, is halfway through his next book -- a Southern 
California-set novel that purports "to tell the truth" about an alien visit in 
1955. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is it almost every alien movie from the '50s was set in Southern 
California? There has to be a reason." It's because, he added with a chuckle, 
"it's believable that it would be set there."

 HEAT WAVE: The numbers don't lie when it comes to telling the weather, and the 
numbers this week aren't very pretty (above). Throughout the Valley, from 
Burbank to Woodland Hills, temperatures hover near the triple-digit mark (B1), 
and relief is definitely not in sight. . . . These numbers are much higher than 
normal for this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 GOLD RUSH: The dollar's in big trouble these days (D1), causing anxiety in 
financial circles everywhere. And the Valley is certainly no exception. In 
fact, according to John Coey, a precious-metal trader for Continental Coin in 
Van Nuys, investors are going for the gold. . . . "They're buying gold as a 
hedge against the fall of the dollar," Coey said, "and platinum, too." 
</P>
<P>
 OPEN SPACE: Big companies do two big things when they skip town. They take 
plenty of jobs, and they leave behind plenty of property. It's no different 
this time with Hughes Aircraft Co.'s missiles system division in West Hills, 
although the site may sell quickly. . . . Meanwhile, GM has lowered the price 
for its former Van Nuys plant from $50 million to $30 million. See Valley 
Business, pages 10, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 MISSING BULLET: Baseball is a business, whether it's the majors or the 
all-woman Colorado Silver Bullets. And that meant bad news for ex-Cal State 
Northridge softball star Missy Cress, who was one of four players cut from the 
squad recently. "She wasn't able to make the transition from softball to 
baseball," said Tommy Jones, director of player development. . . . Cress went 0 
for 3 in three games. 
</P>
<P>
 STARTING OVER: Steel just ain't what it was cracked up to be, as was proven in 
the Jan. 17 quake. So it's quite understandable that the directors of the 
Automobile Club of Southern California in Santa Clarita have voted to 
completely rebuild their office building instead of repairing it (B11). . . . 
"We felt, given another earthquake, we could be in danger," said Kelly B. 
Clark, district manager. A Valley Heat Wave

MORE HUMAN RADIATION TESTS DISCLOSED BY ENERGY DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A review has unearthed 48 more experiments in which hundreds of humans were 
subjected to radiation exposure, often with no evidence of consent, the Energy 
Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional human radiation tests were listed in stacks of documents made 
public by the department, including details about 95 previously hidden nuclear 
bomb detonations at the Nevada Test Site.The blasts went undetected because 
they were set off simultaneously with reported tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said the latest disclosures reflected a 
"tremendously tense balance" between providing the public more information 
about the government nuclear activities and maintaining national security. In 
December, she announced her openness initiative with the release of previously 
classified data on nuclear testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Energy Department disclosed that nearly $3.7 million already 
has been spent in efforts to learn more about the extent of human radiation 
experiments since World War II. It said the document searches eventually would 
cost at least $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of 11,000 such documents has disclosed at least 48 experiments in 
which humans were given various radioactive isotopes to determine the effects 
of radiation on the human body. Several tests were as recent as the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the cases were: 
</P>
<P>
 * The use of pregnant women who were injected with radioactive iodine-131 to 
determine effects on the fetus. The women all had been scheduled for 
therapeutic abortions and the aborted fetuses were then tested for radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1946, six employees of a laboratory associated with the nuclear program 
were given plutonium-contaminated water to drink to investigate the absorption 
of plutonium. These tests were described as voluntary and at least two of the 
workers are still alive, according to the summary.

 Rick Davis, coach and general manager of the Salsa, said Monday soccer's 
popularity in Southern California should improve because his team has joined 
Mexico's newly formed Division 1-A. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a wonderful opportunity for the people of Los Angeles to be able 
to enjoy high-caliber professional soccer on a year-round basis," said Davis, 
on a conference call from Chicago after he had completed a telecast of the 
World Cup match between Spain and Bolivia at Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico is reorganizing its professional soccer leagues and invited the Salsa 
to join Division 1-A, which will start play in September. The Division 1-A also 
will play in a cup competition with Mexico's first division. The U.S. Soccer 
Federation board of directors approved the Salsa's request Sunday in Los 
Angeles, voting, 10-8, with three abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton's Titan Stadium will remain the team's home field, 
depending on availability. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa has had success in the past in exhibitions against teams from 
Mexico's first division, beating Chivas and Pumas, Davis said. It also defeated 
World Cup teams from South Korea and Cameroon in recent friendly matches. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa was the runner-up in the American Professional Soccer League last 
season and will continue to play in the APSL. The team plans to carry a player 
pool of 35 and field two teams in case of schedule conflicts during September, 
when the leagues' schedules overlap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa will start its second APSL season Friday in Denver against the 
defending champion Colorado Foxes. The home opener is July 24 against the 
Seattle Sounders.

STRUGGLING O.C. BANK DELAYS STOCK OFFERING; FINANCE: POSTPONEMENT LEAVES 
COMMERCEBANCORP, CONCERNED ABOUT ITS LINK TO FIRST PENSION CORP., OPEN TO 
REGULATORY ACTION. 
</P>

<P>
 Concerned about potential liability from its past business connection with 
First Pension Corp., CommerceBancorp in Newport Beach said Monday that it has 
postponed a stock offering that would have brought in desperately needed 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Another struggling Orange County bank, Pioneer, said that it is negotiating 
with two investor groups about a possible sale of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 For CommerceBancorp, parent company of CommerceBank, the delayed stock 
offering increases the risk of action, even seizure, by regulators. The bank, 
which is considered "significantly undercapitalized" by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp., had planned to raise $14 million through a stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Walter, CommerceBancorp's president and chief executive officer, said in 
an interview Monday that from 1990 to the end of 1993, CommerceBank was a 
custodian for some individual retirement accounts administered by First 
Pension, the Irvine-based investment company that filed for bankruptcy 
liquidation two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has alleged that First Pension's owners 
ran a pyramid scheme that may have resulted in the loss of as much as $124 
million invested by 8,000 clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter said he is not sure what liability, if any, CommerceBank might have. 
But any doubts could have hurt the stock offering, he said, especially the 
possibility that lawsuits might be filed against the bank by First Pension 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he said, the bank decided to postpone the stock offering pending 
a review of those individual retirement accounts, though "the longer the delay, 
the greater chance of (regulatory) actions taking place." 
</P>
<P>
 CommerceBancorp, with assets of about $158 million, has a capital-to-assets 
ratio as of March 31 of 2.14% -- well below the 6.5% federal requirement and 
barely above the crucial 2% level that could trigger a takeover by regulators. 
The capital ratio is an indicator of an institution's reserve against losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer, too, faces the possibility of a federal takeover. The bank, owned by 
Pioneer Bancorp in Fullerton, signed a Federal Reserve order last month 
requiring it to boost its capital by the end of June -- Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank said Monday that it is in negotiations with two potential buyers but 
would not identify them or comment further on the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Timmons, president and chief executive officer of Pioneer Bancorp, said 
that he is not sure whether the bank can meet the deadline. He expressed 
confidence that the bank will not be taken over this week but conceded that 
seizure by the government is possible if no sale agreement is negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing everything we can," he said Monday, "but I can't make any 
promises." 
</P>
<P>
 As of March 31, Pioneer Bancorp had assets of about $133 million and a capital 
ratio of 3.1%.

BUILDING A REPUTATION FOR AIDING THE HOMELESS; CONSTRUCTION: HOMEAID, A GROUP 
FORMED BY O.C. BUILDERS, HAS PUT UP 17 SHELTERS FOR THE POOR IN THE PAST FIVE 
YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 HomeAid will be 5 years old this month, and the group formed to provide 
shelter for the homeless has much to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit organization, started in June, 1989, by the building industry in 
Orange County, has completed 17 shelters with more than 300 beds. Three more 
shelters are now being built. 
</P>
<P>
 The group focuses on the so-called transitionally homeless -- people who are 
in immediate need of shelter because of job loss, illness or desertion by a 
spouse. The number of homeless people in Orange County at any given time, 
including those temporarily on the streets, is estimated at between 12,000 and 
15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Though politically conservative Orange County is not usually considered a 
hotbed of social activism, the program has been highly successful, said Mike 
Lennon, executive director for HomeAid Orange County. The reason, Lennon said, 
is that the program doesn't just seek cash, it asks people to contribute 
materials and skills. 
</P>
<P>
 And because some of the nation's premier home builders, developers, 
construction companies and contractors are based here, the resources are 
available. "The local builders here have been involved in all sorts of 
charities here for years," Lennon said. "I think most people will help the 
disadvantaged if you show them a way." 
</P>
<P>
 HomeAid is a one-of-a-kind program, Lennon said. In contrast to Habitat for 
Humanity, which builds single-family homes nationwide for the working poor, it 
offers temporary shelter to people in dire need.  
</P>
<P>
 Lennon, 47, regards himself as a sort of real estate broker for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take needs and resources and put them together," he said. "Really, HomeAid 
works because of this wonderful collaboration of contractors, suppliers and 
businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 A nonprofit arm of the Orange County chapter of the Building Industry Assn., a 
national trade group, HomeAid now has chapters in Los Angeles, Riverside and 
San Bernardino counties. The next goal, Lennon said, is to go national. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the program has a specific focus, Lennon said, he is optimistic that 
the idea will spread. 
</P>
<P>
 "We deliberately chose the transitionally homeless because people could see 
their investment pay off and see the homeless get back on their feet," he said. 
"And they were doing what they do best -- they were coming out to help with 
their craft." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the severe real estate downturn of the past four years, local 
developers and contractors have contributed more than $4.4 million in cash and 
provided more than 200,000 volunteer hours to HomeAid. 
</P>
<P>
 Lennon, formerly a public relations spokesman for the Building Industry Assn., 
says he took a pay cut to become director of the HomeAid program. A Chicago 
native who has lived in California since 1968, he said he can't imagine 
anything he'd rather be doing.  
</P>
<P>
 "I love the fact that the end result of our work is that we help people with a 
new shot at life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bart Hansen, a principal with Newport Beach builder Shawntana Development, 
worked on the first HomeAid project, which was a 13-bed shelter in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "One roofer, if we'd asked him for $300, would've balked," Hansen said. "But 
we could ask him for a $7,000 roof, and he could get his arms around that. 
That's why HomeAid has been so successful. We're asking our membership to do 
what they do best." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the HomeAid projects are House of Hope, a 45-bed shelter for homeless 
women and children in Orange, Shelter for the Homeless in Westminster and the 
42-bed El Modena Shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a natural fit for the home building industry to be involved in homeless 
issues," said Tim Shaw, executive director of Homeless Issues Task Force of 
Orange County. The nonprofit group has worked with HomeAid on several shelter 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 L.C. (Bob) Albertson Jr., an executive with Newport Beach builder Presley 
Cos., is another HomeAid proponent and serves on the group's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole company is behind the HomeAid project," Albertson said. "It's a 
natural. We can bring contractors and everyone together to do what we do best 
-- build."

CHAIN TO SHIFT HEADQUARTERS TO LAS VEGAS; MENTAL HEALTH: COMMUNITY PSYCHIATRIC 
CENTERS OF LAGUNA HILLS WILL SOFTEN BLOW LOCALLY BY MOVING 30 JOBS HERE FROM 
L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Community Psychiatric Centers said Monday that it hopes to save more than $2 
million a year by relocating its headquarters to Las Vegas and consolidating 
some operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides moving its corporate offices from Laguna Hills, Community Psychiatric 
is consolidating three divisions now based in different parts of the nation, 
said Richard Conte, chief executive officer. Doing so in Las Vegas, rather than 
in Orange County, will be less expensive, Conte said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company owns eight acres in Las Vegas, where construction, labor and 
housing costs are all less expensive than here. "Every penny counts in the 
hospital business," Conte said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 18 months, the company said, it will move about 50 headquarters jobs 
out of Orange County. Transitional Hospitals Corp., an Atlanta division of 
about 70 people, will join the headquarters staff in Las Vegas. And a billing 
office of about 80 to 100 people will be created at the new site. 
</P>
<P>
 The blow to Orange County employment will be softened, however, because the 
company will transfer its managed care division -- about 30 people -- from Los 
Angeles to the Laguna Hills site. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Psychiatric, which is the nation's third-largest chain of private 
psychiatric hospitals, has been restructuring itself since Conte took the helm 
two years ago from his father, James. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the top 20 managers, 18 are new. In February, two brokerages -- Salomon 
Brothers and Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. -- upgraded their recommendations of 
Community Psychiatric stock to a "buy." 
</P>
<P>
 Reasons for the "buy" rating, according to analysts Lori Price and Kathleen 
Baxley, who prepared the Oppenheimer report, include the "firing of weak 
hospital administrators" and the launching of the Transitional Hospitals Corp. 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 The division, which was formed in late 1992, runs subacute hospitals, which 
house patients who may be moved from full-service hospitals but who are still 
very ill. The company has 12 subacute hospitals in 10 states, including one 
adjacent to the site of its new Las Vegas headquarters. This summer, Community 
Psychiatric said, it will finish converting its former psychiatric hospital in 
Brea to a subacute care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Community Psychiatric posted profits for three of the four quarters in 
its 1993 fiscal year, it never overcame a $37.9-million loss for the first 
quarter, when it took a restructuring charge of nearly $55 million after the 
sale or closure of some psychiatric hospitals. For the year, the company 
reported a loss of $24.8 million on revenue of $335.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its financial woes, the company was plagued during the past two 
years by an insurance fraud probe in Texas and lawsuits by several former 
employees who said they were fired for reporting that some workers' credentials 
were faked by their superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Psychiatric was not fined in the Texas case, although three other 
hospital companies were. And it has settled the complaints by the former 
employees, spokeswoman Suzanne Hovdey said.

NORTH CAROLINA BUILDER TO ACQUIRE GOLDEN WEST HOMES IN STOCK DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Golden West Homes, a Santa Ana producer of manufactured housing, will be 
acquired by Oakwood Homes Corp. of North Carolina in a stock deal valued at 
$15.5 million, Oakwood announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakwood, which also makes homes in factories and ships them in modules to 
construction sites, will issue 700,000 shares of its common stock in exchange 
for all the shares of Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kilbourne, chief financial officer of Oakwood, said the acquisition 
gives Oakwood a stronger presence in the West and expands its 
home-manufacturing capacity by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 "This puts our expansion plans a couple of years ahead of schedule," Kilbourne 
said. "We've been growing very aggressively in the Northwest and in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 The merger is expected to close before Sept. 30, subject to certain conditions 
such as approval of both companies' boards of directors and negotiation of a 
final agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilbourne said Oakwood will operate Golden West Homes as a wholly owned 
subsidiary. No layoffs or management changes are expected, he said. The deal 
adds Golden West's 753 employees to Oakwood's 2,300. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West operates factories in Sacramento and Perris, Calif., and Albany, 
Ore. A new plant is expected to open in Ft. Morgan, Colo., this fall. The 
company posted a profit of $1 million on revenue of $97 million for its latest 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakwood, based in Greensboro, N.C., makes homes primarily in the South and 
Midwest. It reported a profit of $24.5 million on revenue of $261 million for 
its latest fiscal year. Golden West Homes at a Glance

BIRTCHER MEDICAL ON THE ROAD TO FISCAL RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Birtcher Medical Systems, which in May hired a turnaround specialist as its 
chief executive officer, said Monday that it has raised $1.6 million from 
investors and from the sale of one of its money-losing product lines. 
</P>
<P>
 That means Birtcher, which makes surgical products, is about 20% of the way 
through its restructuring, said Kenneth C. Cleveland, CEO and president. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, based in Irvine, said it sold 961,667 shares of common stock for 
about $900,000. The money will be used as working capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Birtcher has also sold its Solos Endoscopy Division for $700,000 in cash, 
notes and royalties to Woodbine Optical Corp. of Sharon, Mass. Solos had been 
the leading reason for Birtcher's financial losses, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company lost $18.9 million for the first nine months of the current fiscal 
year. That followed a $1.9-million loss for fiscal 1993 and a $1.2-million loss 
for the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also said Monday that an ongoing patent dispute has been settled. 
Birtcher said that Aspen Laboratories Inc., a subsidiary of Birtcher competitor 
Conmed, has withdrawn its request for an injunction against Birtcher.

<P>
 Qureshey, speaking at the Bear Stearns technology conference in New York, said 
AST's annual revenue will hit $2.4 billion for its current fiscal year and that 
AST will have shipped more than 1 million PCs for the year ending June 30. He 
said the company will focus on its core market of selling to corporations.

TODAY'S EMPLOYERS FIND RICH RESOURCE AMONG 'UNRETIREES'; CAREERS: BUT MANY 
OLDER JOB SEEKERS FACE A TOUGH TIME CONVINCING SOME FIRMS THAT CHOOSING THEM 
CAN BE WISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 After putting in years at the job and leaving with a full pension, many 
retirees don't want to sit back and watch the grass grow. They want to go back 
to work, maybe part time, maybe full time. 
</P>
<P>
 But many face a tough time persuading employers that older can indeed be 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: employers often believe the myths that older Americans can't do 
the work and will be a drain on the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Two authorities believe nothing could be further from the truth. They say many 
employers don't understand that skilled, experienced seniors can boost 
productivity and improve customer service. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, older workers often possess technical and scientific knowledge that 
today's younger workers haven't bothered to acquire. 
</P>
<P>
 According to "Unretirement," co-authors Catherine Fyock and Anne Dorton claim 
seniors attempting to re-enter the work force are often thwarted by employers' 
fears they "will be a detriment to the organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Canny employers, though, such as Wal-Mart Stores, Walt Disney World, Control 
Data Corp., The Travelers Corp., Honeywell Corp., Days Inn, Hardee's and 
McDonald's have been quick to cash in on senior skills. 
</P>
<P>
 By the estimate of the Commonwealth Fund, in 1990, the last year the numbers 
were available, 1.9 million Americans age 55 to 64 were ready and able to go 
back to work. If demographics are any clue, there should be even more today. 
</P>
<P>
 Fyock and Dorton, president and vice president of Innovative Management 
Concepts in Prospect, Ky., provide workplace counseling to such clients as 
AT&T, Hardee's and Federal Express. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting Ernest Hemingway, "Retirement is the ugliest word in the language," 
the authors say retirees have solid reasons to re-enter the work force: pay off 
the mortgage, educate their kids, keep fit, supplement pensions or keep busy. 
Among the "myths" they attack: 
</P>
<P>
 * Retirees belong on a porch in a rocking chair. In fact, thousands prefer to 
stand on their feet all day in some hectic fast-food outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 * They're "slow." In fact, they're actually more productive than younger 
workers, having fewer errors and accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 * They won't stay long. In fact, they're less transient so they actually keep 
jobs longer. Firms such as Western Savings & Loan of Arizona and First Savings 
of San Diego, the authors note, recruit seniors "precisely for their high 
retention rate." 
</P>
<P>
 * They're often out sick. In fact, data compiled by Banker's Life & Polaroid 
Corp. show seniors get higher on-time and attendance marks. 
</P>
<P>
 * They're expensive to train. In fact, since they hold their jobs longer, 
employers get a bigger pay-back when they do train them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seniors are difficult to work with. In fact, "unretirees" have "a lifetime 
of experience" with interpersonal skills. They place "a high value on courtesy, 
tact and diplomacy . . . (and) tend to work easily with co-workers and 
customers," the authors write. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, they provide "a tremendous stabilizing force within a younger work 
force." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mentoring relationships are not uncommon, with younger employees seeking the 
counsel and wisdom of older co-workers in a non-threatening relationship," 
Fyock and Dorton write. 
</P>
<P>
 Other myths: 
</P>
<P>
 * They are viewed "negatively" by customers. In fact, older workers have 
earned a reputation for "stellar customer service and courtesy" and identify 
particularly well with that growing block of customers their own age. 
</P>
<P>
 * They lack workplace experience. In fact, many were veteran managers axed by 
downsizing. Others have "life experience" that could prove invaluable to 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
 As John Russell, president of the Days Inn motel chain, said, "For all our 
talking about it, older people are still the best-kept secret when it comes to 
hiring loyal, steady and capable employees."

EXPLOSIVE GAINS BEING MADE IN THE FIREWORKS INDUSTRY; HOLIDAY: THE AMERICAN 
PYROTECHNICS ASSN. ESTIMATES SALES HAVE MORE THAN TRIPLED FROM 1980 TO 1993, 
FROM ABOUT $75 MILLION TO AROUND $250 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Booming business and skyrocketing sales can best describe -- you guessed it -- 
the state of the fireworks industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the fireworks exhibitors that enliven the nation's skies with an 
explosion of sound and color report steady sales gains over the past two 
decades. Even purveyors of common fireworks say business has been brisk. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Pyrotechnics Assn. estimates industrywide sales -- which include 
everything from 15-cent smoke bombs to slick aerial displays -- have more than 
tripled from 1980 to 1993, from about $75 million to around $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a real surge in interest ever since the '76 Bicentennial 
celebration," said John Conkling, executive director of the pyrotechnics 
association. "Before then . . . some thought it was not too cool to celebrate 
the Fourth of July." 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, millions of Americans will jam parks and ball fields across the 
country to "ooh" and "aah" at thousands of fireworks displays. Countless more 
will attempt a noisy show of their own, legal or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Zambelli Internationale Fireworks, among the largest of the handful of 
family-run companies that dominate the industry, said about a third of its 
business comes around Independence Day. This year, the company has been 
commissioned to do 1,300 holiday displays, including programs in Detroit, 
Pittsburgh, Miami Beach and Louisville. Zambelli also was asked to represent 
the United States in D-day celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Another large exhibitor, Fireworks By Grucci Inc., expects do nearly half its 
business around the coming holiday weekend, putting on roughly 90 displays in 
places like Philadelphia, Boston, Omaha and Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry experts say more local governments and businesses are budgeting for 
fireworks, and many more are organizing public displays beyond July 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say the industry is going to grow even more," said George (Boom Boom) 
Zambelli Sr., who heads Zambelli Internationale. "There's no form of 
entertainment that will draw more people than fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have fireworks in conjunction with a concert or a ball game, it will 
have greater appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Fireworks shows cost anywhere from $8,000 for a 15-minute, manually fired 
display to nearly $1 million for a 30-minute electronically fired, musically 
choreographed extravaganza. The average cost per town runs $17,000; the average 
show, 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the late '60s and early '70s, the budgets were so small. They have not 
been greatly enhanced, but they are bigger, and that has helped (the industry) 
mature," said Philip Butler, a Grucci spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's fireworks displays have come a long way since the Chinese packed 
saltpeter, sulfur and charcoal into bamboo tubes 2,000 years ago. Italian 
explorer Marco Polo discovered them in China and introduced them to the Western 
world in the 1300s. 
</P>
<P>
 China remains the world's largest fireworks exporter, producing nearly half 
the display fireworks and three-quarters of the street fireworks sold in the 
United States. Many larger exhibitors, though, still produce some of their own. 
(Fireworks manufacturing in this country dates back to before the Revolutionary 
War, when gunpowder was packed in rockets and firecracker-type devices.) 
</P>
<P>
 While the principle remains the same, technological advances have made 
fireworks displays faster-paced and more brilliant, often punctuated with 
musical accompaniments and dazzling grand finales. 
</P>
<P>
 "This reflects society," said Conkling. "We were a slower-paced nation 30 
years ago (and) . . . displays used to last more than an hour then. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today we're competing with MTV and rock videos. Attention spans are shorter. 
You try to keep fireworks up to date with the rest of the entertainment 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of the biggest displays are shot electronically, as opposed to 
manually, and some shows are choreographed with the help of a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Grucci, for instance, has developed a software program that coordinates music 
and fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 More technological advances are expected. At the pyrotechnics association's 
annual meeting last fall, Walt Disney Imagineering dazzled some in the industry 
by presenting its own innovation -- an air-powered, multi-barreled, 
computer-controlled and chip-activated firing system.

HERE'S WHAT MAKES THEM GO BOOM! IN THE NIGHT SKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some fireworks facts: 
</P>
<P>
 How they work: The basic ingredient in fireworks is old-fashioned gunpowder. 
The black powder, as it is known, is what lifts a rocket shell.The loud "boom" 
comes from flash powder. 
</P>
<P>
 Visual effects occur when certain chemicals are burned. Strontium salts, for 
instance, produce a red light, copper oxide creates blue, barium nitrate gives 
off green and charcoal or iron radiate orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemical powders are compressed into small pellets called "stars," each of 
which leaves a trail of color upon explosion. A typical shell can have several 
hundred stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The design seen in the sky depends largely on the shape of the shell. Oriental 
shells are round, limited to one color and one explosion, or break. Italian 
shells are a cylinder shape, often with several breaks and colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Where they come from: The Chinese invented fireworks about 2,000 years ago and 
continue to dominate the world market. 
</P>
<P>
 China produces about 75% of the consumer fireworks used in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Who regulates them: Several government agencies, among them the Department of 
Transportation; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; Consumer Product 
Safety Commission, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fireworks like cherry bombs and M-80s are banned by the federal 
government. Several states prohibit all types of street fireworks, such as 
firecrackers, Roman candles, skyrockets, revolving wheels, cylindrical 
fountains and sparklers.

SUMMER IS WHEN HOME BURGLARS REALLY GET HOT; CRIME: CROOKS THRIVE WHILE 
HOMEOWNERS VACATION. THAT'S WHY IT'S ALSO THE SEASON WHEN THE SALE OF HOME 
SECURITY DEVICES SOAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ah, the summer months -- a time to wind down, chill out and get away. Better 
make that lock up and look out as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The summer is peak season for home burglaries. Nearly a fifth of the 2 million 
residential break-ins each year occur in July and August, when most people are 
frolicking at the beach or vacationing miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The season also is hot for home security sales, a growth industry in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 First Alert of Chicago expects to sell 40% of its light timers, safes and 
other security products between now and August. Westec Security Inc. of Newport 
Beach is preparing for a 25% to 40% increase in orders for its customized alarm 
systems in the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the National Burglar & Fire Alarm Assn. reports a 40% jump in 
industrywide sales in the last five years, even though burglaries have actually 
declined slightly during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing a lot of growth in sales . . . (as) the perception of crime is 
on rise," said Linda S. Gimbel, a spokeswoman for the Bethesda, Md.-based 
association. "More and more Americans say they feel safer with a home security 
system. People are buying empowerment." 
</P>
<P>
 Security devices do help, studies show. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes protected with security alarms are about three times less likely to be 
burglarized than those without them and suffer 25% less losses even when 
burglaries occur. (The average take per house is usually about $1,200 in cash 
and goods.) 
</P>
<P>
 But how can consumers make sure they are not getting ripped off by those 
trying to prevent rip-offs? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not always easy when you look at the arsenal of security devices on the 
market today. Homeowners can arm themselves with everything from simple timers 
that automatically control indoor lights to sophisticated infrared sensors that 
detect intruders' footsteps at the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can almost reduce your chances of being burglarized to zero . . . if you 
create a fortress of your home. But (that) will make your life unpleasant in 
the house," said Simon Hakim, an economist at Temple University in Philadelphia 
who has studied the behavior of burglars. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes the best way to ward off burglars is to make life difficult for 
them. "The average break-in time is 60 seconds. If it takes longer than that . 
. . a burglar is likely to go elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing the right security system depends largely on your budget and living 
habits. It is not practical, for instance, to invest in something that costs 
more than the possessions you are trying to secure, especially if you also have 
adequate insurance coverage. You also do not want a system that will severely 
inhibit movement in your own home. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good standard system will cover the perimeters of your home, alert you to 
when there's an intruder and let the intruder know he's been detected. It 
(also) will limit damage in your home and summon help," Gimbel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most home security experts recommend using a combination of electronic alarms 
and simple anti-theft devices such as indoor light timers or outdoor 
motion-sensing flood lights, which give a vacant home a more lived-in look. 
</P>
<P>
 Do-it-yourself alarm kits can cost as little as $200 at many electronic 
stores. Professionally installed systems cost about $1,200 on average, but many 
also have monthly monitoring fees starting at about $20. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice in alarms boils down to two: wired or wireless. A wired system 
includes strategically placed sensors physically linked to a central control 
unit. In a wireless system, the sensors communicate with the control unit via 
radio transmitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Wired systems are considered the most reliable and are the most popular, 
though technological advances, such as longer-life batteries, have helped 
improve sales in wireless alarms, said Joseph Freeman, former president of 
Wells Fargo Armored Services who now runs JP Freeman & Co., a security research 
firm in Newtown, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman said the latest trend is to install a combination of both. "You can 
have a wireless system . . . and then you can run a wire through an obstacle, 
like metallic wallpaper, or a wall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The security products on the market today can adjust to just about any kind of 
home or lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many companies, such as First Alert, emphasize overall lifestyle 
enhancements that keep people safe and ward off intruders. There are devices 
that monitor the level of carbon monoxide in a house or turn down the heat when 
no one is home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest of the world may be frightening . . . (but) safety in the home is 
really the one thing people feel they can have some control over," said Richard 
F. Timmons, vice president of marketing for First Alert. 
</P>
<P>
 That control can be extended to a distance as well. Stuart Barber, marketing 
manager for Rollins Protective Services, says one of its popular home security 
devices is its hand-held light-control device that allow users to turn on the 
lights at their home up to 1,000 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 The more sophisticated home alarm systems will also include extensive 
perimeter sensors that trigger an alarm when an established boundary line is 
crossed. They can be installed at doorways, windows or near overgrown shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common types of perimeter sensors include: magnetic reed switches, 
ultrasonic detectors, microwave detectors and passive infrared detectors. There 
are also sensors that can detect when a screen is cut or glass is broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Cobb, a vice president at Westec Security in Newport Beach, says a 
typical installation usually takes about a day, though larger homes with more 
sophisticated systems can take longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Gimbel says individuals opting for a professionally installed system should 
interview at least three companies before hiring one, ask for references or 
check with their local Better Business Bureau to see if there are any consumer 
complaints. Consumers also need to carefully read their contracts to determine 
if they are buying or leasing the equipment, and have the systems demonstrated 
and inspected when the job is complete, others warn. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the best equipment will not be foolproof if it is improperly installed or 
monitored. "Ninety-five percent of all alarms are false," Freeman noted.

DREAM TEAMS ABOUND EXCEPT FOR ONE; VH-1'S FIRST AWARD SHOW DELIVERS A 
STAR-STUDDED LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As VH-1, MTV's sister network, has struggled to resolve an identity crisis and 
come into its own, it was inevitable the process would involve the cable web 
establishing its own annual awards show-cum-industry schmoozefest. But what, at 
this late date, to give awards for? 
</P>
<P>
 Honoring celebrity charity endeavors was what finally was settled upon, making 
public hoopla out of private altruism. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't this spring's first annual Jackson Family Honors already nail that 
angle? And sooo definitively. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there's always room for two. The first issuing of the VH-1 Honors, 
telecast live Sunday from the Shrine Auditorium, may not go down in 
charity-event infamy with the Jacksons' juicy debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 But it did provide another example of MTV Networks doing what they do best: 
event programming where the ostensible purpose of the event is markedly less 
significant than giving viewers one-off performances they won't see anywhere 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 So, while VH-1's lineup of performing philanthropists -- Bonnie Raitt, Garth 
Brooks, Al Green, Michael Bolton, Melissa Etheridge, Stevie Wonder, Kenny G and 
"the artist formerly known as Prince" -- was predictably star-studded, the real 
draw was the promise of duets, trios, million-dollar quartets and what have 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 This indeed proved the case, with results that were alternately fun and 
forced, but pretty consistently above the awards-show norm. Despite some hokum, 
you didn't feel overly charitable for staying tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening anthem, "Heaven Help Us All," had Wonder joined in quick 
succession by Green, Raitt and Etheridge for a peppy group sing that was more 
good photo-op than sustained thrill. But the evening's calculatedly historic 
confabs picked up from there. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial honoree Brooks, who'd already done a bang-up "Baton Rouge" with a 
bluegrass band, stuck around to duet with the presenter who introduced him, 
James Taylor, on "Sweet Baby James," the country crooner's apprentice-like awe 
evident in his beatific look during his professed idol's turns at the mike. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, the Rev. Al worked the house like his Memphis congregation, reviving 
"Let's Stay Together" with all his pre-clergy magnetism intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Green's solo spot was the evening's highlight, though his subsequent 
soul-o-rama teaming with Raitt and her presenter, Mavis Staples, on a medley of 
"Tired of Being Alone" and "I'll Take You There" was the clear crowd favorite 
through sheer quantity of charisma. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, presenter Kathy Ireland did not duet with her honoree, Michael 
Bolton, whose arena-rock revivalism on "Ain't Got Nothing If You Ain't Got 
Love" could have used either a fly or a super model in the ointment. Neither, 
alas, did Kenny G, Mr. Circular Breathing, make use of the heavy breathing of 
his introducer, Jon Lovitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Other pairings included a near-sublime match of Wonder with Take 6, and a fair 
-- if outclassed -- meeting between Etheridge and Sammy Hagar on "Honky Tonk 
Women." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the artist known as "the artist formerly known as Prince" 
(in lieu of reinventing the language, we'll call him TAFKAP for short) didn't 
deign to share his climactic spotlight with lesser mortals. And didn't need to. 
</P>
<P>
 While TAFKAP understandably provokes cynicism among the grown-ups toward which 
VH-1 is geared, his galvanizing barnstorm here was a timely memory-jogger to 
the effect that he's as stunning a concert performer as he is a cheesy 
self-packager. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind the dancers in pasties and fright wigs: TAFKAP's "Interactive" 
(currently available only on the CD-ROM of the same name, in a recording far 
outstripped by the live version) momentarily re-established him as a monster of 
a rock 'n' roll guitar-wielder, a vein he hasn't much mined since the mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen DeGeneres hosted the 2 1/2-hour-plus overtime telecast, usually quite 
amusingly (though someone should have warned her the "More Than a 
Woman"/"Bald-Headed Woman" schtick in her monologue is as old as the ages). 
Jermaine Jackson couldn't have done it better.

NAVY CASTS A WARY EYE AT DISNEY'S 'TIDE'; MOVIES: THE PENTAGON IS RELUCTANT TO 
ASSIST WITH PRODUCTION OF A DRAMA ABOUT A SUBMARINE MUTINY, WHICH IT CALLS 
FAR-FETCHED AND ALARMIST. 
</P>

<P>
 For Hollywood, a film about a mutiny on board a U.S. Trident nuclear submarine 
has all the earmarks of a box-office hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, "Crimson Tide," starring Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman, seems 
such a sure bet that, with a projected production price tag of $50 million, it 
would be the biggest action film ever mounted by Walt Disney Studios under its 
Hollywood Pictures banner. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the Navy, the story about an armed confrontation by crew members on an 
American nuclear sub seems so far-fetched and alarmist that they are reluctant 
to assist in making the movie, which is scheduled to start shooting Aug. 1. 
And, Pentagon sources say, producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer are 
equally reluctant to change the script if it means toning down the drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. Gary Shrout, the Navy's liaison to Hollywood, says the chances of a 
mutiny on a Trident sub are "somewhat less than getting kidnaped by Martians." 
</P>
<P>
 Scripted by Michael Schiffer and Quentin Tarantino, "Crimson Tide" revolves 
around the U.S. submarine Alabama, which receives a coded message to launch a 
preemptive strike after a renegade politician seizes military bases in Russia 
and threatens to attack America. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Strub, the Defense Department's senior liaison to Hollywood, said he 
hopes the Navy and producers can work out their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a feeling from the production company that they feel the impact of an 
armed confrontation on the sub is unacceptably lessened if it just becomes a 
contest of wills and a war of words," he added. "By the same token, there is no 
question this armed mutiny is not going to make it in the Navy." 
</P>
<P>
 The producers declined to be interviewed for this story, but Disney sources 
said the film would proceed without the military's help if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 To capture the realism of submarine life, a contingent of writers, producers 
and Disney executives took a short cruise late last year on the U.S. submarine 
Florida at the Trident training facility in Bangor, Wash. They visited the 
control room, mess decks, torpedo room and missile compartment and even 
observed a simulated nuclear missile launch that a participant said was "one of 
the scariest things ever." 
</P>
<P>
 "They showed us exactly what steps are needed to be taken administratively -- 
as well as messages and decoding -- before missiles are launched," said one 
source. "It's a fascinating ritualized process in which two people have to hold 
the message, walk to the captain so that all eyes validate it, and by doing 
that, they ensure that it is accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood and the military have had a long and rich history of cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department currently uses two criteria in determining whether to 
lend assistance on a film. First, it must provide the public with a better 
understanding of the military and, second, it should help in military 
recruitment and retention. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the Army opened Fort Jackson, S.C., to director Penny Marshall for 
"Renaissance Man," the Air Force supplied bases for the Clint Eastwood thriller 
"In the Line of Fire," and the Marines supplied vertical takeoff and landing 
Harrier jets for this summer's Arnold Schwarzenegger film, "True Lies." 
</P>
<P>
 But there also are numerous scripts that don't cut it with the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I get through reading a script, I ask myself, 'What impression will a 
viewer have of the Marine Corps when he leaves the theater?' " said Lt. Col. 
Jerry Broeckert, the Marine Corps' liaison to Hollywood. He added, however, 
that the Marines will lend support to a movie that has negative elements in it, 
"as long as they are handled the way we would handle them and they are 
resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 One film that the Pentagon has declined to assist is "Major Payne," a comedy 
starring Damon Wayans that began filming last week in Virginia. It's about the 
Marine's top combat killer who has to make a transition to private life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The show-stopper was that this guy was relentlessly negative," Strub said, 
recalling the script he read. "He was abusive. He was a Neanderthal. He was 
outrageous. He had a shaved head and a gold front tooth with a diamond in it. 
Now, I can assure you, military regulations don't allow that. We were 
encouraged to laugh at this guy's deviant behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is also a scene in which an Army colonel, whose son is in school, 
kidnaps a bunch of students and keeps them in an Army arsenal," he added. "This 
is a completely unrealistic military portrayal." 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Eric Gold contends the film "doesn't denigrate the military at all." 
In fact, he noted, while the colonel in question flips out, Wayans' character 
is the one who "saves the day." 
</P>
<P>
 "Are (Pentagon officials) saying no one freaks out, like at that Air Force 
base in Washington the other day (in which over two dozen people were shot)?" 
Gold asked. "Are they saying this doesn't exist? Of course it exists." 
</P>
<P>
 Another film that the military rejected is "Outbreak," a Warner Bros. film 
about a deadly virus, which will star Dustin Hoffman, Morgan Freeman and Rene 
Russo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department objects to the plot because it depicts high-ranking 
military officers developing biological warfare weapons. Bio-warfare, Strub 
said, "was declared null and void during the Nixon Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Pentagon likely will provide locations and other assistance 
for a competing virus movie, "Crisis in the Hot Zone," starring Robert Redford 
and Jodie Foster. The 20th Century Fox film is based on a true-life account of 
a deadly virus discovered in Maryland, in which Army personnel race to find its 
source. 
</P>
<P>
 Another project the Pentagon passed on is Paramount Pictures' upcoming 
"Forrest Gump" starring Tom Hanks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We turned down 'Forrest Gump,' first, because it had an unrealistic Vietnam 
scene -- Forrest was put into a platoon that consisted entirely of people like 
him," said Army Lt. Col. Mitchell E. Marovitz. "And, second, there was an 
anti-war rally in which he was seen in uniform giving an anti-war speech."

IN HOLLYWOOD'S LINEUP; MOVIES: SCOTT PATTERSON GAVE UP ON BASEBALL AFTER FIVE 
YEARS IN THE MINORS. THAT WAS HARD WORK. BUT THE PRACTICE PAID OFF -- NOW THAT 
HE'S IN 'LITTLE BIG LEAGUE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Scott Patterson was a pitcher for the Atlanta Braves' and New York Yankees' 
triple-A teams for five disappointing years.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was called up for the (majors) a few times, but they never activated me on 
the 25-man roster," Patterson acknowledges. "It was a little frustrating. 
That's why I walked away from it." 
</P>
<P>
 And walked into acting. In fact, the blond, blue-eyed Patterson has finally 
made the majors thanks to Hollywood. He plays a pitcher for the Minnesota Twins 
in "Little Big League," Castle Rock's family comedy about an 12-year-old boy 
who inherits the Twins from his late grandfather and becomes the team's 
manager. Patterson's cocky Mike McGreavy doubts his young manager's ability and 
gives the boy a difficult time. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Patterson auditioned for the bigger role as the team's wholesome 
first baseman. Timothy Busfield eventually got that part. "Things being what 
they are out here, I didn't have enough credits," Patterson explains at his 
Beverly Hills publicist's office. "I think they always saw me as McGreavy as 
soon as I walked in." 
</P>
<P>
 "He is really good," says director Andrew Scheinman. "But this is a more 
Middle America story -- he did seem kind of urban. He was such a great baseball 
player, coupled with his acting. I think he has a real shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, 31, acknowledges he has a lot in common with McGreavy. "I was kind 
of like him when I played," he says. "I never made the amount of money he did. 
I never had the amount of success he did. But I wasn't that severe an outsider. 
Pitchers are usually outsiders. They are kind of shunned on the team. They 
don't play every day, so they don't get the same amount of respect unless they 
are Cy Young Award winners." 
</P>
<P>
 During his auditions, Patterson didn't tell the producers or Scheinman about 
his professional baseball experience. But he couldn't keep it a secret for 
long. At the movie's baseball tryout, Patterson impressed a scout from the St. 
Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the workout, he said, 'Would you be interested in playing professional 
baseball?' I said, 'You are a little late for that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I had put the word out that I wanted actors who really played baseball," says 
Scheinman. "I didn't know how good he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson always looked upon baseball as strictly a job. "I worked very hard. 
I was very disciplined and that's how I approached it." Acting, though, is a 
different story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at it -- without sounding too pretentious -- as a life process. I like 
being around creative people." 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, who grew up in New Jersey, was always torn between sports and the 
arts. "I always played baseball; it was a way to stay out of the house." 
</P>
<P>
 He quit the baseball team during his junior year in high school. "I went 
through a late adolescent rebellion. I grew my hair, and I was writing a lot. I 
wrote a lot of plays. I just didn't care about sports. The coach thought I was 
insane." 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson spent a lot of time hanging out in New York during his freshman year 
at Rutgers University. Finally, an old friend persuaded him to return to 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving pro baseball nine years ago, he spent a year traveling 
throughout Europe. "I hadn't been outside a ballpark in five or six years. I 
didn't know what a sunset was like in the summer outside the stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon his return to the United States, he went to New York and began studying 
acting with Robert Lewis. Eventually, Patterson and a friend formed their own 
theater company, the Arc-Light Repertory Company. "We were really struggling 
along, trying to make a little buzz happen. It was way Off Broadway. I was at a 
point where an audience was going to be my best teacher."  
</P>
<P>
 After six years in New York, Patterson went to Hollywood in 1992. Besides 
"Little Big League," he has appeared as a murderer bent on killing Raymond Burr 
in the 1993 TV movie "The Return of Ironside," and recently completed a role as 
an evil alien in the upcoming Fox TV film "Alien Nation: Dark Horizon."  
</P>
<P>
 Since moving to Los Angeles, though, Patterson hasn't found the time to return 
to the theater or complete the screenplay he's writing. "Now is the time for 
(acting). It's a real dogfight getting established."

SPEAKING HIS PEACE; RAYMOND MYERS HOPES TO 'TOUCH OUR SOULS' AND EVOKE CHANGE 
WITH HIS REGGAE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ROOS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raymond Myers knows that when things get as ugly as they often have in his 
native Nicaragua, it's vital to hold on to pride and hope to keep the spirit 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers, 31, is a reggae musician from Bluefields, on Nicaragua's Caribbean 
coast. He has long witnessed unemployment, crime and political unrest engulf 
his war-torn homeland. Like many before him, Myers has used music as an outlet 
for both his anger and longing for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a bad situation over there," Myers said recently during a phone 
interview from Culver City, where he is living now. "We have a lot of problems, 
man, but we've got to hold tight, remain positive, and let music help soothe us 
from some of the stress and problems. I believe music can educate people . . . 
it has the power to reach out and touch our souls." 
</P>
<P>
 Influenced by reggae legends Bob Marley and Peter Tosh ("They took simple 
little folk music and made it a worldwide phenomenon"), Myers has forged a 
style reflecting his culturally diverse native land, which is inhabited by 
English-speaking Creole, mestizo, Amerindian and Afro-Caribbean peoples. He 
blends reggae, salsa, soca (soul-calypso) and rock strains into his own mix, 
with lyrics in both English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his 10-piece band perform Wednesday as part of the Long Beach Museum of 
Art's summer concert series. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers focused on politicized and roots reggae during his years as the lead 
singer, guitarist and composer of the Soul Vibrations band from 1986 to 1993. 
But creative differences within the band prompted Myers to go solo; he's just 
finished recording some new material at Jackson Browne's studio in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers met Browne about eight years ago in Managua. Touched by Myers and his 
music, Browne said he would try to help Myers further his career. 
</P>
<P>
 A sampling of his new songs finds Myers in strong voice, physically and 
metaphorically. The infectious "Aviva el Corazon" ("Lively Up Your Heart") is 
an ode to Bob Marley's "Lively Up Yourself" and dances on a bed of catchy 
rhythms. The pulsating, horn-driven "Shame Guys" is a lighthearted knock at men 
who lag behind women on the dance floor. But it is "Latino Soy" ("I Am 
Latino"), sung with immense pride and joy, that highlights Myers' new work.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a salsa song about Latin culture and our heritage," Myers said. "I just 
wanted to express the richness and humility of the Nicaraguan people, and that 
there is a unification between us. Not everything is as negative as portrayed 
by the media and outsiders." 
</P>
<P>
 Myers said he is optimistic about his new opportunities as a solo artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to keep a musical tradition alive, but with a variety of roots reggae 
that is danceable, more commercial and less overtly political than the Soul 
Vibrations material," he said. "On my own, it is more challenging, but it's 
also more pleasing and comforting to me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Myers, who is married and has three children, is a believer in the notion of 
making the world a brighter place for his descendants. In that vein, he led a 
five-week music class last year for the Willie Gault Youth Enrichment Program 
at Jordan High School in Long Beach. Some 80 disadvantaged inner-city youths 
received free music, dance, voice, art and drama instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great cultural experience for these kids," Myers said. "Man, you 
have to keep going to school . . . you have to have an education today. I mean, 
these kids are prone to drop out, so we've got to urge them to continue and not 
give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Through the power of his music, Myers hopes he can be a positive force for 
adults, too. 
</P>
<P>
 'I just try to express my feelings through my music," he said. "If I can 
capture the spirit of the people -- right at that moment -- it brings me such 
great joy. It reminds me of how I felt when I first started singing in the 
church choir when I was 14 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 * Raymond Myers plays Wednesday at the Long Beach Museum of Art, 2300 E. Ocean 
Blvd., Long Beach, as part of the museum's annual summer concert series. 7 p.m. 
$8 for museum members and seniors, $10 for others. Children under 12 are free.

13-YEAR-OLD'S NUDITY RESULTS IN COURT BLOCKING FILM; MOVIES: THE BOY'S MOTHER 
GETS INJUNCTION FROM IRISH JUSTICE SYSTEM TO STOP RELEASE OF 'WAR OF THE 
BUTTONS.' WARNER BROS. WILL CONTEST THE COMPLAINT. 
</P>

<P>
 The worldwide release of a new film produced by former Columbia studio boss 
David Puttnam has been blocked by an Irish court -- after a woman complained 
that her 13-year-old son appeared nude in the production. 
</P>
<P>
 An injunction filed in Cork, Ireland, prevents the release of "The War of the 
Buttons," due for its world premiere in Dublin on July 29. Much of the filming 
took place near Skibbereen, on Ireland's western coast, last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros., the distributor of the film, will contest the injunction, which 
prevents the studio from screening, distributing or releasing the $8.5-million 
film, which had been expected to be released in the United States later this 
year. Warners spokesman Julian Senior said the film had been seen by two 
research audiences of parents and children in Britain before the injunction was 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Puttnam said he was unable to comment about the injunction for legal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The War of the Buttons" was adapted by screenwriter Colin Welland ("Chariots 
of Fire") from a French novel, "La Guerre des Boutons," by Louis Fergaud. The 
story is about two adjacent towns whose children constantly battle each other; 
their fights are determined by the number of buttons that can be ripped from 
opponents' coats. Eighteen Skibbereen children were given roles in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene to which the boy's mother objected shows a group of boys running 
down a hillside into battle naked, thus preventing the rival boys from tearing 
their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's attorneys told the court that his parents withdrew him from the 
production after he took part in the scene, which required 12 takes over two 
days. After the scene, the court was told, the boy seemed "a bit down." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior said the boys wore "modesty pouches" for the scene. "The boy in 
question is seen fleetingly from the back," he added. "I have seen 'The War of 
the Buttons' myself and it is a delightful, funny, charming little film. Anyone 
who talks about it in terms of the nudity is getting it quite wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are now putting together an affidavit to get the injunction lifted on 
Friday." It is expected that the judge, Mr. Justice Moran, will see the film 
himself before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The War of the Buttons" had been scheduled for an October release in Britain, 
but that depends on the outcome of the court case. "The only people who this 
will hurt" are those in the Irish film community, Senior added. "The film is 
suitable for children, and it tested very well with both parents and children 
at our screenings."

THEATER REVIEW; COMIC TRUTHS RING OUT IN 'CIRCLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fans of the novels and stories of W. Somerset Maugham frequently aren't aware 
that for a quarter of a century he was one of England's top playwrights and 
often had three plays running at once in London's West End. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those plays were comedies, and the most revived and best thought of is 
his 1921 romp, "The Circle," currently playing at the Long Beach Studio 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Maugham's comedies poked, prodded and pricked the institution of 
marriage. He thought ill of marriage. His own was a disaster. But behind 
Maugham's ever-starchy exterior, there was always a kittenish sense of humor, 
and it's no more evident than in this delightful theatrical prank, set in 1919, 
about the joys and wisdom of deserting one's spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 When Arnold Champion-Cheney was 5, his mother ran off with the prominent Lord 
Hugh Porteous, causing a scandal that ruined his chances to be prime minister 
and forcing their three-decade exile in Florence. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold's father, who has given over his estate to his politician son, lives in 
a cottage near the main house. Unbeknown to the father, Arnold's wife, 
Elizabeth, has invited Lord Porteous and Arnold's mom, Lady Kitty, to visit. 
She has her reasons, for there is another guest, Teddie Luton, who is 
passionately in love with Elizabeth, and she needs to do some research. 
</P>
<P>
 This is high comedy in the strict sense, what was once called "teacup comedy," 
technically not unlike Wilde, or Coward or Sheridan. Not a comma or syllable 
can be left out -- it is language that is like music, and this company does 
very well by it indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Robert G. Leigh guides his company with impeccable taste and with a 
sure knowledge of the script's musical requirements. If there is a flaw in his 
staging, it is a tendency to sometimes let the air out of the froth he has 
taken so much trouble to whip up, allowing some of his actors to become more 
intense, more sincere, more bloody emotional than is good for their laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Oakley, as Maugham's alter ego, Arnold, is as priggish and as much a 
junior Colonel Blimp as he can be. Until Arnold realizes that his wife is about 
to bolt, one can almost imagine there is a curtain rod up the back of his 
trousers, and Oakley's panoply of tics when unsettled is a very funny trick 
that more could be made of. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kokol is equally on the mark as the decrepit Porteous, with ill-fitted 
false teeth, a marvelous grumble-rumble of dismay and a streak of charm a yard 
wide that makes Lady Kitty's decision to fly with him seem perfectly logical. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best moments, when Porteous and Kitty are between spats, as they 
realize the still-burning affection between them is being echoed in the younger 
generation, rings with an honesty and shine that Maugham only found after he 
had left his wife, Syrie. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Davis, as Kitty, and Kokol are matched well, hissing at each other as 
they always have, delighted with their own little shows. Davis has just the 
right flavor for the exiled scarlet woman, even if it's sometimes a bit too 
heady a mixture and could be toned down. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Kellerman is a delightful Elizabeth, with just the right naivete tossed 
up with a slight brashness typical of a well-born British girl flapping into 
the Roaring Twenties. Derek Stefan is a fine Teddie, quite opaque mentally, 
rather pompous and juvenile, but with enough pizazz to justify Elizabeth's 
adoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Ingebritsen provides a needed balance with her admirably period shadings 
and reactions as a guest, but Rowland Kerr seems at odds with his 
characterization as Arnold's father and with the style of comedy. James A. 
Rice, as the butler George, is amusing, and his upper lip is so stiff, he looks 
as though he might have trained at Lord Astor's Cliveden.

ANSWERING DUNAWAY'S 'SUNSET' CHARGES; THEATER: LLOYD WEBBER'S SPOKESMAN GIVES 
COMPOSER-PRODUCER'S PERSPECTIVE ON THE ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A spokesman for Andrew Lloyd Webber sought to explain over the weekend the 
background on the composer-producer's actions leading up to last week's firing 
of actress Faye Dunaway from the Los Angeles production of "Sunset Boulevard," 
an act Dunaway has termed "capricious." 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Peter Brown denied Dunaway's contention that Lloyd Webber had 
insisted that she sing the role in a higher range than her own. "At her 
bidding, they tried different keys, but she was never asked to sing in a higher 
range," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway manager Bob Palmer replied that Dunaway and Lloyd Webber agreed about 
the key at their last meeting, but this followed a period when Dunaway "was 
trying to get her voice up there where he wanted it." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to payments for rehearsals, Lloyd Webber's company has officially 
offered to pay Dunaway two weeks of her post-opening salary -- the amount 
required by Actors' Equity contracts when someone is dismissed during 
rehearsals. In Dunaway's case, sources on both sides agree that two weeks' 
salary amounts to approximately $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At her press conference Friday, Dunaway said she expects to be paid for the 
six-month term of her contract, which would have begun on opening night, July 
5. At $25,000 a week, she would be due $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for both sides agree that no contract was signed. A pact had been 
drawn up but was still being examined. By offering to pay for two weeks, though 
no contract was signed, Lloyd Webber spokesman Peter Brown said "we believe 
we're acting as if it had been signed." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway's attorney Larry Stein declined to comment on the status of the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the complications of Dunaway's shooting schedule for the movie 
"Don Juan de Marco and the Centerfold" had also been a factor in Lloyd Webber's 
decision to dump Dunaway, Brown said that requests from the Dunaway camp to 
delay her first performance beyond the announced July 5 had "made everyone look 
into the situation more closely." He also noted that location shooting in 
Mexico would have required Dunaway to miss "Sunset" from July 13-15 -- a fact 
that Brown contends wasn't told to Lloyd Webber's representatives until after 
the July 5 date was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer said that details of the shooting schedule in Mexico had been made 
clear early on to Lloyd Webber's company, but acknowledged that Dunaway had 
"looked into the possibility" of an opening night delay. However, he said that 
when she met with Lloyd Webber a week ago, "she was ready to open on July 5." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway objected to Lloyd Webber's manner of telling her the bad news -- she 
learned it from Palmer after getting the impression at a session with Lloyd 
Webber one day earlier that all was well. Brown defended the producer's 
behavior at that last meeting with Dunaway -- "he's not rude ever; he remained 
polite, then went away to discuss the situation" with the show's director and 
musical director. After the decision was reached, "the proper way" was to go 
through Dunaway's agent, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's more civilized to tell it like it is," responded Palmer. "She 
loves to deal with the facts. She's not a naive woman." 
</P>
<P>
 After grossing at least $25 million from 232 performances, including a 
L.A.-record-breaking final week's take of $949,466, the musical closed Sunday 
night, with Close referring obliquely to the "very dramatic developments" of 
the past week's closing announcement in her remarks to the capacity house after 
the final curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 Close brought virtually every member of the backstage team out on stage, 
mentioning most of them by name -- from director Trevor Nunn to carpenters and 
costumers. She apologized for missing several performances but thanked her 
"wonderful and incredibly talented" standby Karen Mason, passing her own big 
bouquet of flowers over to Mason. 
</P>
<P>
 She listed momentous events since the show had opened -- from fires, 
earthquake and floods to the death of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and the "tragedy 
and horror" of the O.J. Simpson story -- noting that only one performance was 
missed (it was after the quake). 
</P>
<P>
 Her mention of Simpson may have raised a few eyebrows. For the record, the 
charity that Close selected as beneficiary of the $6,000 earned from auctioning 
her house seats at the final performance was the L.A. County Bar Domestic 
Violence Project. And, though she didn't draw the parallel herself, the Simpson 
story is about a contemporary real-life double murder at an address not far 
from the fictional celebrity murder that serves as the framework for the 
"Sunset Boulevard" story.

NHL DRAFT; IF OFFER IS RIGHT, DUCKS MIGHT TRADE NO. 2 PICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the No. 2 pick in the NHL entry draft today, the Mighty Ducks have a 
chance to draft an almost sure-fire future star. 
</P>
<P>
 But anyone who wants to see center Radek Bonk, defenseman Ed Jovanovski or 
goaltender Jamie Storr in a Duck jersey might be a bit uncomfortable to learn 
that Jack Ferreira was in the Rams' war room for the NFL draft, watching the 
Rams twice trade their first-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a lesson in how to trade down," said Ferreira, who watched the Rams 
trade from fifth to seventh to 15th and is now entertaining offers for the 
NHL's second pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether any of the teams eager to move up will come up with a deal sweet 
enough to pry away the pick remains to be seen as general managers continue 
bargaining until the last minute. Ferreira would only be inclined to trade the 
second pick if he could get an established young player -- not an older veteran 
-- and a pick no lower than 15th or so. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings, who have finally finished paying for the Wayne Gretzky deal and 
have a first-round pick for the first time since 1990, are looking for a power 
forward or perhaps a goalie with the seventh pick overall, though new General 
Manager Sam McMaster also is not averse to a trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida, which secured the No. 1 pick by choosing to let the Ducks pick fourth 
ahead of them last year, is said to be leaning toward Jovanovski, a big, 
hard-hitting and versatile defenseman, in part because the Panthers have no 
particular need for a center. Then again, the Panthers' Bill Torrey hasn't 
ruled out trading his pick either. 
</P>
<P>
 If Florida does take Jovanovski, that would leave the Ducks free to take Bonk, 
a big, skillful Czech who scored 42 goals for minor league Las Vegas in the 
International League after starting the season as the youngest player in league 
history at 17. 
</P>
<P>
 But a real bit of intrigue would be if the Ducks keep their pick and pass over 
either of the generally acknowledged top two prospects -- Bonk or Jovanovski -- 
in favor of Storr, the top-rated goalie in the draft. For one thing, no goalie 
has ever gone higher than fifth in the entry draft, and for another, virtually 
the only strength the second-year Ducks have is at goaltender, with Guy Hebert 
and Mikhail Shtalenkov. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Ducks like Storr and Ferreira insists the interest is real, not a ruse 
to make teams who want Storr think they need to trade for the pick.  
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly think of all the players in the draft he's the surest one you can 
say is going to be a star," said Ferreira, who scheduled a Monday night 
interview with Storr. "Because of our goaltending situation right now, it 
doesn't seem like a logical pick, but it puts you in pretty good position for 
the future, or for a trade." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks point to goalies' crucial role in the playoffs as a reason to 
consider Storr, but another might be that since he's probably a couple of years 
from the NHL, he might come cheaper than others. Remember, the Ducks still 
haven't signed Paul Kariya, their first pick from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But could the Ducks really pass on Bonk, the most proven player in the draft? 
</P>
<P>
 "They would subject themselves to tremendous criticism if they don't take 
Bonk," said Butch Goring, an ex-King who coached Bonk in Las Vegas last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the players the Kings are eyeing is Brett Lindros, the younger brother 
of Philadelphia's Eric Lindros and something of a wild card. Though he doesn't 
have his brother's scoring skill, Brett Lindros is the prototype of the big 
forward the Kings want. The snag is that Lindros is said to be against playing 
in Los Angeles because of the family's disdain for Gretzky. And people remember 
what happened when Eric refused to play in Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't necessarily mean the Kings would stay away from Lindros if he's 
available, but others they are looking at include Ryan Smyth, another tough 
forward, and Jeff O'Neill, a smaller forward with tremendous scoring potential. 
But should Storr last until the seventh pick, which is unlikely, McMaster would 
probably grab him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings have named John Perpich, an assistant the last four seasons with the 
Washington Capitals, as an assistant to Coach Barry Melrose. Tom Renney, 
another the coach the Kings had interviewed, instead signed a contract 
extension with Team Canada. . . . Ron Salcer, the agent for the Kings' Rob 
Blake, said there has been a "significant dropoff," in the team's most recent 
contract offer to the 24-year-old defenseman. "We're not talking about a little 
dropoff but a lot," he said. "They took a major step backward." Salcer had 
recent negotiations with the previous King management but nothing was put in 
writing. About 10 days ago, new King General Manager Sam McMaster made a 
four-year offer believed to be in the $6-million range. Top Prospects

AS KARIYA STALEMATE CONTINUES, DUCKS LOOKING TO AVOID ANOTHER; HOCKEY: WITH ITS 
TOP PICK IN 1993 DRAFT STILL UNSIGNED, TEAM FACING PROSPECT THAT ITS FIRST 
SELECTION TODAY COULD SEEK EVEN MORE MONEY. 
</P>

<P>
 So the Mighty Ducks have the No. 2 pick in the NHL draft today. 
</P>
<P>
 All that means is they have the right to call out the name of some youngster, 
hand him a Mighty Duck cap and a Mighty Duck jersey with his name on it, pose 
for pictures and smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the way they did with Paul Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
 Drafting someone doesn't make him a Duck. He can't score any goals for them 
until he signs a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a year since the Ducks picked Kariya, the slight but extremely 
skilled playmaker who went on to star for Canada in the Olympics and the World 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 He was proclaimed the cornerstone of the organization, and hailed as the 
perfect Disney hockey player. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet since the Ducks began negotiating last spring with Kariya's agent, Don 
Baizley, the sides have made little progress and are believed to remain 
millions of dollars apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams have begun to approach the Ducks about trading Kariya, and the Ducks are 
beginning to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you've got to look at all the options," Ferreira said. "It's 
something you don't want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem isn't the size of the Ducks' pocketbook -- 27 sellouts at The Pond 
of Anaheim and phenomenal sales of team merchandise contributed to a first-year 
profit that club president Tony Tavares says will exceed expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is the size of the opening of the Ducks' pocketbook. Tavares and 
Ferreira say they object in principle to high rookie salaries for unproven 
players. They blame "mistakes" by Ottawa and Hartford in signing Alexandre 
Daigle and Chris Pronger to huge contracts for the problem, making the point 
that those players did not perform at that high a level this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kariya situation finally should begin to clarify itself this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tavares said the Ducks soon will improve their offer to Kariya substantially, 
based on his performance at the World Championships. And it has been part of 
Ferreira's strategy since the end of the season to feel out negotiations with 
their potential No. 2 pick before signing Kariya, since No. 2 will 
automatically ask for more than last year's No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Baizley has begun to downplay the possibility of Kariya going to Europe, but 
the International Hockey League and even junior hockey are being mentioned as 
options. Ferreira and Baizley are awaiting rules interpretations from NHL 
Commissioner Gary Bettman as to when Kariya would become a free agent if he 
returned to the junior level, and whether the Ducks would have the right to 
match any offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both decided we want to know exactly what our options are so we see who 
has the leverage," Ferreira said. 
</P>
<P>
 So if the Ducks put a jersey on the second pick today, does that mean he'll be 
a Duck this fall? Or just another member of the Ducks' All-Unsigned team? 
</P>
<P>
 Tavares says "signability will be an issue" when the Ducks decide whom to 
draft today. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can figure we don't want to go through another year like we have trying 
to get Kariya signed," Tavares said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira says he will take the best player available. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the best player available wants more cash than the Ducks say is 
available? 
</P>
<P>
 "You just enter another stalemate," Ferreira said.

UC IRVINE COACH CANO CAUGHT SOCCER FEVER BEFORE IT WAS CONTAGIOUS; COLLEGE: AN 
EARLY PARTICIPANT IN U.S. YOUTH ORGANIZATION, HE IS TAPPING HIS ENTHUSIASM FOR 
THE GAME TO BOOST THE ANTEATERS' PROGRAMS.

<P>
 As the World Cup pushes soccer fever higher in the United States, Marine Cano 
watches and smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano has watched soccer grow from fledgling status to become one of the most 
popular sports among American youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a professional career in Europe never materialized and a brief stint 
on the U.S. national team didn't produce a World Cup appearance, Cano has no 
regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's best are in his neighborhood now, and Cano, UC Irvine's soccer 
director and women's head coach, knows the World Cup's presence will only boost 
the sport's recognition in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like if you lived in Germany and the Super Bowl comes there," Cano said. 
"Right now, we have the best players from the best soccer countries in the 
world playing in our back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the only way you can really grasp it is to be in a stadium, with all of 
the fanfare. I don't care if you've never seen a soccer game in your life, if 
you are in that atmosphere, you will enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer has given Cano a lifetime of enjoyment, and he spreads his unbridled 
enthusiasm for "the greatest game in the world" to anyone who will listen. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, soccer awareness was low in the United States, but that 
didn't stop Cano from trying the sport. When his family moved to Torrance in 
1964, at age 9, he joined the American Youth Soccer Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was there when AYSO was founded and I've seen it come full cycle," Cano 
said. "I was on one of the first two teams ever formed and I was the first AYSO 
player to sign a professional contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now there are more than 450,000 participants in AYSO, and there are more 
youths playing soccer than playing football, basketball and baseball combined." 
</P>
<P>
 A much different world than the one in which Cano grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano pointed out that current U.S. national team members, John Harkes and 
Ernie Stewart among others, play soccer in Europe. But 18 years ago, it was 
much tougher for Americans overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 In many of the European leagues, Cano said the structure of the sport is 
similar to professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The clubs have reserve teams -- a mini farm system -- backing their top team. 
Towns and cities sponsor teams and the best teams play in a premier division. 
Teams can advance to that top division by playing well in lower divisions, but 
teams that play poorly can also be relegated to a lower division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fortunate that a lot of my teammates -- from the 1976 Los Angeles 
Skyhawks of the American Soccer League -- were of English descent," Cano said. 
"So I went to England following that season and played for Portsmouth for a 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Cano, a goalkeeper, played for Portsmouth's reserve team when its top team was 
trying to stay in the third division. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, the first-string goalie was struggling and they wanted to give 
me shot on the first team, but I needed a work permit," Cano said. "Portsmouth 
was trying to avoid relegation, and it would have cost the club too much money 
to get a permit for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was frustrated in the sense that I knew was just as good as the other 
goalkeepers. Your mind plays funny tricks sometimes, but I don't feel the hand 
I was dealt was a bad hand. I feel God has a plan for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the plan was playing professional soccer in the United States for nine 
years. Cano played in a variety of leagues, ranging from the country's most 
successful -- the North American Soccer League, which featured superstars such 
as Pele -- and the Major Indoor Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I absorbed the good and bad from my playing career," Cano said. "That has 
molded me into a coach that can teach players about the good things about life, 
not just soccer. Looking back I don't regret anything. I always felt I never 
quit." 
</P>
<P>
 That fighting spirit is something Cano hopes to pass along to his players. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he arrived at Irvine, Cano spent 10 years at Cal State Dominguez Hills, 
where his men's and women's teams won five California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
championships, and the women's team won the NCAA Division II title in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano's expectations are just as high for Irvine. Cano's goal is to bring a 
soccer national championship to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite budgetary restrictions, which currently limit Irvine to only 2 1/2 
scholarships for each soccer team, Cano hopes to boost that to five per team by 
next season. The NCAA allows 10 scholarships for men's soccer and 11 for 
women's soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is not just to coach and recruit but to raise funds," Cano said. "We 
have to get out in the community and give back to them if we want any support." 
</P>
<P>
 Cano's support for his players includes his strong belief in education. 
</P>
<P>
 "A player in this community has to know that No. 1, they can get a quality 
education here," Cano said. "The icing on the cake is knowing they have a 
program where they can develop as a player and have a chance to win. You can 
see with the success of youth soccer, the talent is there." 
</P>
<P>
 Cano's job is to bring that talent to Irvine.

DOTY CONCENTRATES ON TURNING TRAGEDY INTO A TURNING POINT; SOFTBALL: FORMER 
WESTMINSTER HIGH STANDOUT, WHOSE BROTHER WAS KILLED IN AN AUTO ACCIDENT, HELPS 
ARIZONA WIN NCAA TITLE.

 Andrea Jane Doty -- A.J. on the softball diamond -- remembers the struggle in 
the summer of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 That was when her brother, Robbie, died in a one-car, alcohol-related 
automobile accident. He was 19, the passenger, wearing a safety belt. 
</P>
<P>
 She was 15, the little sister, wearing a heavy burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbie's death played on Andrea's mind and she carried it on to the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't get my game back together after that," she said. "I couldn't hit 
the ball, I couldn't field the ball. We (the Orange County Batbusters) lost 
regionals and didn't go to nationals, and I made the last out of the last game. 
That's when I thought I would quit. I was at my lowest point." 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't the point of no return. Instead, it was the point of ascension. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I wanted to do was give up on everything, and my mom (Beth) reminded me 
of how proud Robbie was of my ability to play softball," Doty recalled. "I 
decided from that moment on, I didn't care if we won or lost or how much 
playing time I got, I would just give 110%. And if I wasn't playing, I would 
keep my head in the game and help my teammates any way I could." 
</P>
<P>
 With the new outlook came less pressure. Play for fun, she kept telling 
herself. And she did. 
</P>
<P>
 She has had a rags-to-riches career. 
</P>
<P>
 -- She batted .400 during five years with the Batbusters, one of the nation's 
top club teams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- She played high school ball at Westminster, where victories were sparse. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Last spring, as a freshman, she was the starting right fielder for NCAA 
champion Arizona, which won 64 of 67 games, including its first 31. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Doty's shoestring catch of a sinking line drive against UCLA in the 
semifinals -- and her throw to first base to double up the runner -- that took 
the wind out of the Bruins in a tie game and helped Arizona to a 5-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a scale of 10," Arizona Coach Mike Candrea said of the play, "it was a 
strong eight." 
</P>
<P>
 If the ball had gotten past Doty, UCLA probably would have scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone wants to play offense, but one of our weak links was that we needed 
a solid outfielder who could give us a solid effort," Candrea said. "She's not 
fancy, she doesn't have the strongest arm, but she's a very strong outfielder 
who doesn't make a lot of mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Doty made no errors in 49 games. She had only 20 at-bats, finishing at .200, 
but her offense wasn't needed; Arizona set 13 NCAA offensive records, including 
highest single-season team batting average (.380), most home runs (93), runs 
(527), hits (701), total bases (1,112), runs batted in (478) and first-team 
All-Americans (six; the previous record was three).  
</P>
<P>
 Doty, who bats and throws left-handed, was the designated player in most 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first it was really hard because I'm used to batting for myself, but I 
struggled early, and I figured it was best for the team," Doty said. "Everyone 
has their part on the team, and I figured my part was to play outfield to the 
best of my ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a senior, Valerie Zepeda, on the team that I roomed with on the 
road trips -- she didn't play a lot -- and we would talk about things like 
playing time. She helped me understand what it was like to play as a team, that 
everyone has their part." 
</P>
<P>
 The differences between her high school, club and college careers were as 
distinct as black and white. 
</P>
<P>
 She was used to winning during her travel ball seasons with the Batbusters. 
The summer before her freshman year in high school, they finished second in 
nationals; before her junior year, they finished second; before her senior 
year, they finished first; before she went off to college, they finished 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 But playing at Westminster was different. There was no coaching continuity -- 
Doty played for four coaches in four years -- and Doty admittedly lacked 
respect for her last coach, Gretchen Bock. By all accounts, theirs was a stormy 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very set in her ways and competitive, and her frustration played a 
large role in the attitude she took, but I've got 15 other players to deal 
with," Bock said. "She was a very individual player. She was not a team player, 
in my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 They couldn't even agree whether Doty had been kicked off the team her senior 
season. Doty claimed she was, Bock said she wasn't. Candrea, when he heard the 
story, was astonished. 
</P>
<P>
 "It surprises me after being around her for a year," Candrea said, "because 
she had nothing but a very good attitude for us at Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
 Doty, though, considered her days at Westminster and reflected upon all she 
had been through -- the good and the bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Softball," she said, "isn't my whole life."

STABILIZING DOLLAR HELPS STOCKS; DOW GAINS 48.56; MARKETS: TRADERS ALSO RESPOND 
TO A DROP IN COMMODITY PRICES AND BOND YIELDS. BUT SOME ANALYSTS SEE A 'FLASH 
RALLY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. stocks and bonds staged a surprise rally Monday, responding in part to a 
stable dollar and to another sharp fall in commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average soared 48.56 points to 3,685.50, retracing 
most of Friday's 62.15-point plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 But many Wall Streeters warned that the markets' rally was largely technical 
in nature and that bearish trends in the dollar and interest rates suggest any 
rebound could be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a flash rally," insisted Douglas Kass, a bearish analyst at JW Charles 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks opened lower early Monday, with the Dow quickly losing 25 points in the 
wake of the dollar's first post-World War II close below 100 Japanese yen 
overnight in Tokyo trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. market was also pressured by steep overnight losses in most Asian 
stock markets. Japan's Nikkei-225 stock index, for example, slumped 465.79 
points to 20,300.96 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the dollar inched higher in New York -- without significant central 
bank intervention -- buyers returned to stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Because so many traders had expected the markets to spiral lower Monday, the 
turn in prices probably sparked heavy buying related to "short covering," 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Short covering occurs when bearish traders who sell stock short -- that is, 
they sell borrowed shares, expecting further price declines -- rush to buy back 
shares on the open market, in order to close out their positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow's rise accelerated through the day, which often denotes panicked 
short-covering, traders noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, stocks also got some fundamental help from a slide in bond yields, 
which keyed off the latest dive in commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
 While a jump in coffee prices stole the spotlight, many other commodities 
tumbled, including cotton, oil, pork bellies, sugar and gold. Near-term gold 
futures dropped $6.40 an ounce to $384.70 on the New York Comex. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are very few plus signs in the commodity world," said Jeff Wilson, 
editor of the Brock Report, a farm marketing newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 With falling commodity prices suggesting renewed deflation, bonds responded 
well. The yield on the 30-year T-bond fell to 7.45% from 7.52% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said stock and bond markets may also be reconsidering the 
importance of the dollar's slide. While fears remain that the Federal Reserve 
Board will seek to bolster the dollar by hiking short-term interest rates at 
its July 5 meeting, many economists aren't convinced the dollar's trend is of 
overriding concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stock market has been hammered by major media hype about the dollar," 
said Alfred Goldman, analyst at brokerage A.G. Edwards & Sons. Yet the dollar 
has been falling for nearly a decade, without causing major problems for the 
stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, experts warn that investors may view another drop in the dollar as 
just another reason to avoid what have been very volatile markets this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Moderate volume of 250 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday 
showed there was no great conviction in the Dow's rally. In fact, falling 
stocks were nearly even in number with rising stocks on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Nasdaq market of mostly smaller issues, the composite index gained 8.89 
points to 702.68 as battered technology stocks rebounded. But winners and 
losers were about evenly matched on Nasdaq as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * European stocks showed surprising resilience in the face of currency 
turmoil, and that may have helped U.S. shares. In London, the FTSE-100 index 
gained 23.3 points to 2,899.9. In Paris, the CAC index inched up 4.58 points to 
1,911.60. But Frankfurt's DAX index lost 16.71 points to 1,988.60. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index rocketed 51.92 points to 2,239.19 after the 
country's interior minister rescinded an angry resignation letter he had 
submitted Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Wall Street, technology and telecommunications stocks led the rally. They 
have been among the most beaten-down issues this month, on growing worries 
about a slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft surged 2 3/8 to 51 7/8, Cabletron Systems leaped 8 1/2 to 95, IBM 
gained 1 5/8 to 61 1/2, Compaq jumped 2 1/4 to 33 1/4, Nextel surged 3 1/4 to 
33 1/4 and BMC Software added 2 7/8 to 45 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Biotech shares also gained after drug giant Eli Lilly agreed to a marketing 
pact with biotech firm Somatogen. Somatogen's shares zoomed 2 3/4 to 9 1/2. 
Other biotech winners included Amgen, up 1 1/2 to 43 3/4; Centocor, up 14/16 to 
11 5/8, and Cellpro, up 2 1/2 to 20 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks powering the Dow higher included Caterpillar, up 4 to 105 
1/8; GE, up 1 1/8 to 47 3/8; GM, up 1 5/8 to 52 1/4, and Union Carbide, up 7/8 
to 26 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among financial issues, brokerage stocks recouped some of their recent 
losses. Merrill Lynch jumped 1 5/8 to 36 5/8, Dean Witter leaped 1 3/4 to 37 
3/8 and Charles Schwab was up 1 3/4 to 27 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Disney rose 1 1/8 to 43 1/8. Alex. Brown & Sons upgraded the stock to 
"strong buy" from "buy," citing the strength of "The Lion King." 
</P>
<P>
 * DOLLAR RALLIES: Greenback climbs back from postwar low against yen. A1

KEMPER AGREES TO $3.25-BILLION TAKEOVER BID; MERGERS: DEAL WITH CONSECO MAY 
PORTEND OTHER 'STRATEGIC ALLIANCES' BETWEEN MUTUAL FUND MANAGERS AND INSURERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kemper Corp. on Monday accepted a $3.25-billion takeover bid from 
Indiana-based insurer Conseco Inc. in a deal that highlights the growing 
movement of insurance companies to offer mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper said it signed a merger agreement with Conseco following a meeting of 
its board Sunday night. Conseco had set a midnight Sunday deadline for Kemper 
to respond to its offer, made Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper put itself up for sale in May after General Electric Co.'s financial 
unit, GE Capital Corp., made an unsolicited offer of $60 per share. Conseco's 
offer of $67 per share in cash and stock prompted GE Capital to withdraw its 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by regulators and both companies' shareholders, the merger would 
create a financial services company with more than $85 billion in assets under 
management. Net revenue and annual collected premiums would total $4.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said they don't expect a flurry of insurance industry merger activity 
following the Kemper-Conseco deal. Rather, they foresee "strategic alliances" 
between insurance and mutual fund companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will see brand-name mutual funds offered inside insurance products," said 
Wilson Dinielli, a securities analyst for Argus Research in New York. For 
example, New York-based Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, 
one of the country's largest life insurers and asset managers, offers between 
five and 10 Fidelity mutual funds to its customers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to mergers, "it's a slightly more inexpensive way for companies to 
achieve the same objective: having a large enough menu of investments on their 
plate to attract customers," Dinielli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conseco said it plans to merge Kemper's asset management, brokerage and mutual 
fund businesses into its own business and call the new company Kemper.  
</P>
<P>
 Kemper has about $90 billion in life insurance business, which should mesh 
well with Conseco's life insurance unit. But analysts said it was Kemper's 
$45-billion family of mutual funds -- the nation's seventh-largest -- and other 
asset management services, including a brokerage firm, that made it an 
attractive partner for Conseco. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really is interest in getting asset management divisions for life 
insurers," Dinielli said. "I don't think traditional life insurance is going to 
be a big part of the picture going forward. Universal life and variable annuity 
products are what customers want, and companies need to be able to offer a 
broad range of funds for investors to choose from." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Ceurvorst, vice president of Duff & Phelps, a financial research firm in 
Chicago, said that "GE Capital and Conseco were more interested in the fee 
service income from (Kemper's) mutual fund business. This merger wasn't 
primarily motivated by the insurance company efficiency that could be had by 
combining companies, although that was an additional benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street's response to the merger was tepid, in part because of questions 
about Conseco's ability to digest Kemper. On the New York Stock Exchange, 
Kemper stock closed at $61.125 a share, down 25 cents, and Conseco shares fell 
62.5 cents to $48.625.  
</P>
<P>
 Conseco, with $5.9 billion in assets, is one-third the size of Kemper, which 
has $14 billion in assets.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: A FRANKLY TOUGH CHALLENGE; SELLING THE LOWLY WIENER 
CALLS FOR HIGH CREATIVITY 
</P>

<P>
 For the nation's largest hot dog chain, the hunt for business has finally come 
down to this: the Veggie Dog. 
</P>
<P>
 No baloney. 
</P>
<P>
 Vegetarian hot dogs will be test-marketed next month at several 
Wienerschnitzel locations in Southern California. The wieners will be made from 
soy -- with nary a fleck of meat. Think of it as pizza without cheese. Or 
Twinkies without cream. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a serious bid to increase business by appealing to the untapped niche 
of vegetarians. Such unconventional actions are what hot dog chains must do to 
survive in the 1990s. As most fast-food fans continue to hanker for hamburgers, 
the nation's hot dog chains -- from Wienerschnitzel to Nathan's Famous -- are 
searching for new ways to lure consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot dog chains have had a rough go of things. Just ask ex-Chicago Bears Coach 
Mike Ditka, who couldn't coax Chicagoans to buy red-hots at Ditka's Dogs. It 
closed faster than you can say "frankfurter." 
</P>
<P>
 And just as the big summer season was approaching, a university study earlier 
this month linked excessive hot dog consumption to cancer. Recognizing the 
nutrition consciousness of consumers, one billboard for Wienerschnitzel asks 
with a wink, "Does relish count as a vegetable?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Hot dogs have lost their cachet with the American public," said Milford 
Prewitt, senior editor at Nation's Restaurant Business magazine. "A restaurant 
hamburger simply has more of a perceived value that people are willing to pay 
for." 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-food consumers buy about 10 hamburgers for every hot dog. Some argue that 
these buying habits are not about to change soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hot dogs will forever take a back seat to hamburgers," said Robert Sandleman, 
a Brea-based consultant. "The unfortunate reputation is that anything that ends 
up on the factory floor goes into a hot dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Most big hamburger chains won't touch hot dogs. Although McDonald's tried 
selling them in Canada, it has no plans to test them in the United States. And 
after Burger King tested wieners in two cities a few years back, it quickly 
sent the dogs packing. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl's Jr. was originally founded as a hot dog stand, but you won't find hot 
dogs there now. Carl's briefly brought them back a few years ago -- selling the 
Hebrew National brand to present an image of high quality. A lot of good that 
did. Sales sputtered, and hot dogs were again given the boot. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, no matter what the big burger chains do, there are some people who 
passionately believe in hot dogs. There are few more ardent about it than 
Dennis Tase, president of Wienerschnitzel, a division of the Newport 
Beach-based Galardi Group. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no telling how many hot dogs I eat a week," said Tase, who visits 
three or four outlets a day, often taste-testing hot dogs at each. "There's 
nothing better than a double-cheese chili dog." 
</P>
<P>
 After several flat years -- during which it closed some poorly performing 
locations, the 300-unit Wienerschnitzel chain now expects to open nine stores 
over the next 18 months. It is even testing the idea of teaming up with 
Winchell's Donut Houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Wienerschnitzel thinks it can boost business by poking fun at itself with 
self-mocking ads -- even referring to itself as "Chez Weenie." The object is to 
grab the attention of young consumers "who do not believe most advertising," 
said Beverly Blake, vice president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wienerschnitzel billboards all over Southern California show portraits of 
jumbo oozing chili dogs next to headlines such as "The culinary equivalent of 
mud wrestling" and "It's cheap. It's messy. Hey, you are what you eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Some vegetarians were angered by one billboard with a photo of a fat 
frankfurter that said, "Vegetarians can eat the bun." 
</P>
<P>
 That ad, created by the Los Angeles agency Stein Robaire Helm, prompted one 
vegetarian activist to phone Tase and propose that Wienerschnitzel start 
selling vegetarian hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 12 million vegetarians in the United States, why ignore us?" posed Gene 
Bauston, executive director of Farm Sanctuary Inc., a nonprofit farm animal 
protection group in Orland, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy called me so many times, he finally convinced me to try it," Tase 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wienerschnitzel is about to find new competition in Southern California. 
Nathan's Famous Inc., the Westbury, N.Y.-based chain that helped popularize the 
hot dog with a single stand on Coney Island, will test the California market 
with stands scheduled to open at a few Unocal gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hot dogs are the one fast-food segment where there is no recognized national 
brand leader," said Wayne Norbitz, president of Nathan's. "We aim to become 
that."  
</P>
<P>
 The chain has 184 units in 17 states, and more than half of those were opened 
over the last two years. "We're like a 78-year-old start-up company," Norbitz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the ballpark, one of the more popular spots to grab a hot dog in 
Southern California is at the mall. That's where the Hot-Dog-on-a-Stick chain 
sells 9 million corn dogs a year, said Diane Barham, president of the Solana 
Beach-based chain. Her father founded the 93-unit chain 50 years ago with a 
single location in Venice Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Barham said malls are a good spot to sell corn dogs because shoppers often 
have just one free hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, "when everyone was bad-mouthing hot dogs," Barham saw sales 
slipping and knew she had to take action. So she dumped beef and pork wieners 
and started serving turkey dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she heavily promotes the turkey ingredient at each stand, she 
certainly hasn't changed the product's name. After all, who would buy 
turkey-on-a-stick? 
</P>
<P>

all 52 World Cup games, is posting ratings far above initial projections. Hot

<P>
 Hot dogs rank among the least popular of all items sold at fast-food outlets 
in Southern California. A survey of 600 Southern California residents asked 
them to name the last fast-food item they had purchased as a meal. The 
responses: 
</P>

MEXICAN GROUP TO BUY DEL MONTE FOODS; MERGERS: BILLIONAIRE CARLOS CABAL PENICHE 
IS BEHIND THE $1-BILLION AGREEMENT. DEAL CONTINUES TREND BY FIRMS SEEKING TO 
COMPETE UNDER NAFTA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An investor group headed by Mexican billionaire Carlos Cabal Peniche has 
agreed to buy San Francisco-based Del Monte Foods Co. in a cash and debt 
transfer deal valued at close to $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction announced Monday is the latest in a series of U.S. 
acquisitions by Mexican firms seeking a better vantage point for competing 
under the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the agreement, which is designed to eliminate trade barriers between 
Mexico, the United States and Canada, took effect Jan. 1, Mexican firms have 
acquired an Arizona bus manufacturer, a Ft. Worth bakery, Westin Hotels and 
some cement plants in Texas and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 If completed, the Del Monte Foods deal would be the largest California 
acquisition yet by a Mexican firm. "Our goal is to build Del Monte into a major 
North American food business that will be a vigorous competitor in an 
increasingly unified North American market," Cabal said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Monte Foods is one of the world's leading processors of fruits and 
vegetables, with operations in the United States, Mexico, Central America and 
the Philippines. The company had sales of $1.6 billion last year and has 13,500 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps its best-known product is canned fruit cocktails, including Snack 
Cups. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is one of five now-unrelated Del Monte units that were spun off 
separately by parent RJR Nabisco after its infamous $25-billion leveraged 
buyout in 1989. In 1992, Grupo Cabal acquired one of those units, Del Monte 
Fresh Produce, a worldwide grower of bananas and pineapples, from a British 
firm that had acquired it from RJR Nabisco in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Monte Foods, which is controlled by a trust including Merrill Lynch & Co. 
and Citibank, put itself up for sale in January, 1990. An earlier deal with 
Grupo Cabal fell apart in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the definitive agreement announced Monday, shareholders of Del Monte 
Foods would receive approximately $277 million in cash, while Grupo Cabal would 
assume about $700 million in Del Monte Foods debt, a Cabal spokesman said. The 
new owners also plan to inject up to $40 million into Del Monte Foods' 
operations after the deal's closing, scheduled for September. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabal, 37, heads one of Mexico's wealthiest families. His Grupo Cabal owns 
Banco Union, Mexico's 10th-largest bank with about $7 billion in assets and 140 
branches. He is in the process of acquiring Banco Cremi, whose $5 billion in 
assets will be merged into Banco Union to create Mexico's fourth-largest bank. 
Neither bank has been particularly profitable, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabal, originally from Merida on the Yucatan Peninsula but now based in Mexico 
City, also has widespread real estate, trading, marble and lumber businesses, 
said Susana Ornelas, a Baring Securities bank analyst in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabal has been touched by controversy in recent months. The investigation of 
the defunct and scandal-ridden Bank of Credit and Commerce International 
revealed that he had received a $60-million loan from a BCCI unit called 
Eastbrook that he repaid with $30 million in cash and stock in one of his 
companies after BCCI ran into financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman said reports that Cabal was being investigated by the Manhattan 
district attorney's office in New York for his BCCI involvement are false. But 
Cabal was named in a civil suit filed last year in New York state by 
now-defunct Eastbrook that alleges Cabal and two other Eastbrook employees 
fraudulently channeled the loan money into personal accounts. Cabal, through a 
spokesman, denied the charges.

 Insurer Raises Estimate of Quake Costs: 20th Century Industries, the Woodland 
Hills-based holder of two insurance subsidiaries, announced it expects to pay 
out $685 million in claims and expenses related to the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake.Earlier this month, the company announced it would stop selling 
earthquake insurance policies, citing $600 million in quake claims that wiped 
out two-thirds of its surplus. CEO Neil H. Ashley also said the company has 
secured a $175-million loan and has purchased an additional $400 million in 
reinsurance coverage to shore up its financial resources. The subsidiaries are 
20th Century Insurance Co., the eighth-largest homeowner insurer statewide, and 
21st Century Casualty Co., which markets auto insurance.

 Met Life Agrees to Donate $2.5 Million: Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. said 
it will make the donations as part of an expanded settlement with Florida 
regulators over its marketing practices.Authorities found that the New 
York-based insurer deceptively marketed life insurance as a retirement or 
savings plan. The insurer has already paid Florida $4.3 million in fines and 
legal fees as part of a settlement reached in March with more than 40 states. 
Under the new agreement, Met Life also will pay $2.4 million in the next two 
years for programs aimed at combatting youth and family violence and preventing 
fraud against the elderly.

 T-Bill Rates Rise Slightly: The Treasury Department sold $11 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.20%, up from 4.18% last 
week. Another $11 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 4.60%, up from 4.55%.The three-month bill rate was the highest 
since they sold for 4.23% on May 31. The six-month bill rate was the highest 
since they averaged 4.67%, also on May 31. The new discount rates understate 
the actual return to investors: 4.31% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 
bill selling for $9,893.80, and 4.78% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,767.40. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value. T-Bill Auction

 Dell Offers Stripped-Down Pentium PC: Dell Computer Corp. of Austin, Tex., 
fired another round in the personal computer price wars with the introduction 
of its Dell Dimension XPS.The machine, based on Intel Corp.'s most advanced 
Pentium chip, has a base price of $1,999, making it the cheapest Pentium-based 
PC available. It has no CD-ROM drive or other multimedia features and has a 
smaller hard drive than the company's more powerful machines. Intel has 
gradually been dropping prices on its Pentium microprocessor, the newest and 
most powerful "brain" for personal computers, launched late last year.

 Macy Narrows Its Loss: R.H. Macy & Co., operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
since 1992, said its loss for May narrowed on fewer markdowns and better 
inventory control.Sales declined 4.4%, however, because of bad weather, the 
company said. The New York-based operator of 124 Macy, Bullock's and I. Magnin 
stores said it lost $15.9 million for the four weeks ended May 28, down from a 
year-earlier loss of $29.7 million. Before reorganization and interest expense, 
the company posted operating income of $6.4 million, compared to a year-ago 
operating loss of $7.4 million.

PEOPLE: UNOCAL BOARD OKS REORGANIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unocal Corp.'s board on Monday approved a major management reorganization 
designed to refocus the company on its strategic plans, including the formation 
of a new 76 Products Co. to handle its West Coast refining and marketing 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Beach, who became Unocal's chief executive on May 1, will head a new 
office of the chief executive.Joining him will be John Imle Jr., formerly 
president of Unocal's energy services division, as president of the company, 
and Neal Schmale, formerly president of the petroleum products and chemicals 
division, as chief financial officer. Lawrence Higby, formerly executive vice 
president of marketing at the Los Angeles Times, will become president of 76 
Products Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unocal's new organization focuses on achieving excellence in three critical 
areas -- operations, growth and finance -- instead of along business lines," 
Beach said. "We must excel in all of these areas in order to compete 
successfully in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The changes take effect July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Sanderson, a senior principal with Purvin & Gertz Inc., a refining 
consulting firm in Long Beach, said the reorganization is part of the natural 
progression of West Coast oil companies that have consolidated their operations 
here and spun off holdings in other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an interesting and novel way to allow people to focus on areas of 
particular importance," Sanderson said. "It sounds like a pretty good idea."

 Sales of Existing Homes Slow: Rising mortgage rates slowed sales of previously 
owned homes slightly in May, though purchases remained above a 4-million annual 
rate for the seventh time in the last eight months. The National Assn. of 
Realtors said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.09 million, 
down from 4.12 million in April.It was the first decline since sales dropped to 
a 3.84-million rate in February, when winter weather kept many buyers away. 
Sales plunged 12.4% in the West in May, offsetting gains in the Northeast and 
South. Sales were unchanged in the Midwest. Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages 
averaged 8.6% in May, up from 8.32% a month earlier and the highest since they 
hit 8.67% in May, 1992.

Q & A: STRONGER YEN FRAUGHT WITH ECONOMIC RISKS ON BOTH SIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The yen closed at 99.93 to the dollar in Tokyo on Monday, the first time the 
U.S. currency's value has closed below 100 yen since the modern exchange rate 
system was established half a century ago. The dollar later rallied in New York 
back above the 100 level, but it is clear that the yen has enjoyed a record 
rise against the greenback. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some questions and answers about the yen's strength against the 
dollar and its potential effects. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why has the yen been rising against the dollar? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There is no single reason, but much of the yen's most recent strength has 
derived from Japan's enormous trade surplus with the United States. The 
inability of Japan and the United States to agree on ways to reduce the surplus 
has led the global foreign exchange market to conclude that a more expensive 
yen -- in other words, a cheaper dollar -- is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How would a cheaper dollar help shrink Japan's trade surplus? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Theoretically, it means Japanese goods become more expensive in the United 
States because more dollars are needed to buy them, even though their value in 
yen terms hasn't changed. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one reason why imported Japanese cars have gotten more expensive in 
the last few years. Conversely, it takes fewer yen to buy the same American 
goods in Japan -- making them more affordable. The net result is that Japan's 
trade surplus begins to shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Then why does the surplus remain so high? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There are a few reasons. It takes time for currency exchange rates to have 
an effect on trade flows. American exporters are only beginning to make 
significant cracks in Japan's insulated markets. Many Japanese exporters, 
attempting to keep their prices from rising sharply in the United States, have 
absorbed the blow of the stronger yen through lower profits. Others have moved 
their manufacturing operations to the United States, partly to bypass the 
exchange rate problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are the risks of a higher yen and cheaper dollar? 
</P>
<P>
 A: For Japan, the risks are lower profits and sales for Japanese exporters, 
which could threaten the nation's recovery from its worst economic downturn 
since World War II. Moreover, if the Japanese economy stays in recession, 
consumers could be less inclined to buy imported products, even though those 
products become cheaper with the yen's rise. 
</P>
<P>
 For the United States, a cheaper dollar discourages foreigners from investing 
in U.S. stocks and bonds. That has jolted Wall Street and could ultimately lead 
to significantly higher U.S. interest rates. That would help the dollar but 
make the cost of borrowing more expensive for American consumers and inevitably 
slow the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: With those considerable risks, what are Japan, the United States and other 
countries doing about it? 
</P>
<P>
 A: On Friday, the United States led a multinational effort by central banks to 
slow the dollar's fall by purchasing dollars on the foreign exchange market, 
which reduced the supply. But the dollar fell anyway, signaling a deep-seated 
belief by global money traders that the U.S. currency is likely to weaken in 
coming weeks and months. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, there is some belief that Japan's central bank will lower interest 
rates. That would make yen-denominated investments less valuable and 
theoretically could cause the yen to weaken against the dollar. But lower 
interest rates can also hurt Japan by shifting investment to other countries 
where rates are higher.

SPRINT EXEC TO BECOME PACBELL PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacific Bell, saying it needs fresh management talent to lead it into 
unfamiliar competitive terrain, on Monday named Sprint Corp. executive David 
Dorman as president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorman, 40, assumes posts held by Phil Quigley, who on April 1 became chairman 
and CEO of Pacific Telesis Group, the holding company that gets 98% of its 
revenue from PacBell. Quigley remains chairman of PacBell, the exclusive 
provider of local phone service in two-thirds of California. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time in 10 months that Pacific Telesis went outside the 
company for a key manager, and Quigley said that trend will continue as the 
phone company positions itself for a new era in telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest change facing PacBell is its probable entry into the long-distance 
phone business within California, a $2-billion-plus market from which it has 
been barred since the 1984 breakup of the Bell System. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have questioned whether the culture of a regulated utility such as 
PacBell is suited to free-market competition. AT&T, which was thrust into 
competitive businesses at the time of the Bell System breakup, took the better 
part of a decade to adjust. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think part of the model you are seeing is the AT&T model of the past few 
years, where people are brought in from the outside to stimulate the company 
and change traditional Bell company thinking," said Craig Ellis, 
telecommunications analyst at Wheat First Securities in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorman was corporate executive vice president and president of business 
services for Sprint, the country's third-largest long-distance company after 
AT&T and MCI. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorman will seek to lead PacBell into a market that Sprint, his employer of 
the past 13 years, says local phone companies have no business entering. 
Congress and federal courts are weighing whether PacBell and the other regional 
Bell companies should be allowed back into the long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some critics say the entry of PacBell and the other Baby Bells 
companies into long-distance could threaten the survival of Sprint, which has a 
far smaller share of the market than AT&T and MCI. 
</P>
<P>
 All three companies, as well as consumer groups, argue that as long as PacBell 
retains a local monopoly -- and controls the switches through which all 
long-distance calls must pass -- it could unfairly seize the lion's share of 
the long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference, Dorman said he and Quigley "had some fun sparring about 
that in our early talks. . . . I have certainly seen both sides of that 
debate." But he said the threat to Sprint is "way overblown." 
</P>
<P>
 Quigley called Dorman "a battle-hardened competitor" and said PacBell "needs 
to bring talent in where we don't have the kind of competitive experience we 
need." 
</P>
<P>
 In September, PacBell hired marketing executive Michael J. Fitzpatrick from 
the CEO's post at Network Systems Corp.

 Carter-Wallace to Discontinue Drug: The New York-based maker of 
pharmaceuticals and toiletries, complying with a government order, said it will 
stop selling Organidin, which is designed to clear phlegm from the lungs of 
people with breathing disorders such as bronchitis and asthma. The move was 
made because of Food and Drug Administration concerns that the drug causes 
cancer and does not work.The company said it would take a "material" charge in 
its fiscal 1995 first quarter ending this month to stop shipping the drug. 
Organidin generated 85% of the company's earnings before taxes and accounting

Exchange Commission filing this year that it might have to pull Organidin from

product and is testing it with patients. The partnership will join a handful of 
other companies racing to get FDA approval for the first artificial blood. The 
agreement calls for Lilly to invest $20 million in Somatogen in exchange for 
Somatogen common stock. Somatogen will also receive an additional $15 million 
equity investment if it meets certain milestones regarding the product. If the

IRS TAKES AIM AT BUSINESS TAXES WITH NEW ENFORCEMENT GUIDELINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Internal Revenue Service is fundamentally changing the way it collects 
taxes from businesses, in a shift expected to most dramatically affect small 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Next spring the IRS will begin sorting business tax returns by industry group 
instead of by type of return. That means that instead of putting all "sole 
proprietorships" into one pile -- be they deli owners or chiropractors or 
free-lance writers -- just because they all file Schedule Cs with their 
returns, the agency will now make separate piles for each line of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Enforcement agents will then tackle each pile differently, armed with detailed 
new enforcement guidelines specific to the industry. The agency plans to define 
more than 100 business categories, covering all work, and develop their 100 
guidelines by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson sees the new approach, the Market Segment 
Specialization Program, as progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have finally come to realize that you don't audit a bank the same way you 
audit a pizza parlor," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the new approach is part of agency efforts to raise taxpayer 
compliance from 83% to 90% by the end of the decade and is expected to help on 
several fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the guidebooks will acquaint agents with each industry before they head 
into audits, alerting them to common deceits. Agents can also avoid irrelevant 
issues, easing one longstanding business complaint that auditors often "don't 
know what they aren't looking for." Beyond that, the IRS will make the 
guidelines available to business owners who want help in filing honest returns. 
</P>
<P>
 There are doubters, however. Some wonder whether it's smart to share the 
guidelines with business owners, who could simply use them to better defeat 
auditors. Others caution that the whole enterprise hinges on the quality of the 
guidelines, and at least one industry already has complaints about the book on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS insists that the new program will not specifically target any type or 
size of business. But accountants outside the agency predict its impact will be 
strongest on small businesses and cash-based businesses of all sizes, because 
those groups have the worst records for paying up. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS has a list of nearly 80 industries for which it is writing or planning 
guidebooks. They are as various as art dealers, escort services, seaports, 
fishing and coal mining. The agency already has guidelines on nine industries, 
including trucking, taxicabs, bed and breakfasts and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts outside the IRS describe the new approach as a logical way to home in 
on deadbeats and get them to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Small businesses will feel the impact of the IRS' new specialization work 
most, said Cornelius Coleman, who helped shape the program as the North 
Atlantic regional IRS commissioner before joining the accounting firm of 
Coopers & Lybrand in New York.

 Multimedia: Time Warner Interactive and advertising conglomerate Interpublic 
Group of Companies have formed a joint venture to produce information, 
entertainment and advertising programming in a variety of interactive formats. 
The goal of several of the prototypes is to integrate each of the three 
elements into one product -- a departure from traditional media in which 
commercials are typically separate from other programming.Interpublic's 
agencies include McCann-Erickson, Lintas and Lowe Group. . . . In a preview of 
what life may be like when and if computers and TV sets converge, CNBC's 
24-hour talk show, "America's Talking," will use a computer and the Prodigy 
on-line service to allow viewers to send questions and comments onto the set by 
electronic mail. The hosts will take questions from the audience in cyberspace 
as well as from the traditional audience in the studio. After a given segment, 
Prodigy members can use the service's real-time chat feature to continue the 
discussion over their computers and phone lines. Producers of the show, which 
premieres July 4, also plan to experiment with instant polls of the 
computer-equipped viewers. AMY HARMON

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; STARK FINDS LITTLE NOSTALGIA FOR OLD IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With movies such as "Speed" driving a strong summer box office, look for 
plenty of upward mobility in Hollywood this year. It usually takes just one 
hit, or even one widely acclaimed piece of work, to move someone's salary into 
the fast lane these days. 
</P>
<P>
 The most celebrated recent case involves comedian Jim Carrey, whose asking 
price rose from about $450,000 to $7 million after he starred in the sleeper 
hit "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective." Carrey may get another boost from "The Mask," 
which comes out soon. Others likely to benefit from their roles in summer 
sensations include Keanu Reeves of "Speed" and John Goodman of "The 
Flintstones." 
</P>
<P>
 That's great for stars and their support teams, but it's enough to make others 
nostalgic for the days when salaries were more managed under the old studio 
system. Producer Ray Stark ("The Way We Were," "Steel Magnolias"), for one, has 
quietly lobbied for a modified version of that system, only to discover that 
Hollywood is not a very nostalgic place. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark's appeal began five years ago when he broached the idea with Motion 
Picture Assn. of America President Jack Valenti. In a letter obtained by The 
Times that has not surfaced publicly before, Stark argued that spiraling 
salaries were throwing Hollywood's economy out of whack and damaging 
performers' long-term careers -- because they worked less often and rarely 
established definitive screen personas, other than as action stars. 
</P>
<P>
 As a solution, he suggested that the studios embrace an updated contract 
system that would permit them to nurture talent as they did in the days of 
Clark Gable, Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under Stark's detailed plan, each major studio would put up $250,000 to begin 
funding an "actors' school." Some 12 students would be accepted to the school 
each year. The students could be represented by traditional agents and lawyers. 
But in return for training and guaranteed employment, they would agree to work 
under a seven-year personal services agreement, with per-picture salaries 
capped at $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark told Valenti he had discussed the plan with most of the major studio 
chiefs at the time and that they were receptive, even encouraging. But it died 
there, although the producer recirculated the letter two years ago. Stark, 
confirming that he wrote the letter and still favors the idea, recalled that 
the industry never responded. "Valenti said, 'Yeah, let's do something,' " 
Stark said. "But no one ever took on the project." 
</P>
<P>
 It may not take a Ph.D in logic to figure out what happened. In Hollywood, 
it's a given that the balance of power has shifted from the studios to talent, 
which explains why stars such as Arnold Schwarzenegger can command $15 million 
a film. Sources say most executives would be frightened of supporting such a 
fundamental change, because it could touch off a holy war with big stars and 
their phalanx of powerful agents, managers and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's possible that those studio chiefs who expressed interest in Stark's plan 
were doing so only hypothetically. But the plan also seems to raise antitrust 
issues, which are alluded to in the letter. The issue remains so sensitive that 
even now, no one but Stark will openly discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Valenti failed to return telephone calls for comment after a copy of the 
letter was faxed to his Beverly Hills hotel at his request. Three of the studio 
chiefs named in the letter also declined to comment, with one saying he'd just 
as soon shoot himself in a particularly sensitive area. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark, one of those rare people in Hollywood who is successful and powerful 
enough to speak his mind, said he's never made a crusade out of the idea. But 
as someone who started as an agent representing actors such as John Wayne and 
Lana Turner, he said he honestly believes that the old system did a better job 
of building careers. "In the old days, personalities were built -- you went to 
see Clark Gable no matter who he played," Stark said. "But the studios don't 
build talent anymore. They build buildings."

 Unity in numbers: As Europe lurches toward a new entertainment trade policy, 
the American Film Marketing Assn. is lobbying against the formation of a 
pan-European movie distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the European Audiovisual Conference, which begins discussions 
in Brussels on Thursday, AFMA President Jonas Rosenfeld argues that a 
subsidized pan-European company would turn into a bottomless money pit. 
Rosenfeld says national distributors are already doing a good job of fostering 
multinational productions and other types of joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 European Union officials are heatedly debating how to revive the group's 
troubled entertainment industry. The most nationalistic representatives have 
argued that the answer lies in limiting the number of American movies and TV 
shows allowed in Europe. Those forces also succeeded in excluding entertainment 
from last year's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosenfeld said the most vociferous complaints are coming from those 
involved with the creative side of the industry, with business interests going 
"frequently unheard."

VENEZUELA IMPOSES CONTROLS TO CHECK RUNAWAY INFLATION; SOUTH AMERICA: CERTAIN 
RIGHTS ARE SUSPENDED. GOVERNMENT WILL SET MAXIMUM PRICES ON SOME BASIC ITEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing the possibility of 70% inflation by the end of the year, Venezuelan 
President Rafael Caldera suspended some constitutional rights late Monday to 
impose price and currency exchange controls. 
</P>
<P>
 The government suspended five constitutional guarantees, including protection 
against unreasonable searches, in order to impose the controls and prepare, if 
necessary, for public unrest, a government spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move allows the government to set maximum prices for certain basic 
products, such as food and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Venezuela is undergoing one of the worst economic crises in its history. A 
large portion of the banking system has fallen into state hands, while the 
bolivar, the national currency, has plummeted in foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation was 5.2% in May, one of Latin America's highest rates, and it is 
expected to reach an annual rate of 70% by the end of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grave state of our financial system, the insistent wave of rumors, the 
speculative movements that have tried to bring down the bolivar have forced us 
to take these measures," Caldera said in a nationwide television address. 
</P>
<P>
 To soften the effects of inflation, the government will issue transportation 
and food bonds to low-income residents, Caldera said. More measures will be 
announced soon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By government estimate, 8 million of the country's 20 million people live in 
poverty. Public schools, roads, hospitals and other services are falling apart; 
real incomes and living standards are shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldera said he does not believe the measures will scare off foreign 
investors. "On the contrary, investors need a stable currency," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government will also seek tighter regulation of commercial banks, Caldera 
said.

MOON STRUCK; IT'S BEEN 25 YEARS SINCE 'BUZZ' ALDRIN DAZZLED THE WORLD BY 
PLANTING OUR FLAG ON THE MOON. NOW, AMID THE RUSH OF ACTIVITY MARKING THE 
EVENT, MANY WONDER: WHAT DID WE LEARN UP THERE? 
</P>

<P>
 Out of the cool darkness and crackling static of space came a message any 
earthling could understand: "Picking up some dust." 
</P>
<P>
 With those words, Apollo 11 astronaut Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin Jr. radioed Earth 
that his space module was 40 feet above the moon and ready to touch down. It 
was 1:18 p.m. on July 20, 1969 -- a day when America was bitterly divided over 
the Vietnam War and barreling on a fast track toward more political havoc. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 48 hours before, Ted Kennedy's car had careened off a bridge at 
Chappaquidick. Angry civil rights protests were planned in big cities for the 
fall and the Chicago Conspiracy Trial was soon to begin. Not a pretty time. 
</P>
<P>
 But when mission commander Neil A. Armstrong took his first steps on the lunar 
surface that afternoon, the nation momentarily forgot its turmoil. Worldwide, 
more than 600 million people were riveted to television sets and radios, 
spellbound as humans swept aside one of the last great barriers to manned space 
exploration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned that man can damn well do anything he sets his mind to do," says 
Walter Cronkite, who broadcast the event on CBS-TV. "And the challenge was to 
keep this lesson in front of us. If we could get to the moon, we should be able 
to solve any problem on Earth. That's what the moon shot said to us." 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the last time America felt so confident about itself, and 
then-President Richard M. Nixon walked a fine line between hyperbole and pride, 
calling the Apollo 11 voyage the most significant week since Creation. The 
plaque left behind by the crew read: "We Came in Peace for All Mankind." 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter of a century later, Apollo 11's stunning technological achievement 
is unquestioned. Yet the meaning of it all is up for grabs. The memory of what 
once seemed our finest hour has been eroded by national malaise, petty 
political wrangling and the abrupt end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, there are no more Soviets to race. No more propaganda battles to be 
won. NASA's once limitless horizons have degenerated into nasty budget 
squabbles, and a whole new generation has come of age since the last Apollo 
landing in 1972. Perhaps fittingly, the historic picture of Aldrin saluting an 
American flag on the moon is best known as an MTV logo. 
</P>
<P>
 So what did it all amount to, that memorable summer day when Armstrong and 
Aldrin hopped on the lunar surface, 240,000 miles from Earth? As the mission's 
25th anniversary approaches, a flood of books, magazines, TV specials, films 
and high-level conferences are trying to provide an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "That first moon shot was the finest moment of the 20th Century," says John 
Mosley, an astronomer at Griffith Observatory, where packed crowds have lately 
been watching a retrospective film on the Apollo 11 mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "But times change. Maybe we're becoming one of those countries that achieves 
great things, then retreats to wrestle with its own problems. Others with 
greater vision may take the lead away from us, and that's sad." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, a fading space effort is welcome news. Why spend billions to bounce 
a man on the moon when people are starving on Earth? Civil rights leaders 
voiced these thoughts as the Apollo 11 crew took off, and many anti-poverty 
activists in U.S. cities echo the same concerns today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anybody who even talks about (space) anymore," says Teddy 
Watkins Jr., with the Watts Labor Community Action Committee. "When you think 
of all the money that's been spent out there in space, it could have gone a 
long way toward pulling this country up by its boot straps." 
</P>
<P>
 Others disagree, saying America must continue its travels through the 
universe. The urge to explore and discover, they say, is as fundamental to 
human nature as the need to procreate. Just ask the men who have been there. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Alan B. Shepard Jr., America's first man in space, and James A. Lovell 
Jr., pilot of the Apollo 13 mission, have published dramatic memoirs of what it 
was like to visit the moon. Other experts have written provocative histories of 
the space program, and NASA is reissuing documents from the first moon flight, 
trying to put a positive spin on the benefits of U.S. space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Spaceweek International Assn. is hosting several commemorative 
events in Southern California, including an Apollo 11 Anniversary dinner with 
Vice President Al Gore, an astronaut-celebrity golf tournament and "Family 
Science Space Day" at the California Museum of Science and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The rush of activity is nothing new, because the Apollo moon landing triggered 
a similar reaction in 1969. And a look back at books and statements by the 
three crew members, as well as by critics such as Norman Mailer, show that the 
debate over space hasn't changed much in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Then as now, faith in science collides with more troubling questions: What 
have we really learned from going to the moon? Has it made us better people? 
And what will we do with the awesome power of space flight in the future? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As he looks out the window of his hotel room, high atop New York's Central 
Park, the grand old man of U.S. space travel doesn't offer any easy answers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shepard, who captured America's imagination with his 1961 sub-orbital ride 
in space, insists that going to the moon has taught us as much about ourselves 
-- and our limits -- as it has about the pockmarked lunar surface. 
</P>
<P>
 He explores these issues in "Moonshot" (Turner Publishing), a memoir 
co-written with late astronaut Deke Slayton. The book, which has begun climbing 
bestseller lists, is also the subject of a forthcoming WTBS special, and 
Shepard is promoting the book and film on a national tour. 
</P>

 "Occasionally I'll give speeches and talk about my personal feelings of 
looking back toward Earth from the moon," says Shepard, who led the Apollo 14 
lunar mission in 1971 and was the first man to hit a golf ball on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized up there that our planet is not infinite. It's fragile. That may 
not be obvious to a lot of folks, and it's tough that people are fighting each 
other here on Earth instead of trying to get together and live on this planet. 
We look pretty vulnerable in the darkness of space." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other NASA boosters, Shepard rattles off the Apollo program's impressive 
scientific achievements: Unprecedented knowledge of the lunar surface. Digital 
computer research that's led to the development of laptops in our time. 
Products such as Velcro and Teflon that impact millions. The vast, untapped 
promise of resources for clean, nuclear fission, such as Helium 3, on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he concedes that most people don't relate to advanced research unless it 
directly impacts their lives. Americans have always wanted to know their 
astronauts as people first and scientists second. That's not been easy with the 
U.S. space program, whose current astronauts speak fluent data and little else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get away from that and show these guys as real human beings," 
says Andrew Chaikin, author of "A Man on the Moon" (Viking), an authoritative 
history of the Apollo program. "We never really absorbed the moon experience 
because we didn't know what it was like for these guys." 
</P>
<P>
 How many readers, for example, know that Armstrong -- widely perceived in 1969 
as shy, remote and tongue-tied -- had a sly wit and played ragtime piano in 
bars near Edwards Air Force Base? It's all there in Chaikin's 670-page book, 
along with stories of astronauts who had epiphanies and religious moments as 
they hurtled back to Earth from the moon. Lovell is a good example. 
</P>
<P>
 "After my trip, I got a better sense of our role in the universe, and it made 
me feel humble," says the man who flew the Apollo 8 and 13 missions. 
</P>
<P>
 He's now written his story in "Lost Moon" (Houghton Mifflin), focusing mainly 
on the oxygen tank explosion that nearly killed his crew and caused them to 
abort their 1970 landing. The astronaut also recalls his 1968 flight, which was 
the first to orbit the moon and beamed back one of the most historic photos 
ever taken of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the famous "blue marble" picture showing terra firma in the icy 
blackness of space. The picture eventually became a U.S. stamp, a rallying 
symbol for environmentalists and a marketing tool for everything from Reeboks 
to Whole Earth Catalogues. Lovell worries that the photo's underlying message 
has been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in the 1960s, you had a moment when everything seemed possible with the 
space program," he says. "But today, we're vacillating over space priorities. 
We study everything to death. We've lost the momentum to explore that we once 
had. Under John F. Kennedy, we were gung-ho to reach the moon." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 If there was a spiritual nadir for the New Frontier, it was early 1961. On 
April 12, the Soviets announced that cosmonaut Yuri A. Gagarin had orbited the 
globe. Five days later, the Bay of Pigs invasion collapsed on Cuban beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of such turmoil the Apollo space program was born. Kennedy, eager to 
fulfill the promise of his "Get America Moving" rhetoric and determined to 
catch up with the Soviets, asked his top advisers what the United States should 
do to win the space race. The answer, however daunting, seemed obvious: Go to 
the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy promised a landing by the end of the 1960s and the goal was met. Yet 
it happened largely because of circumstances that would be hard to duplicate 
now, says James Kauffman, professor of communication at Indiana University 
Southeast and the author of "Selling Outer Space: Kennedy, the Media and 
Funding for Project Apollo" (University of Alabama Press). 
</P>
<P>
 "You had a charismatic President, a worthy opponent in the Russians and a very 
compelling myth for most Americans," Kauffman explains. "Going to the moon was 
a reflection of the old frontier story that this country loves: Good guys clash 
with an enemy, go into the wilderness and come back victorious." 
</P>
<P>
 Digging through records of congressional testimony, Kauffman notes that many 
scientists and military experts initially opposed the moon program. Some 
believed it was unnecessary to put humans on the lunar surface, since robot 
technology could get there faster and cheaper. Others objected that the cost of 
the Apollo moon program, then pegged at $24 billion, was exorbitant. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of these critics could brush aside the frontier argument, and so the 
Administration relied heavily on that in its rhetoric with the American 
people," Kauffman says. "The moon was to be our destiny, pure and simple." 
</P>
<P>
 A President rallying such an effort today would face tough obstacles, he adds. 
Americans are no longer paranoid about Soviet scientific expertise, and 
concerns over the budget deficit make new spending programs suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President George Bush learned this in 1989, when he tried to inspire 
the country with a new space push culminating in a manned voyage to Mars. The 
effort fell flat and was eventually abandoned. Few people seemed to notice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is it because space travel seems passe? Or that a vital human element has long 
been missing from America's space exploration programs? 
</P>
<P>
 Those concerns surfaced in 1969, even before Apollo 11 blasted off from Earth. 
Norman Mailer, on assignment for Life magazine, wrote "Of a Fire on the Moon," 
an account of the mission that deviated sharply from mainstream press coverage. 
Instead of beating his chest, the author took a skeptical view of the event, 
referring throughout to himself and his private thoughts: 
</P>
<P>
 "He hardly knew whether the Space Program was the noblest expression of the 
20th Century or the quintessential statement of our fundamental insanity. . . . 
The world would cheer America for a day, but something was lacking, some joy, 
some outrageous sense of adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 One problem, Mailer suggested, was that the astronauts seemed rigid and 
machine-like, with no human detail. When Armstrong made his famous comment on 
the moon -- "That's one small step for man, one giant step for mankind" -- the 
author despaired that even this epochal moment had lost its magic: 
</P>
<P>
 "It was as if on the largest stage ever created, before an audience of the 
Earth, a man of modest appearance would walk to the center, smile tentatively 
at the footlights, and read a page from a data card." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the books written by astronauts in later years did little to dispel 
this concern. For example, "First on the Moon" by Armstrong, Aldrin and Michael 
Collins (Little Brown, 1970), remains a breath-taking recapitulation of the 
mission. Yet there's scant evidence of the crew's innermost thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Chaikin, Kauffman and others worry about the space program's continuing 
lack of human scale. Shuttle flights seem to blend into one another, and their 
scientific experiments are not widely understood. 
</P>
<P>
 But some suggest that critics have failed to celebrate the romance in space 
technology that's been there all along. You just have to know where to look. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long after the Vietnam War is footnotes, people will remember that we went to 
the moon, and that it was a great adventure," says Los Angeles author Mike 
Gray, who has written "Angle of Attack" (Penguin), a history of the Apollo 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five hundred years from now, we'll be occupying every flat surface in the 
solar system that isn't boiling, simply because it's out there. It's our 
business to spread life. We are the intelligent life force," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gray, who also penned "The China Syndrome," the unsung heroes of Apollo 
are the nearly 400,000 technicians who worked tirelessly to make the program a 
national success. If Nixon's name is on the moon, he argues, their names should 
be up there as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the poetry of space travel remains potent and alluring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we solve our short-range problems, visionaries will point us to Mars," 
Gray says. "And we'll go not because of technology, but because we watch 'Star 
Trek.' These are the myths of our time. Like the moon shot itself."

BODY BY ROVER?; FORGET THE DIET BOOKS AND THE GYM. IF YOU WANT A NEW BODY, JUST 
GET YOURSELF A DOG.

<P>
 Can't lose weight? 
</P>
<P>
 Get a dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't aerobicize. Don't Jazzercize. Doggercize. 
</P>
<P>
 Any hound worth its Alpo is only too happy to help with diet and exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 A hungry dog -- all dogs are hungry or dead -- is a better diet aid than 
anything you can get over or under the counter. If you can't afford to have one 
of those Body by Jake types come over to your house and yell at you every day, 
dogs are great personal trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how much junk you usually eat while watching TV, you will eat less 
if a dog is by your Barcalounger, staring intently at your hand as it goes from 
the bag of Cool Ranch Doritos to your fat mouth. Every fifth bite or so will be 
given up to that pooch whose big eyes and sad expression would have you believe 
that the poor waif has been in Somalia since sometime last year. 
</P>
<P>
 You may buy a two-pound bag of Mesquite Bar-B-Q Ruffles, but you'll be lucky 
to eat half -- especially if you leave the bag within doggie reach when you go 
to check the plumbing during a commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 And a face full of dog breath tends to curb the appetite. 
</P>
<P>
 If you decide to get off your duff and get some actual exercise, a canine 
companion will be only too happy to take you for a drag as often as you can 
handle it. 
</P>
<P>
 Just loop a leash around the neck of some big, happy drooler, hold on tightly, 
open the door and feel that fat melt away as you zip around the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the long walks, you also get the benefit of short sprints to 
catch your beast when it takes off after a squirrel, a flyer-delivery guy or 
the mail carrier. You learn to apologize better than a Corvette owner in 
traffic court.  
</P>
<P>
 Don't buy a set of weights. You'll get enough heavy lifting -- and possibly a 
hernia -- schlepping those 50-pound bags of Purina home from Vons. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, you get to stretch those flabby muscles and unlimber -- or snap -- that 
cramped back bending over to clean up after your personal trainer. It's the 
law, you know, and it's the good-neighbor thing to do. And developing the grace 
to carry on a conversation with a neighbor while holding a sack of poop can 
give you the savoir-faire of a French diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it is hard to be suave if you are stuck at home, fat and barefoot 
because Sputnik ate your Adidas. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing about having a dog underfoot is that you can trip over it and 
fall, as my wife did a while back, snapping her arm in three places. Her other 
arm got lots of exercise as she filled out medical insurance claim forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Come to think of it, what's that Jake guy's number?

IN-LINE SKATING'S HOT -- BUT IS IT SAFE?; RECREATION: THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN 
INJURED. BUT DO THE NUMBERS ALONE MEAN THE SPORT IS DANGEROUS? THE VERDICT 
ISN'T IN YET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In-line skating may reach its zenith this summer, according to sporting goods 
manufacturers, who predict sales of skates will surpass last year's record of 
$243 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But will this also be the summer in which skaters are lined up in hospital 
emergency rooms? 
</P>
<P>
 The national Consumer Products Safety Commission says yes. Proponents and 
others say no. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report released June 9, the government organization reported that 
injuries from in-line skating had doubled in the first five months of '94 
compared to the same period last year. With long, sunny days ahead, the 
commission warned, the rate of injuries is expected to soar. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sport is dangerous, and the injuries are serious," said Ann Brown, 
commission chairwoman. "The CPSC wants your summer Rollerblading fun to be 
outdoors and in the sun, not indoors and in the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 The report predicted that potentially devastating head injuries will increase 
from 2,000 last year to 7,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Brown called the sport "intrinsically dangerous," others strongly 
reject the idea that in-line skating is any more dangerous than other 
recreational sports. 
</P>
<P>
 In a different government study also released this month, roller-skating 
injuries that required emergency room treatment were found to be triple that of 
in-line skating injuries. Skateboarding injuries, too, were slightly more 
common than in-line skating injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 From July 1, 1992, to June 30, 1993, injuries among roller skaters numbered 
92,963, compared to 34,938 for skateboarders and 30,863 among in-line skaters, 
reported Dr. Richard A. Schieber of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention in Atlanta. The study was published in the Journal of the American 
Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 So, are you risking bodily harm if you take up in-line skating? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is not nearly as clear-cut as either recent report might imply, say 
most experts familiar with the statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 In-line skates feature a single row of wheels that, like ice skates, require 
some balance and ankle strength but give the skater greater maneuverability 
than roller skates. The sport is also unique for the speeds that can be 
generated; the typical cruise speed is 10 to 17 m.p.h., Schieber said. 
Moreover, the skater must learn to use a heel brake, as opposed to a toe brake 
on roller skates. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of these characteristics, some people worry that in-line skaters will 
be more likely to fall or collide with other moving objects, leading to serious 
injuries, particularly to the head and wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 According to some experts, in-line skating may not be intrinsically dangerous, 
as the Consumer Products report stated, if the skater is well-trained and 
equipped with protective gear. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, merely producing fewer injuries doesn't make in-line 
skating any safer than roller skating, Schieber said. 
</P>
<P>
 The CDC study, he pointed out, does not give the rate of injury -- that is, 
what percentage of skaters in each of the three roller sports are injured per 
outing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how many participants there are for each sport and how many 
times a week or month each person skates. Without knowing the injury rates, we 
really don't have a good handle on comparing which of these sports is safer," 
said Schieber, a pediatrician and epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the risks of in-line skating will not be easy to estimate until 
several other developments unfold, such as: 
</P>
<P>
 * The number of skaters stabilizes with fewer new skaters coming on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 * Manufacturers produce improved safety gear, now under development. 
</P>
<P>
 * Studies are completed analyzing how and where injuries occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sport only started around 1980," in the United States, Schieber noted. 
"It has achieved an enormous range of popularity in different age groups in a 
short amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To Henry Zuver, the executive director of the International In-Line Skating 
Assn., the injury numbers are small compared to the number of people skating. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are no formal studies on this -- as Schieber pointed out -- 
Zuver estimates that about 12.6 million Americans participated in in-line 
skating in 1993. That would put the injury rate at a fraction of 1% -- even if 
injuries more than doubled over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than 99% are enjoying the activity and skating in a safe manner," Zuver 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zuver and others think injury warnings have been blown out of proportion 
because of how fast the sport has grown. Based on sales figures, participation 
is thought to have increased by about 500% since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The Consumer Products Safety Commission's report is unnecessarily alarmist, 
agreed Dr. Gary Brazina, an orthopedic surgeon at Century City Hospital and 
team physician for the L.A. Blades professional roller hockey team 
</P>
<P>
 "You can certainly expect injuries to increase because the popularity of the 
sport is growing exponentially," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of novice skaters may contribute to a temporarily high injury rate 
this year, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more people are doing it as first-timers. There are a lot of 
beginners out there who don't know how to go over a rough surface or who don't 
take a safety lesson or who don't wear protective gear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If consumers followed the IISA recommendations for safe skating, the injury 
rate would decrease, Zuver said. The organization recommends that skaters wear 
protective gear that includes a helmet, wrist guards, and elbow and knee pads. 
</P>
<P>
 Schieber's study showed that wrist injuries are the most common among in-line 
skaters, accounting for 38% of all injuries. Several types of wrist guards are 
available, but it's not known how many skaters wear them or how useful they are 
in preventing bone fractures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to protective gear, first-time skaters should take a lesson before 
zooming off on their own, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The skates aren't dangerous; the lack of knowledge of the people putting them 
on is dangerous," Zuver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes and workshops are becoming more common as the IISA trains more 
instructors, he said. The association has accredited about 50 new instructors 
in Southern California this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both (government) reports emphasize that taking a class is the right thing to 
do," Zuver said. "It's not unlike skiing. If people go to a ski slope for the 
first time, most will take a lesson and learn the proper methods to ski prior 
to even going on a bunny hill." 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran skaters make the sport look easier than it is, Brazina said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's somewhat more difficult than regular roller skating because of the way 
you stop," he said, noting that in-line skaters use a heel brake instead of a 
toe brake. "Once you master that technique, it's pretty straightforward." 
</P>
<P>
 Another hotly debated subject concerning safety is where in-line skaters 
should skate. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes for in-line skaters should include basics on courtesy and protocol on 
sidewalks and bike paths, Brazina said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there should be some consideration for where you Rollerblade. There 
is always a conflict between cyclists and Rollerbladers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeated calls to ban in-line skating on public property and limit it to 
special fields or rinks have been raised locally since 1991, when a 13-year-old 
Hermosa Beach boy died when he skated down a steep street and collided with a 
bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think confining it to a certain place is over-administrating it," Brazina 
said. "But, as a new sport, people have to be made aware of the rules of the 
road: where to skate and how to skate in traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 In-line skating is a good aerobic exercise, is easy on the joints and helps 
tone the major muscles of the lower body. But the next generation of research 
should help determine just how safe it is, Schieber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zuver is confident that in-line skating will prove to be no more risky than 
any activity in which man straps on wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Done in the proper manner, this is a good activity. I think future studies 
will bear that out." Tips for Safe In-Line Skating 
</P>
<P>
 * Always wear protective equipment: helmet, elbow and knee pads, and wrist 
guards. (The protective gear can cost $50 or more). 
</P>
<P>
 * Learn how to use the skates through lessons or classes. Instructions should 
include how to stop, turn and control speed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not skate at night. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not skate in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 * Skate on smooth surfaces. Avoid slick or dirty areas, such as sandy or oily 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't wear headphones or anything that obstructs hearing or vision.

BODY WATCH; DON'T GET MAD -- GET SMART; WOMEN SHOULDN'T SUFFER SILENTLY OR 
EXPLODE WHEN THEY'RE ANGERED, NEW RESEARCH SHOWS. RATHER, THEY SHOULD DEAL WITH 
IT -- THEIR HEALTH MAY DEPEND ON IT. 
</P>

<P>
 Doctors have been warning men for years that exploding with anger over trivial 
events -- such as some jerk cutting you off on the San Bernardino -- is not 
good for your health. This classic, Type A behavior tends to land men in the 
cardiac-care ward. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about women? 
</P>
<P>
 Is going ballistic bad for their health? Or is it healthier to be a polite 
lady and keep your anger to yourself? 
</P>
<P>
 Neither, say the authors of intriguing new research on women and anger. 
Repressing anger is just as bad as becoming bleeping mad. 
</P>
<P>
 Women, it seems, also have to learn to deal with anger constructively, says 
Sandra P. Thomas, editor of "Women and Anger," (Springer Publishing Co., 1993). 
</P>
<P>
 "Anger is a problem for women when it is too frequent, too intense, too 
prolonged," Thomas says. But, "neither 'stuffing it' nor 'shouting it' is 
recommended." 
</P>
<P>
 The key is determining whether your anger is poisonous or constructive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite its bad press, anger is not entirely unhealthy," Thomas says. "Anger 
can be a signal that our rights or values are being compromised, that others 
are doing too much or too little for us, that something is wrong and should be 
corrected. Unless the anger is expressed, the offending party has no 
opportunity to make needed changes in behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of women's second-class status in society, they have plenty to be 
angry about, Thomas and her colleagues say. They found anger is a key risk 
factor in obesity, smoking and substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, not much has been known about anger and women's health. Most 
of the research, such as the Type A studies, were done using male subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Those studies have shown that men with short fuses have a higher risk of heart 
attack, and cardiologists repeatedly warn men to learn to handle stress without 
cranking up their blood pressure. But the messages for women have been less 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Women) are very bewildered about expressing anger," says Thomas, a nursing 
professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. "There is a message that 
holding anger in is bad for you. There is an equally vocal message that letting 
anger out is bad for you. And then there is the suggestion: Just don't get 
angry. To me, that's about as effective as Nancy Reagan saying 'Just say no' to 
drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a societal taboo surrounding women and anger that deterred 
researchers, Thomas says. Women traditionally hide their anger because it's 
contrary to the ideal of the perfect mother and nurturer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our images of angry women are not very attractive," she says, adding that 
these images are usually described as "shrews, bitches and nags." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' study -- the first large-scale, comprehensive look at women's anger -- 
showed that how anger is expressed has important implications for women's 
health. The all-female research group interviewed 535 women ages 25 to 66 about 
what makes them angry, how they act when they're angry and whether there were 
health consequences linked to their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 The study confirmed what several other studies have shown about Type A 
personalities in men: Hollering, screaming, slamming doors and throwing frying 
pans are not good for your health. 
</P>
<P>
 But harboring anger can be just as dangerous. Thomas found that women who 
obsessed or ruminated about an incident were more likely to have depression, 
stress and other physical health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In another study, female heart patients who suppressed anger were found to be 
more likely to suffer a second heart attack. Researcher Lynda H. Powell of 
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago also found that 
employed, divorced women who lacked a college degree had a higher risk for a 
relapse. 
</P>
<P>
 These women, many of whom were married in the 1940s and '50s, Powell 
suggested, might be more prone to heart attacks because of the anger, 
loneliness and resentment arising from a life that had turned out far 
differently than they had anticipated. "For women with coronary disease, this 
combination of (emotions) may be lethal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But women who confront the source of their anger are using the emotion in a 
healthy way, experts say. For example, one study showed that women who openly 
expressed anger about having cancer lived longer. And, Thomas says, angry women 
may get better medical attention than women who are passive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anger can serve as a useful warning signal that stressors are exceeding our 
resources," she says. "Anger is an entirely natural, legitimate response in 
many situations." 
</P>
<P>
 While Thomas found that the healthiest response to anger is to discuss the 
incident with the person who provoked the anger, only 9% of the women she 
surveyed said they did that. Instead, many said they coped by crying, taking a 
walk or exercising and thinking about or analyzing the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Exercise also appears to be a healthy outlet. Thomas found that women who 
worked out were less likely to have stress-related symptoms, such as a headache 
or stomachache. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most heartening findings in the study, she notes, was that women 
rarely blew up over little things. They said they were most likely to get angry 
over issues of power, justice and responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our women said almost nothing about trivial things, like someone getting 
ahead of them in traffic -- things cited more by men," Thomas says. 
</P>
<P>
 In another study, researchers found that women who were angry about their 
marriages spent more days ill than their happily married counterparts. The way 
people manage their anger is rarely considered by doctors as a factor in 
illness, Thomas notes. 
</P>
<P>
 But that should change as more research like the University of Tennessee study 
emerges.

BODY WATCH; YOUR BODY; AILMENTS -- AND TREATMENTS -- FOR SURFERS ONLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Who would engage willingly -- make that gleefully -- in a sport that sets up 
participants for lacerations, pimples and bony ear growths? 
</P>
<P>
 That, of course, would be surfers. They know that their passion for catching 
waves increases the chances of accident and injury, but they insist that the 
returns -- exercise, serenity, that storybook California look -- more than 
compensate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surfers have gotten more creative and aggressive" -- and injuries are a 
natural consequence, says Dr. Mark Renneker, a San Francisco surfer and 
physician who founded the Surfer's Medical Assn. But surfers are also becoming 
more prevention-savvy, Renneker and other experts say, taking care not just to 
avoid sharks but to protect their ears and skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Canal Problems: Bony exostoses, or surfer's ear, is common. These bony growths 
under the skin of the ear canal get bigger when aggravated by irritation from 
water and wind exposure. As the growths enlarge, they can trap water, ear wax, 
dead skin and sand next to the ear drum, explains Renneker, co-author of the 
self-help paperback "Sick Surfers Ask the Surf Docs and Dr. Geoff" (Bull 
Publishing Co., 1993, (800) 676-2855). 
</P>
<P>
 When the growths close off the ear passage and cause hearing loss and ringing 
in the ears (tinnitus), Dr. Joseph R. Di Bartolomeo, a Santa Barbara ear 
specialist who treats many surfers, uses a kind of high-speed "drill" to remove 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Canal Self-Help: Surfer's ear can be avoided or minimized, though, with such 
self-help measures as wearing protective gear and cleaning the ears properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sell more plugs and more caps than before," says Brian Hilbers, a veteran 
surfer who manages Val Surf & Sport in North Hollywood. Older surfers in 
particular, especially if they have had ear surgery, are buying the billed 
neoprene caps, which fit hoodlike over the ears and cost $20 to $30. 
</P>
<P>
 Good Hygiene: Clean the ears very gently, Renneker advises, because "the skin 
in the outer ear canal is very sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Use a mixture of one-half white vinegar and one-half rubbing alcohol to rinse 
the ear, suggests Di Bartolomeo, who cautions surfers not to use stronger 
alcohol solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't forget to rinse ear plugs after removal, Di Bartolomeo advises: 
"Otherwise, it is like putting on dirty socks to go running." Bacteria on the 
plugs can be forced into the ear canal, leading to infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Ear Ills: Ear drum perforations are another hazard, says Dr. 
ChippMiller, an otolaryngologist on staff at Santa Monica Hospital Medical 
Center and an avid surfer. The implosive force of the ear hitting the water can 
be so great that it causes the drum to perforate. When salt water and bacteria 
enter the middle ear through the perforation, infection and drainage can occur. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that 90% of these acute perforations heal without surgery. 
"The hardest part for surfers is to keep the ear dry," he says. If they must 
surf before the drum heals, they should wear caps and plugs, Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinus Problems: Surfer's sinusitis is another risk. Usually, Miller prescribes 
a 10-day course of decongestants and antibiotics. But some surfers get the 
infection back again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 Sneaky Boards: Then there's the runaway surfboard problem. "They lose the 
board, go under water, don't know exactly where it is and come up and hit the 
fin," says Dr. Wally Ghurabi, director of the Nethercutt Emergency Center at 
Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers of surfboards have become more prevention-oriented, too, 
encouraging surfers to buy protective gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Protection: Use water-proof sunscreen with a sun protection factor of at 
least 15, Renneker advises. The sunscreen lasts only about 80 minutes in water, 
he says, and perhaps only 40 if the product is water-resistant rather than 
waterproof. 
</P>
<P>
 Wet-Suit Pimples: When a tight wet suit rubs body hair wrong, the skin around 
the tiny follicle of each hair becomes irritated. That's because inflammation 
and swelling has blocked the oil produced by underlying glands, trapping them 
inside the follicle.  
</P>
<P>
 For relief, apply over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream in 1% concentration 
three times a day, experts advise. At night, try benzoyl peroxide gel. 
</P>
<P>
 Chin Splits: Any ill-trained athlete can get shin splints. But surfers get 
chin splits, a more exotic nuisance that occurs when the chin is gashed open 
upon impact with the board.

HIGH COURT OKS CONGRESS' RIGHT TO REGULATE CABLE TV; MEDIA: FIRMS CAN BE 
REQUIRED TO CARRY THE SIGNALS OF OVER-THE-AIR STATIONS IN THEIR AREAS, JUSTICES 
RULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Upholding the government's power to protect "the free flow of information and 
ideas," the Supreme Court said Monday that Congress can require cable 
television operators to carry the signals of broadcast stations in their areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-4 ruling stops short of finally upholding part of a 1992 law that says 
cable operators must carry nearly all local over-the-air broadcasters. The case 
was sent back for a further district court hearing on whether all broadcasters 
actually need this protection. 
</P>
<P>
 But the high court's 45-page opinion marks a substantial victory for 
broadcasters, consumers and the Federal Communications Commission. It makes 
clear that cable television can be regulated, so long as the government does 
not seek to dictate the content of its programming. It also firmly rejects the 
cable industry's view that local cable operators, like newspaper publishers, 
are entirely protected from regulation thanks to the Constitution's guarantee 
of free speech and a free press. 
</P>
<P>
 "The First Amendment's command that government not impede the freedom of 
speech does not disable the government from taking steps to ensure that private 
interests not restrict, through physical control of the critical pathway of 
communication, the free flow of information and ideas," said Justice Anthony M. 
Kennedy for the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our review of the (1992) act persuades us that Congress' overriding objective 
in enacting must-carry (rules) was not to favor programming of a particular 
subject matter, viewpoint or format, but rather to preserve access to free 
television for the 40% of Americans without cable," he said. Lawmakers feared 
that small, over-the-air broadcasters could be driven out of business if they 
were dropped by cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling in the case (Turner Broadcasting System vs. the Federal 
Communications Commission, 93-44) is the high court's first extended 
pronouncement on cable television and the First Amendment. It reflects the 
extraordinary change in the TV industry over the last 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Three decades ago, cable television was a fledging industry that sold itself 
to viewers on the promise that it would offer them a clearer picture on their 
screens. Television itself was dominated by three networks: CBS, NBC and ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, cable has become a power and in some ways has supplanted the three 
networks as the dominant force in news and entertainment. It not only delivers 
TV signals into 60% of American households, but it also produces its own 
programming. As both the high court and Congress noted, cable companies can 
exert a stranglehold over television broadcasters because most of them now 
reach households via cable. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1992 law, Congress reacted to a growing volume of consumer complaints 
about rising rates and spotty service from cable companies. The Federal 
Communications Commission was given new authority to regulate the rates charged 
to customers and it recently ordered many cable firms to roll back their 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the cable industry have contested those regulations as well and 
that case had been put on hold in a lower court pending the outcome in the 
Supreme Court of the challenge to the must-carry rules. Monday's decision 
suggests that the rate regulations will be upheld, at least against challenges 
that they are unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 The case decided Monday grew out of the separate concern that cable operators 
might try to kill off local broadcast stations that compete with them for 
advertising dollars. In an instant, these over-the-air stations could lose a 
majority of their viewers if a cable company dropped their signals. 
Particularly vulnerable are smaller, independent stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the must-carry rules, a cable operator could "silence the voice of 
competing speakers with a mere flick of the switch," Kennedy wrote. Even in 
cities where one newspaper enjoys a monopoly, the paper "does not possess the 
power to obstruct readers' access to other competing publications," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's opinion puts cable television somewhere between traditional 
broadcasting and newspapers in the hierarchy of First Amendment rights. 
Broadcasters have been regulated for decades on grounds that they are permitted 
to use the scarce television spectrum to send their signals. Even the content 
of traditional TV programming can be regulated -- for example, to protect 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers sit at the other extreme. The court has struck down virtually all 
attempts to regulate papers, including a 1974 ruling that said Florida 
lawmakers cannot force newspapers to offer a right-of-reply to candidates who 
were castigated in the news or editorial columns. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable TV is entitled to something in between the strict free-speech protection 
afforded newspapers and the lax standard applied to the broadcast industry, 
Kennedy said. In perhaps his most significant conclusion, he said the 
must-carry rules are "content-neutral" regulations. As such, they do not 
violate the First Amendment, he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the justices strike down laws or regulations that regulate a 
message or the content of a publication. For example, laws against flag burning 
were struck down because they were said to punish a message of contempt for the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But other laws restricting free speech have been upheld if they do not favor 
one message over another. For example, the court has upheld a 100-foot buffer 
zone around polling places because all candidates and their partisans are 
equally forbidden from campaigning there. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's opinion upholding the regulations as content neutral was joined by 
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul 
Stevens and David H. Souter. They agreed to send the case back to a three-judge 
panel to gather more information on whether all broadcasters are "in genuine 
jeopardy" and whether the regulations go no further than necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 In dissent, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said that the rules should be struck 
down because they tell cable companies what they must say. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Cable Television Assn. said it was disappointed that "cable 
networks will continue to be second-class citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Broadcasters said it found "much reason for optimism" in 
the court's opinion. "We appear to be batting 2 for 2, with one major portion 
yet to be decided," said NAB President Edward O. Fritts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the Media Access Project, a public interest group, applauded the 
decision as a victory for consumers. "We're particularly pleased that the 
justices recognize the importance of preserving free, over-the-air TV for the 
40% of Americans who can't afford, or choose not to buy, cable," said Andrew 
Jay Schwartzman, the group's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, the court in a Los Angeles case let stand a ruling 
barring cities from absolutely barring a second cable operator from competing 
in the same area as an established firm. Without comment, the justices refused 
to hear an appeal in the case (Los Angeles vs. Preferred Communications, 
93-1759).

PANETTA NAMED CHIEF OF STAFF IN MAJOR WHITE HOUSE SHAKE-UP; PRESIDENCY: 
CLINTON'S FRIEND MCLARTY WILL STEP ASIDE AND BECOME THE COUNSELOR TO THE 
PRESIDENT. GERGEN WILL MOVE TO STATE DEPT. AND RIVLIN WILL BE BUDGET DIRECTOR 
IN EFFORT TO ADD 'STRENGTH, VITALITY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton appointed Budget Director Leon E. Panetta as his new chief 
of staff Monday in a major shake-up aimed at strengthening a beleaguered White 
House as it enters the climactic struggle over what the President called his 
"daunting agenda" -- including health care reform, crime and trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta, an outspoken Washington insider and former California congressman, 
replaces Clinton boyhood friend Thomas (Mack) McLarty, a mild-mannered, 
soft-spoken Arkansan who has been widely criticized as too "nice" and 
inexperienced to run an often-divided White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton named McLarty counselor to the President, a position that keeps him in 
the White House but without the chain-of-command responsibilities of his old 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, David Gergen was removed from his White House communications 
post and named counselor to the State Department, and Panetta's deputy, Alice 
Rivlin, was chosen to take over as director of the White House Office of 
Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the moves would add "strength and vitality" to the White House, 
which members of Congress from both parties -- as well as some Administration 
officials and outside experts -- have criticized as unfocused, undisciplined 
and prone to putting out mixed signals on critical policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats in Congress said they believe Panetta will move quickly to address 
those problems. More important, they said, as the struggle over health care and 
other issues enters the decisive phase, he will bring to his new job an 
understanding of Congress that comes from the hands-on experience of 
shepherding difficult measures through the legislative meat grinder. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of that will matter, they agreed, unless the President himself 
dramatically changes what they see as his undisciplined approach to 
decision-making and management. 
</P>
<P>
 On the record, the bluntest assessment of Clinton's underlying problem came 
from Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento), chairman of the Democratic 
Congressional Campaign Committee in charge of his party's strategy for the 1994 
midterm elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's problems, said Fazio, voicing an opinion shared by many Democrats, 
are "the need to bring issue debates to closure," his failure to meet deadlines 
for policy formulation and "the need to get out of the crisis-management mode." 
</P>
<P>
 One committee chairman, speaking on condition that he not be identified, 
complained that he has had to go to too many meetings, involving too many 
people, who talk too much and with too little focus. "They were too indecisive. 
They never gave McLarty the authority he needed," the lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believes only Clinton can fix the problem. "That's a very important 
point," he said. "Until the President can improve his management style, it will 
be very hard for anybody to do a good job running the operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Clinton, Panetta is a consensus builder who thrives on policy work. 
Whether he will be able to impose more discipline in the face of the 
President's own approach to management remains to be seen. But, unlike McLarty, 
Panetta can be blunt-spoken and does not shrink from criticizing White House 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In April of last year, he stunned Clinton and his top staff by going public 
with a bleak assessment of the President's congressional agenda, declaring that 
it was jeopardized by internal problems at the White House, including the 
President's failure to determine priorities. The assessment was widely shared 
by Democrats in Congress, but such candor from a senior official is almost 
unheard of in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta, who will remain at the budget office for two more weeks, indicated 
that he would move aggressively in taking control of White House operations. "I 
will want to bring in some of my own people," he said Monday night on CNN's 
"Lary King Live." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he might replace White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers, he did 
not dispute the possibility. His two closest advisers at the budget office, 
both of whom he brought from his congressional staff, are Barry Toiv, his press 
secretary, and John Angell, his top personal aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, flanked by the principals as he announced the personnel changes at a 
brief Oval Office news conference, said McLarty had approached him more than a 
month ago about "better deployment" of the White House staff and had 
recommended that Panetta replace him as chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The President said he, McLarty, Vice President Al Gore and several others had 
discussed McLarty's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 McLarty said, however, that he and Clinton first began discussing White House 
staff problems several months ago. The discussions, he said, got more serious 
just before the President left for the June 6 D-day anniversary ceremonies in 
Normandy, when McLarty offered the specific suggestion that Panetta replace him 
and that he take on the role of counselor to the President. 
</P>
<P>
 McLarty then talked with Panetta, who liked the idea. After returning from 
Europe, Clinton gave the green light for the personnel changes, White House 
sources said. Panetta and Clinton met to discuss it Saturday and also conferred 
with Gore, who was said to have played a major role in the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving McLarty to the counselor's job posed an awkward problem for the White 
House because Gergen had given no indication that he would relinquish the post 
until the end of the year, when he plans to return to private life. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Gergen was consulted, according to one source, he said he would be 
glad to leave immediately. Clinton persuaded him to remain as a foreign affairs 
adviser, suggesting an expanded role at the State Department, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore then telephoned Secretary of State Warren Christopher and told him that 
Gergen was leaving the White House. Christopher said he would be glad to have 
him as a top adviser, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen, who served in three Republican administrations before joining the 
Clinton White House last summer, increasingly had been involved in foreign 
affairs. He will remain a senior foreign affairs adviser to Clinton and will 
have offices in both the White House and State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta and McLarty met with the President at the White House Sunday when it 
was decided to announce the changes Monday before they were leaked to the news 
media. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned moves, however, had been so closely held that the announcement 
caught even some of Clinton's close advisers by surprise. "Gee, I was just on 
my way to a meeting Leon was supposed to be at," said one senior Clinton aide 
only moments before the announcement. "I guess he'll be late." 
</P>
<P>
 McLarty, in an interview, said he will become more of a personal adviser to 
Clinton, much like he had been during the transition after Clinton's election. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President," he said, "had voiced the feeling that the sort of more 
informal, less structured time in which he had long discussions with me had not 
become as easy as in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, "we talked about the various outreach efforts I had 
become involved in," most notably representing Clinton to the business 
community and to conservatives on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 His new role is an obvious step down from chief of staff, but McLarty insisted 
that it has "real meaning and substance to it." 
</P>
<P>
 While Panetta has "a different style," he will "continue many of the things 
we've been doing," McLarty said. "Particularly because this is an election 
year, it will be immensely helpful that he's been an elected congressman." 
</P>
<P>
 Though never elected to public office, Clinton's new choice for the sensitive 
position of budget director is a seasoned Washington operator who commands 
respect on both sides of the aisle in Congress. Rivlin, 63, served in the 
Department of Health and Human Services in the Lyndon B. Johnson Administration 
but made her reputation as a strong and independent economic analyst as the 
founding director of the Congressional Budget Office. 
</P>
<P>
 There she tangled with powerful committee chairmen and presidents over 
economic policy but earned widespread respect as an economist who would not 
tailor her assessments to suit the political market. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Panetta, she is known within the Administration as a fierce "deficit 
hawk" who believes that controlling federal spending is a prerequisite to 
healthy economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Her transition to the top job at the budget office is expected to be smooth. 
The first woman to head the office, she has worked there for 18 months. And she 
is accustomed to running a sizable bureaucracy from her days on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Although rumors of White House changes have circulated in Washington for 
months, members of Congress were surprised. An aide to House Speaker Thomas S. 
Foley (D-Wash.) said the Speaker had no warning. Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.), 
who had dinner with McLarty Friday night, said McLarty gave him no indication 
of any coming changes.

THE TIMES POLL; WIDE MAJORITY OF PUBLIC BACKS LAPD PAY RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A wide majority of Los Angeles residents approves of the pay raise that was 
ratified by the police union last week -- a vote of confidence that apparently 
reflects the public's increasingly positive view of the long-embattled force, 
the Los Angeles Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three-quarters of those surveyed said they back the pay hike for 
officers, which could amount to as much as 12% over 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 But much of the support for the raise is conditional. The survey found that 
approval of the package slips to 46% when the public is confronted with the 
possibility, predicted by some city officials, that the raises will cut into a 
plan to put more officers on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll, directed by John Brennan, interviewed 1,023 residents of the 
city of Los Angeles on Saturday and Sunday. The margin of sampling error for 
the entire survey is plus or minus four percentage points and somewhat higher 
for some subgroups. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey brought mostly good news for police officers, who often say they 
feel overburdened and unappreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of the city's residents approve of the way the Police Department is 
handling its duties and clear majorities of blacks and Latinos share a positive 
view of the force, despite the widespread belief in those groups that the force 
is still prone to racism and brutality. Police Chief Willie L. Williams 
maintained his strong positive image, winning the approval of nearly 
three-quarters of the citizens. And despite continuing unease about crime 
across the city, most people have a favorable impression of the LAPD's efforts 
to suppress crime and reach out to citizens in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are in a life-threatening job. They are out there every night putting 
their lives on the line," said Marilyn Roland of Venice, who supports the pay 
raise. "I feel that something else could be cut to pay for this. . . . I think 
it will improve morale and maybe get new recruits to apply for the job." 
</P>
<P>
 "They are in a war zone," said Karen Harris, who lives in South-Central Los 
Angeles and supports the pay raise. "They don't get many decent weapons; they 
might as well give them some more money. It might make them a little more 
enthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
 For several months, the police pay raise has been the preoccupation of many 
officers and much of city government. The Police Protective League, which 
represents about 7,500 officers through the rank of lieutenant, has argued that 
officers are leaving the LAPD in droves as the department's pay slips behind 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Research has shown that Los Angeles officers are paid less than their 
counterparts in most of the state's other big cities -- a disparity that has 
grown sharper in the two years police have gone without pay increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past several months, the police union used increasingly aggressive 
tactics in an attempt to win a larger raise from the city -- beginning with a 
march on City Hall and moving on to a mass sickout by officers and a threat to 
release embarrassing information about Mayor Richard Riordan and City Council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute has been brought to the verge of settlement by a deal that would 
give police a base raise of 7% over the next 18 months. In addition, officers 
would receive a $1,500 bonus that some officials said is designed to make up 
for the two years they went without a pay raise. Patrol officers would receive 
an additional 1% this year and next as an incentive to keep working the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The police officers union announced Monday that the package had been approved 
and now awaits the approval of the City Council to take effect. That vote is 
scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 When the package was described to those surveyed by The Times, 74% said they 
supported it, 20% said they were opposed and the rest said they did not have a 
position. Whites were particularly supportive of the package, with 81% 
approving, but it was also backed by 70% of African Americans and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Several City Council members and other city officials have argued that the 
police raises will cost $15 million more than has been set aside in the 
municipal budget and take away overtime funds that would put the equivalent of 
several hundred more police on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with this scenario, Angelenos were split on the pay raise, with 46% 
in favor and 43% opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Police Protective League and City Council members have spent much of 
their time during the contract dispute impugning each other's tactics and 
motives, but neither side has scored a decisive victory in this war of words. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a third of those responding to the poll said the city acted unfairly 
during negotiations. While a bare majority objected to the Police Protective 
League's sickouts, a sizable number of respondents said they were justified. 
Only 2% of those disapproving of the raise cited the so-called "blue flu" as 
the reason for their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll results were part of a generally improving public attitude toward 
police officers in the city, whose approval rating hit bottom in the spring of 
1991, shortly after the internationally televised beating of Rodney G. King. At 
that point, just 34% of Los Angeles residents approved of the Police 
Department's job performance. 
</P>
<P>
 By last weekend that approval rating had nearly doubled to 67%, a post-King 
beating high, but still lagging behind the nearly three-quarters of residents 
who approved of the department in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Whites (75%), Latinos (64%) and blacks (61%) all said they now approve of the 
LAPD. That view represented a particularly dramatic increase in support from 
Latinos, fewer than half of whom said they approved of the LAPD in a survey 
late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, majorities in every part of the city -- the Westside, San Fernando 
Valley, central and southern regions -- said they approve of the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 The downside for the LAPD is that much of the public still suspects officers 
of harboring racist or brutal attitudes, but even those perceptions of the 
department have been somewhat muted. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since the King beating, The Times Poll found that less than 
a majority, 49%, consider police brutality "common." That compares to the 
approximately two-thirds of Angelenos who expressed that opinion in several 
surveys after the infamous videotaped King beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion on the question of brutality, though, varies widely depending on the 
ethnicity of those questioned. Nearly three of four African Americans surveyed 
continue to believe that brutality is common, compared to less than half of 
whites. Just over half of Latinos believe that incidents of brutality involving 
the LAPD are common, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 The same pattern held true when residents were questioned about racism, with 
blacks (79%) most likely to feel that racist feelings are common among 
officers, whites (50%) least likely to have that opinion and Latinos (66%) in 
the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonah Carolina, 31, of South-Central expressed the mixed feelings of many in 
the black community, who said they approve of the Police Department but still 
are concerned about racism and brutality within the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had encounters with them when I personally detected some sort of 
racism," Carolina said. "On the other hand, there are some (police) who are 
legit and try to do things by the book. If they are right, I am behind them 
100%." 
</P>
<P>
 More than two-thirds of the city's residents said they approve of police 
efforts to hold down crime and 61% said they approve of efforts to reach out to 
their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite those efforts, only about half of the people in the city said they 
feel safe in their communities. That compares to more than 80% of Americans 
nationwide who feel safe in their hometowns, according to a Times survey 
conducted in January. 
</P>
<P>
 In other results, the poll found: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sharp division on the question of whether King received a large enough 
judgment from the city of Los Angeles for his 1991 beating. Forty-four percent 
said the $3.8 million award was too large, while 31% said it was adequate and 
19% said it was not high enough. Blacks were particularly inclined to feel that 
the payment to King should be larger, with 48% favoring a higher award and 38% 
saying it was adequate. Whites were split 56% in favor of a smaller award to 
32% saying it was adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of Angelenos also agreed with the judge and jury in the case that 
King should not receive punitive damages from either the four officers accused 
of beating him, or from former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Disagreement with a position by the American Civil Liberties Union, and 
others, that it is important for LAPD officers to live in Los Angeles to be 
more attuned to the city and its problems. A clear majority of 57% said it is 
not important for officers to live in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fifty percent of respondents oppose the reinstatement of Theodore J. 
Briseno, who was fired after the King beating. He was cleared of criminal 
charges in the beating but was found by a police disciplinary board to have 
acted improperly when he kicked King. Nearly two out of five favored his 
reinstatement. How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,023 adult residents of the city of Los Angeles, 
by telephone, Saturday and Sunday. Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of 
all exchanges in the city. Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that 
listed and non-listed numbers could be contacted. Interviewing was conducted in 
English and Spanish. The sample was weighted slightly to conform with census 
figures for sex, race, age and education. The margin of sampling error for the 
total sample is plus or minus 4 percentage points. For certain other subgroups 
the error margin may be somewhat higher. Poll results can also be affected by 
other factors such as question wording and the order in which questions are 
presented. THE TIME POLL: LAPD Approval Rating 
</P>
<P>
 Approval of the Los Angeles Police Department is the highest since the beating 
of Rodney G. King. Most people approve of the proposed pay increase for 
officers, but would balk at the hike if it means fewer extra officers would be 
hired.

handling its job?

DOLLAR TUMBLES TO A RECORD LOW, THEN RECOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The beleaguered U.S. dollar tumbled to another record low against the surging 
Japanese yen early Monday before edging upward and restoring calm to worldwide 
currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, even as stability returned to agitated markets later Monday and the stock 
market rallied, currency traders warned that the dollar's rough ride was not 
over, and a key Federal Reserve-watcher predicted a U.S. interest rate hike 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's dramatic tumble threatens nascent economic recoveries in Japan 
and Western Europe, economists said, raising expectations of new, concerted 
action to stabilize the world's volatile system of currencies. Indeed, the 
White House acknowledged Monday that the dollar's travails will be on the table 
when the world's seven leading industrial powers meet next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our view . . . that further appreciation of the mark and yen would be 
counter-productive for global recovery," said a senior U.S. Treasury Department 
official, who declined to be named, noting that America's major trading 
partners share the view. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average jumped up 48.56 points Monday, as investors 
responded to growing calm in the currency markets. The dollar closed at 100.45 
Japanese yen in New York trading, unchanged from Friday, and at 1.5835 German 
marks, down from 1.5840. 
</P>
<P>
 An alliance of 17 nations loaded up on dollars late last week in a failed bid 
to shore up the dollar, which has been battered by the perception of weak U.S. 
leadership, a rising trade deficit and prospects for faster growth overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 But anticipation that there could be a currency-stabilizing accord at the G-7 
meeting of industrial nations in Naples -- while speculative -- "is a reason 
the dollar stopped tumbling today," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at 
Chemical Banking Corp. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Currency traders cannot rule out that "there just might be some big move" to 
steady the dollar, yen and Western European currencies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way to bolster the dollar is to raise interest rates, making U.S. 
investments more attractive, even though some economists warn that such action 
could jeopardize an already slowing national recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a key Fed-watcher predicted that an interest rate hike was in store 
when the Fed's Open Market Committee meets next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Federal Reserve governor Wayne Angell, a noted inflation hawk, 
predicted the Fed would hike its discount rate -- the rate charged to member 
banks -- by half a percentage point. Now chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Co. 
in New York, Angell cited investors' fears of rising inflation as one of the 
reasons the dollar has slumped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it (the rate hike) coming as a result of a weak domestic dollar," 
Angell told Bloomberg Business News. 
</P>
<P>
 The international scope of the currency problem was most obvious Monday in 
Japan, where the rising yen looms as a major threat to a fledgling recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 A strengthening currency should push up prices for a nation's products, 
thereby cutting into exports, economic theory suggests. But when the yen rose 
against the dollar in the 1980s, Japanese producers rewrote the textbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than hike prices, they accepted the pain of lower profits in order to 
hold onto customers. They also cut costs and boosted productivity, but such 
strategies take time to implement and pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar lost more than 40% of its value against the yen in the late 1980s; 
This year alone, it has fallen about 10% against the yen and 9% against the 
German mark. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, at least, the stronger yen "is going to discourage new investment," 
predicts Michael J. Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America. "It's 
going to reduce bonus payments to workers. It's going to prevent rallies in 
their stock market." 
</P>
<P>
 Widely overlooked in the dollar's recent decline is the extremely selective 
nature of the currency slide. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. dollar actually has risen against the Canadian dollar and Mexican 
peso, its overall value increasing 15% from 1992, according to an analysis by 
Chemical Banking Corp. that factors in the relative amount of U.S. trade with 
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the spectacle of a dollar plunging against the powerful 
currencies of Japan and Germany carries great weight among international 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of how the dollar is looked at globally, it's never against Canada 
and Mexico," observed Robert A. White, senior vice president of Standard 
Chartered Bank, a London-based bank active in Asia and Africa. "The problems 
that are afflicting the dollar have not gone away." 
</P>
<P>
 These problems include perceptions of weak foreign policy leadership in the 
United States and an incoherent trade policy, economists said Monday. In 
addition, the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata reduces the 
likelihood of a trade agreement with the United States anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of all that, a rapidly growing U.S. trade deficit and expectations of 
faster economic growth overseas may be reflected in the dollar's weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 "A large amount of selling is coming from European investors, where the 
sentiment against the dollar is very negative," explained Bernard Garra, head 
currency trader at Ruesch International in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last year the Europeans invested a lot in the dollar because the 
environment in Europe was poorer. Now a lot of them are coming out of the 
dollar and into the deutsch mark because of the prospects of long-term growth 
in Germany." 
</P>
<P>
 Some also believe the Clinton Administration has not been persuasive in its 
declarations of support for the dollar -- reinforcing the view that U.S. 
officials see the decline as a useful way to put pressure on Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still don't have a unified, forceful statement on behalf of the dollar by 
the U.S. government," said Gary Schlossberg, an economist at Wells Fargo Bank 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 In Asian trading early Monday, the dollar sank through the symbolic floor of 
100 yen -- a floor that had held up for decades until recently -- prompting 
furious yet futile moves by the Bank of Japan to stabilize the greenback. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bank of Japan, intervening in the currency market, bought about $2 billion 
in a vain attempt to keep the dollar above 100 yen, Japanese media reported. 
The central bank does not officially disclose details of its currency 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the dollar closed at 99.93 yen in Tokyo trading. The dollar rebounded 
slightly early today, closing Tokyo's morning trading at 100.20 yen, up 0.27 
yen from Monday's close. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the dollar rose somewhat in European and North American trading to 
finish above its recent lows. Yet many traders are not convinced that 
countries, through their central banks, have the means or determination to 
withstand the force of private speculators, who can bet many billions of 
dollars on the direction of a currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders generally agreed that the test for the dollar is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trading community can't seem to get confident with the idea of the dollar 
going higher," said Glenn Cole, manager of Forex sales at Credit Suisse, New 
York.

POLICE ACCEPT $50-MILLION PACT OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police officers have overwhelmingly approved a $50-million 
contract proposal offered by city leaders, sending the deal to the City Council 
for consideration later this week, the union announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Protective League members approved the contract package 10 
to 1. In contrast to this 91% level of support, 75% of rank-and-file officers 
voted against the last contract proposal endorsed by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This contract dispute has been a longstanding burr in our saddle," said Gary 
Fullerton, a union director. "It's been hurting our morale. This is one big 
problem that may be out of our way." 
</P>
<P>
 The officers' ratification vote of 3,155 to 317, cast in a series of sessions 
last week, brings the two-year dispute closer to an agreement than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 The standoff has grown divisive at times and reached an impasse two weeks ago. 
Before the latest deal was struck, anxious city officials were bracing for a 
disruptive job action during the World Cup soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The city -- torn between budget constraints and a stated commitment to public 
safety -- started out in 1992 offering officers no pay increase. But city 
officials eventually came up with a $50-million package that includes a 7% pay 
increase, a 2% patrol incentive and a $1,500 cash bonus, the equivalent of a 
12% hike spread over 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract would increase the salary of a rookie officer 2% beginning July 1 
-- from $33,157 to about $33,820. The salary of a beginning lieutenant would 
increase from $61,658 to $62,891. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers' salaries would then increase another 2% on Jan. 1, 1995; another 
1.5% on July 1, 1995, and another 1.5% on Jan. 1, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, which applies only to the 7,400 LAPD officers ranked lieutenant 
and below, also includes $1,000 each in cash this year and another $500 next 
year. Patrol officers would receive an additional 1% raise this year and next, 
although that incentive would not become part of the officers' pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the deal is expected to be approved by the council, it may pass by a 
narrow margin. The council has delayed a vote until Wednesday to give 
Councilman Joel Wachs, an advocate of the deal who was out of town, time to 
return to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to pass, and I'm glad it's over with," council President 
John Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is strong opposition to the pact as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics have focused on the mechanics of how the deal came about. Instead 
of going through the city's formal negotiating committee, Mayor Richard 
Riordan, Councilman Richard Alatorre and others floated the deal to the union 
unofficially in a session at the Biltmore Hotel -- before the council had 
considered the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, contract offers win preliminary approval from the council first, 
then go to the membership for ratification. The full council always makes the 
final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The critics of the deal also contend that it is too costly, will drastically 
cut back the mayor's effort to beef up police patrols and is liable to stir up 
other city employees who are being offered lesser deals than police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an open letter to Riordan distributed Monday, Councilman Marvin Braude 
predicted dire financial consequences if the deal is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Mayor, we all hope and pray our city will become safer and that the 
economy will grow and generate more jobs," Braude wrote. "But what is the 
reality? There simply is no money for what you promise." 
</P>
<P>
 But Alatorre, who appeared with union leaders at the news conference Monday, 
called the deal "a fair contract (that) is not going to bankrupt the city of 
Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most controversial aspects of the plan is the $1,500 in cash, which 
the city is calling a "signing bonus" or "equipment bonus." 
</P>
<P>
 Other unions, however, regard that money as a backhanded way for the city to 
give officers retroactive pay -- as the officers have demanded -- for the two 
years they have worked without a contract. However, if the city called the cash 
bonus "retroactive pay," hundreds of other city employees would be legally 
entitled to it as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the scenes, council members have been working out an agreement to give 
other unions some sort of bonus as a sign of good faith. That proposal is 
expected to be made before Wednesday's council vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fairness -- plain and simple," said Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the proposal approved by the Police Protective League has prompted 
other unions -- such as those representing firefighters and police officers 
ranked captain and above -- to push for a comparable deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're outraged," said Julie Butcher, a spokeswoman for Local 347 of the 
Service Employees International Union, which represents 5,500 blue-collar 
workers. "We think we do essential jobs as well. Police officers are absolutely 
essential, but picking up garbage is essential too." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the blue-collar workers settled on a four-year contract 
with no salary increases at all. There is a proviso, however, that allows that 
union to reopen the contract next year. 
</P>
<P>
 While not faulting police officers for the deal they received, Butcher blamed 
the city for misleading other unions and said the police deal may prompt other 
bargaining units to use some of the same aggressive tactics that officers 
employed -- erecting billboards critical of the city and staging high-profile 
job slowdowns, sickouts and protests. 
</P>

 "It looks like in-your-face labor negotiations are how we're all going to have 
to operate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, the council's budget expert, said he intends to 
vote against the deal for precisely that reason. He especially condemned a 
recent threat by union leaders to release embarrassing personal information 
about city leaders if they did not support a sufficient contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tactics that were used by the Police Protective League were 
unprecedented," said Yaroslavsky, who leaves the council in the fall to join 
the County Board of Supervisors. "But they will set a precedent for the future. 
The word on the street now is if you want to get your way, you embarrass the 
city."

CLINTON MAKES FIRST FORMAL DENIAL OF SEX SUIT CHARGES; COURTS: PRESIDENT ASKS 
IMMUNITY FROM LITIGATION. WHITE HOUSE TO ANNOUNCE CREATION OF LEGAL DEFENSE 
FUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton, in his first formal response to a sexual harassment lawsuit 
brought by former Arkansas employee Paula Corbin Jones, denied the charges 
Monday and asserted that he ought to be immune from such litigation while 
serving in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 In a legal memorandum filed on Clinton's behalf with U.S. District Court in 
Little Rock, Ark., Washington attorney Robert S. Bennett pointed to what he 
said are legal flaws in Jones' suit, which are likely to be the basis of 
Clinton's defense, if the courts reject his assertion of presidential immunity. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, sources said that the White House will announce 
today creation of a legal defense fund for the President. The Clintons face 
potentially huge legal costs in the Jones case and in the investigation of 
events related to Whitewater Development Corp., an Arkansas real estate venture 
in which the Clintons were partners. Clinton has authorized the fund to collect 
donations of as much as $1,000 from individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the court filing in Little Rock, Bennett said Jones has not established 
that her alleged 1991 encounter with then-Gov. Clinton in a Little Rock hotel 
room had any impact on her status as a state employee. In addition, he said, 
she has failed to show that she was defamed by Clinton's denial of her story. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Clinton vigorously denies the allegations and would further submit 
that they are insufficient to state a claim of wrongdoing by him," the 
memorandum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' lawyer, Gilbert K. Davis, who has 10 days to reply formally to 
Bennett's memorandum, said that he will challenge both Clinton's contention 
that the President is immune from civil litigation and Bennett's request that 
the courts rule first on the issue of presidential immunity before proceeding 
with other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The occupant of the White House is not above the rest of us when it comes to 
acts committed outside of his office," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, in her May 6 suit, alleges that she was denied suitable raises as an 
employee of the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission. She also maintains 
that she later was defamed publicly by White House aides because she rejected 
Clinton's alleged request for oral sex when, she said, she met with him in a 
hotel room in May, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright rules on Clinton's 
assertion of presidential immunity, the issue is likely to delay any hearing of 
the case for many months, if not years. Both sides have indicated that they 
intend to dispute the immunity issue all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett's memorandum was devoted primarily to persuading Wright that she 
should not hear arguments on any other issues in the case without first 
resolving the question of whether Clinton is immune from civil litigation 
during his tenure as President. 
</P>
<P>
 If his point of view prevails, the President could avoid answering embarassing 
questions that are certain to be posed by Jones' lawyers about his alleged 
sexual behavior -- at least as long as the appeals process drags on. Davis 
predicted that the appeals process would take four to six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett indicated that Clinton's argument for immunity is based largely on a 
1982 Supreme Court decision in a case involving the late President Richard 
Nixon. In that case, the court ruled that a President is immune from being sued 
for any official acts. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of that case, Bennett argued, Jones should not be permitted to sue 
Clinton until he has left office. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jones' response, according to Davis, her lawyers will argue that the 
Supreme Court bestowed immunity on the office of the President, but did not 
give immunity to the President for personal acts committed outside of his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett offered a preview of his other arguments for dismissal of the suit in 
an extended footnote to his memorandum. 
</P>
<P>
 The footnote cited these additional reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The plaintiff's failure to allege facts to show the President caused her to 
be discriminated against on the basis of her sex. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The legal insufficiency of the allegations to make out a claim of quid pro 
quo or hostile environment sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The fact that the plaintiff sat on her rights and did not file her 
complaint in a timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The failure of the allegations to satisfy the standard under Arkansas law 
to make out a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 * "And the fact that her defamation claim rests solely on allegations that 
President Clinton, through agents, denied the substance of the allegations in 
this lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton aides anticipate that legal bills from the Jones case and the 
Whitewater inquiry will exceed $1 million, far beyond the relatively modest 
means of the Clintons. Sources said that the defense fund will be administered 
outside the White House and that it would not accept contributions from 
political action committees, labor unions or interest groups. The names of all 
donors would be publicly disclosed, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' lawyers and conservative groups already have created the Paula Jones 
Legal Defense Fund to cover Jones' legal fees.

COLUMN ONE; NOBLE TRY TO RECLAIM HERITAGE; THE CZECH REPUBLIC IS REVIVING 
ARISTOCRATS' OLD DREAMS BY RETURNING CASTLES, LAND SEIZED BY THE COMMUNISTS. 
FORTUNES AND TITLES HAVE FADED, BUT THE CHANCE TO RESTORE FAMILY HONOR STILL 
SHINES.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Count Joseph Kinsky stands tall beside the weathered gables of his family's 
Georgian-style castle. Forty years under communism, including a jail term and 
labor in the uranium mines, did little to diminish his noble demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 The castle, on the other hand, is a wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 Seized by the government when Communists took control in 1948, the 27-room 
chateau was used for pig breeding, then left to rot. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it belongs again to Kinsky, who at 80 faces the enormous task of restoring 
it to its original splendor -- but without a vast family fortune to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "My relation to that castle is clearly emotional -- it was my home," Kinsky 
said. "If anyone tells me they envy me because I am rich now, I can only say 
I've got things to spend money on." 
</P>
<P>
 Since revolutions brought down Communist governments in Eastern Europe five 
years ago, many nobles have sought the return of confiscated land and castles. 
But only the Czech Republic is readily handing them back. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsky is one of dozens of aristocrats reclaiming the castles and palaces, 
factories, forests and farmlands seized by a regime that was determined to do 
away with the upper class. 
</P>
<P>
 The current government is able to return vast landholdings with little protest 
from a public raised on socialism because restitution is limited to properties 
confiscated after the Communist putsch in 1948 and is made only to citizens who 
live in the republic. The law excludes so-called traitors among the gentry -- 
those who opted for German citizenship after Hitler's occupation of 
Czechoslovakia in 1938 -- while recognizing those seen as patriots for 
retaining their Czech nationality. 
</P>
<P>
 This, and the fact that the nobles are not seeking political power along with 
their old wealth, has made restitution palatable to Czechs, not all of whom 
have profited from the country's return to capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Property claims have met varied fates elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Hungary is offering compensation coupons to former property owners, including 
nobles, that can be used to buy back businesses, land or even castles at 
favorable prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Poland allows former owners to sue in court if they believe that the 
confiscations were illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 The German government is bound by its unification treaty not to return 
property confiscated during the postwar land reform in East Germany. A law that 
would allow former owners to buy back part of those properties at subsidized 
prices is under discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania has yet to decide how it will resolve the land issue, and in Russia, 
some nobility have hinted they might like their estates back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Czech Republic passed its reclamation laws in 1990 and 1991 -- when it was 
still Czechoslovakia. In what is now Slovakia, as in the Baltic states, most of 
the nobility was foreign and therefore ineligible for restitution or 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who seek restitution must present proof of prior ownership to the 
government agency that owns the property -- usually the municipality, in the 
case of castles -- and a denial may be appealed in court. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 castles have been returned and 75 applications have been denied 
because the former owners allegedly were Nazi collaborators, according to the 
Czech Press Agency. About 100 requests are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they fled their homeland or stayed in the country as Kinsky did, most 
aristocratic Czech families have lost their once-great fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 The return of their estates makes them land-rich again, but many remain 
cash-poor. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the castles being dilapidated, the thousands of acres being 
returned are in need of reforesting or farming investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsky, whose nobility dates to the 13th Century, estimates that it will cost 
about $7 million to restore his Kostelec nad Orlici castle, about 75 miles east 
of Prague, and convert it into a family memorial, a public museum with the 
Kinsky art collection and heirlooms rescued from storage or other museums. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a ruin. And as I have lived 40 years in socialism, I haven't got the 
millions. I am hoping that someone will give them to me," Kinsky said with a 
genteel smile. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nazis had been the first to confiscate the castle, in 1939, and Kinsky's 
family moved then to Prague, where his Viennese mother took Czech citizenship 
in solidarity with his father. 
</P>
<P>
 The castle was returned, then appropriated by the Communists, who allowed 
Kinsky's parents to live in two rooms until 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsky's siblings had left the country, but he and his wife remained behind to 
care for his aging parents. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1949, Kinsky was jailed for two years as a class enemy and put to 
work in uranium mines, where he labored for five years. He subsequently worked 
in translating jobs, a lacquer factory and, finally, in a state-run insurance 
company until retiring in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kinsky sought the return of his family properties in 1992, his wife 
protested that she wasn't about to wash the castle's 70 windows twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the government hastened to give back the decrepit building, and the 
Kinskys moved into the former servant quarters last year. 
</P>
<P>
 They also have received nearly 5,000 acres of forest lands and are negotiating 
with the government for the return of more than 800 acres of farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsky and other aristocrats seem to regard their castles in much the same way 
as priests do their churches: The castles preceded them by centuries and will 
outlive them; the nobles are not so much owners of private property as 
administrators of an estate that is to be passed on to subsequent generations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nearby town of Castolovice, workers pound on the roof of a Renaissance 
castle with the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Sternberg Phipps, whose family bought the estate in 1694, struggles for 
words to describe why she returned to the Czech Republic to undertake its 
renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 "(It is) for my family, for history," said Phipps, a countess by birth whose 
family fled to the United States in 1948. "There is something to the fact that 
the family has been here since 1200, in this house since the 1600s." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, records of the family's eight-pointed star crest have been traced 
back as far as 1130. 
</P>
<P>
 Castolovice was built a couple of centuries later and eventually bought by the 
Counts Sternberg to be the seat of the head of the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Kinsky's, the Sternberg castle was confiscated during the Nazi 
occupation. It was returned after World War II, and the family lived there 
before emigrating. 
</P>
<P>
 The castle was a museum and trade school under the Communists and, although it 
is in far better shape than Kinsky's, requires a tremendous amount of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Phipps, a decorator during her years in the United States and England and 
author of the book "Affordable Splendor," is paying for the renovation herself 
but throws up her hands when asked the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 She is improving the museum, installing two restaurants and converting 15 
bedrooms and baths into a guest house to be rented out to conference groups and 
hunting parties to pay for the castle's maintenance. Some rooms will be 
renovated as family quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Castolovice's paintings depict the bygone aristocracy's shooting parties, at 
which hundreds of fowl, deer and wild boar were brought in. 
</P>
<P>
 At nearby Doudleby nad Orlici, also recently returned to its owner, a hallway 
is filled with antler trophies bearing the dates and names of the noble 
shooters. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Czech nobles today dismiss the label of aristocrat, noting that royal 
courts were abolished by the government of the first Czech Republic after World 
War I, and princes and counts became simply "misters." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are no aristocrats. We are the descendants of aristocratic families," 
Kinsky insisted. "Titles are for snobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Phipps notes that she lost her title by marrying a commoner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never impressed with titles," said 97-year-old Jindrich Kolowrat, a 
count by birth. "A lot of aristocrats resent that titles were abolished, like 
somebody stole something from them. But the aristocracy made a lot of historic 
blunders. Only a few families really were always faithful. Even we were not 
always. Some (Kolowrats) allied with the Germans of the Austro-Hungarian 
Empire." 
</P>
<P>
 Kolowrat sits in a winged-back armchair in the living room of the home he 
built long ago on a hill overlooking Prague. The house was taken by an SS 
officer during the Nazi occupation and by the Interior Ministry during 
Communist times as a hotel for spies who came in from Czech embassies around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The count lived out the Communist years in the United States as a successful 
businessman, first with a dairy farm and, later, fitness centers. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to the Czech Republic in his 90s because, he said, "we've been 
here for 800 years. I had no historical connection to America." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his house, his family has retrieved forest land, commercial property 
and two castles, one in downtown Prague that is rented to the National Theater 
for the next 20 years -- for one Czech crown (about 4 cents) per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kolowrats have a noble name and more money than most Czechs. They are 
aristocratically vague about how much land they have reclaimed; one does not 
discuss money in polite society. But also they are careful not to stir what 
they believe are undercurrents of resentment among Czechs who have not fared so 
well under capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The nobles note that some people still dislike the new market economics and 
suspect that anyone with money must have come by it illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Milan Uhde, president of the Czech Parliament, said that the government has a 
policy of restitution and that "the return of property to nobility should be 
judged in the same way as the return of property to anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Generally it is, except when Czechs feel that nobles are receiving special 
treatment -- such as a wink on the residency requirement -- or when they 
suspect a property owner of having been a Nazi collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Communist Party newspaper Rude Pravo charged recently that about 
200 people had relied on "influential members of government" to get back their 
Czech citizenship so that they could seek the return of their properties. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper alleged that some of those were "gray cases," former Nazi 
collaborators who should not be accepted back. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, say Czechs such as 68-year-old economist Miroslav Kuhn, "noblemen 
are people too." 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe all that was stolen should be returned," said 62-year-old Anezka 
Smutna, a retiree. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the aristocrats do not possess the official titles or riches of their 
ancestors, most Czechs know who the nobles are and frequently address them as 
count or countess. 
</P>
<P>
 Many also expect nobility to act like nobility -- a surprise to the generation 
that left very young and returned after decades abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "They see me walking through our buildings with a light bulb or screwdriver 
and say, 'Count, you're not supposed to be doing that,' " said Kolowrat's 
51-year-old son, Tomas. "They have no idea what it meant for my father to start 
over in America. Everyone has expectations of how a count should behave. But we 
are American. You are what you make of yourself, not what you inherit." 
</P>
<P>
 With the titles also comes pressure to live up to the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomas Kolowrat points to 18th-Century family portraits hanging over Interior 
Ministry furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at them," he said. "Look at the people and what they achieved. They are 
historical characters." 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Bubna-Litic, also born a count, was broke and anonymous when he emigrated 
to Australia in the early 1950s. After a childhood in the Doudleby castle amid 
Renaissance graffito designs and Baroque stone muses, Bubna worked in a factory 
and drove a bus before becoming a teacher and, eventually, a principal. 
</P>
<P>
 He got Doudleby back a year ago and is working on several projects that he 
hopes will make the Doudleby self-supporting. 
</P>
<P>
 He says an aristocrat's life is under constant scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a certain obligation," Bubna said. "I must always appear as an 
honest, straight citizen helpful to others. The problem is, at the moment I 
have to help myself. Already there have been certain requests that are quite 
unrealistic. They think because I have a title I am made of money." 
</P>
<P>
 The nobles say they are not only too poor but also too busy to re-create the 
aristocratic society and lifestyle of their forebears. They are looking forward 
rather than back, looking to the future of their lands and castles and family 
memorials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took the castle and all the work on my shoulders," Kinsky said. "I'm 80 and 
have not many years in prospect. But I want to keep on that cultural object 
that was built up by my family."

EX-WIFE'S FATHER RAISES DOUBT ON SIMPSON ALIBI; COURT: HE SETS PHONE CALL 
EARLIER THAN CORONER DID. PROSECUTORS ALSO FACE HURDLE -- THEY LACK MURDER 
WEAPON. 
</P>

 As prosecutors and defense attorneys prepare for the first public airing of 
evidence in the O.J. Simpson case, both have potential problems: Prosecutors 
have yet to discover the whereabouts of the murder weapon, while the father of 
one of the victims emerged Monday to challenge an element of Simpson's alibi. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times, Louis Brown said that on the day of her death, 
his daughter, Nicole Brown Simpson, had spoken with her mother about 10 p.m., 
not 11 p.m. as a coroner's report on the murder scene indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure is important because Simpson's attorneys argue that he was home 
at 11 p.m., waiting for a limousine to take him to the airport. If Nicole 
Simpson was alive at that time, it would support Simpson's alibi. 
</P>
<P>
 That contention was bolstered when by a coroner's report stating that Nicole 
Simpson had spoken to her mother by phone about 11 p.m. Simpson attorney F. Lee 
Bailey was quick Monday to cite the report as evidence of his client's 
innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned today from the coroner's report that Nicole's mother talked with 
her at 11 and he lives 10 minutes away," Bailey said. "So, now you begin to 
have a problem saying that he was at the scene or could have been. . . . That 
is the defense: He was elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nicole Simpson's father disputed the coroner's reported findings Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her mother called her to talk about her reading glasses that had been left 
behind there," Brown, 70, said. He said he was certain that the call was made 
about 10 p.m., not the later time specified in the coroner's report. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, sources said Monday that prosecutors are headed for court with 
matching gloves found at the scene and at Simpson's home, with blood samples 
and potentially significant hair samples and with other evidence. But they have 
not found the weapon used in the June 12 killings, which could raise some 
problems for them, if not at this week's preliminary hearing, then possibly at 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources say police believe that the assailant wielded a knife 
under 15 inches long, very sharp on at least one side, possibly with 
serrations. Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti has described it as a "very substantial 
knife," big enough to have slit Nicole Simpson's throat and wielded by a person 
angry enough to have stabbed Ronald Lyle Goldman nearly two dozen times in his 
neck, back, head, hands and thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 But while they have been able to describe the knife from the wounds that it 
inflicted, investigators still do not know its whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 They have searched a vacant lot in Chicago, using metal detectors and dogs in 
a so-far futile hunt. Last week, they called it off, but Los Angeles Police 
Detective Bert Luper, who was supervising the search, said he is convinced that 
the weapon is in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Timing and corroborating evidence" suggest that the weapon is there, Luper 
said, adding that police concentrated on the lot near Simpson's Chicago hotel 
because "it's one of only a few places where he would have had time to dispose 
of anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Other sources say police have speculated that the weapon was stuffed into 
Simpson's golf bag and checked onto the flight that he took from Los Angeles to 
Chicago shortly after the slayings. According to those sources, police 
suspected this because Simpson took his golf clubs with him to Chicago and 
because they do not believe that he had time to dispose of a weapon before 
being driven to Los Angeles International Airport on the night of the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are now in possession of the golf bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson also was carrying a duffel bag. But sources say he carried it with him 
on the plane and therefore would have had to pass through an airport metal 
detector or X-ray machine with it. Police have interviewed airport workers who 
operate those machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The search for the weapon in Chicago may have been compromised by an apparent 
lapse in ensuring that the area was sealed off. Police began combing the lot 
near the hotel even before Simpson was arrested, but they suspended that search 
over the weekend of June 18 and then resumed it on the following Monday. They 
neglected to close the area in the interim, meaning that any evidence in the 
lot could have been taken without police knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have other evidence, however, that may make the weapon less important 
than in some murder cases. According to sources, police have recovered 
bloodstained clothing, a matching pair of gloves -- one from the crime scene 
and another from outside Simpson's Brentwood mansion -- as well as a series of 
blood samples from the football Hall of Famer's Ford Bronco, from the crime 
scene and from his home. 
</P>
<P>
 In a motion filed Monday, Simpson lawyer Robert L. Shapiro said that in the 
material provided to him by prosecutors, there are references to blood samples, 
Simpson's car, a ski cap and "certain gloves found at the premises of the 
residences of Mr. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 But Shapiro said his experts had not been provided with blood samples to 
conduct their own tests -- which he said were essential to prepare for 
Thursday's preliminary hearing. In a sworn declaration, Shapiro's hired 
forensic pathologist, Michael Baden, said he was allowed to examine evidence 
but not to keep or photograph it. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence is needed so that Simpson's lawyers can mount an "affirmative 
defense" at the preliminary hearing, meaning that they could call witnesses and 
present evidence in defense of Simpson. That is rare for a preliminary hearing, 
in part because it can expose elements of the defense trial strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, meanwhile, asked a judge to order Simpson to provide a hair 
sample because black curly hairs "of African American origin" were found in the 
ski cap at the crime scene, according to a motion filed by the lead prosecutor, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge set the defense and prosecution motions for a hearing today. Earlier 
Monday, another judge ruled that the defense may have access to transcripts of 
testimony given to the grand jury before that panel's work was abruptly cut 
short last week. 
</P>
<P>
 At the preliminary hearing Thursday, prosecutors may call witnesses to 
testify, though they may instead choose to rely heavily on the testimony of 
investigating police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 One possible witness, Jill Shively, told investigators that she saw a person 
resembling Simpson fleeing from the crime scene. But she accepted money for 
telling her story to the tabloid television program "Hard Copy," a move that 
would undermine her credibility if she is called to testify. In addition, small 
claims court records in Burbank reveal that she was ordered on June 28, 1993, 
to pay $2,000 in a court action after she was accused of peddling a script that 
she did not own. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Patrick Clarke, a television actor who was the plaintiff in the small 
claims court suit, said Shively had duped him in 1992 after posing as a budding 
screenwriter and asking him to read her latest script -- a heartwarming drama 
entitled "Remember When," about a man with a pregnant wife and terminal cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Shively, he said, later told him that she had struck a deal to sell the script 
to a production company for $250,000 and to cast him as the star. But three 
weeks before the payment was due, Clarke said, she told him she needed $6,000, 
and he offered a loan against her script advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke said he later discovered that the script was not Shively's, but was for 
a film entitled "My Life" that was in pre-production starring Nicole Kidman and 
Michael Keaton. According to Clarke, she refused to repay his loan, prompting 
him to sue her. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clarke saw her televised interview last week, he called authorities to 
let them know about his experience with Shively. His doubts about her 
credibility were shared by her own attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minute I saw her on 'Hard Copy,' I looked up and said, 'If that's the 
best witness they've got against O.J. Simpson, they're in trouble," ' said 
Cheryl Korchak, a part-time lawyer who represented Shively in the small claims 
court case. 
</P>
<P>
 With the preliminary hearing fast approaching, legal experts said authorities' 
inability to find the murder weapon is not likely to be fatal to the 
prosecution case but does provide Simpson's lawyers with a weakness to exploit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hole in their case," said Donald Re, one of Los Angeles' most 
respected criminal defense attorneys and the lawyer for Simpson's close friend 
Al Cowlings. "Obviously, what they would like to do is put the weapon in the 
defendant's hand before the time of the murder. Without the weapon, they can't 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Levenson, a Loyola law school professor and former federal prosecutor, 
said defense attorneys could exploit the absence of a weapon to suggest that 
the case against Simpson is not airtight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing about not having the murder weapon is that it raises questions," 
she said. "And in a criminal case, all you have to do is raise a reasonable 
doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, prosecutors have convicted criminal defendants in many cases where no 
weapon was found. The success of those cases generally depends on producing 
other compelling evidence, such as scientific samples or eyewitness accounts of 
a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weapon by itself is not the key to this," Barry Tarlow, a prominent 
defense attorney in Los Angeles, said of the Simpson case. "I think it's a 
sideshow unless they find a weapon and definitively tie it to Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Defense attorney Bailey laid the groundwork for challenging blood tests from 
samples taken at the scene of the crime as well as from Simpson's car, 
residence and belongings. Police are conducting DNA tests, and sources say that 
preliminary findings continue to point to Simpson. But Bailey said DNA tests 
are not necessarily conclusive and could be contested in court. Said Bailey: 
"Some experts would say it shows one thing, some experts could say no, it 
doesn't show that, and away we go." 
</P>
<P>
 * Municipal Judge Ray L. Hart heard arguments on NBC's request to unseal 
records related to the 1989 spousal battery case against Simpson. The records 
include two letters from Simpson's court-appointed psychiatrist, reports 
attached to the arrest warrant and copies of photographs. NBC's lawyer asked 
for release of the material, while attorneys for Simpson, the city and the 
district attorney opposed the motion, arguing that the contents could taint 
potential jurors and prevent a fair trial. A court clerk said the judge would 
rule on the motion later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Psychiatrist Saul Faerstein visited Simpson for two hours in jail and said 
afterward: "O.J. wanted me to say to the people that he's very encouraged by 
the letters he's receiving. He feels a lot of love in his heart from all of the 
people who support him and know him. He's getting stronger and he looks forward 
to his day in court." 
</P>
<P>
 * Time magazine, which published a controversial photographic "illustration" 
of Simpson's mug shot on its cover last week, ran a long explanation for that 
decision. "I have looked at thousands of covers over the years and chosen 
hundreds," Managing Editor James R. Gaines wrote. "I have never been so wrong 
about how one would be received."

NEIGHBORHOOD PREPARES TO MOVE FOR CLEANUP OF TOXIC BLACK GOO; SUPERFUND: ORANGE 
COUNTY RESIDENTS WILL BE RELOCATED FROM WHAT IS CALLED ONE OF WORST HAZARDOUS 
WASTE SITES IN COUNTRY. FUMES ARE BLAMED FOR A HOST OF AILMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 By looking, no one would guess that beneath the tranquil back yards of this 
middle class neighborhood a menacing black ooze lies creeping toward the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Neatly manicured lawns border quiet sidewalks lined with trees. Residents walk 
their dogs and wash new cars parked in fresh-swept driveways. And everywhere, 
the impression is one of quiet life in the sunny ambience of north Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Every summer, though, something odd happens as the soil warms in this tract 
near Sowell Avenue and Golden West Street. A strange, dark goo seeps up through 
back-yard lawns and cracks in the patios. It emits a powerful stench, residents 
say, that causes coughing, headaches, sleeplessness, chest pains, nausea and 
breathing difficulty. One resident attributes the recent loss of a lung and 
regular bouts of severe asthma to the annual appearance of the black goo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's miserable," said Gloria Delzeith, 51, a resident since 1978 whose asthma 
requires almost monthly hospitalization and has kept her from working for two 
years. "It's black, it's tarry and it stinks like rotten eggs. It's just been a 
mess; it keeps coming out of the ground, and there's nothing you can do about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials plan to do something about it this summer. Starting in late 
July, they will begin a two-year project during which as many as 50 families 
will be relocated for up to four months. Bulldozer operators in breathing masks 
will dig deep into 25 back yards, tearing up swimming pools, patios, fences and 
room additions, which the government will replace. Then they will remove 45,000 
cubic yards of the buried petroleum residue that officials say makes this one 
of the worst hazardous waste sites in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have moved quickly on this," said Dick Vesperman, project manager for the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which is overseeing the $15-million 
cleanup. "Not all hazardous sites are in residential areas." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, this one was not heavily residential either in 1936 when, according 
to historical records gathered by the EPA, the Long Beach-based Ralph Gray 
Trucking Co. dumped petroleum waste products of unknown origin into four open 
pits in a field the company owned. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous complaints to health officials and the Westminster Chamber of 
Commerce propelled the matter into court. On Dec. 2, 1936, the company's owner, 
Ralph Gray, was convicted of maintaining a public nuisance, a misdemeanor, and 
ordered to pay a $100 fine and to eliminate the problem within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently that never happened. Four years later a county health inspector was 
responding to further complaints with predictions that, left alone, the mess 
would seep away "within a short time." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958 a developer, intent on building a housing tract unmarred by the 
unsightly pits, moved the hazardous material into two long trenches buried 18 
feet beneath the back yards of 25 of the houses he was building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently he felt he could do better with it underground," Vesperman said. 
"He just put dirt over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials say Gray has since died, they cannot find any descendants, 
and the trucking company no longer exists. Nor can they find the developer of 
the tract. 
</P>
<P>
 So two years ago, the site was added to the National Priorities List of 
Superfund sites, qualifying it for the federally funded cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 That project will take place in two phases. This summer, Vesperman said, about 
half of those affected will be temporarily moved at government expense to 
nearby hotels, rented houses or the homes of relatives and friends. The 
relocation will include 12 families whose back yards are to be excavated as 
well as their nearest neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The waste will be taken to an as-yet-undetermined hazardous waste disposal 
site in California. Later, Vesperman said, government workers will reconstruct 
the torn-up yards. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials have set up headquarters in one of the affected houses: a 
three-bedroom rental that, like other homes in the neighborhood, would probably 
sell for $150,000 to $200,000 if banks were willing to finance the sale -- 
which none are, residents say. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's second phase will occur next summer when the same thing will be 
done to the remaining affected back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The ethnically diverse community has been very supportive, Vesperman said. 
"It's really a cooperative effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some residents are not pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Nguyen, 23, a law student who has lived here with his mother for 10 
years, said he has never seen evidence of the black ooze. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never gave it a thought," he said. "This is an inconvenience; we don't want 
to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say the project could not happen a moment too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Torres, a sheet-metal worker who has lived here for 34 years, said four 
members of his family suffer from asthma, which he attributes to the waste. 
"It's great that they're doing it," he said. "We'll enjoy being in a different 
location for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 And Delzeith, whose family expects to spend much of the summer living at a 
nearby Marriott hotel, said that although the cleanup may be too late to 
significantly improve her health, she hopes that it will help maintain the 
health of others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taken them a long time," said the former office supervisor, who had a 
lung removed last year. Although no medical evidence exists directly linking 
her condition to the waste, Delzeith said, she is convinced that it stems from 
years of breathing the material's fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have done this a long time ago," she said. "But I'll be glad when 
it's all cleared out." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say they have detected no statistically significant increase in the 
incidence of disease among residents of the tract but they acknowledge that 
long-term exposure to some of the chemicals contained in it, particularly 
sulfur dioxide, can exacerbate existing upper-respiratory conditions, including 
asthma. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a chemical soup down there," said Marilyn C. Underwood, a 
toxicologist with the state health department. "It's a health hazard." 
</P>
<P>
 Vesperman concurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The risk assessments we've done have indicated that there is some potential 
long-term health threats from continued exposure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the material is relatively harmless while buried, he added, there is 
some danger when it seeps to the surface during hot summers or because of 
excavation. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the major hurdles in the project, officials say, is finding places 
where relocated residents can have their pets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a problem," said Fraser Felter, the agency's community relations 
coordinator. "We've got people with tortoises, 250 koi, rabbits, pheasants, 
chickens, birds, dogs and cats. Just a little thing like pets can really 
complicate matters." 
</P>
<P>
 While government officials tackle that, some residents have begun packing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to it," Delzeith said of the move. "We're leaving 
everything except food, clothes and important papers. Some other stuff we'll 
put in storage." 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Haynes, 73, said spending four months away from her home of 16 years 
"will be kind of fun. I don't get out much anymore; this will be something 
different." Back-Yard Cleanup

excavate and remove toxic oil refinery waste buried in a Westminster housing

IMMIGRANT COST STUDY DRAWS FIRE; ECONOMY: UPDATED FIGURES BY RICE PROFESSOR 
CLAIM $44-BILLION EXPENSE TO TAXPAYERS IN 1993. CRITICS CALL THE ORIGINAL AND 
REVISED REPORTS FLAWED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firing another salvo in an ongoing statistical battle, the author of a 
controversial study on the economic effects of immigration released an updated 
report Monday, claiming that U.S. taxpayers in 1993 paid out $121 billion in 
public assistance but received only $77 billion in taxes from legal and illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, done by Rice University economics professor Donald Huddle, was 
largely intended to address methodological criticisms of a similar study 
released last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier report, which was described by critics as wrong-headed and obvious 
fodder for anti-immigrant groups, calculated that immigrants caused a net drain 
on taxes of $42.5 billion. After making some statistical adjustments, the study 
released Monday increases the tax "deficit" to $44 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the truth causes people to be upset, then so be it," said Huddle at a 
Monday morning news conference. "The study is seeking to lay out the facts as 
carefully and fully as it can." 
</P>
<P>
 But critics said that both studies by Huddle reach implausible conclusions 
and, in particular, exaggerate the effect that immigrants have on displacing 
native workers from their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The highly emotional pitch of the debate over immigration in California and 
other affected states has led to numerous disagreements over the veracity of 
immigration studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups opposed to immigration paint stark portraits of the effects of 
uncontrolled immigration on national and regional economies. Pro-immigrant 
groups tend to emphasize the positive effects of the millions of newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubble's report was sponsored by the Carrying Capacity Network, a nonprofit 
Washington-based environmental group that has recently focused its attention on 
the costs and problems of immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Huddle nor the network made specific recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report released last May, the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think 
tank, took aim at the earlier Huddle study, claiming he had made several 
serious methodological errors in compiling his data. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey S. Passel, co-author of the Urban Institute report, found the new 
Huddle report no improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stand by what we said before and the estimates we've done," Passel said. 
"He's the one going around changing his numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 The Urban Institute study said that Huddle under-reported the incomes of 
immigrants and the amount of taxes they paid. Huddle was also criticized for 
overlooking several significant revenue sources in immigrant populations, 
including Social Security contributions, unemployment insurance and gasoline 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Those errors, the Urban Institute contended, led Huddle to underestimate the 
amount of taxes immigrants pay by $50 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contrary to the public's perception," the Urban Institute study said, " . . . 
immigrants generate significantly more in taxes paid than they cost in services 
received." But the report noted that the surplus was unevenly distributed among 
levels of government. While the federal government benefited from a net 
surplus, state and local governments suffer from a net cost, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, whose tough immigration stance is a key part of his 
reelection strategy, estimates that California spends $2.3 billion in 
unreimbursed costs of illegal immigration alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Huddle on Monday challenged the Urban Institute's study. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute, Huddle said, inflated the amount of immigrants' Social Security 
contributions by including the 50% paid by employers. He also said that the 
Institute underestimated public assistance costs and failed to subtract the 
costs of providing state and federal highway services to immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the two studies differ most strikingly is over the issue of displaced 
native workers. Huddle calculates that it costs nearly $12 billion in indirect 
social service costs for low-skill U.S. workers dislodged from their jobs by 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Urban Institute's reasoning is that displacement has not been found in 
aggregate statistics, therefore it doesn't exist," Huddle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We disagree completely on worker displacement cost," said Passel. "We don't 
think that the literature supports such a drastic view. He assumes that for 
every 100 low-skill immigrants, 25 natives have lost their jobs and never will 
get another job. That's a very static view of the economy."

HEAT EASES, BUT FIRES STILL BURN; WEATHER: RISING HUMIDITY MAKES IT SEEM 
HOTTER, FORECASTERS SAY. HIGH TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN FOR THE 
HOLIDAY WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The enduring heat wave eased only temporarily Monday, and firefighters 
continued their battle against four wildfires that had scorched more than 
12,000 acres of brush and timberland, destroying 10 homes, incinerating about 
50 vehicles and injuring at least eight people. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Monday's high temperatures generally were 5 to 10 degrees below the 
marks that shattered some Southland records Sunday, it was still plenty hot, 
with top readings of well over 100 in many Los Angeles-area communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising humidity made it seem even hotter, and the National Weather Service 
issued a special "excessive heat" advisory warning that "a potentially 
dangerous combination of heat and humidity is developing in the valleys . . . 
of Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 While temperatures topped out at 105 in the San Fernando and San Gabriel 
valleys on Monday, humid air pumped in from a tropical storm system over Baja 
California made it seem 5 to 10 degrees hotter, the weather service said. 
</P>
<P>
 The moist air triggered some strong thunderstorms over the San Bernardino 
Mountains and the western Mojave Desert on Monday afternoon. Residents of 
Victorville, Apple Valley and Barstow were warned of possible flash floods. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said that while the 
humidity will drop a little as the week progresses, the temperatures will start 
rising again, with hot weather expected through the extended Fourth of July 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that people working outside for extended periods will be susceptible to 
sunstroke, heat cramps and heat exhaustion, the weather service advisory 
suggested drinking lots of water and reducing activity levels whenever 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The most destructive of the fires -- a 2,820-acre blaze northwest of the San 
Gabriel Mountain community of Wrightwood -- was 95% contained Monday night 
after burning 10 houses and dozens of trucks and cars, said Jaquie Stiver, a 
U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Stiver said four of the more than 1,300 firefighters brought in from across 
the Southwest suffered minor injuries. The blaze was started by a campfire near 
a Boy Scout camp, but Stiver stressed that Scouts were not responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Breezes in the Wrightwood area were light Monday, and the slow spread of the 
fire permitted the release of water-dropping planes to other blazes still 
raging out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty miles to the west, near Soledad Pass, a brush fire in Kentucky Springs 
Canyon was about half contained after charring more than 3,500 acres of 
chaparral. Stiver said four more firefighters sustained minor injuries fighting 
that blaze, which was started by a tracer bullet deflected from a target at a 
rifle range. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 1,000 firefighters were battling the Soledad fire at nightfall Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Riverside County, more than 500 firefighters were struggling to control a 
blaze that had consumed about 1,500 acres of dense brush in the Anza area by 
Monday afternoon. The going was hot and slow, and with the fire only 40% 
contained by midafternoon, officials said it probably would be sometime late 
today before the fire is fully contained. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Cleveland National Forest, a 4,200-acre fire roared out of control 
Monday afternoon, chewing its way rapidly through heavy brush a few miles east 
of the San Diego County community of Ramona. A fire official said the 330 
firefighters on the lines had managed to contain only about 10% of the blaze. 
He made no predictions when the fire would be controlled. 
</P>
<P>
 For firefighters, the forecast was not good. Temperatures are expected to rise 
a couple of degrees a day through Wednesday, and while dropping humidity will 
make the heat a little more bearable, the drier air will increase the fire 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 The high temperature at Los Angeles Civic Center was 94 degrees Monday, seven 
degrees below Sunday's top mark of 101. Monday's overnight low was 73, tying 
the record for the warmest minimum on a June 27, set in 1990. The relative 
humidity ranged between 29% and 75%. 
</P>
<P>
 Other high temperatures Monday included 106 in Woodland Hills, 105 in 
Pasadena, 102 in Monrovia, 96 in San Gabriel, 95 in El Toro, 88 in Torrance, 83 
at Los Angeles International Airport and 74 in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Brack said the continuing heat is the product of an immense dome of high 
pressure -- centered over Arizona -- that is refusing to budge. He said that as 
long as the dome stays in place, it will block the onshore flow of cool breezes 
from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it looks like not much change through the weekend," he said. "It's 
gonna stay hot."

IT REALLY IS BOILING HOT FOR CREWS ON THE FIRE LINE 
</P>

 The health advisories talk about avoiding exertion and direct exposure to the 
sun and here are 38-year-old Gregory Alexander and friends, dripping wet in 
long, heavy pants and long-sleeved jackets and using chain saws to mow down 
30-foot-high brush in the advance of a moving wall of orange flames. 
</P>
<P>
 It's so hot out here that the nine pounds of water they carry in their 
backpacks could probably brew coffee. But it's keeping them alive. 
</P>
<P>
 They look all around, not just for hot spots capriciously turning against them 
in sudden windstorms, or spot fires erupting behind them. They are on the 
lookout for buddies who are sweating profusely, then getting clammy, and then 
not sweating at all because there is nothing left of their wilted bodies to 
drip out. They are on the brink of collapsing from heat exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you feel like your brain's starting to boil, that's real bad," said 
Anthony Lacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander and Lacy are among the thousands of Southern California firefighters 
who since Saturday have been going out into the same 100-degree-plus heat the 
rest of us have been trying to avoid like the plague. 
</P>
<P>
 They shrug off the heat because, they say, there just is no way to beat it. 
You knuckle under, you carry the 50 pounds of hoses on your back, or wield the 
chain saws in chaparral thick with bees, or pound away at the dirt with rakes 
and shovels to cut a trail five feet wide, and the heat is just one more 
nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went Monday at a 1,500-acre wildfire near Anza in southern Riverside 
County, where the temperatures exceeded the century mark for the third straight 
day and firefighters sang the praises of being properly prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Before heading out onto the fire line -- an unmerciful landscape of 
chaparral-carpeted hillsides -- they "pre-water" by downing as much cool liquid 
as they can handle. 
</P>
<P>
 They soak bandannas in water and drape them over their heads and across their 
faces. 
</P>
<P>
 They wear cotton shirts beneath their fire-retardant jackets and pants to 
absorb the sweat. Polyester-blend shirts melt in the heat and stick to the 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
 They wear heavy denim pants to help ward off the heat of flames. 
</P>
<P>
 They wear two pairs of cotton socks inside their work boots, to better protect 
their feet when walking across hot ash and burning embers a foot or two deep. 
"Your feet get the hottest and there's no way to escape that," said California 
Department of Forestry firefighter Mike Bratton. And even when the rest of you 
cools off, your feet stay hot. 
</P>
<P>
 And they drink water every chance they get. As much as they can, as an 
antidote to dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can get dehydrated before you realize it," warned Riverside County 
firefighter James Flores. "You carry as much water as you can with you, and 
when it's gone, you go back to your engine for more." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're sweating everywhere," he said. "You sweat in your shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Even back in the base camp, where half of the 600 firefighters rested while 
the others worked a 12-hour shift, cooling off was difficult. Men and women 
collapsed in the shade of weeping willows and tamarack bushes, lay atop 
sleeping bags and draped their faces with bandannas, to try to steal some 
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy to sleep in the middle of the day when it's as hot as this, but 
they're so exhausted, they do," said Department of Forestry Capt. Tom Ramsey. 
</P>
<P>
 Large white tents peppered the camp, portable air conditioners trying 
valiantly to cool the air inside -- and with fans posted over the 
air-conditioning units to keep them cool. 
</P>
<P>
 In one corner of the camp, large tubs of ice water held prizes: V-8 juice and 
Gatorade, Hansen's soda and bottles of just plain old water, which disappeared 
the quickest. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, kitchen crews prepared to barbecue 500 12-ounce T-bones. Laid out on 
the lawn were eight large grills, charcoal ready for lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so hot, you could probably just put the steaks on the aluminum foil 
inside the grills to cook 'em," said Ron Mayer of the kitchen team. 
</P>
<P>
 Some foods were meant to be cooling: the Bing cherries, grapes and peaches on 
ice. But firefighters like their food hot, too; on a pallet of canned food off 
to the side, ready for supper, were gallons of pepperoni and chili peppers.

DRUGS CALLED DANGER TO WELFARE REFORM; LEGISLATION: UNIVERSITY PANEL WARNS THAT 
FAILURE TO TREAT ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSERS COULD CRIPPLE PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Arguing that more than one-quarter of the 4.2 million mothers receiving Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children use illicit drugs or drink too much alcohol, a 
Columbia University panel Monday warned federal officials that failure to 
include adequate funds for substance abuse treatment could cripple welfare 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to talk about getting those people to work, we're going to 
have to talk about substance abuse prevention and treatment programs," said 
Joseph Califano, chairman and president of the Center on Addiction and 
Substance Abuse at Columbia University and a former secretary of health, 
education and welfare under President Jimmy Carter. "There absolutely has not 
been enough recognition of this problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials quickly challenged the study, saying it greatly 
exaggerates the problem. They stressed that the study could complicate the 
welfare reform debate in Congress by putting ammunition in the hands of 
conservatives who argue that money spent on education and training for welfare 
recipients will be wasted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overreactions to this report could hamper our efforts to assist welfare 
recipients become productive members of society," said Secretary of Health and 
Human Services Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's blueprint for overhauling welfare was introduced to Congress 
last week, and hearings on welfare reform are expected to start in both the 
House and the Senate this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior congressional staffer agreed that the study could hurt the 
President's efforts to provide more education, training and child care services 
to welfare recipients to help them make the transition to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyzing data from the 1991 National Household Drug Survey, the center 
determined that 27% of welfare mothers abuse or are addicted to alcohol and 
drugs, compared to 9% of mothers not receiving welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 The Columbia group defined substance abuse as consuming five or more drinks at 
one sitting, two or more times a month, or having used illicit drugs in the 
past year. When asked to break out the more serious abusers, Califano said that 
11.6% of those surveyed admitted to binge drinking. Twenty-three percent 
admitted to using illicit drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But using the same data, the Administration came up with strikingly different 
figures. According to an analysis by the Department of Health and Human 
Services, 4.5% of mothers on welfare were determined to have debilitating 
substance abuse problems that would prevent them from participating in 
employment or training activities. Another 10.5% were determined to be 
"moderately impaired" by substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Califano criticized the Administration's 4.5% figure -- the only one Shalala 
cited -- as an "incredibly narrow definition" of substance abuse and charged 
that she was attempting to diminish the problem for political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Both conservative and liberal welfare experts warn that the study highlights a 
potential weak point in the President's plan to "end welfare as we know it" by 
requiring welfare recipients to work and limiting eligibility for cash to two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the extent of drug and alcohol addiction and abuse among welfare 
recipients is as great as the report suggests, and I believe it is, it is a 
sign of how big a challenge the Administration faces in getting people from 
welfare to work and seriously undercuts their cost estimates," said Douglas 
Besharov of the conservative American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy 
Research.

FDA APPROVES FOURTH DRUG FOR TREATMENT OF AIDS, HIV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWARTZ, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Food and Drug Administration has approved a fourth drug, called Stavudine, 
or D4T, for the treatment of AIDS and HIV infection. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug, which will be marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. under the brand 
name Zerit, works in much the same way as other leading treatments for the 
disease -- Ziduvudine (AZT), didanosine (ddI) and Zalcitabine (ddc). None of 
the drugs is a cure for AIDS, but may delay the onset of AIDS symptoms and 
extend survival time. 
</P>
<P>
 The drugs belong to the family of "nucleoside analogs," which are believed to 
inhibit the ability of HIV to reproduce by "fooling" the virus into using the 
drug to build its DNA instead of the body's own natural components. The drug 
also interferes with the production of enzymes that the virus needs in order to 
grow. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA approved D4T for use in adults who no longer respond to, or are unable 
to tolerate, other nucleoside analogs. Current drug therapies have "significant 
limitations," including toxicity and limited effectiveness over time, said 
David Feigal, director of the anti-viral drug division at the FDA's Center for 
Drug Evaluation and Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Bristol-Myers Squibb said the drug will be shipped to wholesalers beginning in 
July. The company estimated the wholesale cost of the drug would come to $6.22 
daily per patient -- less than the cost of AZT. 
</P>
<P>
 In clinical trials of 359 AIDS patients whose immunity-boosting CD4 cells had 
dropped to a median level of 250 cells per cubic millimeter of blood, the drug 
was found to increase the count by 24 cells per cubic millimeter of blood. 
Patients taking AZT showed a decline of 22 cells over a 12-week treatment 
period. The normal number of CD4 cells in healthy adults is 1,000 per cubic 
millimeter of blood. Under the terms of accelerated approval, the company will 
continue to study the drug and its effects. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief side effect of the drug is pain, tingling and numbness in the hands 
and feet that affects between 15% and 21% of users.

GOVERNMENT; TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES GEAR UP TO FIGHT EFFORT TO DERAIL ICC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since 1980, the Interstate Commerce Commission has degenerated from lame duck 
to dinosaur in the minds of its critics. But to Chairwoman Gail McDonald, the 
nation's oldest regulatory agency is on the fast track to the future of 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agency is what Americans want from government," McDonald said. "We are a 
small, responsive, specialized agency. We reinvented reinventing government." 
</P>
<P>
 House and Senate budget trimmers say the 107-year-old agency, which oversaw 
nearly all of the nation's surface transportation in its heyday, is obsolete 
and should be abolished now that the railroad and trucking industries have been 
deregulated. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. John R. Kasich (R-Ohio) spearheaded an amendment this month to eliminate 
the agency's $47-million budget and fold its functions into the Transportation 
Department. The House approved the amendment, which had been defeated twice 
before, by a 234-192 vote, sending the measure to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 But ICC critics could be derailed by interests backing the agency -- an 
obstacle encountered nearly every time Congress attempts to streamline the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Railroad and trucking industry leaders, who say they were blindsided by the 
House vote, are scrambling now to rescue the agency in the Senate, which has 
traditionally protected ICC independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tremendous amount of expertise built up in the ICC," said Ed 
Harper, president of the Assn. of American Railroads, which represents the 
nation's freight lines. "It still stands ready to step in if rates go beyond 
the maximum appropriate limit." 
</P>
<P>
 American Trucking Assn. President Thomas J. Donahue said the trucking industry 
"as a whole cannot support a chaotic situation in which carriers are obligated 
to comply with rules that no one is around to administer." 
</P>
<P>
 Created in 1887 to check railroad monopolies, the quasi-judicial commission 
once had authority that rivaled that of the Supreme Court. Any company that 
wanted to operate a rail line or buy track during the era of westward expansion 
had to win approval from the commission, which also set railroad rates, 
established time zones and regulated the market. 
</P>
<P>
 But its purview narrowed in the early 1980s with deregulation of the trucking 
and railroad businesses. The agency still licenses truckers, oversees trucking 
and railroad company mergers, determines railroad track rights and has some 
authority over trucking rates. Its staff has shrunk to just 614, down from its 
peak 2,500 in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, which courted organized labor during the 
President's 1992 campaign, announced its strong opposition to slashing the ICC, 
saying Vice President Al Gore did not recommend eliminating the agency in his 
"reinventing government" initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasich and other critics say the Transportation Department could absorb the 
agency's duties, citing a similar action in 1983 when the department took 
control of the Civil Aeronautics Board. Eliminating the ICC would save 
taxpayers $25 million this year, Kasich estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 But McDonald contends that move would mean a loss of impartiality, especially 
in cases involving Amtrak. Folding its functions into the Transportation 
Department could bring more political pressure on decisions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials have rejected proposals aimed at collapsing the 
agency. An assistant secretary testified before two House panels that the ICC 
is effective in overseeing those industries it regulates, intervening in the 
marketplace only when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent General Accounting Office study of the commission concluded that the 
rail regulatory functions should be independent of Transportation to preserve 
the integrity of agency rulings. GAO investigators found that slashing the 
agency's budget would not save taxpayers any money.

URBAN PLANNING; GROUP HOPES GREENER CITIES WILL BE SAFER; A NONPROFIT 
ORGANIZATION HOPES TO ACQUIRE 250 PARKS. EXPERTS HAVE LONG LINKED RECREATION, 
CRIME PREVENTION. 
</P>

 Habitat isn't just for wildlife. People need some green too. 
</P>
<P>
 To traditional environmental groups, the notion of conserving land for people 
might be a little strange. But to Martin Rosen, a self-described "old warhorse" 
from a host of environmental battles, the idea has a kind of self-evident 
wisdom to it. And a growing number of lawmakers, prompted by the perceived link 
between declining urban parkland and rising crime, are beginning to think so 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen is president of the Trust for Public Lands, a conservation group that is 
launching a $2.5-billion effort to make 12 American cities greener and, they 
hope, safer places for humans. Using money raised through private donations and 
public bond bills and working with community activists, Rosen's group hopes to 
acquire as many as 250 properties for parks in cities nationwide over the next 
five years. He hopes the group's activities will help leverage new federal 
funds aimed at fighting crime through prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologists and law enforcement experts have been drawing a connection 
between urban parks, recreation areas and crime prevention for several decades. 
After Watts erupted in violence in 1965, an investigation linked urban violence 
to the decay of city recreation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 25 years later, South-Central Los Angeles residents came to the same 
conclusion: In the wake of the 1992 riots, 77% told pollsters that the absence 
of parks and recreation facilities was among their top concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence doesn't demonstrate clearly that deteriorating parkland and 
recreation facilities cause an upturn in crime, but the two do appear to be 
inextricably linked. And if crime and the demise of urban parks go together, 
then the revitalization of urban parkland, Rosen and other experts reckon, will 
contribute to a decline in lawlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Many South-Central residents cite compelling evidence for the idea: In the 
1992 riots, buildings on Union Avenue were torched, windows were shattered and 
businesses looted. But a community garden in the heart of Pico-Union, cleared 
several years before and tended by members of the 10th Street Mothers' Club, 
stood untouched by the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
 "People had cleaned up those lots themselves," said Brenda Funches, who leads 
the grass-roots gardening organization, Common Ground. "Anyone who has a 
history in the neighborhood remembers what these places looked like before, and 
the truth is, everybody knows somebody who is involved with the garden." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all crime-busters see the connection. Steve Twist, director of the 
National Rifle Assn.'s Crime Strike program, called the idea of fighting crime 
with parks "hopelessly naive." 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem of the collapse of the juvenile justice system is a problem of 
the revolving door. There are no significant consequences for chronic violent 
offenders." 
</P>
<P>
 Anecdotal evidence from across the nation abounds. In Philadelphia, police 
helped neighborhood volunteers clean up vacant lots and plant gardens, and 
burglaries and thefts in the precinct dropped from about 40 per month to about 
four. In the summers of 1991 and 1993, Phoenix parks stayed open until midnight 
for basketball, swimming, volleyball and dancing, and police calls on juvenile 
crime dropped up to 55%. 
</P>
<P>
 With Congress focusing on the causes of crime, the link between violence and 
degenerating urban parks is receiving new scrutiny -- and possibly new funds. 
The crime bill, now in House-Senate negotiations, is expected to establish a 
$23-billion trust fund from which initiatives for city parks could draw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Urban recreation and sports programs are a proven, common-sense and 
cost-effective means of preventing crime and delinquency," said Rep. Bruce F. 
Vento (D-Minn.), co-sponsor of an amendment to the crime bill that would 
earmark crime prevention funds for urban parks and recreation programs. "Our 
urban crime rate would be different if these programs had not been neglected in 
the past decade." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Trust for Public Lands conducted an inventory of parkland last year, 
it found that parks were concentrated in affluent neighborhoods in two-thirds 
of the cities it studied. In 16 out of 23 cities, the trust said parkland in 
poor neighborhoods was crowded and inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of neglect, Rosen said, "sends a signal to troubled communities and 
youth that they're not worth the investment." And they will almost surely repay 
the nation with more hostility and more indifference, he added. Green areas in 
cities, he said, "aren't (just) nice; they're urgent, critical, vital areas 
that people require."

RUSSIAN TROOPS IN NEW ROLE AS ABKHAZIA PEACEKEEPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BIRD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time since the Soviet Union's breakup, Russian troops have taken 
up a new peacekeeping mission in the former empire, deploying 3,000 strong in 
the disputed territory of Abkhazia. 
</P>
<P>
 Under auspices of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and with tacit U.N. 
approval, Russian peacekeepers will patrol a 32-mile-wide security zone along 
the Inguri River, the natural border between Georgia and the breakaway republic 
of Abkhazia. 
</P>
<P>
 A Russian-brokered accord, signed by Georgia and Abkhazia last month, calls 
for Moscow's troops to provide security for 250,000 returning Georgian refugees 
who fled last year from battles between Georgia's government forces and 
Abkhazian separatist fighters supported by North Caucasian mercenaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Politically, the deployment serves notice to the world that Russia continues 
to see the former Soviet republics -- most of which are still occupied by 
Moscow troops -- as within its sphere of influence. 
</P>
<P>
 A company belonging to Russia's 97th Parachute Regiment, traveling in six 
light-armored vehicles, rumbled into the main square in Gali, on the Abkhaz 
side of the Inguri, on Saturday. The troops jumped out of their transports and 
lined up hurriedly for an official welcome from Russia's visiting deputy 
foreign minister, Boris Pastukhov. 
</P>
<P>
 "The return of refugees must begin and the task must be done honorably and 
well," he told the solemn-faced troops, who, according to the Russian news 
agency Itar-Tass, came under fire on their way to Gali from Sukhumi on Friday. 
The company cheered in reply as about 100 elderly onlookers, mostly Georgians 
who had stayed on in the town after Gali fell to Abkhazian forces last 
September, applauded politely. 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere in Gali, a virtual ghost town, lightened considerably with the 
Russians' arrival. The previous week, continued looting by Cossack and North 
Caucasian mercenaries around Gali had kept townsfolk off the streets. A U.N. 
observer in the region said Abkhazian authorities have no control over the 
mercenaries, who reportedly drive truckloads of stolen booty from deserted 
Georgian houses back to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Russian troops were arriving here, a few hardy refugees, intent on 
reclaiming their homes, pushed wheelbarrows full of their belongings back 
toward their houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone here's very happy that the peacekeepers have arrived -- no one will 
have weapons, so it will be safe," said Fridon Ekhbaya, 50, a Georgian who 
returned from Zugdidi last month. His wife and three children plan to return 
soon. "My house is still standing. But everything that could be carried has 
been stolen." 
</P>
<P>
 Questions remain about when refugees from deeper in Abkhazia will be allowed 
back home. 
</P>
<P>
 In a packed public meeting in Zugdidi recently, a refugee asked Dzhaba 
Ioseliani, the warlord in charge of Georgia's negotiations with Abkhazia, when 
they might return to Gagra, the westernmost town in Abkhazia. "Within a year, 
all refugees will be able to return," Ioseliani told the attentive audience. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vladislav Ardzinba, the Sukhumi-based Abkhazian leader, said: "This is 
speculation. We can't allow our enemies to return . . . . It's a long process 
that will take 5, 10, 15 years -- maybe more." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Abkhazians oppose any return of Georgian refugees, who once outnumbered 
the 100,000-strong Abkhazian population by more than 2 to 1. Further 
complicating the situation, many homeless Abkhazian families have moved into 
empty Georgian apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgian and Western officials also privately fear the real task of Russian 
peacekeepers is not to help return refugees but to reinforce Abkhazia's de 
facto independence. Russia favored Abkhazia in the conflict, which has left at 
least 3,000 dead, and Georgian leader Eduard A. Shevardnadze accepted Russian 
peacekeepers in a last-ditch hope of bringing peace to his land. 
</P>
<P>
 "Georgia has lost Abkhazia," said a Western diplomat in Tbilisi. "It will take 
only a couple of major countries (to recognize Abkhazia) for all the rest to 
follow." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of Russia's retrenchment in the Caucasus, Moscow's peacekeeping 
mission in Abkhazia will be watched closely by Armenians and Azerbaijanis, who 
for six years have been at war over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.

 No flashy raids or mass arrests were reported, but Russia entered a new regime 
Monday -- the tougher new order dictated by President Boris N. Yeltsin's 
controversial decree cracking down on organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
 From now on, Russian police on the trail of certain crimes have the authority 
to detain suspects for up to 30 days without bringing charges, search vehicles 
and offices without a warrant and inspect bank records without a court order. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's rocketing crime rate and widespread corruption have become 
devastating political liabilities for Yeltsin, second only to the ravaged 
economy in the Russian people's litany of reform-era grievances. In popular 
perception, the "mafia" is taking over much of the country, the streets are 
unsafe and officialdom is all on the take. 
</P>
<P>
 The thirst for law-and-order measures contributes to mass support for 
ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, who backs the creation of summary 
courts with the power to execute "bandits" on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of pledges to fight crime and ineffective commission work, 
Yeltsin finally issued what is known as the "anti-banditry" decree June 12 -- 
only to be confronted by a wave of political opposition and complaints that the 
decree would violate Russians' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and the Kremlin have responded with a public relations campaign touting 
the decree as simply a way of making the procedural nuts and bolts of 
crime-fighting easier. They assure Russians that there will be no human rights 
abuses. "The start of the decree won't come with fireworks," Mikhail Yegorov, 
head of the Russian police's department on organized crime, told reporters 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in classic post-Soviet fashion, the decree's first day in effect 
began not with fireworks but with confusion. Vladimir Kolokoltsev, chief of the 
108th Police Precinct in the very center of Moscow, said he had heard about the 
measure on the radio Monday but had yet to receive instructions on how to 
implement it. 
</P>
<P>
 A worker at the Interior Ministry press center at first said, "Decree? What 
decree?" when asked about its first day in action, then a colleague recalled 
that they had spent much of the day making copies of it to be distributed to 
local police stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Yevgeny Ryabtsev, director of the press center, said police are working on "a 
special schedule for our staff to cover the most criminal places," in tandem 
with counterintelligence agents, Interior Ministry troops and prosecutors. He 
hastened to add, however, that the decree would not mean "a roundup of all of 
Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 Police are under extra pressure to use the decree to good effect in the wake 
of their embarrassing performance last week in a sweep of organized-crime 
haunts dubbed the "Hurricane" operation. According to Moscow media, leaks gave 
the mobsters plenty of time to clear out well in advance, leaving police 
largely empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities here, though, are also under pressure to avoid abusing their new 
powers, particularly because any complaints of unfounded harassment and arrests 
will play directly into the hands of Yeltsin's opponents. In a rare harmony 
among Communist, nationalist and reformist lawmakers, all three voted to ask 
Yeltsin to rescind the decree last week. Yeltsin responded with a stubborn, 
simple nyet, and his chief of staff, Sergei A. Filatov, said Monday that he is 
convinced the Russian president has the public's support for the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Yegorov assured the public that the new police powers will apply only to those 
suspected of serious crimes, such as murder and extortion. 
</P>
<P>
 While much of the Russian public may know that it wants an offensive on crime, 
many here appear to have little knowledge of Yeltsin's decree. The latest poll 
by the independent Institute of the Sociology of Parliamentarism showed that 
59% of 1,000 Muscovites surveyed had not heard of the decree or had only 
vaguely "heard something about it." A total of 33% said they thought it should 
be carried out, 10% were against it, and 57% could not say either way.

2-MAN UKRAINIAN RUNOFF SET AS RETURNS TRICKLE IN; ELECTION: INCUMBENT, FORMER 
PRIME MINISTER WILL SQUARE OFF NEXT MONTH IN PRESIDENTIAL RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Divided sharply over whether to look toward Europe or Russia, voters in this 
nation's presidential election put incumbent Leonid Kravchuk ahead in the west, 
favored former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma in the east and sent them into a 
two-man runoff next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Official returns Monday from 16 of 27 regions gave Kuchma 36% of the votes in 
Sunday's election to 30% for Kravchuk, followed by five other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 But that count was somewhat weighted toward Kuchma's expected strongholds. A 
more complete unofficial tally by Rukh, a nationalist movement that didn't 
field a candidate, put Kravchuk ahead of Kuchma 40% to 35%. 
</P>
<P>
 Complete returns, expected today, may give a clearer picture of who will lead 
this nuclear-armed former Soviet republic of 52 million people for the next 
four years. Political analysts said any first-round lead by Kravchuk would be 
hard to overcome in the runoff because the president, who is weighing a 
possible Cabinet shake-up, is better positioned to bargain for support from 
also-rans. 
</P>
<P>
 Olexander Moroz, socialist chairman of the Parliament elected last spring, was 
running third in the official count with 15% of the presidential vote. 
</P>
<P>
 That put him in a position to press his demand for supreme power for the 
legislative branch, dominated by centrists and Communists determined to slow 
even the timid free-market reforms backed by Kravchuk and Kuchma. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal-making in days ahead may also involve Volodymyr Lanovoy, the only 
radical free-market reformer in the presidential race, who was running fourth 
with 10% of the vote. By law, the runoff must be held by July 10. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Communist apparatchik, Kravchuk, now 60, led Ukraine to independence 
from the Soviet Union 2 1/2 years ago and has steered a cautious course between 
Russia and the West while presiding over bouts of hyper-inflation, industrial 
depression and growing unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent months he has moved decisively to join the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization's "Partnership for Peace," sign an accord with the European Union, 
begin dismantling Ukraine's nuclear arsenal and draft economic reforms that 
would bring the country $700 million in credits from the International Monetary 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in western Ukraine, stronghold of the independence movement, applauded 
these moves and rewarded Kravchuk with 70% to 80% of the vote in their regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchma, 55, former director of the Soviet Union's largest missile factory, 
argued that Kravchuk cut economic ties with Moscow too soon after the Soviet 
Union collapsed and that restoring them would boost Ukraine's fortunes. He ran 
first in industrialized, Russian-speaking regions east of the Dnieper River, 
where poverty has soured sentiment for independence. He also got 82% of the 
vote in Crimea, in southern Ukraine, where a pro-Russian separatist movement 
came to power in regional elections last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Political passions ran so high that 68% of Ukraine's 38 million voters turned 
up at the polls. But Kravchuk ran stronger in the eastern Russian-speaking 
areas than Kuchma did in the west. 
</P>
<P>
 The president made a late campaign swing through the east, trying to 
neutralize his challenger's appeal by offering to make Russian an official 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 He also exploited fears in the rest of the country that Kuchma is too 
pro-Russian to prevent the absorption of eastern Ukraine into a political 
federation ruled from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Ukrainian politicians say that fear is exaggerated, and so is the 
east-west rift. Except for Crimea, Ukraine's Russian-speaking areas are led by 
politicians with no desire to join Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter who is elected president, he will have to establish normal 
relations with Russia," said Volodymyr Cherniak, a Rukh leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Rukh was the only political movement to declare its position for the runoff. 
Cherniak told reporters that Rukh leaders would offer to support Kravchuk if he 
agreed to promote a new constitution, strengthen the presidency's powers and 
hold the line on Ukrainian statehood.

 The presidents of the two Koreas will hold a summit in the North Korean 
capital of Pyongyang on July 25, a South Korean government official said today, 
adding that details still must be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea's Kim Young Sam and North Korea's Kim Il Sung will be the first 
Korean presidents to meet since the peninsula was divided into the Communist 
North and capitalist South in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 The official monitoring talks at the border village of Panmunjom inside the 
Demilitarized Zone that separates the two Koreas said there are differences of 
opinion over a second round of summit talks. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the South wants to set a date and venue for a second round of talks 
during today's inter-Korean talks while the North wants to work out details of 
a second meeting only after the first summit had taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Seoul officials are cautious about whether a summit will actually be held 
because all past summit proposals have failed.

NEWS ANALYSIS; DESPITE THE ODDS, GERMANY'S KOHL IS ONCE AGAIN A FRONT-RUNNER; 
ELECTION: LONG-RULING CHANCELLOR GETS A BOOST AS SOCIAL DEMOCRATS' MODERATE 
LEADER SLIPS IN EARLY POLLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A series of electoral setbacks has thrown Rudolf Scharping, the Social 
Democratic Party leader once widely seen as Germany's next chancellor, into 
second place in this election-rich year and increased odds that Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl can hold power when Germany conducts federal elections in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a resurgence would make Kohl, who as leader of the Christian Democratic 
Union in the Bundestag has governed Germany since 1982, one of the 
longest-tenured heads of government in the democratic world -- though by no 
means one of the most popular. 
</P>
<P>
 In election after election this spring -- at the state, municipal and European 
levels -- voters in unforeseen numbers have rejected Social Democrats and their 
blandly moderate leader in favor of Kohl's Christian Democrats, the Greens or, 
increasingly, even the former Communist Party of what used to be East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 A public opinion survey unveiled Monday showed the extent of Scharping's 
troubles: 40% of those polled said they would vote for Kohl's Christian 
Democrats if federal elections were held next week; only 36% said they would 
elect Social Democrats. It was the widest such margin for Christian Democrats 
in three years. Just one month ago, the Social Democrats narrowly led. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent blow for the Social Democrats came Sunday, when voters in the 
depressed eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt went to the polls. So many 
moderate-to-leftists whom Scharping, 46, might have expected to vote Social 
Democrat voted instead for the former East German Communist Party that Kohl's 
unpopular Christian Democrats managed a narrow victory. 
</P>
<P>
 More surprising still, in municipal elections held Sunday in the former East 
German state of Saxony, voters in the city of Hoyerswerda elected a member of 
the former East German Communist Party -- now doing business as the Party of 
Democratic Socialism -- as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a number of tiny towns and villages in the former East Germany had 
elected former-Communist mayors since the Berlin Wall's fall in 1989, 
Hoyerswerda, population 100,000, is by far the largest city to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts insist that the flash of enthusiasm for former Communists doesn't 
reveal lingering support for hard-line ideas as much as it shows the failings 
of the two main German political parties: Neither the Christian Democrats nor 
the Social Democrats have convinced eastern Germans that they are much more 
than colonizers from the rich outside, seeking to impose their will on a 
disadvantaged, vulnerable East. 
</P>
<P>
 In a startling response to Sunday's elections, Reinhard Hoeppner, the Social 
Democrat gubernatorial contender in Saxony-Anhalt, said that his party might be 
able to work in an informal coalition with the former Communists if it were in 
a position to form a minority government in the state. Such a plan would have 
been unthinkable just weeks ago; ever since the East German government's 
collapse, western Germany's political parties have ridiculed the former 
Communists and vowed to have nothing to do with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Christian Democrats in the state, seeking to build a governing 
coalition, said they would even be willing -- though by no means eager -- to 
govern in coalition with Social Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 But such an alliance of the two main German parties -- a "grand coalition" -- 
would be poorly received by voters and would send a discouraging signal to the 
many Germans who believe this country needs fresh faces and new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent events mark a dramatic change from the mood in Germany as recently as 
March, when voters were heading for polls in the first of 29 elections that 
will occur by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl then simply appeared to be running out of gas. Unemployment in Germany 
was 4 million or more, depending on how it was measured; public disappointment 
with the reunification was rampant, and the public had grown deeply skeptical 
about entrenched politicians. Factions in the coalition with the Christian 
Democrats were grumbling and plotting; even in the governing party there was 
talk of replacing Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
 Against that backdrop, Scharping's strategy has been to portray himself as a 
responsible centrist for whom a middle-of-the-road German -- even a 
disenchanted Christian Democrat -- could vote with confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Scharping distanced himself from his party's leftist wing, saying he was proud 
to have had as many as 150,000 U.S. soldiers stationed in his state, 
Rhineland-Palatinate. 
</P>
<P>
 He embraced the concept of privatizing public services, complained about the 
welfare state's growth, warned labor unions they compromised Germany's position 
in the world economy and favored noncombat participation by Germany in U.N. 
peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Germans seemed drawn to this moderate voice of change: Polls showed almost 
half of the electorate thought Scharping's Social Democrats would form the next 
government, at least in coalition, while less than a fifth thought Kohl's 
Christian Democrats would return to power in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in an effort to regain percentages, Scharping used a party 
convention in the eastern city of Halle to deliver an uncharacteristically 
passionate speech. "We have to fight more directly and determinedly so that 
there will be a change on Oct. 16," he said to applause from party delegates 
who had complained about his leadership. "You can't look forward if you're 
hanging your head."

NUMBER OF INTERCEPTED REFUGEES SOARS

 U.S. Coast Guard cutters intercepted 1,330 Haitian refugees Monday in one of 
the busiest single days since refugees began fleeing Haiti following a 1991 
military coup. 
</P>
<P>
 The new exodus comes in the wake of President Clinton's looser policy toward 
Haitian refugees, which many expected would encourage more desperate Haitians 
to try to escape their violent, dirt-poor homeland. The new policy took effect 
11 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Haitians intercepted since Friday nearly equals the 2,239 
apprehended in all of 1993.

HAITI REPRESSION REPORTED RISING WITH SANCTIONS; CARIBBEAN: U.N. SECRETARY 
GENERAL SEES 'NO PROGRESS' TOWARD OUSTER OF MILITARY COUP LEADERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tightened international sanctions against Haiti, while failing so far to 
weaken military leaders there, have led to a defiant campaign of intensified 
repression and increased human rights abuses, U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 His report, evaluating the situation in Haiti since the Security Council 
strengthened sanctions last month at the Clinton Administration's request, 
painted a dispiriting picture. 
</P>
<P>
 On the goal of the sanctions -- the ouster of Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the army 
commander, and two of his colleagues, and the return of deposed President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide -- the secretary general reported "no progress" and, in 
fact, open defiance. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali said there had been a sharp deterioration in the human rights 
situation. He said the U.N. mission in Haiti had documented "50 politically 
related killings" since the latest sanctions resolution was adopted May 6. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases the perpetrators were identified as members of the military or 
as young toughs belonging to a paramilitary pro-Cedras organization known as 
the Revolutionary Front for Advancement and Progress in Haiti (FRAPH). 
</P>
<P>
 "The executions seem consistent with a systematic elimination of members of 
popular organizations which support the return to constitutional order," he 
told the council. He also reported "new patterns of repression, such as the 
abduction and rape of family members of political activists." 
</P>
<P>
 He described security in Haiti for diplomats and U.N. staff as "highly 
unstable" and said Haitian soldiers and armed civilians have subjected them to 
"threats and intimidation." The lack of security, the report says, has 
contributed to a deterioration of humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
 In its resolution May 6, the council tightened sanctions by extending its 
embargo on oil imports to cover all trade with the exception of food and 
medicine. Yet imports of these essential goods "have decreased considerably," 
the secretary general said, attributing this, in part, to "a scarcity of local 
currency to pay for local goods." 
</P>
<P>
 But he noted hopeful signs. Although the appeal in March, 1993, by the United 
Nations and the Organization of American States for $62.7 million in Haiti 
relief had fallen short by more than $50 million, he said the enormous deficit 
had been more than made up by donations from non-governmental organizations and 
countries acting on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussing sanctions, Boutros-Ghali said that 11 navy vessels -- eight U.S., 
one Canadian, one Argentine and one Dutch -- now make up a cordon around the 
island of Hispaniola, which Haiti shares with the Dominican Republic. France 
has promised to dispatch a French ship there soon. The report added that small 
U.S. boats have also joined the patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 While news reports have described the Dominican border with Haiti as porous, 
the secretary general stressed that the United Nations had received good 
cooperation from Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer in closing the border. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dominican president, in fact, seemed almost too cooperative. Soon after 
the council passed its resolution, he sealed the border so thoroughly that no 
food and medicine were moving into Haiti. Balaguer finally agreed the border 
should be opened to allow in the food and medicine, the report said.

FOR HAITI'S WEALTHY, CRACKDOWN HASN'T ENDED GOOD LIFE; SANCTIONS: SHOPPING IN 
MIAMI IS OUT, BUT NIGHTCLUBS, CASINOS AND RESTAURANTS IN PORT-AU-PRINCE ARE 
DOING FINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The shopping flights to Miami are no more, and their U.S. bank accounts are 
frozen. But for the Haitian elite, the stress of life has been eased: Baltic 
mousse is back. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, the privileged few in this nation of malnourished, even starving 
millions had begun to feel at least a pinprick, if not the true pain, of 
widening international sanctions imposed to try to force an end to more than 2 
1/2 years of rule by a military regime who ousted the elected president in a 
coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an executive order by President Clinton, all flights to the United 
States from Haiti are banned; Haitians face the possibility of having their 
U.S. visas lifted. Those who have money in American banks, both in the United 
States and here, have seen the funds frozen; this measure was especially aimed 
at the military and their elite backers. 
</P>
<P>
 But if all these steps have caused inconvenience and even discomfort for the 
wealthy here, who are accustomed to treating Miami like a shopping mall, the 
ache is being relieved -- even if Haitians now must stay at home -- with a 
defiant resourcefulness that continues to frustrate the world's economic 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 High on the list of still-existing pleasures, for example, was the reopening 
this past week of La Souvenance -- that most renowned of the six or so quality 
international restaurants in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 With the resumption of service at the upscale eatery in the posh, hilltop 
suburb of Petionville comes its piece de resistance: Baltic mousse, a delicate 
mix of salmon and herring roe served with capers and diced onions. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltic mousse first went missing in early spring when a worldwide fuel embargo 
designed to restore Jean-Bertrand Aristide to the presidency virtually ended 
electrical service and the needed refrigeration to keep the delicacy from 
turning into a stomach-churning pudding. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Souvenance closed about two months ago when owner Jean-Guy Barme -- 
faced with a sanction-caused shortage of perceived necessities such as French 
cheese and Belgian chocolate -- retreated to France. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an act of fatalism -- or mind-blowing optimism -- Barme has returned, 
bringing with him the delicacies that enable him to construct not only the 
sought-after hors d'oeuvre but also filet mignon served with a bone-marrow 
sauce, grilled red snapper with sorrel and any number of chateau-produced 
wines. 
</P>
<P>
 On his return, Barme found that gasoline prices had dropped to their lowest 
level in four months. Public electrical service is available to Petionville 18 
hours a day. Markets have plentiful supplies of fresh produce. And the local 
currency has actually gained value against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same story," said a diplomat from a country that has supported the 
sanctions, except for the cutoff of services such as banking, which it finds 
advantageous to its own business interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Alluding to the reports of starving and dying poor Haitians who cannot pay for 
the food and medicine that is available, he said, "We can squeeze and even 
strangle the poor here, but somehow the MREs (the morally repulsive elite, as 
the wealthy here are often called) never really are more than inconvenienced." 
</P>
<P>
 So, while the elite are deprived of the shops of Miami and easy access to U.S. 
banks, their children still cram Petionville clubs to hear popular rock groups 
and drink German beer. And for those who fancy gaming tables, the crowded 
casino at El Rancho hotel continues to pay blackjack at odds of 3-2 -- minimum 
bet $10 (U.S.), if you please. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this comes at a time when the United States appears to have exhausted 
all means of exerting economic pressure. Although U.S. Embassy spokesman 
Stanley Shrager says "we still have some arrows in our quiver" as he hinted at 
a revocation of all U.S. visas for Haitians, there isn't much left. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've destroyed our businesses, unemployment is probably over 85%, we can't 
get out, we can't get our money, we can't even send our children to college (in 
the United States)," said a businesswoman. "But it won't bring Aristide back, 
not unless he comes back in a Marine tank, and what would he come back to? A 
country plowed back into the 18th Century." 
</P>
<P>
 But "the point really is," she said, "that the rich here can survive, and so 
can the military. The army gets its money from smuggling and extortion and 
keeps it in cash, or it simply takes it from the treasury. The rich saw all 
this coming and made the necessary plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not rich," she said, "but I'm not stupid. I'm stocked for at least four 
months, and I know we all can get what we need." 
</P>
<P>
 How is that done? In Haitian terms, it happens the old-fashioned way: Blame it 
on smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime source continues to be the neighboring Dominican Republic, which is 
supplying enough gasoline so that the price -- although well beyond the reach 
of most Haitians at $7.50 a gallon -- has dropped more than 20% in less than a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "You (Americans) think you can either pressure the Dominicans or bribe them 
into closing the border," said a businessman engaged in smuggling. "Maybe that 
will work with (President Joaquin) Balaguer, but not with the majors and 
colonels on the border. They want the money for their pockets, so as long as we 
have the dollars we can get whatever we want."

SHAKE-UP AT THE WHITE HOUSE; GERGEN'S STAR A BIT DIMMER AS HE SHOOTS OVER TO 
STATE; ADVISER: CLINTON MOVES HIS AIDE OVER TO CHRISTOPHER'S STAFF. THOSE 
SAYING GOODBY AND THOSE SAYING HELLO TO HIM ARE BOTH EXPRESSING JOY.

<P>
 When he came to the White House 13 months ago, he was "the Amazing Gergen," a 
bipartisan spin master who could remake any President's image as good as new. 
</P>
<P>
 But over a year of bruising battles, David Gergen's magic -- and the White 
House staff's welcome -- slowly wore thin. 
</P>
<P>
 So when President Clinton announced Monday that he was moving Gergen to the 
State Department, he wasn't just offering him a job, he was granting him 
political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen said he had long planned to leave the White House before this fall's 
congressional campaign anyway. "I did not want to be involved in any Democratic 
campaign against Republicans," the former Ronald Reagan aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen's detractors in the White House, after months of grumbling about the 
moderate Republican in their New Democrat midst, were jubilant. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems this White House has is too damn many free riders," 
growled one Clinton aide. "At least now they've gotten rid of one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, both Gergen and Secretary of State Warren Christopher pronounced 
themselves delighted with the deal, which makes the White House aide a "special 
adviser" to both the President and the secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 That newly invented title could make Gergen an unexpectedly powerful voice in 
foreign policy, aides said, for it comes with a seat on the White House 
National Security Council's "principals committee," where key decisions are 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 It will put Gergen in a position to beef up the Administration's foreign 
policy apparatus where Clinton and Christopher believe it to be weakest: public 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 And it means that no further changes in top foreign policy jobs are in view, 
another senior official said. "This locks it in until the end of the year," the 
official said, when Clinton is expected to consider whether he should stick 
with Christopher and Anthony Lake, his national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has frequently come under fire for apparent confusion in foreign 
policy. The President told The Times last month that he considered his policies 
sound but that he recognized a need to do "a better job of communicating." 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen, in an interview, said his new job would focus on "substance too." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the President's foreign policy team is a lot better than it's given 
credit for," he said. "I don't pretend to be a world-class expert on foreign 
policy. . . . I hope I can help pull the strands together." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, in a written statement, said he was "enthusiastic" about the 
change and hoped Gergen could help the Administration "better communicate its 
foreign policy goals to the American people." 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen said he had long planned to leave the White House by Oct. 15 and had 
talked to both Christopher and White House Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty 
about the possibility of a foreign policy job. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it came to a head faster than I thought it would," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another official said the deal was cut on Saturday, when Vice President Al 
Gore telephoned Christopher to ask if he could make a place for Gergen. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were going to let Gergen walk out," the official said. "There wouldn't 
have been a place for him." 
</P>
<P>
 That would have been an abrupt fall for the White House counselor, who was 
widely credited for rescuing Clinton's image in the middle of a foundering 
first year. But Christopher, who has grown to admire Gergen, quickly decided 
that he could use the extra help. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen will work closely with Christopher's top political aide, Thomas E. 
Donilon, and with State Department spokesman Michael McCurry -- without 
colliding with either one, all three promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen said he still planned to leave the government entirely by the end of 
the year, largely at his wife's urging. 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher intends to ask him to stay longer, a senior State Department 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen said he would not respond to that suggestion -- not on the record, 
anyway, although it appeared Christopher would have little to lose by asking. 
By Comparison, a Quick Exit 
</P>
<P>
 Though past presidents have shifted chiefs of staff, President Clinton has 
ordered his shake-up much earlier in his tenure than any of his recent 
predecessors.

SHAKE-UP AT THE WHITE HOUSE; PANETTA SELECTION EXPECTED TO SERVE SEVERAL 
PURPOSES; WHITE HOUSE: HE FACES TASKS OF BRINGING ORDER TO THE STAFF AND 
INCREASING PRESIDENT'S LEVERAGE WITH CONGRESS. 
</P>

 When Leon Panetta first talked to Bill Clinton about a job in 1992, he was 
neither a campaign stalwart nor a longtime Arkansas friend. The 15-year 
California congressman had even taken a shot at Clinton's campaign manifesto 
for what he viewed as its overly rosy budgetary arithmetic. 
</P>
<P>
 But if those facts ever stirred any doubts in the inner circle, they are long 
forgotten now. 
</P>
<P>
 In 17 months as director of Clinton's Office of Management and Budget, Panetta 
showed Clinton his skill as an ideological advocate, an administrator and a 
high-profile representative to Congress and the public. In the process, the 
affable one-time Republican also convinced Clinton that he could use his 
well-honed Washington skills to put straight the much-criticized disorder of 
his White House staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the President is looking for is somebody who has the knowledge to make 
that system work," said Tony Coelho, the former California congressman who is 
now an outside White House political adviser. "Leon has that knowledge, and he 
has it in depth." 
</P>
<P>
 His appointment is expected to serve a number of purposes at once, 
Administration officials said. Panetta is expected not only to help unstick the 
balky gears of power at the White House but also to increase the President's 
leverage with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if he did nothing at all with Congress, Leon is so well respected that 
they will take tremendous comfort just from the fact that he's there," 
predicted one White House official. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta also may help the beleaguered President with the wide circle of 
contacts in the news media that he has cultivated in his years on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Long known as a deficit hawk, Panetta became a principal architect of the 
Administration's five-year 1993 economic plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will go down in history as the OMB director who did, I think, virtually 
the impossible," Clinton said Monday in introducing his new chief of staff. The 
Administration considers it one of its chief accomplishments that the annual 
federal budget deficit is now in its third year of slowing and will fall below 
$200 billion this year for the first time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opening months of the Clinton Administration, Panetta argued vigorously 
for deficit cutting -- so vigorously, in fact, that he drew denunciations from 
others who wanted a freer-spending White House. "The Poster Boy for Economic 
Constipation" was the label applied to him by Paul Begala, one of Clinton's 
presidential campaign managers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who doesn't think Leon, the nice guy, isn't tough enough has never 
debated him," said Begala. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta also won points for shepherding through Congress a plan that 
ultimately squeaked through by a single vote. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials say Clinton was also impressed by Panetta's management 
of OMB. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta showed he did not gladly suffer poor performance, firing two top-level 
appointees in the first year. He also made clear that it was he, not Alice M. 
Rivlin, his strong-willed deputy, who was running the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 He also improved morale at an agency that had been demoralized by a former 
director, Richard Darman, an administrator who kept the reins of power almost 
exclusively in his own hands. "Spirits had been pretty darn low among the 
green-eyeshade people," said Gary Bass, executive director of OMB Watch, a 
liberal advocacy group. "But he changed that." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta's term has not been without its difficult moments. In April, 1993, 
Panetta confessed to a group of reporters that he thought the President's 
economic plan was in deep trouble and that the North American Free Trade 
Agreement was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The downbeat assessment sent shock waves through Washington, but Clinton 
accepted Panetta's apology without fuss. A week later Clinton was defending him 
as having done a "wonderful job" for the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass said Panetta's candor was the reflex of a former congressman who had been 
largely free before to confide his deepest thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 But while observers say Panetta is tough enough for the new job, few describe 
him as a head-cracking chief of staff in the mold of John H. Sununu or H.R. 
(Bob) Haldeman, who served former Presidents George Bush and Richard Nixon 
respectively. Rather, his technique is to win over adversaries with polite but 
ceaseless argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) recalled the way Panetta would wrest an 
agreement out of opponents while he chaired the House Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had these really long meetings where he would sort of wear down the 
opposition" -- including such polar opposites as liberal Rep. Barney Frank 
(D-Mass.) and conservative Rep. Charles W. Stenholm (D-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta, who represented the Monterey coast in Congress, first won headlines 
for being fired. Working for the Nixon Administration in 1970, he was dismissed 
as head of the civil rights office of the Department of Health, Education and 
Welfare after pushing for aggressive action. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a year, he had switched to the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta is the son of Italian immigrant parents who ran a restaurant in Ft. 
Ord. Some officials believe Panetta's California connections may have been 
another point in his favor in landing his new job.

SHAKE-UP AT THE WHITE HOUSE; 'TINY ALICE' WITH THE BIG ECONOMIC PICTURE; STAFF: 
RIVLIN, THE NEW OMB DIRECTOR, HEWED TO THE CRY FOR DEFICIT REDUCTION. SHE HAS 
WON CONVERTS SINCE LAST YEAR'S BLOODY BUDGET BATTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the first months of the Clinton Administration last year, two camps waged a 
ferocious battle over the direction of the Administration's first budget -- and 
of the Clinton presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the winners was Alice Mitchell Rivlin, a tenacious bureaucratic 
infighter and an unchallenged authority on federal spending, who on Monday was 
promoted to budget director. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's campaign advisers had wanted a budget with an all-out tax attack on 
the wealthy and tens of billions of dollars in new spending for the poor and 
the beleaguered middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 But the President's economic team wanted deficit reduction and more deficit 
reduction, to soothe the financial markets and win political support from 
conservative Democrats and anti-government Ross Perot voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic advisers won, decisively. And Rivlin, then deputy budget 
director, was in the vanguard. 
</P>
<P>
 The diminutive 63-year-old economist, known as "Tiny Alice" in her years on 
Capitol Hill, was often acerbic in defending the deficit-reduction strategy, 
belittling the economic ignorance of the political team in heated White House 
meetings on the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those political advisers, senior campaign aide Paul Begala, believed 
Rivlin and the other deficit hawks were like evil spirits possessing the 
President's soul, driving him away from the people and the ideas that elected 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 But Begala has since come to believe that Rivlin was right and -- in what may 
be a first in American politics -- has confessed the error of his ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not paid to see beyond the next election," Begala said Monday. "She sees 
not only past the next election but into the next generation. She's helped me 
see that paying down the deficit was a necessary first step to expanding the 
economy. And darned if she wasn't right." 
</P>
<P>
 The shift of Leon E. Panetta from director of the Office of Management and 
Budget to White House chief of staff and the elevation of Rivlin to OMB 
director was welcomed both in political and financial circles. 
</P>
<P>
 Her appointment, which requires Senate confirmation, means continuity in 
Administration fiscal policy and a continued commitment to taming the federal 
budget deficit, according to Robert D. Reischauer, director of the 
Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytical shop that Rivlin ran 
from its inception in 1975 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta and Rivlin "are actually quite different as individuals, but their 
concern about the deficit, their knowledge of what's causing federal spending 
to rise and their ability to fashion solutions are very similar," Reischauer 
said. "They both have considerable Hill expertise -- Alice as a staff figure, 
Leon as a member -- and that is a difference, but their similar views mean that 
we'll likely see a continuity in policy." 
</P>
<P>
 That was welcome news in the financial community, which has been closely 
monitoring the Clinton Administration for any signs of tax-and-spendism. As 
long as the White House remains committed to deficit reduction and spending 
restraint, Wall Street is prepared to reward Clinton with relatively low 
interest rates, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marianne Feeley, a senior economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago, said 
Rivlin's appointment would reassure Wall Street that the Administration 
intended to continue along the path set in last year's budget, which contained 
nearly $500 billion in deficit reduction over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivlin, who holds a Ph.D. in economics from Radcliffe College and has worked 
for years as a senior economic analyst at the Brookings Institution in 
Washington, described herself in a recent book as a "fanatical, card-carrying 
middle-of-the-roader." 
</P>
<P>
 At the CBO she refused to give policy recommendations, for fear of tainting 
the office's objectivity, and would not allow her budget estimates to be 
twisted to support policies that she regarded as irresponsible. CBO budget 
estimates gained a level of credibility that they retain to this day, 11 years 
after her departure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress has fussed at us but never tried to change the numbers," she once 
said in an interview. Her analyses also challenged budgetary claims made by 
former Presidents Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, and she 
emerged unscathed.

HIGH COURT UPHOLDS CHURCH-STATE SPLIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court, insisting on a strict separation of church and state, 
struck down Monday a New York law that had carved out a special school district 
to serve the children of a separatist religious sect. 
</P>
<P>
 The Constitution does not allow a "united civic and religious authority" in 
the United States, the court said, even for the special purpose of educating 
the disabled children of a Hasidic community. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 6-3 vote, the justices concluded that state lawmakers violated the First 
Amendment in 1989 when they gave the members of the Satmar Hasidic sect their 
own public school district. The entity, called the Village of Kiryas Joel 
District, was created to take care of the needs of children too handicapped to 
go to private religious schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling deals a setback not only to the Hasidic sect in this case, but to 
mainstream Christian groups that had urged the justices to allow greater 
government "accommodation" of religion. For example, Pat Robertson's American 
Center for Law and Justice had urged the high court to make clear that public 
policies are not unconstitutional simply because they aid a religious group. 
</P>
<P>
 But other groups, including the Anti-Defamation League, praised the court for 
adhering to its strict-separation policy. 
</P>
<P>
 For a decade, New York lawmakers have struggled to find a way to provide 
special education to children of the Satmar Hasidic sect. Its members left 
Brooklyn in the mid-1970s and settled in a rustic community 30 miles north of 
New York City. They were located within the boundaries of Monroe-Woodbury 
School District, but most of their children attended private, religious 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, much of problem that led to Monday's ruling began with the Supreme 
Court itself. Federal law requires public schools to provide a "free, 
appropriate public education" to all disabled children. Before 1985, most 
public school districts served disabled children in private schools by sending 
in special tutors. 
</P>
<P>
 But that year, the high court deemed this practice unconstitutional in 
parochial schools because it "entangled" church and state. 
</P>
<P>
 New York lawmakers passed a measure to create a school district in the 
village. Its one school served just 40 students, and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo called 
it a reasonable solution "to a unique problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But the New York courts disagreed and struck down the law because it created 
"a symbolic union between church and state." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the New York attorney general and lawyers for the Hasidic sect appealed, 
leading to Monday's decision in Kiryas Joel vs. Grumet, 93-517.

U.S. WEAPON-GRADE URANIUM PRODUCTION TOPS ESTIMATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS W. LIPPMAN and R. JEFFREY SMITH, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. government produced far greater quantities of highly enriched, 
weapon-grade uranium from 1945 to 1992 than previously known, Energy Secretary 
Hazel O'Leary disclosed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Government factories in Ohio and Tennessee produced 994 metric tons of 
weapon-grade uranium, well above the usual estimate of about 700.Almost 259 
metric tons of the material, which is highly radioactive and relatively easy to 
convert into bombs, remains in the U.S. stockpile, according to Energy 
Department figures declassified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Weapon-grade uranium may be converted to civilian use, but the Energy 
Department has not made a long-term decision about what to do with the surplus 
material. Some of it is to be retained as fuel for Navy reactors, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Energy Department wants to reduce the stockpile, and the Russian 
stockpile of about 500 metric tons, to limit the threat that the material could 
fall into the wrong hands. A bomb could be fashioned from 25 kilograms, 
according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, so each metric ton could 
make 40 devices. 
</P>
<P>
 The uranium figures were contained in hundreds of pages of material about the 
U.S. nuclear weapon program made public by O'Leary in the second phase of her 
"openness initiative," an ambitious attempt to dismantle the department's 
history of classification and secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary also made public 48 radiation experiments conducted by the government 
on humans since the 1920s, including several cases in which radioactive 
isotopes were given to pregnant women, mental patients, or terminally ill 
persons. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Defense Department blocked disclosure of two other secrets long sought 
by independent researchers and anti-nuclear activists: the total number of 
warheads produced by the United States each year and the number now in the U.S. 
nuclear arsenal.

HOUSE PANEL ASKS FISKE TO TESTIFY ON WHITEWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The House Banking Committee will begin Whitewater hearings July 26 and has 
asked special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. and top White House officials to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said Monday he invited Fiske to 
report on the "Washington phase" of his inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said the first hearing would focus on the removal of Whitewater files 
from White House Deputy Counsel Vincent Foster's office by White House 
officials after his death last July. Gonzalez is not expected to concentrate on 
the circumstances of Foster's death, which authorities ruled a suicide. 
</P>

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; FACING SUPREME TEST AS A FRIEND; RELATIONSHIPS: 
CLOSENESS OF SIMPSON-COWLINGS BONDING IS REGARDED AS UNUSUAL IN MEN. MALE 
FRIENDSHIPS OFTEN INVOLVE A FIERCE SENSE OF LOYALTY, RESEARCHERS SAY.

<P>
 At some point on Friday, June 17, O.J. Simpson and his good friend, Al 
Cowlings, arrived at a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Left alone in a downstairs room of the sprawling San Fernando Valley home of 
friend Robert Kardashian, with Simpson's attorney, Robert L. Shapiro, and 
several other people conferring in a conference room upstairs, the pair fled. 
Equipped with a cellular phone and a gun, they slipped away in a white Ford 
Bronco, beginning what would be one of the most dramatic police chases and 
surrenders in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson may have had an understandable reason for running: guilty or innocent, 
he faced two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances, leaving 
him vulnerable to a death sentence if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cowlings? 
</P>
<P>
 What prompted this ex-football player to risk his reputation, his freedom, 
even his life, to stick with his friend? 
</P>
<P>
 Cowlings, 47, will not say. He has been charged with suspicion of aiding and 
abetting a fugitive and is free on $250,000 bond. But his attorney, Donald M. 
Re, said: 
</P>
<P>
 "A.C. is one of the most loyal, trusting friends anyone could have. I am 
absolutely convinced his only effort was to make sure that O.J. surrendered 
alive. I'm very hopeful that the district attorney will take that into account, 
and will see fit not to bring charges against him." 
</P>
<P>
 The details of what transpired between the two men over the course of that 
exhausting day may never be known. But, according to behavioral experts, though 
Cowlings' actions were extraordinary, male friendships often involve a fierce 
sense of loyalty and facile willingness to do battle together. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers in the relatively new field of the psychology of male friendships 
are finding that males differ distinctly from females in ways that often become 
obvious in times of emotional stress. Among their findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Close male friendships usually arise in childhood and adolescence. But by 
adulthood, many men do not have the kind of buddy who will lay down his life 
for his friend, as some believe Cowlings did. 
</P>
<P>
 * Men's friendships are characterized by the reluctance -- or inability -- to 
talk about their emotions in an intimate way. Likewise, many men dislike 
discussing even factual aspects of their relationships with women. 
</P>
<P>
 * A friend is often a more effective counselor in a crisis situation than a 
relative or professional counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unlike relatives, most friends consciously weigh the pros and cons of 
getting involved in a buddy's problems. But women, more so than men, may take 
greater stock of a situation before becoming embroiled. 
</P>
<P>
 The friendship between Simpson and Cowlings is intriguing, experts said, 
because of the risk they assumed together. It's a "Butch Cassidy and the 
Sundance Kid" story for the '90s, said Los Angeles psychologist Drury Sherrod. 
</P>
<P>
 "For good or for ill, they represent the (image) of men who lay down their 
lives for their buddies," said Sherrod, who has studied male friendship. "But 
it is surprising that they even had this relationship. It's pretty rare for 
that sort of friendship to exist among adult males. Most adult males don't have 
close friends they can call on." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sherrod, studies show that close male friendships usually form in 
childhood, adolescence and early adulthood, often revolving around "male 
bonding" activities, such as sports or military duty. 
</P>
<P>
 But in adulthood, those tight friendships tend to relax as the activities that 
initially brought them together, such as sports endeavors or military 
enlistment, decline. In surveys, most men list their wife as their best friend, 
he says. (Women tend to name another woman.) 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not known what motivated Cowlings to stand by Simpson last 
week, it is clear from interviews with friends that the two were especially 
close, boyhood friends who played college and professional football together. 
</P>
<P>
 In perhaps the most telling sign of their bond, Simpson thanked Cowlings in a 
letter penned before the flight incident: "Man, thanks for being in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what distinguishes (them) is they have maintained their friendship 
when most men don't," Sherrod said. "In some ways, it's the classic adolescent 
male friendship extended into later life." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not surprising, given this relationship, that Simpson would turn to 
Cowlings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, men won't go to anybody (when in despair)," Sherrod said. "What is 
rare is that Simpson could draw on Cowlings. They grew up together, boyhood 
friends who saw each other through everything. In his stress, it seems 
reasonable to me that is who (Simpson) turned to." 
</P>
<P>
 It is traditional in male friendships to place great importance on loyalty, 
said Harvard psychologist Ron Levant, a leader in the studies of male 
psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this comes from traditional masculinity that was forged in a harder 
time, when men had to do battle with each other," he said. "The idea of 
absolute loyalty was very important. If you are in combat with somebody, you 
could count on that person absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage of this type of friendship is that it can be lifesaving, said 
educational psychologist Paul R. Welter, who has studied the importance of 
friendship. His research indicates that a friend -- rather than a relative, 
attorney or counselor -- may be the best person to have around when the going 
gets tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "To help someone, there has to be a relationship and some objectivity," said 
Welter who was formerly at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. "Family 
members have a long history with the person and are too close to help. They are 
not objective enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Therapists may be objective but usually do not have a long-established and 
trusted relationship with their client. 
</P>
<P>
 "A friend supplies the two things (objectivity and closeness) that a family 
member or counselor can't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends have been shown to be highly effective in counseling seriously 
depressed or suicidal people, said Welter, author of the book "How to Help a 
Friend." 
</P>
<P>
 "Just based on what I read, I think there is a good chance that O.J. Simpson's 
life was saved because of a caring friend," he said. "Everything pointed to the 
fact that things were getting worse with Simpson. What keeps a person from 
coming completely apart is one friend staying with them. Someone who says: 'I 
will stay with you, and I'm not going to abandon you.' The presence of a caring 
friend keeps a person from pulling a trigger." 
</P>
<P>
 But the weakness of close male friendships is the inability to talk intimately 
to each other, particularly when under stress, says Levant. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent research in male psychology suggests that men dealing with a heavy 
emotional burden tend to act rather than talk. 
</P>
<P>
 In his theory of "male-role socialization," Levant describes men's inability 
to deal with emotions. Under this explanation, men lack "emotional 
intelligence," Levant said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That includes two things: The inability to put oneself in another person's 
shoes and sense what they are feeling, and the lack of emotional 
self-awareness." 
</P>
<P>
 Although women are highly adept at discussing their emotions, men often suffer 
from what Levant calls "alexithymia," which means "without words for emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are more emotionally empathetic than men," he said. "If you ask a woman 
how she feels, she will describe layer after layer of emotions. Men will say 
what they did, not what they feel," Levant said. 
</P>
<P>
 This characteristic is because of "the male-gender role, in which men are 
required to develop an element of stoicism and to deny to themselves either 
vulnerable emotions, such as shame, fear or hurt, or caring emotions, such as 
closeness, tenderness and affection. These are drummed out of males in the 
course of boyhood socialization," said Levant, who describes his theory in the 
upcoming book "Masculinity Reconstructed." 
</P>
<P>
 One can surmise that in the Simpson case, "you have a desperate man and 
another man who wants to be loyal," he said. "They can't do what they really 
need to do, which is talk about the emotional aspects of the situation. And so 
they act. That is part of the male code -- to be action-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
 Being able to release emotions by talking about them -- as women often do -- 
usually results in making better decisions, Levant said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If men are able to talk about emotions to a friend who would listen with 
understanding, they might come to some emotional resolution," he said. "They 
won't feel so panicky and the emotion won't drive them. The emotional boil will 
have been lanced. Most people can then choose a more reasonable course of 
action." 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to view Cowlings with sympathy, Welter said, because he was 
probably faced with a rare predicament that is known in psychology as a "tragic 
moral choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of having the choice between right and wrong, or two rights, Cowlings 
-- presumably -- was faced with two wrongs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is wrong to aid and abet a fugitive. It is also wrong to let a person 
die," Welter said. "The moral person will choose the lesser of two evils. If 
there is a higher regard for the sanctity of life than the other, they will 
choose not letting the person die." 
</P>
<P>
 Facing such a crushing choice is rare in most lives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are faced with little tragic moral choices. For example, people might ask: 
'Should I lie or say: That is a terrible tie'? But the big choices, like what 
Al Cowlings faced . . . there aren't too many of those." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, friends usually have a choice about whether to get embroiled in 
someone else's woes. While family members are often forced into making hard 
choices on the behalf of loved ones, friends are more likely to feel an option 
to get involved or back off, he says. In this regard, a friend who gets 
involved seems particularly heroic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends weigh the consequences," Welter said. "Friends say: 'My presence is 
needed in the situation. There may be negative consequences, but I can't in 
good conscience not do this.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The question to me is not whether (Cowlings) did the right thing or the wrong 
thing. But did he do the thing he thought O.J. Simpson needed in order to stay 
alive?" Welter said. "One has to respect somebody who makes every effort to 
stay with a friend for whom everything is going worse and worse and worse." 
</P>
<P>
 More so than with women, male friends may choose to come to each other's aid 
without fully knowing the circumstances. Women typically want all the details 
before getting involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Research on human behavior suggests that the pair's decision to flee may have 
been grounded in that very simplistic bond of friendship -- not Cowlings' 
intimate knowledge of the facts, Sherrod said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so speculative because nothing is known about what they said. But I 
don't think you can assume this was a counseling-type relationship. It was 
somebody to call on to help him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies also show that men are loathe to confide in each other about personal 
situations, such as relationship problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women talk about relationships and problems. Women reveal their 
vulnerabilities to each other. Men don't," Sherrod said. "Males don't like 
dealing with conflicts in a relationship. If there were some conflicts, it 
would be typical for men to avoid them. That would make it easier for Cowlings 
to say: 'I don't care what he did, I'm going to help him out.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Men develop intimacy by acting together against some obstacle. In this way, 
Cowlings' actions might be construed as a true test of his friendship with 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men may have a more unquestioning style of friendship than women," Sherrod 
said. "When men are friends, in some ways, it's a less complicated friendship. 
There is a saying that women's friendships are face to face and men's are side 
by side." 
</P>
<P>
 And the true test of male friendship is being side by side, against the odds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a test of ability," Sherrod said. "It's two guys with unquestionable 
allegiance, facing a risk together. It's a mythologized male friendship; the 
kind of friendship where it's you and your friend against the world."

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; THE TIMES POLL; HALF SAY THEY ARE SYMPATHETIC TOWARD 
SIMPSON; BLACKS ARE NEARLY TWICE AS LIKELY AS WHITES TO HOLD THAT OPINION. 
OVERALL, MANY RESPONDENTS ARE CRITICAL OF GARCETTI AND MEDIA COVERAGE OF THE 
CASE.

 Public opinion in Los Angeles is divided regarding NFL Hall of Fame football 
player O.J. Simpson, with roughly half the respondents in a Los Angeles Times 
poll saying they are sympathetic toward the man accused of killing his ex-wife 
and her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinions are also split by race, with African Americans almost twice as likely 
as whites to sympathize with the black sports star. Seventy-four percent of the 
African American respondents said they were either "very" or "somewhat" 
sympathetic toward Simpson, compared to 38% of whites and 50% of Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 The racial division also showed up in a question regarding the handling of the 
case by Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. Sixty-three percent of African Americans 
polled said Garcetti, who has appeared frequently on television shows to talk 
about the case, has behaved irresponsibly while 37% of whites said that. 
Overall, 43% of respondents said Garcetti behaved responsibly, and 40% said he 
behaved irresponsibly. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama, which for the past two weeks has received nearly nonstop television 
coverage and has dominated many newspapers, continues to have a rapt audience. 
About four in five poll respondents said they have followed the story closely. 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, however, those polled have not been impressed with the coverage. 
In fact, 67% of respondents believe the media have been irresponsible, a 
complaint that has been echoed in critiques published on opinion pages and 
broadcast on public affairs and news programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The random telephone poll of 1,023 adults was conducted Saturday and Sunday 
and has a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 The bloodied bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman were 
discovered early June 13 outside her Brentwood townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 One particularly controversial element of the news coverage has been the 
release and broadcast of a taped 911 call made in 1989 by a panicked Nicole 
Simpson to report that her husband had broken into her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the 911 tape should have been revealed," said 21-year-old 
Keyaltayna Johnson, who, in an answer to the poll, said she felt sympathy for 
Simpson. "It had nothing to do with what happened. That was in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the poll found 48% of city residents were sympathetic to Simpson and 
41% were not. More women (52%) were sympathetic than men (43%). 
</P>
<P>
 The degree of sympathy for Simpson in Los Angeles is similar to what was found 
in a national poll conducted by CNN and the Gallup Poll on June 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Lois Heaney, an expert in jury selection with the National Jury Project/West 
in Oakland, said the apparent high degree of sympathy for a man who was a 
fixture of popular culture for more than two decades means that many people are 
still withholding judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 Respondent Paul Olkin, a 41-year-old Rancho Park respiratory therapist, said 
he is ambivalent about Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not condemning him, but I'm not saying he is innocent either," Olkin 
said. "I'd like to know." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he remains angry about how police handled the events of June 17, when 
Simpson was found driving on an Orange County freeway and allowed to return 
home. "They let him take this merry little car ride, where, had it been anyone 
else . . . they certainly wouldn't have been allowed to go into the house, go 
to the bathroom and have something to drink" before being taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Olkin was among 38% of those polled who said Simpson had been treated too 
leniently by police. Overall, 49% said Simpson had been treated as deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 23% of the African Americans polled said Simpson had been treated too 
leniently while 43% of the whites felt that way.

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; DEFENSE PATHOLOGIST A FAMILIAR FACE; FORENSICS: NEW 
YORKER MICHAEL BADEN HAS WORKED ON SEVERAL IMPORTANT CASES, INCLUDING THE 
SLAYINGS OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY AND MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nationally acclaimed pathologist Dr. Michael Baden, hired to assist in the 
defense of O.J. Simpson, needed no introductions when he arrived in Los Angeles 
to work on the murder case. He already knew most of the principals working for 
the defense and prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York City-based forensics specialist worked with Simpson attorney 
Robert L. Shapiro on the Christian Brando case and first met Dist. Atty. Gil 
Garcetti when he performed a second autopsy on the body of former football star 
Ron Settles, who died mysteriously in the Signal Hill jail in 1981. Baden has 
also locked horns at various times with members of the Los Angeles County 
coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, he has worked on some of the most celebrated murder cases in 
recent history, including the slayings of President John F. Kennedy, Martin 
Luther King Jr. and Medgar Evers. 
</P>
<P>
 Baden led the 1979 Congress-backed reexamination of evidence in the Kennedy 
assassination, which supported the original Warren Commission finding that Lee 
Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman. In the King case, Baden disproved a theory 
that a black powder found on King's neck was gunpowder. If that contention had 
been true, it would have meant the civil rights leader was fired on at close 
range and would have undermined the case against James Earl Ray, who was 
convicted of killing King. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Evers case, Baden conducted a second autopsy 28 years after the civil 
rights leader was gunned down, and the findings helped convict 73-year-old 
Byron De La Beckwith, whose two earlier trials resulted in deadlocked juries. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Baden can come up with the same headline-grabbing conclusions in the 
Simpson case remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he has been tight-lipped about the case, in which he is teamed with 
another well-known forensic scientist, Henry C. Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 Baden's job will be to examine the positions of bodies, the depth of wounds, 
coloration around the wounds, the angles of penetration and anything else that 
contributed to the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle 
Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 If past cases are a guide, Baden probably will be able to determine, on the 
basis of wounds, which of the victims was struck first, whether the blows were 
defensive or offensive, whether elements such as self-defense or torture were 
involved. Baden might also be able to tell whether the first blows were struck 
to kill, and whether there was an intent to kill both victims or just one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not here to look for any particular evidence. We are here to find 
whatever evidence we find," he said. "This means gathering evidence, and trying 
to reconstruct, as best as possible, what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to describe what he does, Baden said: "Our job is to listen to the dead 
body and let it tell us what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 On June 20, Baden got his first glimpse of the findings of the autopsies 
performed by the Los Angeles County coroner's office on the two murder victims. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 21, less than 24 hours after picking up the autopsy reports, Baden was 
in a courtroom in New Jersey, involved in another case. 
</P>
<P>
 And the next day, he was back in Los Angeles, going over autopsy reports and 
crime scene photographs in the coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Such transcontinental case-hoping is nothing new to Baden, 59, a tall man with 
longish gray hair, a bushy mustache and wire-rim glasses that give him a 
professorial look. He often handles several cases at once. Still another 
high-profile case he is working on involves charges against Waneta Hoyt, a New 
York mother accused of killing five babies and blaming it on sudden infant 
death syndrome. Baden is working for the prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 The pathologist estimates that he has presided over 20,000 autopsies in a 
32-year career. He works for the New York State Police as director of forensic 
sciences. But that is only a part-time job, and Baden often works for defense 
attorneys as an independent pathologist. 
</P>
<P>
 The physician's agreement with the state of New York is that he will never 
work against state prosecutors in a criminal case, but that he is free to work 
for defense attorneys outside his home state. 
</P>
<P>
 Baden, a former chief medical examiner for New York City, estimates that he 
works for defense teams about half the time in his private practice. 
</P>
<P>
 A colleague, Dr. Cyril Wecht, said he and Baden were testifying in a 
Wilkes-Barre, Pa., murder case when the New York City pathologist got the call 
from Shapiro asking him to join the Simpson case. Baden, in the Wilkes-Barre 
case, was testifying for the prosecution; Wecht was testifying for the defense, 
not the first time they have locked horns. Wecht, a forensic pathologist and 
lawyer who works in Pittsburgh, served on the Kennedy committee and took the 
minority view, arguing against Baden that there was more than one gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those differences, Wecht said in a telephone interview, he has high 
regard for Baden, calling him bright and very competent. 
</P>
<P>
 Baden has had some successes undermining cases presented by Los Angeles County 
law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Christian Brando, the son of actor Marlon Brando, police 
accused the defendant of shooting his half sister's lover to death as the 
victim lay sleeping on a couch. Brando said the gun went off during a struggle 
with the victim, Dag Drollet. Baden, called into the case by Shapiro, found 
that gunshot residue on both of Drollet's hands could have been caused only if 
his hands were on top or near the weapon, a finding that supported Brando's 
claim. The murder charge against Brando was dropped and he was allowed to plead 
guilty to manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Settles case, the coroner's staff, after examining the football 
star's body, supported the contention by Signal Hill police that the young man 
had hanged himself in his jail cell. After exhuming the body and conducting a 
second autopsy, Baden said he believed the death was caused by a chokehold 
administered by police. The family, which had brought Baden into the case, won 
a large settlement.

KNITZ PLEADS GUILTY IN O.C. WATER DISTRICT CASE; SCANDAL: HE WILL PAY $20,000 
FINE AND DO COMMUNITY SERVICE IN PLEA DEAL. JUDGE ASTONISHED BY LENIENCY. 
</P>

 Walter W. (Bill) Knitz, former general manager of the Santa Margarita Water 
District whose use of public funds for self-described "perks" enraged 
ratepayers and ultimately cost him his job, pleaded guilty to criminal 
conflict-of-interest charges Monday and agreed to reimburse the district 
$20,000 for a portion of his excessive expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The 62-year-old Knitz, who held the district's top post for 17 1/2 years until 
his abrupt retirement last year, agreed to a plea-bargain that also requires 
him to perform 200 hours of community service and refrain from involvement with 
Santa Margarita or any other water district for the next three years, and bars 
him from lobbying officials of any state, local or county agency for four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's through doing business in Orange County with any water district," said 
Marc Kelly, the deputy district attorney handling cases against four former or 
current district officials. "The glory days are over. This is a pretty big fall 
from grace." 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Court Judge Blair T. Barnette expressed astonishment over the 
seeming laxity of the punishment. Knitz faced up to six months in jail and 
$10,000 fines each on 19 of the criminal charges he faced. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's hearing, Knitz pleaded guilty to a total of 23 misdemeanors for 
his failure to disclose the extent of gifts he accepted from companies that he 
then recommended for contracts in violation of state conflict-of-interest laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The gifts came principally from two firms -- MacDonald-Stephens Engineers and 
Robert Bein, William Frost & Associates -- that performed almost all of the 
district's engineering work. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're talking about this amount of money, there is usually a discussion 
of jail time," Barnette said, characterizing the sum Knitz is obliged to pay as 
restitution for a "$20,000 theft." 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Kelly suggested that Barnette might not have been 
sufficiently familiar with the particulars of the case, having looked it over 
for the first time only minutes before the plea was entered in his court. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said the judge may have been under the impression that the $20,000 
represented embezzled public funds, rather than what prosecutors felt were 
merely questionable or excessive sums on Knitz's expense accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 But others also questioned whether the punishment fit the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, The Times revealed that Knitz and his top assistant, Michael P. 
Lord, accepted more than $60,000 in gifts from companies to which they 
illegally helped steer nearly $20 million in district business. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the two officials were chalking up $160,000 on their 
district expense accounts, frequently for items as questionable as the $245 
Knitz paid for a limousine to wait for him while he had a $121 lunch at the 
Tavern on the Green in Manhattan's Central Park, and to take him for a 
five-hour sightseeing trip -- "just killing some time" -- before heading to the 
airport for his return to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord was found to have charged the district for a trip to New York with a 
girlfriend, and $200 for tickets to a Broadway show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that it? Are you serious?" asked John J. Schatz, current general manager 
of the Santa Margarita Water District, after learning the terms of the plea 
agreement. "I'd say (Knitz) did very well. I didn't expect jail time, but I did 
expect the fine would be substantially higher." 
</P>
<P>
 Schatz said a $20,000 reimbursement would make little difference to the water 
district, whose new managers are trying to cope with some staggering financial 
problems they inherited from Knitz and Lord. The two former managers had been 
defended by some of the ousted former board members as financial wizards. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's operating budget is about $28 million a year, which is 
collected through water rates -- some of the highest in the county -- and 
through special property tax assessments on district residents. The district 
proposes to increase both this year. 
</P>
<P>
 William R. Mitchell, head of the Orange County chapter of Common Cause, a 
citizens' watchdog group, called the punishment "a slap on the wrist" and noted 
that several public officials had gone to jail for less serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Knitz betrayed the public trust and admitted to criminal activity," 
Mitchell said. "The fine doesn't come close to the money misused at the water 
district. This is completely inadequate and sends the wrong message to the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said it was commendable that Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi's office 
had criminally charged officials like Knitz and former Orange County Supervisor 
Don R. Roth, whose misdeeds were disclosed by The Times, but that his office 
was "engaging in a pattern of plea-bargaining that is disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly strongly disagreed, saying that Knitz's punishment fit the crime and 
that investigators found no evidence of more serious offenses. Capizzi was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want anyone to get the impression that we were lenient in any way," 
Kelly said. "Mr. Knitz has a criminal conviction on his record, is paying hefty 
restitution, and we have very strong terms and conditions of probation. We have 
ended his high life. This is not a slap on the wrist." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the investigation of Santa Margarita water officials, Kelly said, 
no evidence was uncovered that Knitz or Lord misappropriated public funds, 
although they had charged the district large sums for luxury hotel stays, 
four-figure room service tabs, golf outings and even $371 sheepskin seat covers 
for Lord's district-owned car. 
</P>
<P>
 Knitz declined to comment after Monday's hearing. In the past, he has 
maintained that he was entitled to everything he claimed on his expenses, 
because he was expanding a utility that would one day serve a population of 
180,000. The failure to disclose gifts from contractors and conflicts of 
interest were the result of poor legal advice, his attorney, Marshall M. 
Schulman, has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Knitz had been scheduled to enter his guilty plea earlier this month, until 
The Times raised questions about his involvement with a for-profit utility 
holding company that has offered to buy the Santa Margarita Water District. 
When Kelly learned from The Times that Knitz had been retained as a consultant 
by California-American Water Co. of Chula Vista, the hearing was postponed, and 
plea negotiations reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the final plea agreement, Knitz acknowledged having been "involved 
in the attempted acquisition, privatization, or restructuring" of the district 
by California-American, and agreed to refrain from such activities for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Knitz is also barred from having anything to do with any other water district 
for three years and cannot lobby any local, state or county agency or official 
for the next four years. He is prohibited, as well, from holding elective 
office during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly what Knitz will be required to do on his 200 hours of community 
service has yet to be determined, but Kelly said it would amount to "picking up 
trash for Caltrans . . . or feeding soup to the poor." The first 50 hours must 
be completed by early October and all 200 hours must be finished by next June. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney opened its case against Knitz and Lord in March, 1993, 
the day after The Times disclosed that the two men had taken $40,000 worth of 
meals, entertainment and gifts from engineering companies, developers, bankers 
and law firms while helping them obtain contracts for district work. As the two 
men filed amended state disclosure forms, the amount of gifts rose to $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Knitz announced his retirement from the general manager's $113,292-a-year job 
in May, 1993. The next day, Lord, 50, followed suit, leaving a job that had 
paid him $109,116 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Knitz case settled, and $10,000 in civil fines secured from former 
water board chairman Don B. Schone and chief engineer William B. Dye, 
prosecutors have only the case against Lord remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord's situation is more complicated because he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
in April, claiming assets of $375,646 and liabilities of $416,257. Prosecutors 
had hoped to make Lord pay a similar fine. Chapter 7 allows individuals to keep 
some personal property, including a home and automobile, but other assets must 
be sold off to pay at least part of the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 In his bankruptcy filing, Lord says he has been a self-employed contractor 
working out of his home in Vista since he retired from the district in May, 
1993. Among his debts he lists a $17,000 claim by Bein-Frost for engineering 
fees associated with improvements at his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord's pretrial hearing is set for Thursday in Municipal Court in South 
County.

DISPUTE DELAYS RENO AIR'S BID TO SERVE O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A deal to allow Reno Air to begin service this week from Orange County's John 
Wayne Airport fell apart Monday, leaving air travelers to wait even longer for 
a second low-cost airline and forcing ticket agents to scramble to re-book 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air officials said they worked through the weekend in an attempt to iron 
out a dispute between federal regulators and the airport in order to begin 
service as planned on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to resolve the differences, airport officials asked the Orange County 
Board of Supervisors to cancel its vote on the Reno Air deal today. Reno Air 
will now have to wait until at least Oct. 1 before it can fly out of John 
Wayne, said Reno Air's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the real harm was to the traveling public of Orange County who will 
not benefit from our high-quality, on-time service," said Robert M. Rowen, the 
airline's vice president and general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-cost, low-fare Reno Air was being viewed as an important addition to John 
Wayne Airport, which has had some of the highest airline ticket prices in 
Southern California because of severe noise restrictions that limit the number 
of jetliners allowed there. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air usually matches prices with rival Southwest -- the only discount 
carrier now at John Wayne with flights to Oakland and San Jose -- while keeping 
costs low and offering a few more amenities, such as assigned seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being placed on a waiting list for landing slots as other airlines 
have been required to do, Reno Air had arranged a deal to begin service 
immediately through its affiliation with American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, Reno Air would have taken over six daily flights that American 
Airlines now flies to San Jose. American, which says it can't fly the route 
profitably in competition with Southwest, wanted to turn over the route to Reno 
Air so that it could maintain passenger loyalty on its other routes. Though 
separately owned, American and Reno Air have the same frequent flier program 
and other cooperative marketing arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors and airport officials initially approved the 
landing slot trade on a restricted, temporary basis over the objections of some 
other airlines, including United and Delta. Reno Air announced that service 
would start June 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Before service could start, however, regulators raised concerns about the 
deal. A final vote was expected today with service beginning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, however, came to an abrupt halt last week when the federal 
Department of Transportation interceded. Regulators would not allow the airport 
to impose its special restrictions on Reno Air, such as only allowing use of 
the landing slots through Sept. 30, even if the airline agreed to them, Rowen 
said. Airport officials refused to let up on the conditions under which Reno 
Air would be allowed to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are surprised the Department of Transportation did not realize the value 
to the traveling public," Rowen said. "We are as surprised as anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air will now have to wait for airport officials to complete a study of 
their policy regarding affiliations between airlines, he said. The study is 
scheduled for completion Oct. 1 at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if there is any chance that Reno Air could start service soon, airport 
spokeswoman Courtney C. Wiercioch said that discussions are ongoing and that 
"frankly, I don't know what it would take." 
</P>
<P>
 American Airlines spokesman Al Becker said he was still awaiting official word 
about the decision on Reno Air, so he did not know whether American's service 
between John Wayne and San Jose would continue indefinitely. American has been 
matching Southwest's $69 one-way fare on the route and had planned to stop 
service when Reno Air took over. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel agents are being left to sort through the confusion. It had booked and 
re-booked passengers on Reno Air when the airlines set two earlier dates to 
begin service. 
</P>
<P>
 Thom Nulty, president of Associated Travel Management in Santa Ana, said his 
agents have been caught in a "yo-yo" between booking passengers on Reno Air and 
American during the past two weeks as Reno Air's start date was put off, and 
now is again being postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he said he will have to send a third memo to Associated's customers, 
letting them know of the latest change. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a loss for Orange County air travelers," Nulty said. "Given 
a choice between the thought of going Southwest (without) seat assignments, 
people would rather go on Reno Air." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas A. Jackson, president of World Travel in Santa Ana, said his agents 
preferred booking Reno Air because they can access its flights directly in 
their computers. Southwest forces agents to telephone for reservations, 
refusing to pay to join the major computer booking systems. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson said he understands, given the topsy-turvy world of the airline 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just an ongoing thing," he said, "the vagaries of business."

O.C. AGENCY TO ELIMINATE DIAL-A-RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with greater demands on its budget, the Orange County Transportation 
Authority decided Monday to phase out its popular Dial-a-Ride program, which 
provides same-day van service to all county seniors and people with 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In place of the program, the transportation agency will provide a similar but 
less comprehensive shuttle service called ACCESS. It requires users to call at 
least 48 hours in advance to schedule a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dial-a-Ride was something that we would have liked to have maintained, but 
the funds weren't there," said Irv Pickler, who sits on the agency's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The change is partly due to a mandate created by Congress in 1990. Under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, the county is required to provide bus 
service for people who are unable to use the standard bus system. Especially 
targeted by the ADA are the disabled, including seniors. Those who lost out in 
the OCTA decision are able-bodied seniors who may not qualify under the ADA 
guidelines as disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this is a good substitute program," said Melissa O'Neal, 
director of the Tustin Senior Center, adding that the eligibility requirements 
for ACCESS are more stringent than for the Dial-a-Ride Demand program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think too many people are going to fall through the cracks," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50% to 60% of the people who use Dial-a-Ride Demand will be eligible for 
the ACCESS program, agency officials said. To be eligible, a person must be 
unable to get on and off a big bus, get to and from a bus stop or understand 
how to make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to more than a dozen well-attended public hearings held throughout 
the county on the proposed changes in the busing program, Monday's board 
meeting was handled with little discussion among the board members. There also 
was no public testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past six months, many seniors and the disabled had asked county 
officials not to eliminate the 20-year-old Demand program, which annually 
provides some 300,000 trips for about 2,000 riders who use it to go 
door-to-door for shopping, medical visits and other errands. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate, group Dial-a-Ride program that makes 950,000 trips a year will not 
be cut. Both services use vans rather than buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Same-day Dial-a-Ride Demand service, which will be completely eliminated by 
the end of year, costs the county about $5 million annually to operate. The 
transportation agency voted to funnel that money to the ACCESS program, which 
was created last fall at a cost of $4.5 million a year. When the program is 
operational in 1997, it will have a budget of $10 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler, who used the Demand service after suffering broken legs in a recent 
traffic accident, said he sympathizes with the concerns of seniors and the 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out how valuable a service it was," said Pickler, "The service was 
great when we had the money, but now we have no alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were not mollified. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be really tough on the those that don't qualify," said Peggy 
Weatherspoon, director of the Area Agency on Aging. "That continues to be a big 
concern. What alternative can we go to? Where can we find funding? Those 
questions are still unanswered." Transportation agency officials defended the 
choice made by the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think ACCESS is going to be a great program," said Ellen Harvey, manager of 
community transportation services for the agency. "By law we have to provide 
service to everyone" who is eligible under the ADA. 
</P>
<P>
 She said seniors who do not qualify for ACCESS should call the agency to see 
if they can make arrangements for the group Dial-a-Ride or standard bus 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the phasing out of Demand service, only ADA-eligible riders may use the 
same-day service after Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare for ACCESS is $1.50 per trip in Orange County, compared to 90 cents 
per five-mile zone for Dial-a-Ride Demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey said the agency held 15 public hearings from February to April on 
eliminating Dial-a-Ride Demand and to get feedback on how county officials 
could smooth the transition to ACCESS. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the bigger concerns among Dial-a-Ride users is the loss of same-day 
service. Under ACCESS, a rider must call 2 to 14 days in advance to set up a 
ride. In the near future, it will be just a day in advance, Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with that issue, agency officials decided to establish a new 
neighborhood shuttle service, which will have fixed routes and stop at places 
seniors frequently visit. The program will start this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency will spend $300,000 to operate six to nine of the shuttles. Cities 
that want to participate in the program will be asked to fund about half of the 
operational costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Dotson, a councilman for Stanton and member of the county's senior 
citizen advisory council, said he is disappointed that Dial-a-Ride Demand is 
being cut but pleased with the agency's efforts to address the same-day service 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might take a little while to get it working, but it's certainly a step in 
the right direction," Dotson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent public hearings also sparked other action to accommodate the 
elderly and disabled, including adding sensitivity training sessions for bus 
drivers, equipping standard-size buses with lower floors and making bus stops 
more accessible with curb cuts. Dial-a-Ride at Road's End 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's popular Dial-a-Ride Demand program, which has provided 
same-day transportation service to disabled people and senior citizens for two 
decades, is being axed by transit officials because of costs. It is being 
replaced by a less comprehensive program called ACCESS, which will serve only 
about half the people eligible for Demand and will require at least 48 hours' 
advance notice for pickup. Since ACCESS was inaugurated last fall, ridership 
has more than doubled, officials say. ACCESS use is shown below. Trips booked

ANTONOVICH IS JOCKEYING FOR MTA POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN and HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich is trying to gain control of the 
county's most powerful transit agency by muscling aside another San Fernando 
Valley supervisor who was in line for the post. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever becomes chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- 
Antonovich or Supervisor Ed Edelman -- will be in a position to steer lucrative 
contracts toward political allies and control the agency's agenda for the next 
year, including debate over the design and route of a proposed east-west rail 
line in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The normal rotation procedure between city and county governments calls for 
Edelman to automatically succeed Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre 
as head of the 14-month-old transportation agency Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Alatorre's backing, Antonovich is attempting to put the matter to a 
vote by the 13-member MTA board Wednesday, Antonovich's office said Monday. It 
was unclear Monday whether Antonovich could muster the seven votes he needs to 
be elected chairman because several key MTA board members, including Los 
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, said they had not yet made up their minds how to 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 An Antonovich spokesman said Monday that Edelman would make an ineffective 
leader because he is retiring Dec. 5, only five months into the chairman's 
12-month term. Edelman has also already given notice that he would miss several 
MTA meetings in September, said Habib Balian, Antonovich's transportation 
deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be the chair in absentia," Balian said. "Let's just give him a gold 
watch instead of the chairmanship." 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, who was vacationing in Europe, could not be reached for comment 
Monday. But a spokesman said the supervisor would make the MTA a priority 
during his tenure as chairman, not give it short shrift as Antonovich's staff 
has suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be inappropriate and unnecessary to change the rules at this time," 
Edelman spokesman Joel Bellman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellman added that the MTA voted unanimously in April to choose a county 
supervisor instead of a city appointee to replace Edelman when he retires. 
</P>
<P>
 Several MTA sources said Zev Yaroslavsky, the longtime Los Angeles city 
councilman elected June 8 to replace Edelman on the county Board of 
Supervisors, would be the most likely to assume the MTA post if Edelman became 
chairman first and then left the job in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky is now an alternate member of the MTA board of directors, 
representing the city, and attends many of its meetings. That gives him grounds 
to argue in December that he should replace Edelman because of his valuable 
experience on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Antonovich is doing is a crass, political power play -- a coup d'etat -- 
that I hope will fail," Yaroslavsky said. "Ed is capable to serve and I'm 
capable to take his place." 
</P>
<P>
 Several MTA board members said Antonovich covets the post primarily because it 
will give him the clout he needs on key issues, including alignment of the 
Valley's east-west rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a power play for the east-west line," said an MTA source, who asked not 
to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman and Yaroslavsky have been staunch advocates of a plan to build a 
mostly below-ground rail line that would begin at the Metro Rail terminus in 
North Hollywood and parallel Burbank and Chandler boulevards for 14 miles to 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Antonovich has been pressing a rival proposal for a 16-mile 
elevated rail line along the center of the Ventura Freeway -- possibly a 
monorail -- from Universal City to Woodland Hills. He has argued vehemently 
that such a line would be cheaper and quicker to build, and has made it one of 
his key political themes. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials have studied both options and concluded that they are 
both feasible. Final cost estimates are expected in August, followed by a 
decision later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever wins the battle over the chairmanship will be able to control the 
amount of time each side can take when the final debate on the east-west line 
comes to the MTA. The chairman also controls the agenda, deciding when to bring 
an issue to a vote quickly or delay it. 
</P>
<P>
 Another advantage is the chairman's influence over valuable contracts, 
allowing him to sometimes guide them to firms that have contributed to the 
chairman's political campaigns, MTA sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre, whose chairmanship of the MTA ends Friday, declined to comment on 
who he will vote for to replace him, saying only that "the process is being 
worked on," according to his spokeswoman, Liz Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan, who sits on the MTA and has appointed three other members, said 
through a spokeswoman that he needs to talk to other members of the board, 
including Antonovich and Edelman, before he decides how to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "He needs to confer with other members to see what the actual issues are," 
Riordan spokeswoman Noelia Rodriquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Councilman Larry Zarian, another MTA member, said he was put off by 
Antonovich's effort to become chairman, but still has not decided how he will 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, I haven't heard from Antonovich," Zarian said. "I need to 
listen to the arguments."

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: IWERKS EXPECTS TO REPORT LOSS IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Iwerks Entertainment Inc., a Burbank supplier of special-format movie theaters 
and virtual-reality attractions, said it expects to report a loss for its 
fiscal fourth quarter ending Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The company previously said it anticipated breaking even or making a small 
profit for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Iwerks attributed the expected loss to development of its Cinetropolis 
complexes, which will combine large-screen and motion-simulation theaters under 
one roof with virtual-reality rides, restaurants and shops. It also cited 
higher costs of installing a new giant-screen theater system and its 
virtual-reality product. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Iwerks said it sold three big-screen theaters worth a total of 
$2.7 million. The buyers are the Arizona Museum of Science & Technology in 
Phoenix, the Chicago Navy Pier and the Orlando Science Center.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: ADDED NEUPOGEN USE WITH MARROW TRANSPLANTS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amgen Inc., a Thousand Oaks biotechnology concern, said its big-selling drug 
Neupogen has been cleared by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for 
additional use with bone-marrow transplant patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Many chemotherapy drugs kill healthy cells in patients' bone marrow, 
increasing the risk of serious infection. Bone-marrow transplants enable 
patients to receive higher doses of chemotherapy, if needed, while Neupogen can 
speed the body's production of infection-fighting white blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Neupogen has been widely used for several years to help combat a variety of 
infections. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 8,000 to 10,000 bone-marrow transplants in the United States each 
year.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: CALNETICS PAYS $4.4 MILLION FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calnetics Corp., the Chatsworth manufacturer of molded plastic components for 
industrial uses, said last week that it had acquired all of the stock of 
Ontario-based Agricultural Products Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Calnetics paid about $4.4 million in cash and notes for Agricultural Products, 
formerly a privately held company that manufactures plastic water-handling 
products, including tubing, filters and drip-system accessories. The company 
has plants in Ontario and Winter Haven, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Lon Schultz, founder of Agricultural Products, has agreed to continue serving 
as president and director of the company, Calnetics said. Calnetics had total 
sales of $16.6 million for its latest fiscal year. Agricultural Products had 
sales of about $10 million in 1993.

FORECAST: CLOUDY JOB HORIZON; STUDY SAYS VENTURA COUNTY CAN EXPECT FAINT 
RECOVERY BY END OF DECADE, BUT LARGELY IN SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The statewide economic recovery is sputtering in Ventura County, where 
high-paying manufacturing jobs continue to dwindle, and the forecast for job 
growth this decade is modest at best, according to a recent study by the UC 
Santa Barbara Economic Forecast Project. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a net loss of 6,600 jobs in Ventura County since 1990, 
according to the report, assembled by a team of researchers and graduate 
students at the university. The study's most optimistic forecast predicts the 
number of jobs in the county may return to pre-recession levels by 1997, with 
new jobs emerging in the business services and health care industries. 
</P>
<P>
 But more restrained projections indicate employment growth will be meager, 
with the total number of jobs in Ventura County at the end of the decade 
approaching 256,000, about 9,000 more than in 1990. That pace would represent a 
significant departure from the booming job growth of the last decade, when 
40,000 jobs were created in the county between 1986 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the (economic) decline is probably behind us," said Mark Schniepp, 
director of the Forecast Project. But the recovery through the remainder of the 
decade in Ventura County is bound to be faint, "almost to the point that you 
don't even notice it's occurring," Schniepp said. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of the recovery to gain traction in the county is largely due to 
the collapse of the durable manufacturing sector, which traditionally has 
accounted for more than one-fifth of the county's high-income jobs, Schniepp 
said. Durable-goods manufacturers in Ventura County include computer and 
software makers, as well as aerospace sub-contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 durable-goods manufacturing jobs have vanished in the county since 
1990, when employment in the industry peaked at almost 25,000, the report said. 
The trend may continue, Schniepp wrote, "as firms defect to other states where 
less regulation exists and more tax, housing and infrastructure benefits are 
frequently offered." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the county must nurse painful economic wounds inflicted by the 
departure of firms such as Abex Aerospace, which employed about 1,000 workers 
at its Oxnard plant in the late 1980s. Workers there manufactured hydraulic 
pumps used to power airplane flight controls and landing gear. But the 
contraction of the aerospace industry caught up with the company, based in 
Kalamazoo, Mich., and the 33-year-old Oxnard plant was closed in December. 
About 50 employees were retained at other sites, a company official said, and 
all that remains in Ventura County is a 14-person sales office in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of such layoffs, many formerly highly paid residents have departed for 
economically healthier climates in states such as Colorado and Nevada. For the 
first time since 1948, more people moved out of Ventura County in 1993 than 
into the county, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such demographic shifts have contributed to the decline of per capita income 
in Ventura County, which adjusted for inflation, fell from $22,830 in 1990 to 
$21,119 in 1993, the report said. Retail sales have also suffered, and the 
deposit base among local banks and S&Ls has contracted 8% in the two-year 
period ending June 30, 1993, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Property damage in Ventura County from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake 
totaled $850 million, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Repair work, funded in part by insurance coverage or various federal and state 
aid packages, is expected to provide a short-term economic stimulus, but 
rebuilding with borrowed monies will reduce future spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "The net long-term effect of the earthquake is very likely to be negative," 
Schniepp wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the gloomy prospects, Schniepp identified several signs of life in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing market is experiencing "boom-like conditions," with home sales in 
the first quarter up 54% compared to the first three months of 1993, as home 
shoppers who formerly put off purchases have rushed to beat rising interest 
rates, Schniepp wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, home sales also rose 33% over the same month last year, according to 
Dataquick Information Systems. But the trend is not expected to continue unless 
job growth quickens, Schniepp said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report forecasts long-term job growth in the health care industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the massive boomer generation ages and transitions toward retirement, the 
demand for health care services will rise, and probably dramatically," Schniepp 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 A shining example of the potential Schniepp describes is Ventura-based 
Meditech Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was started in 1987 as a temporary nursing service, providing 
trained employees to understaffed area hospitals, said owner and president 
Sharon Bick. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has since expanded to provide home health care service, and its 
roster of temporary employees swelled from 200 at the end of 1987 to 400 this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bick said she expects 20% business growth in 1994 and total revenues of about 
$4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all medical firms are growing. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 positions were eliminated when Oxnard-based St. John's Regional 
Medical Center merged with Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo in February, 
1993, spokeswoman Rita Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no plans for further cutbacks," Schumacher said. "But there won't be 
a move toward hiring a lot of employees over the next couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
 Business services, ranging from office security to data processing, are also 
likely to lead any job expansion in the county, the report said, as larger 
companies continue to replace permanent employees, and sometimes whole 
departments, by contracting with outside firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The UC Santa Barbara study is based on a model and assumptions used by the 
widely watched UCLA Business Forecasting Project.

GOLDEN SYSTEMS' PERPETUAL PRICE WAR; TECHNOLOGY: LOW-COST INDIAN LABOR IS KEY 
TO THE POWER SUPPLY FIRM'S SUCCESS. BUT COMPETITION REMAINS A THREAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Computer parts manufacturer Golden Systems Inc. has almost everything a young 
company could want -- a price advantage, growing demand and cash to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything, that is, except a unique product. What Golden Systems makes are 
power supplies -- the small boxes that regulate the electric current for 
personal and portable computers. The devices are relatively simple to make, and 
so price -- not technical prowess -- is all that matters in Golden Systems' 
marketplace. To keep growing, the 3-year-old company must make its inexpensive 
products even less so, and best a host of competitors trying to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not easy. Even a giant like General Electric abandoned the market, partly 
because of difficulties in getting an edge on the competition, according to 
Mohan Mankikar, president of Santa Rosa-based Micro-Tech Consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden Systems competes against much larger firms, including several Taiwanese 
companies and Hong Kong-based Astec (BSR), which has yearly sales of more than 
$300 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Golden Systems may have a family advantage in its quest to keep costs 
down. Golden Systems' president and chief executive officer is Jay Tandon, 43. 
Tandon is a member of a family from India, where Golden Systems does all its 
manufacturing, availing itself of some of the lowest-cost technically skilled 
labor in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Tandon is also the younger brother of Jugi Tandon, who built Tandon Corp. 
into a highly successful PC maker in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden Systems owes its start back in 1991 to its role as supplier to Tandon 
Corp. It swiftly grew into larger markets, though. Sales increased 38% to $29.4 
million in the past fiscal year ended March 31, up from $21.3 million a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent sales figures have not been as high as expected, but the company's 
future still looks bright, said James Reynolds, analyst for Los Angeles-based 
Wedbush Morgan Securities, lead underwriter of Golden Systems' public stock 
offering last November. 
</P>
<P>
 But others aren't so sure. "If Golden Systems can do it, 50 other companies 
can do the same thing," said consultant Mankikar, referring to the market the 
company competes in. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Tandon's use of cheap Indian labor is critical to the firm's ability 
to keep costs a notch below those of its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Like its Third World peers, India longs for foreign currency. But unlike most, 
it boasts one of the best-educated pools of technical workers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers in India are "a dime a dozen, they are galore all over the place," 
said Vasisht Malhotra, a professor of international relations at the University 
of Southern California and a specialist in India. In Indian culture, "the most 
revered professions are medicine and engineering," added Mankikar, himself an 
engineer from Bombay. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Indian engineers hired by Golden Systems earn about $150 per month, 
while Golden Systems' high school-educated manual laborers, the vast majority 
of whom are women, earn about 40 cents an hour, Thomas said. According to 
Reynolds, manual laborers in Taiwan can earn several times as much. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 India's desperate unemployment can lead to exploitation of workers by foreign 
manufacturers. But Mankikar, who has visited Golden Systems' plant in Bombay, 
said many of the Indians who work there are firmly ensconced in the ranks of a 
privileged middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 Their salaries, large by the standards of the country, help feed a growing 
appetite for consumer products there. And India's government is now pursuing an 
aggressive policy of opening the nation to increased foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this, manufacturing products for export in India is not easy. That's 
where Jay Tandon's roots come in. As a member of the Tandon family, whose 
success both in the U. S. and India has made it well-known, Jay Tandon is 
likely to have an easier time negotiating India's labyrinthine bureaucracy than 
the average non-Indian investor, said Mankikar. 
</P>
<P>
 But India-based production alone won't guarantee Golden Systems success.  
</P>
<P>
 To keep besting its competition, Golden Systems must increase its production, 
Thomas said. In addition to its plant in Bombay, Golden is scrambling to open 
two new plants, one in Madras and the other in Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
 The company produced 275,000 power supplies in the third quarter of the 1994 
fiscal year, and hopes to produce 950,000 units in the last quarter of 1995, 
said Ian Gilson, an industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts find fault with Golden Systems' heavy reliance on a few big 
customers, including Compaq Computer Corp. and IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gilson said that in recent months, Golden Systems has actually turned away 
business from some of its largest customers in an attempt to curb its 
dependence and find other buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the company is seeking to break into other power supply markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm is discussing possible deals with AT&T and Hewlett-Packard Co. to 
produce power supplies for everything from cable television to telephone 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in those markets Golden Systems is likely to face stiff competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Power supply is a strange business," Mankikar said. "Entry into the 
marketplace is very easy. But growth is very difficult."

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: PASQUINI RESIGNS AS HEAD OF FORTUNE PETROLEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan E. Pasquini has resigned as president and chief executive officer of 
Fortune Petroleum Corp., an Agoura Hills-based oil and gas exploration company, 
following a disagreement with the board of directors over the proposed sale of 
the company's California properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Charles Champion, 62, has assumed the additional title of chief 
executive officer.Tyrone J. Fairbanks, 37, has been named Fortune's president 
and also remains chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortune said in May that it was considering selling its California properties, 
which generated about 23% of the oil and gas produced by the company, mostly 
through the production of crude oil. During the past several years, the company 
has been shifting from California-based crude oil production to natural gas 
exploration and production in other states, particularly Texas. Now, Fairbanks 
said, a majority of the board favors divesting the company of its California 
holdings so it can reinvest the proceeds in its more profitable ventures in 
other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasquini, 51, a geologist by training, said he disagrees with the board. While 
acknowledging that the company's California oil wells offer lower returns than 
projects elsewhere, he contends that many offer a stable, long-term source of 
revenue and are worth keeping. 
</P>
<P>

REGIONAL EARNINGS: IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT REPORTS 4TH-QUARTER PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Image Entertainment Inc., the Chatsworth distributor of movies on laser discs, 
reported net income of $648,000 for the fiscal fourth quarter that ended March 
31, compared with a loss of $13.8 million for the same period the previous 
year. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $12 million, down 30% from $17.1 
million in the same period the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fiscal year, the company reported net income of $3.4 million compared 
with a net loss of $17 million in fiscal 1993. Revenues for the year were $66.2 
million, up 10% from $60.4 million the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said fourth-quarter sales decreased because it was unable to 
remove inventory from its damaged warehouse following the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake. It attributed the fourth-quarter profit to cost-cutting measures 
begun in March, 1993. Since last year, 17% of the company's work force, 
including three senior executives, have been laid off.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: PERFECTDATA REPORTS NET LOSS OF $402,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PerfectData Corp. of Simi Valley, which designs and markets cleaning ware for 
office equipment, reported a net loss of $402,000 for the year that ended March 
31, after posting net income of $514,000 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The downward turn was attributed to an $803,000 loss in discontinued product 
lines, including modems, cables and switch boxes for computers and printers. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has jettisoned such lines to focus on its core business of 
cleaning supplies and ergonomic office products such as footrests and 
copyholders, said Irene J. Marino, chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The company reported revenues of $6.7 million for fiscal 1994, down 13% from 
the previous year's revenues of $7.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has been in turmoil since Lee Mannheimer, the firm's longtime 
chief executive officer, resigned in the fall amid an investigation into his 
possible role in an alleged murder-for-hire plot against his estranged wife. 
Joseph Mazin, the company's controlling shareholder, took over as CEO in 
November.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: RIGHT START'S NET INCOME DOWN 8% IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Right Start Inc., a Westlake Village-based mail-order seller of products 
and apparel for infants and children, reported net income of $362,000 for its 
fiscal fourth quarter that ended May 25, down 8% from earnings of $392,000 for 
the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-quarter revenue totaled $15.4 million, which represents a 10% rise over 
the $14 million in revenue reported in the same quarter in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Net income for fiscal 1994 was $176,000, 82% below earnings of $1.03 million 
the previous year, the company reported. Earnings tumbled although revenue rose 
to $55.9 for fiscal year 1994, up from $42.3 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Targon, chief executive officer, said earnings were hurt by poor 
response to a greater number of catalogues mailed and a $470,000 second-quarter 
charge associated with the discontinuation of the company's Weebok catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Right Start has five retail locations in California and Georgia; retail 
sales account for about 6% of company revenue.

HUGHES ADDS TO INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY GLUT; . . . BUT MARKET'S NEW BURDEN MAY SELL 
QUICKLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One unsettling side effect of the wrenching cutbacks in the manufacturing, 
aerospace and defense industries has been the dumping of large commercial and 
industrial properties on an already depressed real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few years, the huge Van Nuys General Motors auto assembly plant, 
Stroh Brewery in Van Nuys, 380 acres in Burbank owned by Lockheed Corp., two 
Redken Laboratories buildings in Canoga Park and bankrupt weapons maker 
Marquardt Manufacturing's Van Nuys headquarters have all come on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the latest in this string of abandoned giant-sized properties is Hughes 
Aircraft Co.'s missile systems division, currently in the last stages of 
closing its 35-year-old West Hills complex. The once-bustling facility is where 
Hughes designed various missile systems, including the TOW missile -- most 
memorable for demolishing Iraqi tanks during the Persian Gulf War. Now the 
85-acre, 13-building office and industrial center is becoming a ghost town as 
Hughes relocates its engineering group to Tucson, where the missiles are 
manufactured. The remaining 1,000 workers will be gone by August and the 
property will be put up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are early indications that the Hughes site won't turn into just 
another white elephant. Many observers believe that Hughes might find a buyer 
for the property far more quickly than others -- including Hughes' parent 
company, General Motors, which was trying to sell the Van Nuys auto plant even 
before it closed two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, an aide to Councilman Hal Bernson said that a "major company" is 
already negotiating to buy the Hughes site. Greg Smith, Bernson's chief deputy, 
would not identify the prospective buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes spokesman Rand Christensen declined to comment on a possible deal. 
"When a sale is finalized, we'll announce that," he said. Sell It Off in 
Pieces? 
</P>
<P>
 The company's real estate department is "in the final stages of evaluating the 
site and firming up their strategy" to market the property, and expects to list 
it for sale later this year, Christensen said. "We'll talk to any interested 
parties before we list it formally." 
</P>
<P>
 The market value of the Hughes property is probably about $10 per square foot, 
or $37 million, said Bill Pentz, vice president at Daum Commercial & Industrial 
Real Estate in Woodland Hills. That's a little more than half the property's 
1993 assessed value of $69 million, but Pentz said the lower figure represents 
what the land is worth without the buildings -- and is probably closer to what 
a buyer would be willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the price is right," Pentz said, "they can get it sold in six months." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hughes property is generating interest from an eclectic group of potential 
buyers. Pat Hall, president of TOLD Partners Inc., a real estate broker in 
Woodland Hills, said that his firm is "having discussions" with an unidentified 
private school that might want to use a portion of the Hughes site. Unlike the 
GM facility, which is dominated by the 71,000-square-foot plant, the 
multi-building Hughes site could be easily divided into "pieces" that could be 
sold or redeveloped separately, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another organization is considering the Hughes property and other large sites 
in the Valley -- including the GM plant -- for the design and manufacture of 
planes, electric vehicles and rail cars. The San Jose-based Manufacturing 
Technology Initiative, a nonprofit consortium, has been helping companies form 
joint ventures that it hopes to locate at the chosen site. One venture, led by 
Anaheim electric-car maker Taylor-Dunn Manufacturing Co., is seeking 500,000 
square feet of industrial space in the Valley to build electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision on where to locate will be "based upon dollars," said coalition 
President Gloria Rose Ott. 
</P>
<P>
 Many real estate specialists say the Hughes site has many advantages over the 
still-empty GM plant that could make it more attractive to a potential buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hughes property, although zoned for heavy industrial use, is a hilltop, 
campus-style office and industrial complex that is surrounded by upscale homes. 
The facility could appeal to health-care, high-tech, telecommunications or 
insurance companies, real estate brokers say. Although some possible buyers 
might be deterred by the site's isolation from other commercial development, 
others might consider that a plus. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a better location than GM and it's in better condition," said Seth 
Dudley, senior vice president at commercial real estate brokerage Julien J. 
Studley Inc. in Los Angeles. Stumbling Blocks 
</P>
<P>
 Any sale could be complicated by certain factors, however. 
</P>
<P>
 If significant environmental contamination is discovered, Hughes would 
probably have to mount a major cleanup program as a condition of a sale, which 
can be expensive and time consuming. Lockheed has spent $55 million so far 
cleaning up toxic substances at its Burbank properties and expects the total 
remediation effort to cost $175 million over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
 So far that doesn't seem to be a problem for Hughes. The Hughes property was 
inspected within the past month and no soil contamination was found, said 
Richard Varenchik, spokesman for the state Environmental Protection Agency's 
Department of Toxic Substances Control. There is contaminated ground water at 
the site from underground storage tanks that leaked gasoline and diesel fuel, 
said Elijah Hill, an engineer at the state Water Quality Control Board. But the 
tanks have been removed and the contamination is "pretty limited, something on 
the order of size of a gasoline service station," Hill said. An ongoing cleanup 
is being done on the property, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes' spokesman Christensen said there is a plant at the facility to treat 
the ground water. "Nothing would prohibit us from selling the property," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, one of the Hughes buildings was yellow-tagged for limited use after the 
January earthquake. Christensen said the building was not repaired because of 
the move to Tucson, but he does not expect it to hinder the sale of the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 A bigger concern is California's still-laggard economy and the state's 
anti-business reputation, said Mike Howard, senior vice president at commercial 
and industrial real estate broker Grubb & Ellis in Sherman Oaks. "Unless 
there's some community incentive . . . I don't know if in the near-term we're 
going to attract someone to the site," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luring out-of-state businesses to the Hughes site would be difficult, even 
though many Eastern firms have been seeking manufacturing, distribution and 
back-office locations in the West to avoid weather-related shipping delays, 
said James Schriner, a partner at PHH Fantus, a New York consulting firm that 
advises manufacturers on selecting sites. Those companies have confined their 
searches to states such as New Mexico and Arizona, which are perceived to be 
business-friendly. "California costs are still too scary," Schriner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even local companies that real estate agents cite as likely to need more space 
for expansion aren't good prospects. Fast-growing Blue Cross of California in 
Woodland Hills, for instance, said it has no expansion plans. Woodland Hills 
insurer 20th Century Industries, which had been courted by every major 
developer in the West Valley, has put its headquarters move on hold while it 
tries to recover from the devastating impact of earthquake damage claims on its 
financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
 And Cal State Northridge, which four years ago considered using part of the 
Hughes facility has "no need or interest in it" now, said CSUN spokesman Bruce 
Erickson. In 1990, the school's enrollment reached 31,000 and was expected to 
grow further. Then the recession hit, along with fee increases. Enrollment is 
now down to about 26,000, the school is still recovering from severe earthquake 
damage and expansion plans are "dead and cold," Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Converting the property to a residential development is also considered 
unlikely because it would be difficult for a developer to raise the financing 
for such a project in today's sluggish housing market. 
</P>
<P>
 Many local officials, including Mayor Richard Riordan, Councilman Bernson, 
Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City) and Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), 
have promised to join efforts to lure buyers to the large abandoned Valley 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
 But community efforts to help sell big properties such as the GM plant so far 
have been fragmented and largely unsuccessful. That's one reason the Valley 
Economic Development Center, the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. and local 
chambers of commerce are constructing a business plan for the Valley to help 
attract and retain businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 One idea being studied is to allow sellers of large properties to donate their 
empty facilities to a nonprofit agency and receive substantial tax write-offs, 
said VEDC President John Rooney. The agency would then offer the properties for 
sale at prices well below their market values. 
</P>
<P>
 What's needed, Rooney said, is "a thought-out effort to help market these 
sites more effectively."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: G & H RATED IN TOP 50 AEROSPACE ELECTRONICS SUPPLIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A little-known Camarillo G & H Technology Inc., has been ranked by a trade 
publication among the nation's top 50 aerospace electronics suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 G & H, which has 300 employees at its plant adjoining Camarillo Airport, was 
ranked 34th by Military & Aerospace Electronics magazine in a group headed by 
such giants as AlliedSignal Aerospace, Texas Instruments, Unisys, Teledyne, 
Hewlett-Packard and Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
 G & H derives $25 million of its $40 million in annual sales from aerospace 
electronics, turning out connectors, cable assemblies, shielding and drive 
shafts for defense and commercial space satellites and such U. S. fighter 
planes as the F-22 and F/A-18. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, the Camarillo company's relatively modest defense business 
wouldn't place it so high on a list studded with multibillion-dollar names. But 
the magazine limited its top 50 mostly to subcontractors, ruling out Hughes 
Electronics, Litton Industries, Martin Marietta, Raytheon and Rockwell 
International, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're honored to be recognized anyway," G & H spokesman Tom Moran said. 
"We're doing some exciting things, and we expect our business to grow along 
with electronics in general." 
</P>
<P>
 Among projects the firm is working on, Moran listed Space Station Alpha, the 
Orbcomm communications constellation and a new helmet-mounted display system 
for aircraft pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in Santa Monica in 1946, G & H established a branch plant in Camarillo 
in the mid-1980s. At the time, the firm was a subsidiary of Cincinnati-based 
Penn Central Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 A group headed by Thomas C. Cleary, G & H's current chairman and chief 
executive, purchased the unit and took it private in December, 1992. Last year, 
the Santa Monica plant was closed and its work absorbed into the Camarillo 
facility.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: STAKES RISING FOR H & H TAKEOVER BY WEATHERFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The stock market is raising the stakes on the pending acquisition of Santa 
Paula's H & H Oil Tool Co. by Houston-based Weatherford International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 When the takeover was first announced in late April, it was estimated that H & 
H shareholders would receive Weatherford stock valued at $28 million.Lately, 
however, the 2.6 million Weatherford shares to be paid have been moving upward. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock, which traded at slightly more than $10 on the American Stock 
Exchange in late April, was quoted in the mid-$11 range early last week, 
raising the merger's paper value to about $31 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the week, however, after the two companies announced a definitive 
agreement, Weatherford jumped to the $14-per-share range, bringing the 
projected price to $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
 H & H, whose shares traded at less than $4 on NASDAQ when the merger was first 
announced, sold in the $10 range last week. H & H, like Weatherford, rents 
equipment to the oil and gas industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oil stocks in general have been strong lately because the price of oil has 
been going up," noted Bob Foote, H & H's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the final value of the acquisition, Foote says that will be decided by 
the stock market. "The final figure won't be known until early September, when 
the merger is scheduled to be completed. Until then, I imagine the two stocks 
will move in tandem."

 Ventura County's jobless rate in May fell to 6.4%, down from 7.4% in 
April.About 3,300 jobs were created in the county last month, according to the 
state Employment Development Department.

 The May unemployment rate was the lowest since 1991, but the agency said 
year-to-year comparisons are difficult because its calculating method has 
changed.
